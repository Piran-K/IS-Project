Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,jillg232,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Business,Watch out for rip unpleasant ‚Äúguides‚Äù,"This was a last stop after a busy week on a business trip. So we popped in but straight away a ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù man advised us to put our shoes in a safe area to be paid for to keep them safe.  He then followed us and insisted on telling us things about the Temple.  He correctly named which hotel we were staying in ( I suspect he had seen our driver!) but I was by the end a bit concerned. He was acting as if he was a staff member but it was obvious he was not.  He then wanted money for blessings and our family names.  Realistically I could see that this money was really for him, which I didn‚Äôt mind.  So I gave him some cash.  He supposedly went into the temple to hand over the cash. I just can‚Äôt see that he did but I didn‚Äôt expect him to. But then he carried on and insisted on more money at the end. When I refused he became angry and abusive.  It was pretty unpleasant.  Sad to say it‚Äôs a beautiful place but just don‚Äôt engage with anyone."

Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,Krishnan R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan-23,A place you must visit before you leave Chennai,"Every trip we take to Chennai, we always visit this temple. Very beautiful from the inside and out. Architecture is very historical. Lots of space and shrines and even in the inside-most shrine for Lord Shiva, they even implemented an A/C, something many temples in Kerala are lacking. Plus, no strict rules like Kerala has on taking your shirt off in certain parts or putting anything in a cloak room. Only one little pet peeve is that there are stray cats & dogs around the place. Overall, a must visit if you come to Chennai. Don't leave Chennai without doing this."

There were three wedding parties when we were there, all with huge accompanying families. The biggest had set up a ‚Äúphotograph the Bride and Groom‚Äù session with an array of professional lamps and defusers - inviting everyone to join the party. There was also the serious bit of walking clockwise to pray at the numerous shrines. So many beautiful saris! The temple decoration with a seemingly infinite display of Hindu deities is wonderful. Leave your shoes outside, apparently there is a shoe store but we didn‚Äôt notice and simply left them at the gate with all the others. On leaving all the shoes were gone, but someone pointed to a large heap of shoes piled on the other side of the road, ours were deep within that pile. Photography is allowed inside the compound but not directly into the shrines themselves. You are not allowed to wear a hat inside."

Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,GRAM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-19,Beware of Scammers,"I am Hindu from the USA. I was looking forward to going to this temple for darshan while in Chennai. As I walked in, I was approached by a ""guide"" who works for the temple; he has a noticeable scar under one of his eyes. He claims that he is is a ""student"" and works at the temple giving tours. Initially, he seemed legitimate. But then, he took us to the kitchen and asked for 3,000 rupees to feed devotees for one sitting. It was almost as if he was bargaining, with no guarantee of where the money would actually go. Disappointingly, the same guide informed me that I was not allowed to go into the actual temple because I did not speak Hindi (despite being Hindu). However, he did request a donation to take into the temple and make on my behalf. After a quick tour, he requested 20 USD (at minimum) for his services and would not budge otherwise. After spending a total of over 60 USD, I was not able to partake in darshan, as I hoped. I am presuming all of the money I ""donated"" went directly into this man's pocket. Beware; these practices have no place in a house of worship. Utterly disgusting."

Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,Marco B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-19,Nice but pollution in Chennai....,"I visited Kapaleeshwarar temple several time before, my last visit was in November 2019. I always enjoy going there, sit in the shade of one of the temple and watch the world go bye. Nice place to meditate and relax. Unfortunately this time around pollution in Chennai was so bad that after just 30minutes I had to go back to my hotel room. I think on November 5-6-7-8 they had the worse pollution ever recoded in Chennai. Thanks God I had with me protective air pollution mask but I felt awkward to wear it inside the temple. Please don't go to India without a air filtering mask, the best I found and that it is made with natural fabric is the metamasks.com Be safe, enjoy India, great country but challenging if not properly equipped."

There was no sign or so. I need him as guide to be allowed inside. In the inside he came with a story that I have to give money to the poor. He wanted 500! rupies. I gave 200 in the end after long discussions and he did go with this money inside the temple building. I do not have a good feeling, may have landed in his pocket. Also the guide fee. He did not let me go until I pay 20!‚Ç¨because others do pay the same. We arranged something else in the beginning. He did not let me go, even wanted to scam me more with the currency exchange rate. This was my fault as well, but I have this was the worst experience here so far. + he wanted to arrange a tuctuc and a good place to lunch. He still tried These Things, even if we were quite discussing about the Rest...I think you are allowed to go inside the area, just not in the actual temple building. But there will be a sign!"

Marina_Beach,Wandering Tales Travel Dreams,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr-22,A nice place to experience Chennai beaches,"Surprisingly, it is one of the cleaner beaches in Chennai.  There is a lot of patrolling that happens by police on horses and by foot... mainly to discourage swimming as the waters are not very safe.  A nice beach to get your fill of the sea side and walking in the  sand if you normally live in a place nowhere close to beaches.  Sunset time is the best time to visit."
Marina_Beach,Mudit Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family,Visit,"Marina Beach is a primarily sandy beach, with an average width of 300 m (980 ft) and the width at the widest stretch is 437 m (1,434 ft). Bathing and swimming at the Marina are legally prohibited because of the dangers, as the undercurrent is very turbulent. It is one of the most crowded beaches in the country.The beach promenade in 1913Before the 16th century, there were frequent incident of inundation of land near the coast due to rise in sea level. When the sea withdrew, several ridges and lagoons were left behind. On the southern side of Fort St. George, one such sand ridge ran from the mouth of the Cooum River to the present site of the Presidency College. On the rear side of the ridge was a huge depression on which the college grounds were later developed. The ridge is the site of the present-day beach. When Fort St. George was built in 1640, the sea was too close to the fort. The building of the harbor near the fort resulted in sand accretion to the south of the fort and the harbor and the sea, which was washing the ramparts of the fort, moved afar at about 2.5 km away from the fort creating a wide beach between the land and the sea.Before the Madras harbor was built, the beach was just a strip of mud, teeming with mudskippers. The beach washed up close to the present day road for a long time until the harbor was built in 1881.Ever since the harbor was built, the area south of the port has accreted significantly, forming the present day's beach mainly due to the presence of wave breakers laid for the construction of the harbor, although the coast in the northern region has undergone severe erosion. Eventually, the north-drifting current widened the beach to its present extent. The beach was formed as a result of arresting the littoral drift by the port's breakwater. The area of the beach is increasing 40 sq m every year. "
Marina_Beach,Raguram R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-22,"Great landmark, Spoiled by Administrative Apathy.","Great Landmark beach, Could have been maintained better.  we went to the beach on a working day at 4:00 PM, Just to enjoy time at the beach. Let me outline my experience,a) Beach sand had a lot of garbage mixed, including broken bottles, plastic caps, plastic overb) There was a lot of garbage thrown back by the sea on the beach, nothing was cleared. There was barely any place right by the beach where you could sit down and enjoy. Too much of rotten stuff. I was surprised to see a mattress also thrown back by the seac) there was a mechanized sand combing machine that is supposed to collect garbage from the beach sand. It was just wasting time and money. It was doing nothing. d) We saw a couple pull out the diaper of their child and dump it on the beach. There is no toilet or any infrastructure where children can be taken care of.We just squatted there for some time and decided to bail out. Highly dissatisfied."
Marina_Beach,Andrew D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Don't visit during the daytime,"Maybe I made a mistake of visiting it during daytime, because there is nothing at all here. The beach itself is average with nothing to write home about, while the avenue with the statues are undergoing public transport renovation so you can't really see the statues right now. On top of that, the sun is too glaring with nothing else to do and see. Skip, or maybe try during evening?"

You can come here during sunrise or sunset. Horse ride is another attraction. The beach police is continuously patrolling. This Beach should be clean regularly. One drawback is there don't have any sitting arrangement seperaly in the beach. you have to get back 400 meter to sit.  A must visit place."

Marina_Beach,niluanu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-22,Long Sandy Beach,Marina Beach is India's longest beach and one of Chennai's prime tourist attractions.  It is a huge expanse of sand and you need to walk quite a bit to reach the sea. The sand can get quite hot during the day. The place can get quite crowded during evenings when many of the food stalls also open. The place is easily accessible by public transport. Parking is also available. Do carry water if you visit during daytime
Marina_Beach,Eileen108,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-22,Hardly Anyone There till After Dark,"I went at 10:30am and was surprised to see the beach was empty. Even at 5:30pm, the snack sellers were just starting to come and getting out vegetables to cook. Policemen on horses were telling people not to go in the water as the waves were too high."
Marina_Beach,Ria1104,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-22,Had a Really Bad Experience,"I visited the beach on our long layover in Chennai. Mostly this beach is visited by locals and so the vendors can easily distinguish between a local and an outsider and hence the price difference and everything clearly comes into picture.The beach itself is really huge with a huge expanse of sand....you could literally get exhausted from walking all the way from the road to the sea. We made a mistake here instead of going through the designated route of the shops, God knows why we chose a way which appeared a bit quieter. It was in the middle of the day and hence safety was not much of a concern for us (that is what we thought) . But soon we realized why this way was secluded and the other one was so crowded. The entire way till the sea (the secluded one) was full of poop (both of human and animals) and was super smelly. I have never seen such a smelly beach in my life. Now people might counter me saying the smell might be from the local vendors selling fish....but being a Bengali I clearly can differentiate the smell of fish and poop.And to make things worse two transgenders caught my boyfriend for money and when he denied started abusing. When we gave them Rs 10 just to shut their mouth they demanded Rs 50 and threatened to throw sand at us if we did not pay. At this I  got paranoid for a while....luckily my boyfriend grabbed my hand and got mingled in the midst of a local group who were relaxing in the beach.Not only that even fish shops overcharged us for the fish we bought for snacks. Now I might not be a local but most Bengalis can clearly distinguish which fish is what. So when he promised me pomfret and offered some other fish I understood in my first bite that I am getting conned. So my first experience in this beach was not at all good. I feel that you would enjoy this place more if you knew about the nooks and corners of this place....you should know what to try and what to avoid....what kind of cons are existing and all. If you can crack all this then you might enjoy here. Also try to go through the crowded ways which go through the shops till you reach the waters to avoid toxic smell as well as toxic people."

History of the beach dates back to  late 1870, when the governor of Madras  Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, who was captivated by the beach on an earlier visit , conceived and built the promenade along the beach in 1884 by extensively modifying and layering it with soft sand. He also gave it the name Madras Marina in the same year. Since the early 19th century, a number of public buildings were constructed fronting the beach.Since ,we were pressed for time, we visited the beach in the late afternoon...the sand of course was burning but the moment waves washed our feet, we felt refreshed ...It is definitely a place to visit."

Also I‚Äôm told the sea is used for removing untreated sewage and rubbish so best avoided but a great shame as magnificent if something was done about this.

The entire area has a good parking facility(of course a bit hard to get place sometimes) with a lot of food stalls that once can enjoy while walking along the shore. This is a place one MUST visit if you are a tourist to Chennai. Coming to the waters, the shore is little inclined so have to be careful. Police patrolling(on horses) happens throughout(they watch us) the day which was the things I liked the most. They care and ensure every visitor goes back safe & sound. Good place!!"

Marina_Beach,Jolly Traveller,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Marina Beach - I tried to love it,"Marina Beach is a Chennai must see destination but after visiting the north end of the beach I felt deflated.I didn't get to the lighthouse which I do think would be worth visiting so maybe start therr.I started my wanders st Madras University grounds (stunning architecture), then took the pedestrian underpass to the north end of the beach. I strolled through the monument grounds (worth a look but it would be best with a guide), up to the bridge (with its unique stink of backwater and sewerage) and cut through the quiet memorial park to the beach. From there a walk across the grass flats to the sand.As with Elliot's Beach, there is plenty to see but the plentiful garbage and for me the poor condition of some horses (possibly retired beach ponies) up the back made it a joyless visit. Have a look at my pics.I tried to love this beach for it's uniqueness but couldn't.

More kinds of  fish than we could identify. Everyone seems friendly and happy to allow photos and engage in hand-sign talk with non Tamil speakers like us. This is a working beach - covered in brightly coloured fishing boats, nets, fishing gear and assorted fishing related debris. We went late morning, we are told early morning is the really busy time.

Marina beach is more commercial and Besant Nagar beach gives more privacy...This beach is more for the people those who prefer to be away from the commercial things and crowded space.

Some of these restaurants have seating arrangement in the open which goes well with the breeze. You can explore restaurants serving south Indian, tandoori and continental dishes. Sunday mornings are usually car free times so you can actually park your vehicles elsewhere and walk on the road along the beach sands.

Signs say no photography inside but most Indian visitors were happily taking photos. Look closely at the framed paintings of the disciples on the walls - they are portrayed as if they were Bollywood stars. You have to go behind the church to enter the tomb of Thomas, even quieter and more spiritual. There is a small museum there too. We visited This Catholic church and Kapaleeshwarar Hindu temple in the same morning - it is fascinating to contrast and compare how the two religions have built and use their places of worship just 500m apart."

San_Thome_Church,Ronan P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-19,"Very beautiful, surprisingly moving","I hadn't intended to visit the church, but I had hired a driver who insisted on taking me there on the way to a Hindu Temple. I am very glad he did. This church is one of only three in the world to hold the remains of one of the original disciples, the others being St Peters in Rome, and Santiago de Compostela.St Thomas, he who doubted, was martyred in India, and his remains are held here. They have the lance heaad which killed him. Oh, I know the cynics will say ""I thought they only came in packs of twelve"", but it is very moving to explore the little museum, the basement chapel where the tomb is, and the church itself, a cool, beautiful oasis of peace in the middle of the bustle of Chennai. The original church was builtby Persian Christians in the 10th Century, but this fell into disrepair five hundred years later, so the Portugese built a church on the current site to hold the tomb in 1522. This building is from 1896, but the feeling of such long continuity remains. I loved visiting it, and found it very moving, more so than I had imagined."

I was pleased to visit and see genuine worshipers upholding their faith in Christ.  I did wonder what was in the safe in the wall and why it was open and highlighted.  I saws a group of people doing morning exercises in the yard. that was interesting to see at a church.  What was also interesting was the presence of a moderately large police contingent at the site.

It's first of all situated in one of the nicest area in Chennai, Mylapore. The Church is built on the grave of St.Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ. There arr only three churches in the world built on the grave of the disciples of Jesus and Santhome is one among them. A relic of St.Thomas is kept in the underground and a musuem is also there which depicts the old and traditional stories and the things. The Church has a great history behind. There is also a pole of St.Thomas behind the Church which was made thanking God for saving Santhome from the tsunami,2004."
San_Thome_Church,kurien2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-18,Three Cathedrals in the world supposedly built over the tomb of apostles St.Peter's St.James  and Santhome,Legend has it that among the 12 disciples st.Thomas landed up in India and lived in St.Thomas Mount and buried in Santhome the Portugese quarter in Madras. The three disciples over whose tombs Cathedrals have been built are St.Peter at Rome St.James in Spain and Santhome for St.Thomas. The fact that there is a 400 year gap between the time Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross to the time St.Thomas landed up at Santhome. However the interesting feature is this is one cross with Christ fully clothed standing in a lotus with two peacocks on either side

San_Thome_Church,Rasputin21,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A Roman Catholic church honoring St Thomas,"San Thome as it is known, is a pristine white church among the decaying Madras surroundings.  Unfortunately, it is currently being renovated and is covered in scaffolding making photography difficult.  On the left as you enter the grounds is a very realistic and well maintained grotto with luxurious foliage.  There is limited parking available.The current church was built in the 16th Century by the Portuguese.  It was built to contain the martyred remains of St Thomas the Apostle.  It must have been quite a feat for him to have travelled so far  in AD 52.  He was martyred on St Thomas' Mount and a diorama of the martyrdom is displayed in the crypt.The Church was rebuilt by the British in 1893.  The spire reaches a height of 155ft.The Portuguese influence is confirmed by the brass panels identifying the various priests of the church.  Even if they had English names, they were prefixed by ""Dom"".One enters the church through the side entrance and is immediately entranced by the beautiful gold chandeliers.  On the right is the simple choir accessed from the entrance.  To the left is the main altar with large statues of various saints.  What is unusual is that there are pews in the altar area as well.   To the right is the chapel of the Virgin of Mylapore where the Virgin is dressed in a blue sari.On the left is the Holy Sacrament Chapel.  Behind the church is a building that contains a museum and the crypt.  One has to remove one's shoes and climb down the stairs to the crypt.  No photography is allowed in the crypt.  Although the museum is on the ground floor one has to remove one's shoes to enter there too!Do visit and give a donation to the upkeep of this wonderful church."

Shirdi_Sai_Baba_Temple,Chinmai Gupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Plan your taxi carefully.,"I went to Shirdi, from Delhi with my 70+ parents and 2 kids, aged 13 and 7, thinki g that it is a safe destination to travel to, for ladies.We had planned a 5 days trip, starting from Shirdi, to trimbakeshwar, then Nashik and then back to The hotel - Marigold Regency was wonderful- neat, clean, staff helpful , free pick and drop service to the Sai Temple.The only problem we faced in the whole trip was the taxi that had been arranged through a travel agent.We arranged it before travelling to avoid last minute confusions but it did not turn out to be so.The taxi driver was apathetic, had no desire to show us  nearby attractions even on repeated requests.Did not tie the luggage on the luggage carrier, so in effect we travelled in cramped seats despite it being a 7 seater.He took us to specific shops in shani shignapur and shirdi and compelled us to buy stuff from there, and had no consideration for my elderly parents parking very far away- saving his petrol and creating difficulties for us, which were avoidable.Even when requested to drive further he refused.On the third day of the trip, he started harrassing us for extra money- refused to follow the earlier agreed upon  itinery and created a lot of stress for me and my parents.To the extent that eventually we had to change out taxi.But this experience left a bad taste and made me to feel that even now, single females with/ without kids are not safe to travel."

Though temple distance was not so far. Bit this was a great facility.We used to pay our obeisance there twice a day to reap to the maximum. The temple is located in a huge area and one can see big rush always. But we were lucky to avail the facility of senior pass and pay our respects easily always.People visiting to this holy city and sacred temple should note that cab charges Rs 600 from airport to city. This rate is very high and fixed by the union. Airport to city distance is approximately 15-16kms only. The Shirdi airport is small but nice.At the temple, it is advised to bargain much for flowers, garlands and bouquets. They ask for almost 4 times high rates. They sell guavas add pomegranates also at exorbitant rates though fresh so you need to bargain.In Prasad, there is no binding and one can offer anything. Opposite to gate is the shop selling any type of Prasad. So but according to your trust and ability. No phones etc are allowed inside. So put them in locker at Rs 5 only. Keep the slip carefully with mobile number which is verified when you take phone.You can enjoy divine taste of tea at Baba's tea shop inside. This is small and always crowded because tea here is for Rs 2 only and coffee for Rs 3. Mineral water for Rs 10 only.If you are fast and quick then you can come out of the temple in just half hour. Rest depends on you.From Shirdi, one can go to Shani Shignapur also in non AC tempo traveller at Rs 150 only that leaves you back at Shirdi temple in the evening.Likewise you've chance to visit Triambkeshwar temple also. But you should plan it early in a cab. Travel agencies charge Rs 3000 or so for going and coming to Shirdi but a good bargain can fetch you at Rs 2100 only which we paid.

Shirdi_Sai_Baba_Temple,Valavanur Natar... K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Write up on  Shiridi Saibaba temple at Injambakkam,"begin this post with my eyes closed and  complete reverence in silence  recalling the words of Baba :I Quote""No one goes anywhere without a connection or relationship.Never drive away People or creatures  who approach you  receive them well and treat them with due respect. GOD will certainly be pleased if you give water to the thirsty and bread to those in hunger and attire to naked poor and a place in your home sitout for resting if they are tired .If  anyone demands money and if  you dont feel like giving it's okay .But do not bark at him.or her like a dog""  I have lived in Maharashtra Pune for close to 10 years but I did not have his grace to visit his last known abode Shiridhi until recently .But before I was  given a call to go there  a doctor  friend of ours ,  domiciled in UK celebrated their daughter's wedding at Shirdhi Saibaba temple at Injambakkam , a few years back .Its a sprawaling campus with huge car park And the temple itself is a grandiose .The statue of Baba in soarkling white marble is awe  inspiring to say the least. I was fortunate to pray here in peace abd witness the maha Aarthi .To appeal to the mind of all kinds of devotees specially Hindus many VigrahamsOf all gods and that of Navagrahas with sannidhis have been added here in this baba temple. The whole premises generates peace and harmonybif body and mind with abundant trees breathing oxygen for one's benefit.But while sitting in meditation at this temple I refected upon the simplicity and the life and times of  Baba.Shirdi Sai Baba, was an¬†Indian¬†spiritual master regarded by his devotees as a¬†saint, a¬†fakir, a¬†satguru¬†and an incarnation of Lord Shiva and Dattatreya. He was  revered by both Hindus and Muslims alike during  his lifetime and even After he left this world on 15 October 1918 in Shirdi,¬†then known as Bombay Presidency during British India and now ¬†Maharashtra.A Samadhi and a wonderful Mandir has been constructed  here and attracts millions of devotees round the year .My being an ardent devotee of KanchiShri Chandrasekhara Maya Swami , in whoseLotus feet , I am in perpetual surrender .My spiritual inward travel began in 79 when he gave me a unique dhiksha on a full moon night while he was doing his atma pooja at a  pooja  in Bhavani temple at Satara and I consider him reincarnation of Lordess Kanchi Kamakshi .He has guided me since then and all my grahastha and spiritual life and  experiences that followed .Visits  to holy places and meeting many Sat Gurus till date is all his grace. As a true seeker I realise what Baba preached about  the importance of¬† realization of the self¬†and to abhor ¬†love for perishable things,  while following  a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace and devotion to the God and guru. Sai Baba did not have a  distinction based on religion or caste. But one thing that elludes me today  is :when Baba through out his life lived a life in simplicity and mingled with the poor why now his statue now  adorned in temples with such great pomp and grandeur when that money can be channelled for poor and needy that includes imparting knowledge to them to become self sufficient. I ask of all readers of this post this :When you visit a temple, mosque or church Of great importance and while  you stand in front of the diety and start praying the physical body responds to spirituality with both your hand coming to gather and eyes automatically closing .The truth of the matter is when you join hands you realise the fact that you and he have become one .You seek him inside of you and not on the outside of you .So grandeur of the statue or place of worship is of no importance. It is just a starting point in your spiritual journey ..I conclude with an ideal mantra            ""OM SAI RAM ""Om Being the universal Bhjikshara mantra Sai denoting the diety Ram  equates Sai of Shiridhi to Shri Rama of Ayodhya"

Parthasarathy_Temple,rasa006,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-19,This Perumal temple in Triplicane in Chennai is famous for many reasons.,"We, family members of 4 adults and 2 children, visited Parthasarathy Temple in Triplicane,Chennai during Navarathri festival. Laksharchana was going on for Rukmani thayar, (Vedavalli Thayar) many families participated, with Rs.200.00 as charges.When we went there to darshan of main diety, Swamy PARTHASARATHY PERUMAL, long queues were seen. Special quick darshan tickets of Rs.200 and another ticket for Rs.50.00 are offered for quick darshan. We had good darshan with aarthi to Perumal. As I said earlier, this temple is famous for many reasons:1. Main deity's majestic standing posture of more than 9 feet height.2. Main sanctum is facing East and  the temple is very near to Marina Beach, one of the famous beaches in the world.3. This Temple prasadam - Puliyotharai - it is called Parthasarathy Koil Puliyotharai. Rice item made with tamarind extract, red chilli,etc. If you try puliyotharai somewhere else, like restaurant, you tent to ask "" will it be like Parthasarathy Koil Puliyotharai. Its unique smell and taste made this one famous- like Laddu in Tirupathhi.4. Just opposite to western gate of this temple,ls an iconic house,maintained by Tamil Nadu Government. Yes, in this house Poet Mahakavi Bharathi lived and died. I visited this temple many times earlier, but after a gap of 4 years, I visited now and to my dismay, this temple's famous puliyotharai last its charm. I wondered what went wrong and why it went wrong. This time, this prasadam was a let- down for us.Any how, we had good darshan of Yoga Narasimhar, Andal, and other upaa dieties,"

This was a first for me.Returned 3rd day determined to pay obeisance at Vishnujis feet.Queued up with the general public, for 45 minutes, of exposure to the interiors. Fortunately, the vedic chanting of shlokas commenced. The serenity and spiritual power of the temple, and the hymns took over my entire being.There is a 50 rupees fast lane, but in my view, beats the purpose of temple visit.Life and time is running away and us mortals are forever in a hurry chasing the elusive mirage.Temple time should be devoted to focusing on the spiritual aspect and not scoring tick marks.Would I visit again... Definitely..Wish the temple premises outside the main area were cleaner as barefoot walking becomes a challenge under existing conditions."

This temple called ‚ÄúParthasarathy temple‚Äù is one of the most beautiful temples with many special features. Apart from being the sixty-first Vaishnavite  Divya Pradesam, it has the unique idol of Lord Krishna as Parthsarathy with a silver moustache in standing posture with a conch in his right hand and showing varada mudra in his left hand. As the Lord promised that he would not directly participate in Mahabharata War, we do not see Sudarshan Chakra in his hand. In the main sanctum along with Parthasarathy (also called Venkatakrishnan), we can also see his whole family present, a rare feature nowhere found in any other temple. Hence this place is called Southern Brindavana. Rukmini and Lord Balarama are seen on the right side of the main deity and Satyaki to his left along with Pradhyumna (Krishna‚Äôs son) and Aniruddha( Krishna‚Äôs grandson). On the face of the main deity a mark seen which said to be the mark left by Bhishma‚Äôs arrows during the Mahabharata war. In this temple we can see five forms of Vishnu ‚Äì Lord Narasimha, Lord Sri Rama, Lord Gajendra Varada Raja, Lord Ranganatha and Lord Sri Krishna at one and same place. In this temple there are two entrance towers (Raja Gopurams) : one in front of Lord Parthasarathy‚Äôs shrine facing east; another one just behind this temple in front of Lord Narasimha‚Äôs shrine f acing west. Lord Narasimha called Yoga Narasimha is seen in sitting posture.  Besides these two Raja Gopurams, there are five vimanams or temple towers ‚Äì over the shrines of Lord Parthasarathy, Ranganatha,Rama, Narasimha and Andal respectively. On the right side parallel to Parthasarathy shrine, the shrine of Goddess Vedavalli is seen facing east. There is a shrine for Ranganatha and for Sri Rama seen in the passage to the main shrine. Lord Ranganatha is seen facing east in reclining posture on the holy serpent bed of Adi Sesha with His two consorts sitting near his feet. In the shrine of Sri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna are seen on sides. A small shrine for Hanuman is seen just in front of this shrine. There is a separate shrine for Andal. This temple was constructed first by the Pallava King Narsimha Varma I in eighth century and later was expanded and developed by Pandya, Chola and Vijayanagara kings. There are many stone inscriptions in Telugu and Tamil referring to Pallava King Nandi Varman,Chola kings Raja Raja and Kulottunga III, Pandya king Maravarman  and Vijayanagara kings like Sadasiva raya, Sri Rangaraya and Venkatapathi raya II.  In 1564 the temple was renovated with new shrines. According to legends a king called Sumathi did penance and prayed to Lord Vishnu to appear before him in the form of Lord Parthasarathy. The Lord directed him to go to Tiruvallikkeni (now called Triplicane) to see the idol of Parthsarathy installed by sage Atreya Rishi. The king went there and built a shrine there after meeting the sage Atreya. The temple is open from 5.30 a.m. to 12.00 noon and from 4.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. every day.  Here worship is done according to Vaikhasana Agama in accordance with Thenkalai tradition. Many special poojas and celebrations are performed here on festival days like Sri Krishna Jayanti, Sri Vaikunta Ekadasi, Ratha sapatami, Sri Rama Navami and Nava Rathri. Brahmosthsavams are celebrated for  Lord Parthsarathy during Chittirai month (April and May) and for Lord Narasimha during Ani month (June and July).  Theppostsavam (float festival) is grandly celebrated here for one week during the month of Masi (February) every year."

Parthasarathy_Temple,Gowrish P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Historic Krishna temple, grand deity, must visit","Located in Triplicane within a couple of kilometers of Marina Beach, Sri Parthsarathy Temple is one of the oldest structures in Chennai, dating back to 8th Century AD, of the Chola rule.Dedicated to Lord Krishna and Goddess Rukmini, this temple built in Drividian style has other sanctums for Vishnu - Rama and Ranganatha included.The complex is large and has a rather round-about route to inner sanctum. If you enter from the main gate near the temple tank, you have to go all the way around, circumnavigate 3/4ths of the ground before getting in. This is likely for crowd management, but might be unnecessary during non busy hours.The main deity, Parthasarathy is an gorgeous stunning idol, larger than life and adormed with precious gems.The large stone construction keeps the insides cool but also humid. They have, as seen in other large temples like the Kapaleeswarar Temple, ACs inside to manage the ambient temperature.Parking is limited and surrounding roads are narrow. *Photography* is prohibited once inside. The outer corridor (see picture) has high pillars, with deities carved into the lower halves. This is a must visit beautiful temple."

The place is well kept and is worth every penny spent. The walk through aquarium with Sharks swimming over the heads is the highlight of the place. They have a cute AI experience for kids that takes a 2D sketch from kids and renders it on a screen as a 3D animation. Kids loved to see their imaginary fish springing to lifeI personally didn't like them have a good store in a dungeon at the end of the park. The place was fairly stinky and dingy to sell food. The restrooms were not clean either. 5 Stars for the experience of watching the fishes and2 stars for how well the place is maintained

With ticket price in the higher end (Rs.695 per head, excluding parking charge), we would think it would be amazing. Unfortunately.. 1) None of the staff even knows the name of the #fishes there. (They only know where the bathroom is or the price of the snacks). 2) Can't spend more than an hour. (Can go to two movies with the same money).3) Staff was rude. (A group of students came. The VGP staff gave mic to the teacher who was screaming ""Class 3A STAND IN THE LINE. Class 4A, Class 4A!!! Where is THE LINE! FORM THE LINE.. ALL STUDENTS STAND IN THE LINE..."" The screaming on the mic went for more than 10mins.felt like we were in a school playground (got a terrible headache since it was closed area and the noise was extremely loud and unpleasant). When asked about the Mic announcements, the VGP Staff named Mr.Shiva said rudely that it will be like this only! And suggested saying ""Don't come here. Yes it will be like this. I can't do anything! You can leave if you want.""Simply, They could have allowed only the school students and refused entry for public if they don't care about others!4) The place lacks proper maintenance (someone had vomited inside the tunnel and it was stinking, they took their sweet own time to clean, even after informing). 5) Food is overly priced and mostly old (popcorn was stale).While the experience at #Crocodile bank/#Snake park which is few kms away was #amazing!Snake park staffs (of #Irulas tribe) were eager to explain more, readily #answering any queries we had! The price is way lesser than VGP Marine Kingdom. Crocodile bank Rs.100 per head. Snake park Rs.30 per head.Highly recommend the Snake park in Crocodile bank!üëçüèºA big No for Marine kingdomüëéüèº"

,,,,,"Firstly the one you rather not waste your money on and recommend you should not fall for it is the ""VR"" at the entry. They advertise it as a 9D experience, but does not even give a 3D experience at the best. If you have ever experienced a 4D or such in one of those sea worlds or Disney worlds elsewhere, just forget about pulling out your wallet and wasting 150Rs/person for the 10 minute thing where you sit on a chair that keeps making cranking noises and bumping up and down while you watch a video beamed to your gear that is strapped to your head. 9D is a sham. An whats worse is the videos are not even stitched together, but 3 different videos are streamed one after the other while operator announces ""next video"" that without appropriate audio doesn't ever make you feel  like being underwater. Even Youtube does a better job of streaming queued videos back to back !! Probably enjoyable only for little kids (8yrs or younger). I would not even rat 1-star for the VR, but sue them for the misleading 9D which is nothing but a money scam.Otherwise, coming to the main attraction, if you are interested in or like to see fishes, this is a good place one could easily spend 3-4 hours enjoying your time watching them - lots of variety of fishes, big and small, can be seen.  I mean ""live"" fishes! It was amazing to see various fishes of different colors swimming together in each of the many of those aquariums (like the one in my uploaded pic), feels pretty even for me as an adult.  The only touch pool is that of the star fishes where one can touch and feel their body. There are many other pools which are open on the top and have fishes that can be viewed.The underwater tunnel provides a nice experience of like being under water (in the ocean) but the tunnel could be much well maintained - without touch marks and being clear to make the view as real as being in the water than reminding being in a  glass tunnel. And in case you were asking, there are no live shows.. this is not SeaWorld., but worth a visit if you love fishes."

Even the operations manger Vijay Kumar is so irresponsible while talking to visitors. There are no CCTV cameras to know who has taken the car. Anything can happen to your car but management won't take any responsibility. So,  I suggest people don't go for wallet parking."

There are even some sharks üê†üêüü¶àüëç The entire place is maintained very well.üëç One of the highlights of this place is the huge tank and they've made a cave out of it, thus allowing us to watch the movement of fishes around us.üëç There is a touch gallery where you're allowed to touch some fishes under supervision. üëç Though I haven't seen it, I've heard that everyday there is a scheduled slot for feeding time. Visitors will be allowed to watch the staffs feeding the fishes. Recommend to check with the place before your visit. üëç Good place to bring kids.üëç There is a souvenir shop inside where they sell ocean life themed toys for kids. üëç There is also a restaurant and a cafe inside the place."

Later I called customer care and confirmed about ticket validity, they said can come anytime, after 2 months I went to visit the place with family and kids, they said tickets already expired, once again I have to buy tickets to visit the place, poor maintenance when compare with other places, it's not worth to visit this place, less fish varieties."

The view ignites to know more about marine life species its an good attempt to keep rare fishes ,  I was 78 Kgs -36 years women tried the scuba diving, the tutor Joshua and the Dive master Anish kumar was so encouraging, no negative comments or scary words, in the practising session i took little long time and had a point of quitting , dive master motivated and it was an good memory for my life .also they took care of my 8 years old daughter.Thanks for the diving team as well as the maintence guys."
,,,,,I have visited this place with my family. My kid enjoyed it a lot. Visited it on Monday so it was not crowded. So had a good time to watch each fish and it was worth it.
,,,,,It is a good attempt by its creators. There are a lot of variety of fish in the huge aquariums it houses. You can spot sharks in the 'through water' tunnel. Avoid weekends to skip the crowd. 
,,,,,A great place to visit on the ECR. It is situated next to the VGP Kingdom and Snow Kingdom venues. A good experience overall even though the venue is quite small. They also provide scuba diving tours and also have a VR zone both of which are a must try activities. Entry fees are a bit on the upside(cost per adult is Rs.600 and per child[above 90cm ht] is Rs.500). The cafeteria and souvenir shops are also a bit costly and are situated near the exit. Overall a must visit spot for a breathtaking aquatic experience.

VGP_Marine_Kingdom,VGP Marine Kingdom,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good experience,"I have visited this Marine Kingdom twice and it is probably the first to have underwater walkthrough aquarium in India. I have been always been a Scuba diving enthusiast. The moment I saw VGP offering Scuba dives, my long pending desire to swim with the sharks woke up instantly and seized the opportunity. I filled a routine health questionnaire and attended the detailed explanation by the diving instructor (I forgot his name, so posting his pic). Although excited, I was a bit nervous of the sharks as this was my first dive inside an aquarium. But I was told it is totally safe and gave clear instructions on what to do and what not to. I did a trial dive followed by the full dive. The water used in the aquarium is sea water; it makes sense as they have sea species in the main aquarium.My heart was throbbing for a while with all Hollywood scary movie bits running in my mind. My instructor was very sensible and kept checking my wellness inside the water frequently. Once he was sure that I was comfortable and that I was able to signal him back, he reduced the frequency and took me closer to the fishes.I cannot name all the species I saw, but I could identify lemon sharks, black tip, sting rays, etc. The dive was for about 60 minutes in total and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were different artificial landscapes inside the aquarium ‚Äî including replicas of some temple in ruins, and a drowned ship in the seas which was totally unexpected. As I informed my family earlier to wait at the underground tunnel to see me while I dive, they were waiting near the aquarium panel. They waved at me in excitement, so I signaled my diver and he helped me kneel, and I was waving back, which only encouraged other people to wave back at me. I continued with the rest of my dive with some beautiful memories to cherish until my next escapade.Amusingly, I came to know that those who register for scuba need not purchase a separate ticket for the aquarium. The reason I quote amusing is that if I am already swimming with the fishes, why would I crave for watching them from outside the aquarium üòäI also noticed that the cost for the dive is still economical than other scuba dives I have done in rest of the world. According to me, we are getting a world class experience within an aquarium at a nominal cost.You need good reef or sometimes luck to swim closer with the fishes in open waters. But here, the landscapes are built, and you cannot get any closer than this to the sea species. So, the only regret I had during my entire visit was that I could not carry my GoPro with me for some catchy pictures. Happy diving!"

The VR show was good ( Do not miss that ).  They do the feeding at specific times and we wanted to view that - but we missed it. You can easily lose track of time watching other things so plan accordingly if you want to watch the feeding. The whole place was divided into zones based on habitats. Appreciate the fact that it had elevators and escalators in all the places making it elderly friendly. There is a cafe and a sovienur shop at the end .

Chennai_Central_Railway_Station,Valavanur Natar... K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Business,A detailed write up on origin history and its present status of Chennai Central Railway station,"A detailed write up on origin ,history and growth of The Chennai Central station The century-old Chennai Central Railway Station was designed by architect George Harding in 12th-century¬† Romanesque architecture. It  is indeed one of the most prominent landmarks of Chennai that serves as the main gateway by Rail  to the  rest of the country along with Egmore Railway  station 2 kms away .These two stations are well connected by suburban and Road connectivity .The Buchingham canal built by the British to ferry goods by waterway upto Nellore in Andhrapradesh  lies to the west of this Station . The  suburban railways that includes MRTS and Metro has its main hub near  this central station .The Sub terrenian metro station and muti layered shopping plaza now under consruction will becomr one of Asia's largest .The headquarters¬†of the¬†Southern Railway¬†and the corporation ¬†Ripon Building.built during the¬†British Raj are to the east and west of this station respectively .To the south is the main General hospital .and Madras Medical college .To its credit of long history it has been renamed twice, from¬†Madras Central¬†to¬†Chennai Central¬†in 1996, in line with change if its city's name from. Madras to¬†Chennai, and then later to to¬†Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station¬†in 2019, after the late¬†Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu¬†M. G. Ramachandran..Perhaps this name must be the station in indian network which has  the  longest name now .About 6 lakh  passengers utilise  this  terminus each  day, making it the busiest railway station in¬†South India togather with¬†Chennai Egmore.¬†Although the cleanliness is never a high point of Indian railways, Chennai central has the distinction of being one of the cleanest scoring over 180 points Out of 300 points bench mark .It boasts of 17 Platforms of which 12 is for long distance, & 5 for suburban commute  and  has 30 tracks for interchanging . Pallavan metro bus service connects this station by road to all parts of the city Historically speaking  when the Madras Railway Company began to network¬† South India¬†in 1856 the first station to be built was not this station but one at¬†Royapuram,(Now defunct) and it remained the main station at that time.With expansion of the Madras Railways network  this Madras Central station  came into being in 1873 , in  the open grounds that had once been called¬†John Pereira's Gardens, belonging to Joao Pereira de Faria  a¬†Portuguese¬†merchant  who had  settled in Madras in 1660.In 1907, Madras Central was made the Madras Railway Company's main station and  gained prominence after  Royapuram station ceased to be  a terminus for Madras .The Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway Company was formed in 1908 and took over the Central station from the Madras Railway Company.The station's importance  grew  after the  the headquarters of the¬†Madras and  Southern Mahratta Railway¬†moved to the adjacent building  ans soon came to be  known as the¬†Southern Railway in 1922The year 1980s saw further expansion of central station that saw the annexing of  the erstwhile Moore market complex that was devastated in a fire .The Railways built a 13-storied complex to house the suburban terminus and railway reservation counter. With open space in front  becoming  a car park..In 1996, after  the station became known as Chennai Central  and increased passenger capacity compelled  further extension to  the main building and a new building was added   in 1998 with on the western side with a similar architecture to the original. After this duplication of the main building, the stations 12 platforms became 17 platforms .The multi-storeyed¬†Moore Market Complex¬†then became  a dedicated terminus with three separate platforms for the¬†Chennai Suburban Railway system.In the 1990s, when the IRCTC was formed, shopping stalls and  food plazas were set up.In 2005, the buildings were painted a light brown colour, but Railways bowed down to  public demand through  campaigns and also to retain the old nostalgic charm it was  repainted back  in their original brick-red color.To its credit it became the first  station  in India to be placed on the cyber mapand on 26 September 2014, Chennai Central got  free Wi-Fi connectivity. The renovated station now  boasts of bookshops,  restaurants, accommodation facilities, Internet browsing centres, and a shopping mall. And an inadequate waiting hall that can hold  about just  1,000 people.But to be frank even though it has a chequred history and undergone so many addition and changes its still a far cry from any internation standardsFor railway station for it  lacks several facilities such as drinking water, medical & prominent ¬†display boards and above all cleanliness .There are passenger operated enquiry terminals and seven touch-screen PNR status machines in the station.The station has three¬†split-flap timing boards, electronic display boards and Plasma TVs that mention train timings and platform number.A passenger information center in the station has been upgraded with ""Spot your Train"" live train display facility, information kiosks and passenger digital assistance booths.The terminus, however, has only 10 toilets, which is grossly  inadequate for over 4  lakh passenger movement at any point of time .Four-seater battery operated vehicles available to cater to the needs of the elderly and the physically impaired is grossly inadequate for many comevto the general hospital acroos the road by rail forctreatmentvfrom all parts the country . It is a pain to get one easily .On 15 April 2013, a new emergency medical care centre was opened thanks to PIL and intervention by judiciary . The centre now  has three beds, two doctors on duty and another on standby, four nurses, a paramedic team, and a round-the-clock ambulance. The centre is equipped with oxygen cylinders, an ECG, a defibrillator and resuscitation equipment. The terminus is also the first railway station in the country to have facilities of an ambulance.The station has parking facilities for more than 1,000 two-wheelers and  1,000 cars .But The station still faces parking problems and with on going metro Rail work chaos is an understatement .Once the Metro works with underground plazas are completed the Chennai Central station atleast on the outside I hope , will take back its pride of place in chennai city scape with its dominating clock on the central Red tower ."

Things have changes nonetheless, today they are much better, also if you are calling an uber or ola tell them that you are standing near the CANARA bank atm and they can easily locate you. avoid the touts and the freelance taxis as they still having the fleecing mentality ."

The town was named after P. Thyagaraya Chetty. The streets, parks and localities in the new neighbourhood were named after important officials in the provincial government.T. Nagar is now considered the largest shopping district in India by revenue. It is known for its plethora of saree and jewellery retailers, including Pothys, Nalli Silks and Saravana Stores. The neighbourhood is served by Mambalam railway station of the Chennai Suburban Railway Network. T.

In here, you will be able to purchase goods of very low value to expensive ones.If you are into clothing and fashion accessories, your visit to this street is a must!Now, the most famous shopping district of Chennai is not all bed of roses.  It has its own thorns as well.First, car/bike parking - you will never be able to park your vehicles near this street.  So, it is strongly advised that you come in a taxi or any other form of public transport (the local railway station called ""Mambalam"" is conveniently situated).Second, climate control - apart from a few chain of stores, you have to literally sweat it out here, especially in the summer.Third, safety - you have to be really careful with your belongings.Fourth, toilet facilities - unfortunately, there are no proper toilets around this shopping locale and that is a huge downside.With all the above challenges, this has always remained a favourite shopping space for me and I'm sure you would like it too.BTW, there are a lot of eateries nearby - that should keep you going throughout the day!"

Tightly packed with visitors, the street features mostly jewellery and clothing stores, which range from inexpensive to high end. One will find bargains even in the costly establishments. It was the usual practice those days to name the streets after the first resident, irrespective of their class, caste or contribution to the community. Ranganathan Street ought to have been named Rangaswamy Iyengar Street after the first resident of that street. However, T. Rangaswamy Iyengar, a retired Civil Servant of the erstwhile Madras Presidency, who built his house in this street in the early 1920s, when approached by civil authorities for his formal approval, requested it be named after Lord Ranganatha of Srirangam temple. Usman Road is on one end of the street and at the other end is the Mambalam (local electric) train station. On the street, we can find many commercial establishments, ranging from street hawkers selling safety pins to big stores selling gold jewellery. Many vegetable vendors also sell their wares on Ranganathan Street. Throughout the year, the street is full of people. Traditionally, it is busiest during Deepavali festival, as this street offers consumers the opportunity to purchase a variety of commodities. The most famous among the establishments on Ranganathan Street is the Saravana Stores. Ranganathan Street is a famous icon of T. Nagar and due to its proximity to Mambalam railway station, people from all parts of Chennai and Tamil Nadu flock to the Street for shopping, especially during festive seasons.We visited this street recently to purchase various items for the ensuing festive season and found the crowd so over-whelming that we got out of there immediately after our shopping!Put Theagaraya Nagar, Ranganathan Street on your schedule.

The growth of this temple from a small thatched shed with a photo of Lord Murugan ,the credit must go to the film world and the cine artists who patronised it over the years from many of the studios that existed in Kodambakkam for many years .Producer Devar of famous Devar films Who used trained animals to great effect  in his films was a great devoteeOf Lotd Muruga and his co teibutuin ti this temple is enormous .But today most of the studios have vanushed giving way to real estates, but the temple's  popularity just seems to grow.Saravana Bhavan restuarant  established a huge  branch  next to this temple with the blessings of Sri Kripanandha Warrior,  himself a great Devotee and Katakalaksheepam exponent  .This restuarant  makes it very easy for couples from the poorer section of society to get married in the temple  and then serve marriage special food for their guests in this   hotel under well established token system .This temple and hotel combination works very well to conduct marriage in a very affordable manner avoiding huge marriage hall and other infrastructure costs .This marriage facility is the main hallmark of this ever over crowded murugan temple  with around 6,000 to 7000 couples getting married each year in this temple as it houses  a very  spacious hall used for marriages and doubles as religious discourse area .Now let me  trace the origin and history of this temple In the year 1890   a strong devotee of Lord Murugan named Annaswamy Nayakar built a small shed l With his personal funds in a small way And placed a painting for his own praying  .Over time he appeared to acquire some sort of extra perceptional  powers and started giving advise to many people like a soothsayer on matters concerning their personal matters And following his advise sermed to work fine for many peole who went to him.News about him  spread and he came to be known as Arul Vakku Annaswamy . Some of acts he achieved included curing many diseases,  obtaining jobs , predict and conduct marriages  in the family The special.powers he exhibited , soon attracted the movie world and its people started pumping imoney  into development of  this shed into a regular temple with a huge temple tank Mind you those days HRCE a Govt regulatory dept was not in existance and but  temple saw a rapid growth as a private transpirant enterprise .In 1920s and a Rajagopuram was built in dravidian architecture with imagesDepicting various aspects under Sakanda puranam or storirs  of Murugan divine acts and deedsInside this temple there are separate sannidhis for  Vinayaka, Shiva ,  Meenakshi , Kali, Bhairava&  Shanmuga with Valli Devasenai.The main diety Lord Muruga in standing posture resembles the diety in the famous Palani Murugan , known to be  one  the arupadai veedagal of   Muruga in Tamil nadu .Lord Dakshina Murti, Chandikeswar, Mahalakshmi, and others othets too have small sannadhis .One  of modern addition was a glass walled palli Arai quite spacious that came up thanks to a mirror merchant. Personally speaking, writing about this temple floods my mind with fond memories when I was just a small child and my father used to drive the whole family in his car from T nagar Singara Mudali street and we had to wait for long at railway level crossing after passing a hugevpotters village  and once we are on the western side of the railway crossing , we were practically surrounded by green paddy fields and trees on either sides a rural village .Its unbelievable to see the huge metropolis that it has evolved into these past two decades and now it is extremely overcrowded .

When i visitef vadapalani yesterday Lord Senthilnadhan flashed in my mind for a whike Secondly unlike other Muruga temple you have seperate block/ dedicated sannadhi for chevvai, lord Guru and lord Saniswaran. People with dosham perform remedial pooja to alleviate their sins and problems. I remember the famous tamil song ""Thiruchendoorin kadalorathil Senthilnadan Arasangam"" implying Thiruchendoor was kingdom of lord Muruga.So is the power of Lord Murugan in Vadapalani also. Now that metro train stop at vadapalani I wish every hindu should visit Vadapalani whenever they land in Chennai .From Airport it is only a 10 minutes travel to vadapalani. Whatsoever it is millions of public perform marriage here and take Lords blessings. and also lot of doshams/ pariharam a strong Hindus belief. Also daily annadhanam is done for more than or mutiples of thousand devotees everyday. This is being gifted by devotees and devasthaanams ,a glorious service.See my posting on Vadapalani marriage festival following this blog"

Had a darshan and it was a great experience. We have here a 20Rs queue as well as free darshan queue. But often I notice many find a way through  a gate near the deity's entrance....may be through influence. But everyone remain silent in spite of paying a price for a quick darshan, They make the deity look beautiful and it is divine to have a darshan here.

Then went inner mandapam.That day there's some betrothal function and Lord Muruga Peruman kalyana Utchavam, in mandapam.We had good darshan,with Lord in Sandhana kaapu alankaram ( Sandal paste). Not much crowd ,since it was Thursday. But we prefered paid darshan which cost Rs,20/- per head. Unfortunately no Golden Chariot on that day. We also worshipped Lord Subramanian with Valli-dheivanai on inner piragaram and also Lord Dakshinamoorthy and Goddess Durgambigai. Going around the temple,we prayed at Goddess Meenakshi, Lord Sevvai,( this is unique in this temple,with separate sannidhi for Sevvai). Then Near Temple flagpost, we prayed Lord Anjaneyar. Over all a good time for us.But try to avoid on Karthigai, Sashti and other Murugan festival days. Crowd will be too much. On Marriage Muhurtham days also good crowd. Another problem in this temple, parking. If you are going in your car-self driven- you may face some problems to alight and get back to car, since car parking is haphazard and not in good maintenance."

I was all excited to go to Vadapalani temple.. So got ready at 6am and mom suggested I waited till 7am.. Since we were not sure if temple would be open. Temple open timings: 5amTuesdays and Kirthigai: 4:30amI got down from cab and got the archanai materials from a lady for ‚Çπ50. Got 3 mulam jasmine (‚Çπ20 each = total ‚Çπ60) which she made into a Garland. I gave the Garland to the moolavar. Archanai are done only with the urchavar.. I got a ticket for archanai ‚Çπ5 and special entry fees of ‚Çπ20.I stood in the queue for 30-40 minutes since moolavar was being done with sandal makeup. Wait was 100% worth.. Meenakshi Amman had the same makeup as well.. So beautiful. üôèüèºWe have Lord Ganesha, Shiva, Meenakshi, Aanjaneyar, Two more Muruga with Valli and Theiviyani.. I finished worshipping and got my prasadham Athirasam, thatai, murukku, laddo, panchamirtham, Pongal and puliyotharai.. There is a inside stall which has books, key chains, photos, posters of lord Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha.. Etc. Must buy.. Check out everything.. Don't miss. Get Ghee vizghakku for Lord Murugar to be lit right in front of Urchavar. There is a sithar peedam right next to the stall. Get two lemons. The cons:The temple is all about money. At Least ‚Çπ20. Or they literally make u feel like why u came.. And.. With cash issues in India.. It is difficult to get so much change.. I had only few ‚Çπ10.. This made it the sad visit. With all the people in their FastTrack life.. People should respect the few people who go to temples frequently.. And not scare them off. Anyways..I calmed myself cos I was happy to see Lord Muruga so beautiful.. ‚úåüèºWhen I came out.. There were two not so old ladies coming behind me asking me to get idlies. Now that I have seen happen when I get them food.. They don't seem to eat and sell them instead.. I have seen this trend in many temples.Anyhow.. I loved my Tuesday with Lord Murugar. If not for the depressing temple priests.. It would have been the best experience. I don't take pics of inside temple. I was busy worshipping too. Sorry. "

Sri Anjaneya temple is located at 8th street, Ist main Road, Ramnagar. You have to get down at Palavathangal or at Mambalam railway station to reach this temple. The idol of Anjaneya is thirty-two feet tall carved from a single granite stone and is the second tallest one after the statue of Hanuman in Panchavatee at Puducherry. Sri Maruthi Bhaktasamajam Trust with the blessings of Sri Raghavendraswami and Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswati succeeded in establishing this temple in 1989. The temple was consecrated with Kumbhabhishekam in 1995 after constructing a lofty 90-foot tall Rajagopuram. In 2008 this temple was taken over by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department, Govt. of Tamilnadu. As soon as one enters one can see the gigantic statue of Lord Hanuman in standing posture with folded hands. The tall statue decorated with flower garlands and golden crown looks quite majestic and evokes a sense of devotion. There is a pathway on four sides of the temple. The mandapam or the central hall is very spacious and devotees have to move in a queue. Three ghee lamps burn continuously in front of the sanctum. The temple is well-maintained and many senior citizens act as volunteers in doing temple work.  Various type of Prasadam such as Pongal,Puliyogara and Milagu Vada are freely distributed here to all devotees. Many devotees perform Vadamala seva here when the tall idol of Lord Hanuman is garlanded with vadas from top to bottom.  The temple is facing west and there is a second entrance from the southern side. On northwestern side there is the shrine of Lord Srirama with Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman. In southwestern corner there is a shrine for Lord Sri Krishna along with his consorts, Rukmini and Satyabhama. This is quite unusual since in many Hanuman temples one does not see a separate shrine for lord Krishna.  In the Northeastern corner there is a platform with lord Ganesh and there is an idol of Naga (serpent) on the left side of Ganesh. On the northwestern side of the temple there is a cowshed with many cows whose milk is used for temple sevas. To the eastern side of the temple one finds the kitchen and the administrative building. Many sevas are done in this temple. Sri Rama Kalyanam is performed every day. Special poojas and ceremonies are performed during festive days like Hanumath Jayanti, Golulasthami,Sri rama navami and Navarathri.  Special archanas are done on Saturdays and Abhishekams on Ekadashi and Amavaasi.The temple is open from 5.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon and from 4.00 to 9.00 p.m. in the evening. On Tuesdays and Saturdays one finds a huge crowd here.  The nearby temples are Sri Raghavendraswami temple and Guruvayur temple. If you visit Chennai do visit Naganallur area where you can see many temples with unique features and significance."

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Harsha N,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Dry rides - Pathetic, Aqua rides - Good",We visited this place in December and I am completely disappointed with this amusement park. 50% of the rides are poorly maintained/not working. So they should either charge less to the customer based on no of rides or make sure it is working. Aqua rides are good and you can enjoy. Food is pathetic. Request you to plan 1st half or 2nd half so that you can avoid food.

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Md Azharuddin,,,,"This is a very old and famous theme park in Chennai, and I think that's the only reason good number of people still visit it. Reason I rated it low - 1. Staff are very unprofessional and are not interested in operating the rides. Even when asked they give reasons not to operate the rides. Half of the rides were not working.2. Only one restaurant in the park with only a few and horrible options. It almost reminded me of a government hospital or a temple where free food is donated.3. Drinking water was not available anywhere in the park except for entrance and restaurant.Request everyone to provide a genuine feedback rather than exaggerating. "

,,,,,"The universal kingdom has nothing new to offer us. All old rides. No new exciting rides. These rides you can go in fairs.. aqua kingdom is ok ok. The wave pool doesn‚Äôt have waves. Not even periodically. It‚Äôs just a swimming pool with DJ. Water rides queue are very long and okayish. We travelled with small kids under 12. So they enjoyed. But for adults, we won‚Äôt enjoy"
,,,,,"All old riding machines , very poor maintenance , rude behaviour staffs, no clean toilets and worst food. Not advised"
,,,,,Very nice place to spend a weekend . We enjoyed too much . Plan for another visit. Recommended for friends to once visit.
,,,,,"There are two words to sum up this place: dangerous and filthy.The aqua park is full of workers fixing stands whilst people slide down the water slides.  The staircase to the top of the slides is poorly maintained with building rubbish everywhere.   The shower facilities are a disgrace.  The park itself is fairly spead out but many of the dry rides are in a state of repair.  Missing seat belts, broken units etc which would not be allowed in other countries.  Also, very few food choices so come prepared.  We went on a school so crowds were minimal.  People seemed to enjoy themselves but that is India in a nutshell where people are a lot more forgiving. If you are used to western standards I would give this place a miss!"
,,,,,"It's a wonderful experience overall and worth the money spent. Universal Kingdom is full of rides for every age group. Bring your kids if have to give them good experience of all the rides at one place. It's a good place to hangout especially with family and friends . The Aquarium and the Snow Kingdom was super awesome, It is whole new world. They are well maintained, well organized and neat, The aquarium has an underwater tunnel where you can see the fishes and sharks. Has a great collection of unusual fishes, turtles and sting rays. In my opinion one of the best aquariums in India"

The snow world, the water park and other rides are new.  Kids can have fun.  The cost is high, no doubt.  But the next stop on this route is mahabalipuram.  So for kids sake, loitered around.  Some rides bring out the child, some rides are non functional and some rides are crowded.The best part is the Guard.  Make him laugh if you can.  Good for selfies."

No. 1 among all water world / Aqua world where you can enjoy in water pool, sliding through tunnels. There are many gaint wheels, rides what you come across in exhibitions. And also you will find a Roller coaster ride that is the best experience and the most enjoyed by us. But small kids are not allowed for this ride. Food is available inside and out the VGP too. Usually the food is expensive in all such places. Top Gun is another thing that you must try those who love adventures where a large group of people are turned upside down but don't worry it is secure. There are many other things. "

But my main point is that VGP universal kingdom park is tons of fun and you should definitely go there. If you live in chennai, it is ideal because you only have to drive half an hour from there by car ( it is the closest theme park to chennai). Also, it is ideal for kids who are 8 and up. For me, it has been so much fun!!!! I had fun and I loved the rides, I was screaming so bad. but it seems like I am repeating fun over and over again. Anyway, its fun and fun. It is a must go there."

VGP is your get away from the Chennai heat and traffic. It is located near to the beach , which is a plus point considering you are tired out at the end of the day.They have enough dry and wet games & rides you tire you out . I'd recommend the fish pedicure for the ladies. Kids have endless options, honestly they fall asleep tired before the day ends. Again, a plus point üòÅ. The canteen and food sold are reasonably priced, as is the ticket. The water Kingdom inside is my personal favourite. They provide swimming outfit which are cute and the entire water park is covered with people running around in the same coloured outfit. Awesome!!!!!!!! The outfits are budget friendly and the deposit is cheap. Lockers are also available. VGP pretty much is an amazing place to go to in Chennai. At the end of the day, you have memories,fun and a good night sleep."

Locker facility is available for Rs.100, where Rs.70 is returnable. Food is available at high cost. I suggest to go as an one time visit if you want to enjoy this summer with friends and family.."

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Andre G,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,THE WORST THEME PARK I'VE EVER BEEN TO!!!,"Since this was the first time to VGP, I had high expectations .. Sadly, I lost all hopes on reaching this place because of the cleanliness. ZERO!!! cleanliness. On entering the swimming pool I realized that I had made a huge mistake for coming to VGP as there was a lot of sand and moss found in the pool. I also found in many places around the pool that there was alot of slush. One more thing was there was not enough of float rings. I had to stand in a line for about half an hour to get one float ring.Before I got into the pool the staff at the lockers were extremely rude. After standing in a line there was an old man who refused us lockers just because he apparently didn't have change for 500 Rs. He yelled at my wife till i had to intervene and tell him that he had sufficient change that he had collected from other customers but was still stubborn not to give us lockers. I mean when your running a theme park which is known all around the world the least you could do is not give such excuses like this. The way the theme park is run it seems like they are only making tons money but least bothered about customers.Even parks like Kishkintha and Queensland are a lot cheaper than this place but still  more cleaner and more customer oriented. I've been to many theme parks in India and this by far is the worst!!!."

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Blazing Warlord,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Extremely Disappointing Visit,"My personal experience in VGP Universal Kingdom was utterly disappointing. We had taken a leisurely drive to the VGP park to spend a Sunday evening after a sudden decision. The tickets were Rs 550 per person for the land based rides and Aqua Zone together. After entering, we clicked a few pictures with the legendary Statue Man of India.But as we ventured further into the 'Kingdom', we realized that we had made a mistake. Most of the rides were damaged or under renovation. The working rides too were very badly maintained. A few thrill rides including two roller coasters, a swinging ship and a haunted house were the main attractions in the land rides. For the kids, a rotating swing and a cup and saucer ride were all that could be enjoyed. For animal lovers, there is a small petting zoo near the entrance, consisting of a few birds. The Aqua zone was probably a tad bit better, but without proper planning, is not something that can be enjoyed to the fullest. A few water slides and a pool was all there was in the Aqua zone but the water quality was not well maintained and proper attire was not being followed. The food being served in the shops were also not good. The only good thing about the place was the small beach area near the sea, where one can take a leisurely walk. So, on a whole, very disappointed with the experience and I hope that they will take some effort to improve the place."

Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,Valavanur Natar... K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A write up on Mangadu Kamakshi Amman Temple,"The¬†Mangadu Kamakshi Amman Temple¬†in Chennai This hindu temple beileved to be more than 2000  old .It is built in  Chola  Architecture  and style is dedicated to Goddess Kamakshi and Sri Chakram that symbolizes her .I  have  a personal connect with this temple near Kundrathur in Mangadu village from late  60's ,when it was just a quaint dilapidated temple with one  Agraharam .There was hardly anyone visiting this temple in those days .Only a single kala  pooja was being performed  .The compound wall used to have vegetation  growing on it . I remember when I was young,  my family being  ardent followers of Guru Kanchi Mahaperiava , used to go to this temple on weekends, armed with broom, knife,  crowbar and spade to deweed the vegetations, sweep the temple main garbha graham and generally clean  the temple , under the supervision of the main gurukkal.Many in late  60's like my family, started to take cognizance of this temple,only after Kanchi Paramacharya camped in this temple and took great interest in trying to improve this ancient temple .It was due to his efforts that this temple has now become very popular .Devotees are  suggested  to pray for one day chosen by them for six weeks continously for grant of boon by Kamakshi ,for the marriage of their children , prosperity , promotion in their jobs  or for bearing of child .The goddess , it appears has granted their boon , if one were to go  by the rise in popularity of this temple , after  late 70's , which now sports a Rajagopuram with seven tiers filled  great sculptures .There was no Gopuram initially.Once the temple started earning revenue ,the HRCE of TNadu Govt moved in with an office ,to take management control to run it and  improve it in all respects .A family member of mine named  Mr Sunder,  a suptd in HRCE , was appointed as executive officer in later years and he worked hard to raise  this temple upkeep and maintenance by leaps and bounds , providing new facilities for public and soon came to be revognised as ""Mangadu Sundur""to many .Later as advised by Kanchi Maha Periava he worked untiringly to improve the livelyhood of many archakas and their families in many temples spread across tamil Nad , by getting their rightful pay and pensions from the HRCE .He informs that the first Jewelry and the vasthram for the goddess was gifted by Kanchi Maha periava .The term Mangadu means ""Mango Forests or Mango Grooves"" and this temple was built in its midst .This  temple is known as  ""Tapas Kamakshi"" for according to purana it is the place where the goddess performed her penance to re-unite in matrimony with Lord Shiva, performing all 32 types of dharmic rituals .The sthala purana mentions  that, when Lord Shiva and Parvati where in Mount Kailash ,Parvathi playfully closed the eyes of the Lord Shiva and that resulted in  the whole universe falling  into eternal darkness. So the Lord ordained Parvathi  to perform Tapasya.The Goddess came down to this mangrove in Mangadu   and performed penance amidst ""Panch agni"" or five agni kundams .She stood near the central agni kundam keeping her left leg toe in the fire while keeping her right  leg on her left thighs .She kept her left hand on her navel, while holding a japa mala in her right hand over her head.She undertook her deep penance with eyes closed to seek the hand of the  lord. Lord Shiva satisfied with her tapas, then instructs  her to go to Kanchipuram for concluding their marriage.Soon after the goddess leaves  this Mangadu  place, the heat of the agni  she created created ,became unbearable for everone living in the vicinity .Adi Sankarar who installed all the Sankara Madams in India ,seeing the plight of the people in his meditation , visited  this Mangadu and installed a ""Sri Ardhameru Chakram"" at the place where shakthi did her penance,  to quench the heat of the Agni and at the same time transform  the place to a soothing and sacred  one for all to pray.This Sri Chakra he installed  has 43 Thrikonas or triangles and is made up  of 8 herbals called Astagandams.The base is of koorma or tortoise design with 3 steps above .Over this base are 16 lotus petals and again over this there are 8 more petals . The top of this petal base is drawn the Sri Chakra , which is the largest among all in temples across tamil Nad . It is usually clad in 9 yards saree..Daily poojas are conducted to this ""Sri Chakram"" in the¬†sanctum Sanctorum of the temple and this Chakra is considered to be a Tantric form of the Goddess herself ""This Ardhameru Sri Chakram""  is considered as the supreme divinity of this temple and only sandal or  Kumkum  archana is performed with no abhishekam  as it is  made up of herbs.On Vijayadasami day of Navarathiri it is provided with a gold kavacham and on other days it has silver kavachams The Shrine of ""Tapas Kamakshi"" in this temple  was installed at the behest of Kanchi Paramacharya in addition to  existing Sun god . The devotees to this temple offer worship to four Ambikas or goddess in four forms  - The Sri Chakra mentioned above - The Adhi kamakshi in panchalokha    holds a parrot in her right hand and     the moon crescent on her head -  Lordess kamakshi doing penance     among the five agni  kundams- The lamp near the Adhi Kamakshi    reverred as Ambhika or lordess    herself.The temple also has a shrine for Ganapati  to the left of the main entrance .I conclude my article, that after doing a pooja on fridays for six weeks ,in this temple in 1976 ,I got my first   senior corporate job in Pune ."
Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,Madhavi A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,The idol of Mangadu Amman has a green stone in her crown.,"I have been visiting Mangadu Kamakshi Amman temple since 1979. I go there on a Thursday, when I am in Chennai. Either using a hire car or Ola, it is an easy access and takes around 30 minutes to reach there from Adyar - early in the morning.it is a beautiful temple arranged in a traditional way - but I believe it gets crowded on special days with separate queues. I usually go there when it is quiet and am able to appreciate the inner sanctum sanctorum and the outer areas (to walk around). I am especially enamored by the Brass metal figurine of Amman standing on one leg and conducting penance. She signifies strength, perseverance and determination to me."

Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,saranyaupendaran,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Wonderful temple but poorly managed,"Mangadu TempleMangadu Kamakshi amman temple is a 2000 year old temple located in Mangadu, about  24 kms from Chennai city close to Kundrathur.   It has a beautiful seven tiered gopuram and a divine idol of mother Kamakshi in the sanctum sanctorum along with a very rare Maha meru Chakra believed to have been installed by Adi Shankara himself.    The temple sees a constant inflow of devotees as the goddess is believed to bless unmarried people who visit her with a suitable partner at an early date.   The temple is also associated with the planet Venus and is therefore called a Sukra sthalam in tamil.  Open from 6am to 1.30pm and 3.30pm to 9.30pm thereafter, the temple remains open throughout the day on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.   It is a common sight to see wedding parties bring in the sacred wedding coconut and mangalsutra to be blessed by the goddess before having the mangalsutra tied around the bride‚Äôs neck by the groom  in the temple premises . The wedding group then partakes of lunch in a nearby hotel after this simple, cost-saving and effective ceremony before dispersing.  There are special tickets for entry, priced at Rs.50/- and Rs.20/- respectively, in addition to free darshan queues.   The narrow doorways are divided into three lanes using ropes for these three separate lines, and there seems to be no special entry offered to the elderly and disabled.  Avoid Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays, along with other auspicious muhurtham days when visiting the temple in order to avoid long lines.   Alternately, plan a visit very early in the morning around 6.30am if you need to visit on an auspicious day.The first impression one gets of the temple itself is that it needs better management and could be cleaner, particularly in view of the huge crowds that visit and the large hundi collections.   The temple tank is dry and rampantly overgrown with weeds, while the large platform abutting it is unkept and messy.  It could be a wonderful resting place for weary pilgrims with the right facilities, and scenic looking if the tank is maintained well with trees and plants around .  There are no proper seating areas for the elderly and disabled.   The area around the temple also could be better maintained, as parking is unruly and haphazard and vendors and litter are found everywhere.  Moreover stall vendors and the temple staff manning entry into the lines also collude to allow visitors entry on the payment of a small gratification outside the temple, denying the temple its just revenues.   As with most temples in India, there are plenty of favoured visitors who are ushered in by staff and priests, bypassing queues and walking confidently upto the sanctum sanctorum, while the rest of us curse under our breath while standing in line.Do look out for the niche Subramanya enroute to the sanctum sanctorum, the Adi Shankara idol and the tapasvi Kamakshi on your way out, along with the beautiful Kalabairavar and the idol of Lord Surya.  Mangadu was a mangrove forest originally, and hence the name, where  Goddess Parvathi undertook rigorous penance before marrying Lord Shiva in Kancheepuram, according to the temple legend.Mangadu temple can be visited along with other temples in the vicinity such as the Kundrathur Murugan temple, the Thiruverkadu Mariamman temple which is about 7 kms away, and the Vedapureeswarar temple, in about half a day.   The roads leading to these temples are pot-holed and traffic-ridden, and you need to factor in extra travel time when planning a visit.   Google maps are very helpful during navigation.  Carry water and snacks with you, as there are no proper eateries along the route.  A small vegetarian hotel on the Mangadu temple main street , Balaji Bhavan, serves tiffin and beverages ."
Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,yy m,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Old habits die hard,"Visited this temple for the first time last week with elderly parent and a small child.My experience : Poor guidance from temple employees about where to find the free darshan entrance.We were asked to go through the whole loop of queuing area even though there were hardly anybody ,approximately 10 people 2) When asked to accept the Saree and perform archana for the deity ,the priest were very rude asking me to Ho back and get the coconuts broken before entering the sanctum Santorum or moolavar.3) All the while the priest kept muttering abuse how people don't know the procedures....The Saree was finally taken and draped on the mahameru.As I said even though there were less than 10 devotees we were ushered out in seconds.I came round twice to get proper and satisfactory darshan of Ambal .If you are like me living in virtual reality it was a wake up call as to the prevalence of caste discrimination in front of parabrahmam ,in this day and age.I can see why Dravidian movement is still active in Tamilnadu and can also see how it took root.Nothing wrong with the god per se,but an unpleasant experience overall."

Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,akhilchandu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Nice temple,"Kamakshi Amman Temple is linked to the story of Lord Shiva and Goddess Shakthi (Parvathi). Both of them were sitting in their garden on Mount Kailash when Devi playfully closed the eyes of Lord Shiva with her hands. Instantly, the whole of creation fell into eternal darkness. The goddess craved Shiva's pardon and he asked her to go down to earth to undertake a severe penance. She came to the mango grove, Maangadu and began her penance by standing with her left leg on Panchagni (five fires) and folding the right leg at the left knee. Her left hand can be seen raised above her head, holding a japamala (prayer beads). This image can be seen in Mangadu Kamakshi Amman Temple as Tapas Kamakshiamman.¬†Shiva was pleased and asked her to go with him to Kanchi to celebrate their marriage. She left the place immediately without extinguishing the fire. As a result, the whole area suffered from unbearable heat for a long time. Sri Adi Sankara of Kaladi came here and installed the rare Sri Ardhameru Chakram (a spiritual geometrical patterned device) and extinguished the fire."

It is located in the historic city of Kanchipuram, near Chennai, India and is popularly associated with Sankaracharya, one of the greatest Hindu gurus. The Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, the Akilandeswari temple in Thiruvanaikaval near Tiruchirappalli and this Kamakshi are the important centers of worship of Parvati as the mother goddess, in the state of Tamil Nadu. The temple was most probably built by the Pallava kings, whose capital was Kanchipuram, around 6 C.E.The main deity, Kamakshi, is seated in a majestic Padmasana, an yogic posture signifying peace and prosperity, instead of the traditional standing pose. The goddess holds a sugarcane bow and bunch of flowers in the lower two of her arms and has a pasha (lasso), an ankusha (goad) in her upper two arms. There is also a parrot perched near the flower bunch. There are no other Parvati temples in the city of Kanchipuram, apart from this temple, which is unusual in a traditional city that has hundreds of traditional temples. There are various legends that account for this fact. One of them according to Kamakshivilasa is that the Goddess had to absorb all the other shakthi forms to give a boon to Kama, the Hindu god of love.[1] Another legend attributes it to the Raja Rajeswari pose of the deity that signifies an absolute control over the land under the deity's control.[2] Legend has it that Kamakshi offered worship to a Shivalingam made out of sand, under a mango tree and gained Shiva's hand in marriage.Adi Shankaracharya, the famous 8th-century CE scholar and saint, established the Sri Chakra in this Kamakshi Devi temple in the trough-like structure in that shrine. This Sri Chakra soon became the All India famous Kamakoti Peeta. The Acharya's Lalitha Trishati Bhashya comments Kamakoti Peetam as Sri Chakra."

Spread over an area of over 1.5 acres, the temple is constructed on five levels. There is a 7,000¬†sq¬†ft temple hall on the first floor, an auditorium for cultural and spiritual programmes on the ground floor and a prasadam hall in the basement.In the temple hall, there are three teak-wood altars which house the deities. The deities have been sourced from Jaipur and Odisha.Designed under the guidance of Sri Bhanu Swami, the temple has imbibed various attributes from Vedic¬†scripture and is inspired by the Pallava and Kalinga architecture.¬†The entrance to the temple is marked by a representation of the universe or the bhu-mandala on marble floor. According to the cosmology of ancient Vedic puranas, the universe is described as series of circular islands surrounding a central pillar called Mount Meru. The design on the floor at the entrance depicts the same universal pattern. There is also a life-like statue of a cow feeding its calf at the portico.The primary purpose of the temple to transform the material self-centred identity into a spiritual identity of unconditional love is graphically represented by means of a magnificent chandelier that projects various colours on the walls and ceiling. The chandelier has 500 Himalayan quartz crystals supposedly meant to intensify the spiritual energy in the temple. The temple also visually displays various vastu shastra features. A booklet explaining all these features is available at the book shop, which is located near the portico."

When I was there, breakfast was to start at 10.30 am, which is very late indeed. I had to walk about 10 minutes to get to a veg food place at the beginning of Bhakti Vedanta Street. Guest house needs some upkeep too- linen and sheets were clean, and fan was working. Washroom could have been cleaner, hot water was not available, AC in the room was not working at that time.

It took about 20 minutes to get the entry tickets. Heck, the ticket counter did not provide any information on the Ticket Options. Note, You would have to pay Rs.25 for cell phone if you wish to take photos with them. We took Zoo Round or whatever name they want to call it for Rs.100. They would take you around the zoo in a Golf Cart. They would stop at few places and let you down. Its best suited for elders. If you are with a kid, choose cycles which can be hired inside the zoo. They also have the Lion & Deer 'Safari' which was a just a waste of time depending on your luck!We first went by Golf Cart and saw the routes and familiarised with the location as the place was extensive. We then went to hire the cycle and went around the park as well. If you want to hire the cycles, please do so by 11:00 else expect huge waiting time as they have limited cycles only. Charges for Cycle was Rs. 30 per hour. Child ( less than 3 years ) they provide with a child seat fixed on front. They also have electric scooter charged at Rs. 90 per hour. They DEMAND a Security Deposit of Rs. 500 for two cycles which was given back! Over all, its better to take Electric Scooter, if unavailable take the Cycle. The food joints was pathetic. Bad enough, You cannot bring your own food as well. However, somehow few other smuggled them which made me wonder how could they do it? Anyway, the food was pathetic. They have drinking water around the park though I would refrain from drinking from them. Water bottles were available. If you are with a kid, better have some snacks and bring it in a box and not in the plastic cover. Inform at entrance as they would allow. Else, you have to deposit it with them. Oh! The animals, well, its to your luck. You can see most of them. However, if the park is crowded, expect animals to take shelter. I felt bad for the Elephant. It was chained and made to stand under scorching sun. Overall, Way lower than Tiruvandram Zoo or Mangalore Zoo. If you havent been to any of those, you would enjoy."

I thought that's the procedure.. (Since i am riding first time to lion safari don't know the procedure )After the safari finished driver took me Rs. 400 for 4 adults. (But non of other passengers paid to him). Then only o realized that the driver taking the money directly from the people and keeping it in the pocket.. If this is the practice then imagine how much money will the earn everyday.. (I hope they get the monthly salary ). If this mal practice continues then the zoo revenue will go down and we have to take out this kind of practice from the staff.. Secondly we tried having food in Tamilnadu hotel inside the zoo. Went 5:10 pm in the evening approx. By seeing menu in the notice board i asked for chilly chicken then the cashier told all this menu now not available.. Fare enough.. But then they should not display in menu board and to keep in cashier counter.. At least they should keep the available menu only written on menu board.. When i ask this to the cashier(On his face full of pimples were there No Name batch was fixed. Couldn't take the name) he replied that it's our wish, we keep the food, erase the food, we sell the food or we don't sell the food. Shocked by his answer.. Because i am basically a hotelier from hospitality background.. If at all you are not a kind to people at least you should respect the job and know ur limit.. If you have staff like this will the hotel get revenue?? Because you get different different people from the world everyday.. You may not get the same guest everyday. But the experience at your hotel matters.. This all my observation and wanna to get to the Aringar Anna Zoo - Vadalur Zoo management notice.. Thanks.. "
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Shubhi06,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-19,I would recommend it !,"One of the better zoos I have visited in India, full of big cats and reptiles and birds. It is spread in a wide area enclosing parts of natural habitat and a shallow lake. It becomes particularly chirpy during winter migratory season when numerable birds arrive. It boasts few mating centers for big animals as well.They provide bicycle on rent to explore inside. One can bring their food (not in plastic) and enjoy a picnic day. Only tic is if you have a mobile and it has a camera, you will be charged for it."

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,It's far away from city but must for children,"Zoo park in Chennai is very far from city. It too long. There was a local  train route. It was too hectic trip. We bought all the snacks outside. They are taking so much care about the environment. They don't allow even the biscuit packet covers and chips packets covers or any other packet covers. But it's a wrong idea I felt. We had to put all the chips, biscuits in a newspaper. So don't carry more if you don't need. Because if there any things remaining all go waste.Once you enter inside book electric vehicle. Otherwise you will have to walk long and lose all your energy in especially if it is a hot summer. There is long queue for electric vehicle ticket counter. Coming to animals, there many varieties. But we lost interest because we had been with elderly people and missed the station as we had been here for the first time by train. Everything went wrong. So it was not a great experience as we already had seen many zoo parks. But small kids enjoyed. "

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Thia M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-19,Elephant on Chains,"I took my children there yesterday. We all very sad to see that an elephant chained to tree. It was all by itself and clearly under a lot of distress as it rocked back and forth and whipped the chain around. The area it is kept in is large but has no fence or moat to keep the elephant in. This needs to change. Elephants are extremely emotional, intelligent, social animals, and chaining them to tree alone is incompletely inhumane. I really hope they make changes to this. All of the other animals seemed to have free range of appropriate size enclosures."

No plastic containers. Looks like time needed to walk around will be less than 2-3 hrs for all. I felt the lake inside was filled with Algae - post monsoon effect. Extreme end zone containing fox was quite dry and needs cleaning. Rest is very nice. I can compare it with european experience of well laid path ways, clean directions. Bit stinking aquarium. Odd experience was the food shops i found in two places, looks like a loot with sub standard stuff."

Because of this,all the battery cars and safari vehicles were already fully booked..And we had to walk throughout the park...We were a group of 6adults  and 6 small kids...we were told that we were not allowed to bring any snacks or food..so we went with only water...but after going inside,we saw that many of them had brought food and snacks...it's not a problem for adults,as there are snacks counters near butterfly park,tea,aavin ice-cream booth etc.,But if you are going with kids,make sure you have something for them  to eat.Because it took us Almost 5hrs for us to walk and cover the park,so we had to skip lunch...You can't cut short and go the exit halfway..But they do have almost all animals and colourful birds to excite the kids...We saw lions, tigers, white tigers, hippopotamus,otters, elephants,a giraffe,a zebras,snakes,,and lots of different kinds of monkeys and colourful birds..there is an aquarium too...but we were too tired to check it out..So if you want to show real animals to your kids,this is a great place...but remember not to go on a public holiday,..(I think it opens by 10am)and book a battery car and safari jeep...and take plenty of water with you..."

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Q01635,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,UK visitor - WORST ZOO - AVOID,"Where do I start, maybe with a positive, at 50 Rs each it's the cheapest Zoo I've been to. You need to pay for phones if you want to take pictures, there really isn't anything to take pictures of, so that's a moot point.Sad and pretty dilapidated in general, (animals have reasonable space, I'm not anti zoo). Went to aquarium first, about 20 small fish tanks with dirty glass/water, really the carp at an average UK garden centre is a better display than this.Things didn't get better when we used the toilets, we paid 10Rs each, I've no real problem with paying (although it's odd when you pay to come in already) but if you do pay, a nice experience is expected, nasty wet dirty toilets.Typically you would look at the zoo map to see where to go, indeed there is a map, on a nice big board, but unreadable due to sun damage. Lots of staff, about 4 or 5 organising lion safaris (needs 1 at most), 3 guys in nasty aquarium, so lack of staff is not an issue, it just seems that they do not understand how nice a zoo can be.If you really have nothing better to do and you do visit, pay the extra for the lion safari, it's a bit sad with a handful of lions but the best of a very very bad lot.If the proprietor reads this, I suggest you visit some foreign zoo (any country will do!) to see how zoos can be, yours is pretty sad attempt."

Also there are variety of birds including emu, ostrich, macau, peacock, phesant, etc. So colorful and chirpy.

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,ChicLifeByte,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A massive zoo which is a must attend for kids as well as photography enthusiasts!,"With my key interest towards Wildlife and animals, a visit to the zoo is always on my agenda whichever city I visit. Spread across a huge area, the famous Chennai zoo houses 160 species of insects, birds and animals. One can spot crocodiles, blackbuck, lion-tailed macaque, panthers, peacocks, lions, hyenas, jaguars and much more. The place is huge, hence I recommend taking the safaris to save time and energy. There are different safaris available at this park including a lion safari and a deer safari, for which there are different costs based upon the age of a person. My recommendation is the Lion Safari in which they actually take you inside a restricted area where lions roam. If you would like to explore the zoo on your own, then you can rent a bicycle during the start of the tour so that you don‚Äôt exhaust yourself walking. Also at the zoo is a library, where one can know about the living environment and the habitat of these animals. Perfect for families who want to showcase different animals to their kids, the place is also a must visit for photography enthusiasts."

There are some impressive animals there, there are also plenty of animals with very little space. The public areas are baron and unkempt which is not usual for India but the animals appear to be well cared for generally.There appeared to be plenty of refreshment stands around for visitors.If in Chennai this is worth a visit but it is not worth travelling that far for.Saltwater crocodiles the most impressive for me..."

And battery car would cost 100 per person per hour. The place is really huge, and waking the entire distance could be very tiring , if not impossible . Cycles are also available for a cost of 15 per cycle per hour. The zoo has animals like elephant , lion, tiger , zebra , giraffe , leopard, bear, snake and crocodile park, and also many birds. There is also a butterfly park , which is not well maintained . There are few food stalls inside. And outside food is not allowed. There is a huge parking space, but again weekends could be crowded.

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,rrumakanthan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,A Good Zoo,"-We visited (with a 2 year old kid) during the second week of March, and the Chennai summer heat is picking up and hence start early and finish before noon.-This park is very large and spread out and hence it is difficult to walk around and see all the animals. Bicycles are available on rent (very reasonable cost) and even with bicycles it could be difficult to see a large area in Chennai heat.( may be November to  February will be a comfortable weather to walk around) - The best I will say is Tigers (about 7 ) and one White Tiger .This is better than Singapore and London Zoo . Lions are also good ( three, one Lion and two Lioness) when we went. These are housed in a large open enclosure.-There are Cheetas,    Hippos, Giraffes, Orangutans, Otters, A small and nice aquarium with small fish , well kept are housed in the zoo .  A large water birds enclosure with plenty of water fowls, Peacocks, Monkeys Crocodile, Bison, Deers, Snakes (a large number of Pythons are kept here) are also housed here. Many are housed in open enclosures-.The best way to see the zoo comfortably is to take the buggy (Rs 100 per person ) and takes about an hour . The driver will stop in important spots ( Tigers, Lions, Hippos, Aquarium, Snake House etc) to see the animals without having to walk a long distance between each other. If possible start the visit by first taking the Buggy trip. The Zoo opens at 9 am and the first buggy trip starts at 930 am. Each Buggy takes about 12 persons or so. There is a comfortable seating place to wait to take the Buggy trip..  - The Zoo is reasonably clean, though the car parking and surrounding areas are not kept clean and should be improved. Continuous manual sweeping is being carried out inside the zoo area to keep it reasonably clean.- Covered seating areas are available inside the Zoo to relax in between.  -  As informed everywhere, plastic packaging is not allowed inside the zoo and bags are checked at the entrance. You can take eatables in metal and other non disposable containers and water in non plastic containers. Children food is allowed to be taken.Week ends have many visitors and week days are not crowded as per the information. (number of visitors increase after 11 am ) .-It could take about an hour  to drive down to the zoo from the Chennai city when you start at about 730 am or so.  ."

Parking is adequate though if you are late you have to park at least 1 km away. Worst part is there is no pick up and drop service and you are left at the mercy of local Auto rickshaws.There are 2 ways to explore the park, we can either hire a buggy or we can walk down. Thanks to heavy tree cover we decided to walk down and did not regret it a bit. This gives you freedom to spend as much time as want inside the Zoo. We did take good breaks and were adequately hydrated. Animals were ok, most of them were well maintained and compared to other Zoo's in India abundant space was available for the animals. Majority of the enclosures were not cramped. All in all my kid enjoyed the day out and so did we. Not sure how our experience would have been if the day had been hotter!"

Lots of animal to witness and good things end here.Plan properly, never visit on weekends. It's 5km walk around zoo and with Chennai weather ,you will be drained out and with elders or children it's going to be big issue.so next option is battery car or some safari,wait you will not be assured and its not available all the time. they stop if they want. In counter if you ask any clarification or suggestions,you will be met with not so friendly staff.I went inside the zoo and then I was told safari was available and was asked to go outside to counter to buy tickets, which I did.But why on Earth I should walk again to counter, can't they provide inside or can't  they give it in counter itself in first place.So it's pure luck if you get any vehicle. One suggestion plan it in morning when zoo opens, my friends told me after my disappointed trip."

We visited the library during summer vacation and could make it only the Children's section and not to all the 9 floors due to paucity of time. The children's section had a good collection of books along with reading area for kids. Kids can read the books there itself and children's books are not rented to be taken out. The children can read as many books as they want and can spend almost the whole day there as there is a huge collection of books. School children volunteer on weekends / holidays to sort out, categorize and arrange the books properly.There is a canteen in the library campus, though it is little far behind the library building. The library is maintained better compared to other government establishments. However, the canteen needs better maintenance and air conditioning, as it gets very hotter during the summer.The overall campus is very good with very little to complain about. Since it was a long weekend on summer holidays, many of the services like Aavin parlour, ATMs, snacks & soft drinks delivery kiosks inside the library building were not working."

The idea was to establish this park, primarily to maintain and display captive collection of various species of snakes and other reptiles endemic to our native area and to kindle public interest in them while prompting the them to empathize with these reptiles and protecting them thereby our eco system itself .The main focus was to attract school children primarily to show all aspects of reptiles with the actual live species on display in order to aid research and understanding all about these reptiles in nature . It was also to dispell the notion that they are dangerous to humans and therefore has to be killed if they come close to human habitat .Going by the fact that this park over the years has been attracting 7 to 8 lakh visitors , in a year mostly school children, I must say this venture is a great success in promoting the ecology .The park produces adequate revenue by way of gate collection to maintain it in good standard .The park boasts of a huge collection of an assorted variety of 23 different snakes including adders, pythons, vipers, cobras and other reptiles housed with glass frontage .The crocodiles and large lizards are kept inOpen air enclosure that is well protected from public using parapet wall with mesh .Half a dozen turtles including black variety ,a few Tortoise Star variety included ,spotted rock gecko,and Asian chameleons completes the reptiles on display ."

So just for the experience went with family, although a call taxi would've been cheaper and straight-forward for the same destination.  For single journey we got tokens. At the entry station we scan the token at gate, and at the exit station the gate swallows the token. The metro train itself was standing two floors above ground, reached via escalators.  At first we were confused because the train door did not open, and there were no buttons on the door to open it.  Another passenger explained that doors are closed until the last few minutes in order to save air-condition.  So, three minutes before the train starting time the doors opened automatically and we entered the refrigerator-cold compartment.The station and the train were clean and well-maintained.  The commute was mostly above the ground on a bridge, which was interesting. I can see how much Chennai has evolved in the past many years.  Metro is very much a welcome relief, at least for the sake of fresh, cool, clean and safe public transport around the city."

The Chennai international airport and its runways too are nice sight to view from this height, especially when planes take off and pass just above St Thomas Mount.

Many years of supreme and divine blessings continue to pour. and we moved towards Lord Shiva. then we had tied red sacred thread. then we had dharshan of Muruga and came out. within the vicinity of Lord Siddhi vinayagar sannidhi and murugan sannidhi. Then after we could see the golu infront of Virat brhama. beautiful golu was arranged and ayyappa predominantly occupied the rows. we also saw the Kalikaambal urchavar. we also took the blessings of prityangira devi before we complete our rounds.  one has to visit this temple in their life time. but the street was narrow and very difficult to find the parking for cars of course two wheeler no issue. you will somehow find the space"
Kalikambal_Temple,Valavanur Natar... K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A WRITE UP ON KALAKAMBAL TEMPLE GEORGE TOWN PARRYS CORNER CHENNAI,"The famous Kalikambal temple is located on Thambu Chetty street,  in george town now more known as Parry's corner. The name Parry's corner came about due to √æthe presence of an old company called M/S EID Parry & Company established in 1787, by  Thomas Parry ,  a Welsh merchantThis multistorey building was the corporate headquarters  of this company . This building called ""Dare House"" stands in the the corner of NSC Bose Road and First line beach Road  abutting both the roads and is  opposite to Madras high court .The  Murugappa group now owns it .Now coming back to Kalikambal temple that is located in Thambu Chetty street that perhaps derived its name from Thambu Chetty,  a merchant who worked  with the British as a Dubash.The first Hindu temples of British Madras were built  during the period of 1640 to 1680 in this neighbourhood  The prominent  merchants of the city, mostly dubashes (middlemen) of British merchants and business establishments donated liberally for building these temples .In fact several of the streets in the neighbourhood also came to be  named after these dubashes.Apart from this famous temple this street is also the main retail market for Hardware, ceramic tiles and sanitary ware.The temple was originally located closer to the sea shore in the vicinity of Fort St George and  was relocated to the current site at 1640¬†AD. and was  re built  by MuthuMari Achari in True Tamilian  Architecture abd completed iIn  1678 .This temple is dedicated to Hindu goddess  Shri Kali Kambal (Lordess Sakthi ) and Lord Kamateshwarar (Shiva).The temple has separate sannadhis for Ganesha and Prathyankara .On the 1st May of every year since 1985 , Sri Kalikambal Kodai  summer  Abhishekam is performed from 10AM to 1PM  to the Goddess by Kodai Maha Abhisheham committee praying for enough rains during the year all over the country.History tells us that The great Maratta leader Shivaji Maharaj,   the founder of the Hindawi-Swarajya in the 17th century, had worshiped in this temple incognito on 3rd October 1667.Initially the idol of Kali the Godess was in  a very  fierce form  and for reasons unknown,   this fierce form was replaced with a calmer form like shanta swaroopi resembling the  Goddess Kamakshi.The Maha kumbabishekam of this Sri Kalikambal  took place on Wednesday, January 23. 2013 .with thoudands  of devotees gathered to witness the consecration of the Rajagopuram and the vimanam of the Moolavar by the head  priests belonging to the  The Sivacharyar Trust .The first phase of the consecration took place on January 17. Grandeur marked everything associated with the occasion and the  highlight of this kumbaabhisekham was flowers were  showered from a helicopter even as  abhisekham was being carried out to  the kalasams.About 25,000 people were fed free  after the kumbabishekam. Food was served to the inmates of orphanages and homes for destitutes in the city as well by the trust.The Sivacharyar Trust who runs the temple , in fact is also engaged in several social welfare activities such as distribution of clothes, text books, medicine, etc. The physically disabled are provided with appropriate vehicles and the poor are helped with marriage expenses."

Marundeeswarar_Temple,Myo M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Two front gates! :),"What sets this temple apart from all other Hindu temples in the city is its two successive (as in a ""column"" going into the temple grounds if you view from outside) front gates, whereas there's only one front gate at all the other temples I got to.  And I don't know if the reason for the two front gates is because of the two tomb (shrine) buildings on the temple grounds inside, maybe there are two deities of ""equal significance"" here (with a tomb building for each of the two) and therefore two front gates (one for each of the two), but as a non-Hindu that's only my ""thought"" as to the reason for the two front gates.  The passageway between the two gates is also fairly wide (not a narrow passageway) with paintings on the ceiling and carvings on the pillars, so I figured it was the Marriage Hall since all big Hindu temples seem to have got one of those (I'm quite sure a Marriage Hall is an essential part of a Hindu temple).  Also, on the right side of the back area of the temple grounds is a tree with a little fence around it, and I saw some people circling around it likely for some religious reason.There's no admission fee here, but similar to Kapaleeswarar (Chennai's most famous temple) further north, there's a ""photo fee"" here as well; I paid 50 rupees for it.By public transportation, the nearest bus depot is Thiruvanmiyur (1A & A1 buses get there that I know of, but I'm sure there are many others too since it's a fairly big station), and it's a short walk south from there to the Temple."

This is saddening for many reasins but especially as it all washes out to our shared oceans.There were positives...seeing hoof, paw and footprints in the sand, bubbles blowing by, the stunning blue skyscape and the vendors were not pushy.There is activity and vibrancy of a different place and time - fishermen, cattle wandering along the sand, fairy floss and icecream (Kwality Wall's) sellers, pony rides (no dstails on cost or service sorry), bubble -blower vendors, rows of multi coloured chairs, concrete cricket pitch, people swimming fully clothed.If you are in Chennai it is worth a visit but my tips are wear sandals, really watch your step and look before you sit."

Elliot_s_Beach,Puneetkumar Pattar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Its more or less Besant nagar beach housing the Elliots memorial,"Elliots beach is mostly the Besant nagar beach itself. This portion of the beach that hosts the elliots memorial is called elliots beach (named after Edward Elliot, onetime chief magistrate and superintendent of police, Madras). As I have noted in my review on Bessie, Besant nagar beach is one of the most happening places in Chennai, especially considering the mushrooming of a large number of restaurants along the beach. The beach itself used to be a nice and quiet place some two years ago. However, it has turned into an overcrowded place, especially in the recent few months. Still, it is one of the best locations to spend an evening or take a walk in the morning. The road that runs along the beach hosts a large number of eateries, and the beach itself has a large number of hawkers/street food. Marina doesn't have restaurants (but has hawkers) while Thiruvamiyur doesn't have either (available but in a very low number). So, this beach continues to pull a lot of crowd."

Growing crowds is something out of our control. However, what made the local corporation authorities permit the scores of bunk shops to be located on the beach. They are not only positively ugly but also encourage the public to dump plastic and other waste food products on the sand. Hygiene is another casualty as the food waste attracts flies and mosquitoes. Such an avoidable matter but the government authorities just don't seem to care."

We played in the water and after an hour decided to take leave. We did try spring potato chips. It was good. We prefer the vendors more towards the road than near the beach. They were better, more neat. The beach itself has heavy footfall, you may see a lot of trash generated. I wish people were better educated and dump trash near the bins. The municipal guys also do not seem to clear trash regularly. A few bins were over flowing. One was altogether missing. Overall a ""decent"" beach to spend time. Good coffee joints along the road.

Government_Museum,Wil Chung,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Mixture of great and awful,"Visited here solo to take in more of Indian and Tamil life. The museum is made up of a number of buildings each with their own unique galleries. The cost for foreigners is 250 (Indians is just 15). I understand a ""tourist tax"" but the multiple is huge!The good first - bronze exhibits, stone sculptures and contemporary arts were gorgeous. Whilst pretty much everything else was terrible. The natural history exhibits were very old and not really well looked after, whilst the children's museum is pretty laughable (see picture of Indian costumes)It is a good way to spend some time in Chennai, I was just expecting more. Not angry, just disappointed."

Government_Museum,1777NT,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-19,A typical dull drab Indian Museum,"From the far north of India to the deep south and everywhere in between there a dull drab poorly maintained crumbling buildings purporting to be marvellous museums. The general trend (and I have been coming to India since 1982) is to have little to no illumination, poor signage, glass cases that haven't been cleaned for decades. Nothing to try to attract visitors.The Chennai Government Museum was terrible, construction work going on all over the site, some excavated trenches that had clearly been open for years, filthy inside the building, a large percentage of it ""closed for renovation""  - by the look of it, for the last ten years.  No refreshment facilities, no information for visitors, a few staff asleep on stools scattered around this dire failure, and NO air-conditioning, which incidentally is useful for exhibits as well as visitors.  The system is obviously in need of serious financial input, a good way to start is to have suitable money raising add-ons, like restaurants, souvenir shops, rather than rip-off the foreigners with the disgusting system of charging them considerably more than locals.  Hope British Cathedrals/Museums latch on to that gimmick !!It's a disgrace that such a valuable collection of Cholla Bronzes are impossible to see."

We were told that they would close in half an hour right after they sold us the tickets. There is absolute chaos in the complex. Everything is in serious repair and there are no signboards. It is appropriate to keep it closed while repairs are in progress.
Government_Museum,Richard7,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Night at the Museum,"I love museums. If you don't like museums, then this is not the best place to start. I walked from Thousand Lights metro station so was pretty hot when I arrived. Most exhibition halls are not air-conditioned but they have a few fans. I was going to start with the bronzes, but the power was off, and it was pitch black in there. The main section had some windows but it was still pretty gloomy until the lights came on. By now I was ready for more macabre, and the moth-eaten stuffed animals did not disappoint. Take your kids to the Childrens Museum, inside the (airconditioned!) hall there are models of dissected animals and body parts. Elsewhere I found a cabinet with human skulls and best (worst!) of all, a wooden device used for human sacrifice. If you are looking for something else, you may find it in the eclectic cabinets. Some things are pretty shabby, but if you go with an open mind and a bit of imagination, you'll have a good day."

Government_Museum,Ronan P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-19,"Some wonderful collections, housed in a poor setting","The artefacts held in the museum are astonishing ,but they are housed in a way which gives concern for the future.The rooms were hot, with fans here and there, but the heat and the humidity are both things which modern museums seek to avoid. The buildings are vast, and filled with treasures. It is, in many ways, what traditional museums used to be before they went all high-tech and interactive. But the content (aside from a few rather horrid examples of old-school taxidermy) is fabulous. The collections of Hindu sculptures is fantastic. Having looked at similarly dated examples in Europe, the Indian statues are far more sophisticated. Incredible objects are found in profusion, but there could be more explanation.Having said that, the buildings (there are several) were filled with ordinary Indian families, who all seemed to be having a good time.I'm really glad I saw the collections.My favourite items were some artefacts from the Indus Valley civilisation, a wonderful little bronze Mother Goddess figure, and some huge copper plate collections of legal documents on gigantic rings, showing a way of keeping vital deeds and contracts in a climate where paper documents, or most other media, would perish."
Government_Museum,Krishnaveni S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Amusing museum but needs maintenance,"It is a vast museum. We saw the main building with various sections inside. There is stone sculptures belonging to various era. The zoology section has skeleton of whale which makes you feel as if you are inside it's stomach. There is sections of reptiles, birds and mammals. It is really well maintained. We also went to the children's section, which has dolls representing various states and also many countries. A walk through prehistoric times to various civilization is very enlightening. Some of the things in the science section is not maintained and doesn't work. Even the playground needs lots of maintenance.We went to the building having the stamp and coins collection. Learnt  lots of thingsWe were very tired by then and skipped the archaeological section. I really wish there was a canteen in the museum complexOn the whole I recommend every one to go there with their kids"
Government_Museum,JPHStVincent,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,a place that is hard to rate,"It is very hard to give an overall rating, some aspects of the museum deserve a 5, others deserve a 1. There is a superb collection of stone carvings and a wonderful collection of bronzes, but the way that they are displayed leaves so much to be desired. At lot of the stone carvings, statues and more, are just in a room, pretty much any how. Some effort has been put into the bronzes, but not enough. Some of the historic sections of the buildings are in desperate need of repair. Work is currently going on, and a number of galleries are closed, but most of the effort seems to be directed towards laying drains in the grounds. This could be a really great museum, but it needs a curator with a vision and (most of all) a decent budget. That said, I would always go back for another visit!"
Government_Museum,bjerkseth,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo, Beautiful treasures in terrible environment ,"I had so looked forward to see the Government Museum in Chennai, which houses antiquities, a zoological section, etc. one can see that the buildings are pretty old, should not be surprised to hear they are from the time of the British. There are virtually hundreds of statues from various time periods, and from Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Wonderful work in stone. Everything is a terrible setting, either they lack money or the curator does not have a clue. The settings are very old, at times destroyed. Light fixtures are placed close to the Art, so when you want to take a photo, it‚Äôs impossible to do a good one without getting a light fixture on top. Labeling is also very badly placed. Background colors are not attractive, plywood in many rooms, which was at times broken. I was super disappointed, and the Government needs to act fast in order to get the Museum up to standard; such a wonderful collection, some of them in old-fashioned, dusty cabinets. Continuing in to the section with stuffed animals. May be good for school children. For others it‚Äôs a cabinet of horrors. Stuffed animals from a bygone time (British Raj?). Some lacking fur, some lacking feathers, and a plaster dinosaur up in all of it. Made for very sad sightings. Looking out of one of the windows I saw virtually hundreds of antiquities in the open air, wonderful carvings of various deities, standing among weed. The walkway was so full of weed and grass that I would not dare to walk there, in case of snakes. I tried to find them when I came out, impossible. It did not make matters better when a silver colored bolero car almost drove me down, inside the museum compound. Sad, sorry, but true. All of it. "

The museum had no air conditioning and it seemed that the treasured there were not being taken very good care of. After having seen many of the statues and work in the rightful places throughout the country, this museum was disappointing.The children's museum was very pathetic.

So make sure you get tickets for it if you plan to take photos inside the buildings or else employees confesticate the phones or cameras without ticket. The building with sculptures shows us beautiful examples from era gone by from southern India and also from Buddhist and Jainism. It also houses natural science museum with fossils, meteoroid, crystals, skeleton of whales, elephant, dinosaurs and real life models of wild animals and birds exclusive to India. Also has a working model of dinosaurs which is great fun for kids!The bronze gallery is an amazing exhibit showcasing Saivism and Vaishnavism sculptures.Don't miss the newly opened coins and stamps gallery which is housed behind the sculpture gallery. There's a very small board which leads to the building, ask any employee and they'll take you there. It houses coins from different eras, stamps from all around the world and currency from different eras too.

One of the galleries exhibit anthropology related items : olden warfare equipments, models/photos of dresses and houses used by various tribal groups etc. The second gallery is more diverse covering multiple aspects - historic sculptures of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain deities, olden musical instruments, exhibits of various folk dances, science-related exhibits, etc. There's a dinosaur show at specific timings for school kids.The buildings look pretty much run-down with wooden creepy stair-cases and windows. It appears that no one has ever ventured to several corners of the upper storeys of the galleries. I could see cobwebs, pigeon excreta etc at multiple places (a few rooms have AC though).

Some of the most stunning examples of art from antiquity kept in rather sad conditions of public display. The Madras Museum is no exception, sadly. Its musty exhibits and ill-maintained display cases however contain some of the country's greatest art treasures. A particular highlight is the Chola Bronzes section, with several magnificent Natarajas on display. Some outdoor displays also have great examples of ancient statuary and sculpture from across South India. Another section has some fine and rather famous paintings too but displayed in the most sad fashion, with bad lighting. When will the government spruce up such places and aggressively promote heritage and history to the largely apathetic students who are usually marched past these exhibits? One can only hope"

The Ravi Verma paintings were also quite impressive. Particularly also liked the doll section, with dolls with different regional attire. However, many sections were closed, and it was really sad to see the state of all the rooms. There was dust everywhere and some parts such as the children's activity area, was beyond acceptable. Would hope that some effort is put into bringing this museum to a reasonable conditions, as some of the exhibits are priceless and amazing examples of our history!!"

Government_Museum,Olivier R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Interesting but overpriced (as it is in December 2017),"This is surely not a world class museum, but it is an interesting regional Indian museum, notably for the bronzes and sculptures collections. As others have written, it is somewhat poorly maintained and there is dirt almost everywhere. But I don't think it should refrain from visiting the place. I've seen the same situation in other Indian museums, including in Delhi and it is obviously a result of limited investments by the government rather than a lack of interest by the staff.As for the zoological and geological collections, I'd say they could be skiped if you've already visited one of the major natural history museum of the world: those galleries are quite uneasy to enjoy, considering how old and derelict the exhibits are.Unfortunately, many galleries are closed (December 2017), so the result is an overpriced entrance fee."

Also, must see the collection of Raja Ravi Varma paintings including the famous Shankuntala. Yes, the museum is hot, and signs not clearly marked, descriptions of artifacts are poor, there are stray dogs running around the grounds, no water, and the bathrooms are dirty, but it's India.

The children's museum and the anthropology section can be given miss on all days and twice on Sundays!Better man-power deployment to maintain this heritage property and guide the customers better is mandatory!Amenities are figuratively non-existent - the toilets are extremely poor."

Once inside the museum, you can see many items throughout Indian history from prehistory to more recent times. The ground floor has many statues of deities and animals, many of which are in very good condition given how old they are. My favourites were old stone carvings and tablets with inscriptions in very ancient Indian languages with a character map showing how close they are to contemporary Indian languages. Further into the museum, there are less impressive natural history areas, including a quite loud animatronic T-Rex (which I initially didn‚Äôt know was capable of moving until I got quite a surprise). The animals on show are in reasonable condition but the layout and presentation is lacking and very dated sadly. But it is definitely worth visiting for the first half. I would have included more photos but photography is prohibited inside the museum. "

Another one which made me gasp will you find in the Mammals gallery. A room full of Wet Specimen, from parasites and bacterias to embryo of an elephant. Worth a visit!

I hope the government outsources the maintenance to a private firm. The information displayed is satisfactory. There are many exhibits which are touched by people who visit this museum so some measures have to be taken to avoid this. The paintings inthe art gallery are very good, however again, displayed in a pathetic manner. Prized possessions like Raja Ravi Varma are not very well illuminated and the photo frames need to be restored to their original glory. The cannons that are displayed outside are also very good and have to be displayed indoors with proper history."

Government_Museum,Aaron,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A well-traveled Westerner review ,"First off, what is a gem to one person isn't always to another. This is just my personal opinion. At the time of my review admission is Rs.15 for Indians and Rs.250 for foreigners. Discounts for children. A very fair deal for locals but I do not know if I would recommend it for the price they charge foreign tourists.  This is a very historical museum been over 150 years old. It's housed on 6 acres of land and consists of multiple buildings.  The structure of the buildings and surrounding do look this old since upkeep seems to be an issue. There are seven different buildings which all are not usually open at the same time. Summa buildings have better displays than the others. The bronze showcase is the best kept and displayed of all of them. Poor lighting, lack of labels and information in some displays, dilapidated surroundings, and lack of air conditioner in most of the buildings puts this at a lower level than most museums out there. It has a wide variety and some wonderful treasures but you are going to pay in comfort for having to seek those out. The heat is incredible and mostly unbearable after a certain amount of time. Basic facilities like drinking water and toilets are hard to find. Absolutely no state of the art displays or even TV screens showing video are used at this museum.There is a Rs.200 extra fee if you plan to use photography or video. Although I saw many local Indians taking as many photos as they want when staff were not looking. It's a very large complex and luckily there are benches in each building to rest. You will eventually seek out fans in order to cool yourself down.You're supposed to go to the buildings one through seven in that order done so in a type of chronological order of history.For me personally, after about two hours most museums get tiring from information overload. Add to the fact this place is incredibly hot inside and your patience might seem to be much less.As others have said, bring your own drinking water, and lots of it! "

This is because there are 2 separate queues and they are separated by metal bars to ensure no one crosses over and I guess also to ensure those who pay more gets ahead of the queue. The guy who was responsible for issuing receipts for the darshan helped us at the very first goddess, there are 8 goddesses in total and you would need to navigate them through narrow steps, but the view from each level is breathtaking. Definitely worth a visit but be informed that the priests will ask/cajole you to buy gold-plated coins or request you to place a rupee note at the foot of the deity and another rupee note for him to pack the bindi for you to bring it back home.

The approach is for most part via a narrow staircase with sharp (right) angles more or less along the sides (internal and external!), and it is so narrow that only one reasonably well-built person can fit between the walls in many places; so, there was a long line in (mostly) single file slowly proceeding through. (For some reason, there was a huge crowd on the day we visited; several busloads of pilgrims were also there at the same time.)Anyway, the design of the structure reminded us of a small fort!The location on the sea shore doubtless also contributes to the degradation of the structure. (I assume that the sea breeze is a significant factor to the paint wearing off and other minor damage to the carvings on the temple.)  But I wish it was maintained in better condition. Also, some of the shrines were not opened at the time we visited (don't know why)."

Even the shoe keeper was pushy. As soon as I entered the site a ""guide"" attached himself to me. He wasn't particularly helpful, but he was nice enough. I learned more about the eight forms of the goddess from reading than this guy could give me. Usually it's the other way around. The downside of this experience is that they planked the whole place over, so the lines of sight are basically obliterated. You get the added value of walking next to everything.

Firstly google map sent us to a rich man‚Äôs big farm. When we found the correct address of the village, there was nobody but only two responsibles (one of them can talk English), lovely dogs in the garden and a two layers medium size gallery with beatiful paintings. The wonderful surprise started when I asked the possibility to meet up with one of the artists who was living in the village. The artist Latha Gopal was the daughter of one of the artist founders (K.S. Gopal) of the village. We learned from her the wonderful story of the village. She gave detailed informations about the paintings and their pioneer painters, also her painting. She also showed us the queen of the trees in the garden: wonderful ‚ÄúBanyan Tree‚Äù. Some important informations about the village: you can buy very important paintings exposed in the gallery (not in the museum) starting with the prices of 2000 euros. Daily rent of the exposition gallery is around 40 euros (area is far from the city but the place is so meaningful). Free drawing workshops on Sundays 10h-14h. This village is one of the centers of Madras Movement: contemporary step in Indian painting and sculpture. Besides, Madras (Chennai) Fine Art School is √∂ne of the oldest fine art institutes of ƒ∞ndia. Entrance is less than 1 euro/person.

Their work is widely recognized as some of the best art produced in postwar India and is shown regularly in galleries across the country. Several Cholamandal artists have also shown in Europe, the United States and South America.In the village Injambakkam, 9 km from Chennai, India, it has over 20 resident painters and sculptors, who live as a community and pool their skills. They run the Artists Handicrafts Association, a cooperative which manages the village and sale of works through the permanent exhibition at the complex, which includes paintings, sketches, terra-cotta/stone/metal sculptures, batiks and handicrafts etc., making the village a self-supporting entity"

Cholamandal_Artists_Village,Dilip S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Where I Learnt Lot,"The 10th December , 2016 is the date we will never forget . On this day we first visited Dakshin Chitra and then very fortunate to visit Cholamandal an Artists‚Äô Village brainchild of K C S Paniker , eminent painter and visionary who dreamt of an art Indian in spirit and world wide contemporary .  The place we visited was not a village , it was a multum in parvo , telling the story of the strength and the weakness of present day Indian art .  Thirty painters and sculptures acquired 3.5 ha of land 8 km south of Adyar  on then muttukadu road in 1965 to start the Village in order to rehabilitate the creative artists . Here the artists paints or sculpts through the major part of the day and earns through the sale of his art . The Village is perhaps the first of its kind anywhere in the world . On 1st feb 2009 , the Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art consisting of the K C S Paniker Museum of the Madras Movement , two commercial A C gallaries , Labernum and Indigo , and an open air international sculptures park surrounding the complex was inaugurated . Here we could revisit Paniker . The notion of a three dimensional linear space that the Renaissance  painters advanced and which they applied in the rule of perspective , and the pure theory of it which the cubists abstracted later on are to date the only technically sound solutions to the issue between drawing and picture . Paniker was one who would not submit his subject to received theory in its applied or pure form . Rather than relent Paniker broke off and set out arguing his own case . He made his departure in the landscape , the genre he used extensively for developing his arguments . Instead of solidifying the free space with the straight line structure of perspective or with regular blocks of colour , he made it into a fluid thing held up with a distribution of highly accented , broken and curling lines . The irregular edges of colour that one gets as a bonus when working in water colour , a medium in which Paniker excelled , might have suggested to him this very unconventional abstraction .   The second artist we studied was the sculptor Nandgopal . His sculpture looked open and perhaps continues to , probably because it Is not closed on all sides like something in the round , also because it is not spatial , I e , something fixed compositionally  in space .  We highly appreciated A Selavraj‚Äôs painting , which absorbed the rhythmic freedom that makes the dancer‚Äôs body reflect the pure joy of movement . A Selavraj is a born dancer . The dancing experience evolved his style both in painting and sculpture . It acquired a fluidity  and in painting he gets a flow of light and  shadow .  His style remains purely figurative and he felt inspired by dancers , deities , musicians and village dames .There were many inspirational sculptures around the complex , some of which were Dream of the black sun by N D Rajsekharan , the zen inspired  Emptiness by Hiroshi Mikami , Figure  by Kanyai Kunhiraman , Head by Mall Walsh , Landscape by Theo tan Have , Lord M..  by S Kannappan  , Seed by Nagji Patel from my Vadodara ,  Shape by Olaf Mooij , Temple by Cune van Groeningrn and  View by Ajit Chakravarti  .  There was painting by Dich Donker too ."

Though small the collection is made of paintings (oil, acrylic, and water colour), sketches, drawings, and sculptures. Sadly only few art pieces have titles and none has explanations written on the side to enlighten the visitors on the artists‚Äô messages.I would not advice to tourists who have a limited time to go there as the galleries are very small and do not contain items that will blow their mind, but I would definitely advice people who stay in Chennai to go there. It is indeed said to be the largest artists‚Äô community of India and in any case it must one of the only such communities able to survive like this today.

Queens_Land,Sherline,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worst experience with crazy horses - Queensland Chennai,"I fell down from the crazy horses game. Please don't go for this because1. No footrest is available to place your leg 2. A Handle on each side of horse's face is the only support to hold on. The seat is a flat and lengthy one. When it lifts up from 180 to 100 degrees, the only thing you can hold on is the handle. If you are an adult/women, your weight keeps pulling you down. Now, it starts rotating when you are still hanging at the same 100 degree angle position. My experience here, My hands were already tired holding onto the handle. I couldn't balance when it started rotating fast. My legs started flying in one direction.I literally came out of the seat. I was holding onto the side of the horse. My left leg now is on the top of the seat. My right leg somewhere underneath the horse's neck.  People outside started shouting to stop the ride. But no one stopped. The controller guy said the ride is about to end so he can't stop now. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't hold on there for long. Gradually when it started slowing down, i let go and fell down. Guys, If you are obese, please please don't go for this. It seems like that particular horse on which I sat was a defective one. Also, Same thing happened for another girl on that same horse.  If it is a defective one, they should have sealed it, right? And people above 40 felt a bit of dizziness. My husband got a headache too.To sum up, Queensland is a budget friendly amusement park. But some rides are dangerous because of poor maintenance and no guidance."

The first thing was the route was awesome. Later once we entered queen's Land kids started enjoying the rides. There were crazy rides that even made elders to forget their age and enjoy the surprises of falling from the heights almost (Just kidding) not really. It feels almost we fell. But later we find we are still alive. Crazy horse üê¥ was nice for kids it's just a horse but keeps changing its direction very often and turns around. So the rider has to sit carefully. Bumping cars will be a nice.Note: some of the rides are free and some you may need to pay extra. Exclusive attraction that I found was Ropeway inside the amusement park. Jaint wheel üé° and Columbus are common anywhere. Toy train ride allowed us to have a look around the amusement park. Artificial waterfalls are very attractive for kids. There is one more ride that looks like a round tyre with seats arranged and will be pushed into the streaming water. That takes us in crazy directions. It's a must try ride. It hits the walls and rotates and changes its direction. So it is so interesting. You must try it definitely.

How the newly travelling members know that Rope car will not stop while getting-in? There is sign board, people will have to know only from the members instructions, if they skipped to tell you, then rope car will push you into the lake and you will be finished. For my case they skipped to put the shutter and finally came and pushed the shutter at the near end. I escaped narrowly."

Better change your dresses before you go for this. Since those who are very conscious to remain dry will get wet at the end of ride.4. Food is good in the restaurants inside, which was very well developed when compared to older days.5. Rest rooms are quite descent.What went bad ?1.  First ride is Free Fall but it had a lot of crowd so we moved on and went for small rides. And roller coaster again had a huge crowd so we skipped again. Till then everything was good. Then we stood in queue for Pirate Ship , where a group of 20 members overtook us and went to front of queue and entered without any manners. To our disappointment there was even a security personnel. But he kept his mouth quite. 2. So Queensland needs Maintenance !  3. Queensland need to improve dressing room and shower room which is a mandatory after you soak yourself in that chlorine water.4.

It could be easily a 5 star rated attraction/theme park at Chennai. The entrance fee is Rs.550 and the ticket is a arm-paper-band with numbers printed on it tied on the visitors right hand. Its a good idea. The very first attraction welcomes is the free fall. A open area lift coming down freely at good speed. After this two or three routes takes you for different excitements. There are roller coaster, centrox, etc etc rides for all ages. Most interesting is the Niagara falls. Its an artificially created hill for about 150-200 ft, from the top of which water is made to fall. They start at 2:00pm and end at 2:30pm.  For ladies separate entry and area under the falls is provided at which the falls height may be around 75-100ft. Next is the Wavepool. This is an artificially created sea wave like water pool. It starts at 2:30pm for 30 minutes. Next is the Swimming pool which seems opened from morning itself. And then Himalayan ride. The theme park also has a cable car which takes you above the park at good height. To add to this is the theme park is full of trees. No separate tickets need to be bought for any ride or activity. Food is allowed. Lot of small eateries and two or three restaurants are there. If it is not sunny, a full day can be spent here. "

Queens_Land,Rucha121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good Amusement Park,"Located on outskirts of Chennai, Queens Land is a relatively better theme park as compared to the others present in Chennai. Safety and hygiene standards are heavily compromised in theme parks in India, so we have to exercise extra attention and caution. Although, here, we mainly enjoyed swimming pool and water rides as compared to high-speed or other such snazzy rides. Far off from city, you need to go in own car or hire cab. Entry fees are higher on weekends. Best enjoyment is in groups of more than 5"

Queens_Land,tnbalaji90,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Business,Just loved it,We went as a gang of 8 people last March '17. Despite good experience could've been better in terms of water games. Only 2 water games were available with 2-3 slides and jumpers. May be the park was bit exaggerated which made our expectation levels set high. Land games was peerless. On the whole we just loved it.
Queens_Land,Madhavan Sundarraj,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,One day trip with family ,Good place in chennai to have one day outing. But it's too far away (27kms) from city and you need to go with your own transportation. Don't expect any rental services nearby. Some Rides are time based which is frustrating one since the crowd is loaded due to fixed timings.  Veg and non-veg Resturant's are available but not much varieties.

Queens_Land,aiman_zakir,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Horrible water in the water park, pools are divided foren and women","We went to Queensland as the ratings were the highest. We went just for the water park. It was summer and we walked under the scorching sun to reach the water park. Upon reaching there we were instantly disappointed with the smell of chlorine hitting our nose and the filthy water. Since we already reached we went to the changing room which was full of water and hardly any place to keep your stuff to change. THE WATER POOL WAS DIVIDED FOR MEN AND WOMEN SO IT WAS A WASTE TO GO WITH THE FAMILY. ALL THE GOOD SLIDES WERE WITH THE MEN AND WE LADIES WERE STUCK WITH CHILDREN SLIDES AND KNEE DEEP WATER.Our relief came when we went to the American wave pool which had a better quality of water. The Niagara Falls besides, which only work for half an hour is the best part of the whole amusement park. "
Queens_Land,Arun Kumar N,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Not fit for kids,"There were a lot of rides where kids weren't allowed. Out of the 7 hours the theme park was open, the most of the kids rides were shut for close to 3 hours for lunch. Every time we had to walk in hot sun so that we can check if the rides were open yet. Kids were allowed in the water pool only with women. It's ridiculous for kids who come with male members of their family. On top of everything, the water was very very dirty. There were blades/sharp objects in the pool that a kid in my group got his foot cut. The only good thing, the food was not a rip off and good. If this is the best theme park in Chennai, I wonder how bad the other ones are."

Queens_Land,Arun,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Budget friendly and nice amusement park,Queensland is cheapest and best amusement park in Chennai. You get to try a lot of rides. There is no extra charges for the rides unlike other amusement parks. Though you have to start early at eleven when they open and you need an entire day to go around all the rides. There is a big lake and usually in summer it is dry. They allow boating in the lake and you also can enjoy the winch ride which passes above the lake. I have been to Queensland a lot of times and enjoyed every single time.
Queens_Land,deepika d,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Had great time,The entry for adult is now raised to 550.  But reasonable since the rides are more and has many children rides too.

Queens_Land,Ranga E,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan-17,Old and tired,I visited this place almost after 10 years. Good thing is almost all the rides are still there. But the place took a beating in the recent cyclone resulting in major loss of greenery. Plus there is no new addition and the rides are all old and tired stuff. Most of them are well worn out despite being functional and mechanically sound. But this is the best theme park in Chennai for kids. There are at least 20 rides for kids below 6 years age and that made it worthwhile.

Hygenic food court serving meals at reasonable cost is an added plus.Only one recommendation please start early and go in groups if you have small kids so that you can take turns to look after the lil ones and enjoy some high adrenaline  pumping  rides for which children's are not allowed

It has room for improvement and a lot can be expected to go well (if managed properly).They charged child price for a kid less than child age and said her height is more, so we will charge (then why mention an age limit on website)."

It is good amusement park, have lot of rides and games.  Good place to spend with family and friends.  Suitable for all ages from kids to Senior citizens.The rides like 'Himalaya water ride', 'winch' 'Bumper car' and other water rides must never be missed.  They will give a map at start which is also useful.There are some eat outs there for afternoon, but should get there earlier before 1 pm, other wise the food stuff will get over.  We can take home food also.The problem I faced in Queens land both the times is that they have lot of rides and one cannot complete all in a whole day, But we will pay the whole amount.  Eg: You will get queue for most of the famous rides, standing in queue will grab 2-3 hours in one day in total, and rides like Himalayan water ride, winch may take long time, so you will not have time to complete all the rides, even if you want.Swimming pool not good, with lot of dirt.The evening train for exit is also not to be missed, but the problem is, it is once in 45 minutes, and a whole bunch of people will be waiting for it, so one thing you will leave your time to stand in queue OR you will leave that train and walk for about 1 km for exit."

Matsya_Narayana_Temple,RamGanesan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,A peaceful Meditation Center right on the Beach,"This peaceful temple dedicated to Matsya Narayana is on the East Cost Road near a place called Uthandi.  It is a relatively newly constructed temple right on the beach.  The temple has been constructed by Donors and supported by Chinmaya Mission.  The structure of the temple itself has been carefully designed in a oval shape and a raised circular structure.  The large life size idol of Lord Narayana in the form of a Matsya (fish) is in the middle of the elevated circular platform.  People who know the avatars described in Hindu tradition will understand the significance of the Matsya Avatar, the avatar that saved the world from floods.  The area around the idol is meant for meditation and visitors are asked to remain silent in that designated spot.  The entire temple sits on the shores of the sea and a gusty wind always breezes past us.  It is therefore a serene atmosphere for meditation and prayer.  The unique aspect of this place is that it is open air with a lot of beautiful pillar structures with inscriptions about several things that the temple stands for.  When the lights come out in the evening after dark it is a real treat to watch the place.  The lighting has also been carefully chosen to maintain a calm and serene atmosphere.  The floor around the temple has also been carefully laid with small marble stones that create an accu pressure on the foot.  This helps in blood circulation when one comes around the temple.  The lawn and the garden with a lot of flowers add beauty to the whole place.  There are also three other shrines inside the complex, Siva, Hanuman, Ganapthy and of course Narayana and his concert.   The book shop sells religious books.  Separate toilet and shoe keep area are maintained well.   Vehicle parking is not a problem right now as not many people are aware of this place.  I hope by this review people will get to know the place.  Do refer my photos to see the beautiful temple.  This is a Must see place if you are in the southern parts of Chennai"

There are other deities in the background looking on...The piety and gravitas of the atmosphere in Trivandrum is not so prominent here. Instead of being awe-inspiring, here it is more democratic or transparent(!) is the feeling we get...But either way, this place gives you the indefinable presense that electric feeling you get in places close to the devine...

What used to be a very peaceful and serene place has now become a commercial place with many marriage functions happening inside the temple. Personally i would feel that the temple is no longer the temple it was in the yester years and has become so commercial. Otherwise the temple is quite well maintained.  There is no dedicated car parking and one has to park in the side streets without disturbing the entry way to the houses on either side."

Had been in chennai for three years and didn't heard about this temple. The one acre temple complex has six murugan and one Gsnapati temple representing all the six famous murugan temples of tamil nadu - 1. Swamimalai at the northeast, 2. Tiruchendur at the east, 3. Palamudirsolai & 4. Tirupparankundram at the south, 5. Palani at the west and 6. Tiruttani in the northwest. The Mahavallabha Ganapati temple is in the center.It is behind the Astha lakshmi temple. Where as the Astha lakshmi temple is directly on the shore - this temple is slightly behind. One cannot see the beach from here. However there is a pathway for the beach from outside the temple - for which I have not ventured. There is a wall before the main entrance facing the shore - may be some construction? Really an ideal place to spend peaceful time with sea breeze and the spiritual aura. And moreover not much crowd in normal days. If you are LORD MURUGAN FOLLOWER - keep the temple on your weekend must visit place list. May god bless all. "

Aarupadai_Veedu_Temple,Pradeep R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Seashore temple for peace of mind.,"In the year 1984, the sage Kanchi Paramacharya was camping at Gulbarga in Karnataka State, when Dr. Alagappa Alagappan, an Ex-UN Official went to have his darshan. He mentioned to the Acharya regarding having a single temple complex for all the six Padai Veedu temples of Lord Muruga at one place and that too in granite. The sage readily agreed and immediately arranged for an acre of land at Besant Nagar in Chennai near the sea, through the then Chief Minister of Tamilnadu, Late Mr. M. G. Ramachandran and HR & CE Minister Mr. RM. Veerappan. The Temple Complex is located on the shore of Bay of Bengal, behind Ashtalakshmi Temple. Dr. Alagappan is the pioneer in building Hindu temples in the USA. First he built Maha Vallabha Ganapati temple in New York and was instrumental in building many others like the Venkatachalapati temple in Pittsburgh and the Meenakshi temple in Houston. He was advising and helping as well as organising temple architects (stapathis) from India to build these temples. The Kanchi Acharya advised Dr. Alagappan to take up the project and guided him well. He has stressed that it is difficult for the devotees to visit all six Padai Veedus when touring Tamil Nadu. He wished it should be in a single seashore site and he was sure that Tamil Nadu would become prosperous on account of it. Swami Malai praharam and temple were built first in 1995, in remembrance of Paramacharya, whose original name was Swaminathan. Another three temples -- the Mahavallabha Ganapati, Palani and Tiruttani temples -- were completed and consecrated in 1998. Three other temples, namely Tiruchendur, Tirupparankundram and Palamudirsolai, have also been completed with the concecration having taken place in the presence of HH ≈örƒ´ Jayendra Saraswati Swamigal of ≈örƒ´ Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam on 21st June 2002. Mr. Muthiah Stapathy, who has built many temples in India and in USA, is the architect of this project. The Mandalabhishekam of the temple was completed on the 4th Aug 2002. It is widely believed that Pamban Swamigal, an ardent devotee of Lord Muruga, who lived in the last century and whose samadhi is very close by, had a premonition that the six temples of Lord Muruga were going to be constructed nearby. Already a number of miracles have been happening in this temple complex. At Swamimalai, in the form of Gurunathan, He is blessing students with school / college admissions and excellence in their studies. When the Trustees of the temple went to order a Vel from the Vummidiar Jewellers, to their great surprise they were told that they had a Vel ready with them especially for Swaminatha Swami. There are many other such instances. The temple complex is unique in its construction. In this complex, Swamimalai is situated in the northeast, Tiruchendur in the east, Palamudirsolai and Tirupparankundram in the south, Palani in the west and Tiruttani in the northwest directions, respectively. The Mahavallabha Ganapati temple is in the center. This temple complex is attracting a large number of devotees from far and near. In addition to local dignitaries and devotees, even devotees from abroad have visited and worshipped in this temple. Unlike other places, the seashore is ideal for meditation with a cool and peaceful atmosphere. Homams are regularly conducted at the request of the devotees. Festivals revering Lord Muruga are celebrated here in the traditional way. Valli Tirukkalyanam at the temple has become popular with parents of marriageable girls, and many of them have had immediate grant of their wishes. The morning Darshan timings are from 6:00 AM to 12:00 noon and evening Darshan timings are from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The darshan and puja time of the temple are extended during auspicious days. There will be change in the opening and closing time during festivals, important rituals and eclipses. Visitors / tourists to Chennai should make this temple as ‚Äòmust visit‚Äô. "

Over generations  devotees to be estimated anywhere between 20 to 50 million each year , specially keralites , settled all over India and abroad  undertake an annual pilgrimage  to the Main Ayyapa  temple   in Sabarimala ,  situated on a hilltop amidst eighteen hills at an altitude of 480¬†m above sea level, surrounded by mountains and dense forests called Periyar Tiger hills reserve,  in pathanthitta district of KeralaState , South of India.The famous festival is Makara Villakku festival .This main temple is dedicated to the hindu celibate  diety, Lord ¬†Ayyappan also known as¬†Dharma Sastha.According to hindu mythology he isthe son of¬†Lord Shiva and Mohini ,the feminine incarnation of Lord VishnuIts a rare temple due to the fact  that the traditions of this Sabarimala temple  is a confluence of Shaivism, Shakthism& Vaishnavism with other Sramana traditions .People before undertaking this pilgrimage, normally go through a period of strict penance and prayers meetings for 41 days abd  start the pulgrimage with an Irumudi or offering to the lord carried on their head  wearing  black clothes .During this period of prayers they maintain strict  abstinance from non veg food & alcohol.Devotees undertaking this pilgrimage  to Sabarimala Mandalam- Makaravilakku  seasons in Chennai  had to fend for themselves in the absence of any institutionalized service in chennai in those days of 60's & 70's .These Ayyappan Vilakku rituals,  associated with this pilgrimage  used to be conducted in several areas of the city as an annual feature and homes of devotees themselves  and in our neighbourhood it used to be conducted in the premises of a small  temple on Melpadi Muthu Naicken Street or in the precincts of Asalathamman Koil,  on North Mada Street in NungambakkamOf which Mahalingapuram forms a part.In 1967 a few  organizers, realising the need to have an institution to overcome the problems encountered by the devotees undertaking pilgrimage to this  Holy Hills, decided  to provide minimum facilities to them. Notable among them  being  Sarvasri P.B.Nair, R.S.Kaimal, K.V.Thankappan Nair, K.Bhaskaran, C.P.G.Nambiar, T.M.G.Kurup, V.S.Mani Iyer.Formation of a trust by them led to the realisation of the Mahalingapuram Bhaktha Samajam & the famous Ayyappan Temple built  in traditional kerala style architecture , as you see today standing tall.Now the temple also has sannadhis for Guruvayur krishnan ,Ganapathy, shiva & Parvathi , Murugan with his consorts Valli & Devasenai and Lordess Saraswathi.This temple is known for its very good upkeep & maintenance following strictly the rituals to specified in our Vedas and scriptures & while maintaining  perfect Timings forcall poojas and visting hours .  Annual poojas notable among them being the Vallakku pooja every year around Karthigai month Iis noteworthy .Traditionally this begins in the late evening , from the Shiva temple nearby on the main Road with  ladies standing in two rows carrying a lamp & begin a procession in front of Lord Ayyappa riding a chariot accompanied  by famous and loud Ketala Chanda music And fire works and it ends at the Ayyppa temple .I strongly reccommend visitors to Chennai to look up this  temple during their next visit to Chennai ."

Mahalingapuram_Sree_Ayyappa_Temple,Ravi D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-16,Miniature Kerala,"The Mahalingapuram Sree Ayyappa Temple is run by a trust and I have been fortunate to have been associated with this temple from inception  in the late seventies. Lord Ayyappa, according to folk lore, was brought up by a Royal couple, who found him on the banks of a river - a gift from heavenly abodes, in answer to the childless couple's  prayers to God. The story line then follows a typical palace intrigue, when after the birth of a baby boy a few years later, jealousy, treachery of a Minister throws in ingredients of an action thriller; suspense and action. The plot ends in miraculous  anticlimax when Sree Ayyappa forays in to the forest to fetch milk of a tigress, the only supposed cure for his mother's feigned illness - a ploy meant to eliminate him. The mythological tale then transforms in to a spiritual one when after many trials and challenges in the forests, new friendships and alliances formed, he returns riding atop a tigress. Pictures depicting Lord Ayyappa in this form are traditionally not displayed to mounted inside homes, except those of bachelors observing strict abstinence. The spiritual aspects commence with his revelation of true identity-for no human can ride a tiger. Forgiving all those who plotted against him  he returns to heavenly abode. The spot of his ascension is marked by a temple, the plan of which is attributed to the divine architect Lord Parsurama. The original hill top temple Is located in Kerala State. Every year, from mid-November to first week of January, is the period when devotees after observing a strict 41-days abstinence, undertake a pilgrimage to Sabarimala or the mountain of Lord Sabari.The temple in Mahalingapuram is not a replica- that is forbidden. The architecture is typically of Kerala and the sanctum follows all the tenets of temple architecture and divine rules. It is kept exceptionally clean and follows strict timings - opening, closing and observing all the poojas in correct manner at correct timings. Later a Sree Guruvayurappan Temple for Lord Krishna was added alongside and over the years new buildings, constructions and renovations have taken place. Sree Ayyappan Temple also has smaller abodes for Lord Ganesha - the elephant headed  God, Goddess Mallikapura, and Lord Muruga (Karthik, son of Lord Shiva and Godess Parvathy, as known to North India)"

Pondy_Bazaar,Debasmitaghosh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Shop to your heart's content,"Recently went to Chennai with my husband after 10 years. We had started our married life in Chennai 10 years ago so there was a lot of nostalgia attached to this trip. Hubby had work so I stepped out solo for a walk down Pondy Bazaar, one of my favourite places to shop in Chennai. It was around 12 in the afternoon, the February sun was pleasant, and I instantly felt at home under the canopy of trees that Pondy Bazaar is known for. I started off by buying a gajra for myself for 20 bucks from a street-side shop selling flowers and garlands. Got into the Chennai feel once I put the gajra on my hair. Walked a bit and stopped by this shop called Choices selling cut pieces for garments. The collection was huge, and an array of colours mesmerised me. I bought a few blouse pieces to gift my mother and mom-in-law. The prices were pretty reasonable, and I was in fact amazed that I got such a good deal. I came out of the shop happy and started walking again. There were shops lined up selling every pretty thing from copper-goldplated jewellery starting from Rs 800 to kurtas and bags priced Rs 200 onwards. I'm between there were small joints selling corn and coconut pudding. I stopped by one Amma selling fresh coconut water. At Rs 40 it was worth the price. The water was sweet and I felt satiated after a long walk in the sun. My next stop was Rathna Stores that sells everything, right from utensils to furniture. One tends to get lost inside this shop, the variety is so much. I felt excited walking in here after 10 years! Bought a few steel bowls and a couple of copper-bottom steel saucepans. Felt like buying the entire shop though. If you happen to come to Chennai, a visit to Pondy Bazaar, and most importantly Rathna Stores is a must! I walked down the entire street till I felt totally happy and done. Pondy Bazaar gives you that typical Chennai vibe, and it's always pleasant to come back here."

Firstly, ST THOMAS MOUNT where the saint was killed, and secondly, LITTLE MOUNT where the saint lived and spent time in prayer. Near SAN THOME CATHEDRAL is the place where the saint was initially buried before the body was exhumed and sent elsewhere.I visited only St Thomas Mount and the Little Mount shrines.Being a senior citizen I was tired climbing up the many steps of St Thomas Mount. Older people should take an autorickshaw up via a back road. Once up, apart from religious sentiments, one gets some panoramic views of certain parts of Chennai.Little Mount - known as CHINNAMALAI to the locals (important info for auto drivers) - has a few things connected to St Thomas as well as a miraculous spring, now contained in a room about 12 feet by six feet.Both shrines are very well maintained, are serene locations, and takes one away from the hustle and bustle of the city"

Other than this, there is really nothing much. However, if your curiosity does get the better of you, do visit!

The place known as little mount is locally called chinnamalai and the church is named as 'our lady of health'. This is located at Saidapet and NOT near the airport. The church or shrine near the airport is st.thomas mount. Little mount is believed to be the place where St. Thomas was in hiding. You can see the cave as an underground place attached to the church. There is a rock with a huge palm impression and it is believed that this palm impression belongs to St.Thomas. There is a spring which again is believed to have been in existence from the time of St.Thomas and many devotees carry this water back along with them. This place therefore has historic and religious importance. Just around the church there is a small garden with the depiction of the stations of the cross.

It is bare except for an altar that has been placed quite recently.you can also see the narrow (grilled) opening in the cave wall said to have opened up miraculously to allow the saint to escape from his pursuers.The entire shrine has a feeling of ascetic serenity and prayerfulnes about it along with a sense of historical drama and danger.It is highly recommended for devout Catholics as well as history buffs.Note: The locals call it Chinna malai (little mount) and is located in Saidapet. It should not be confused with the much higher and more famous Periya malai (big mount)/Firangi malai which is popularly called St thomas mount and overlooks the airport, and was the site of St thomas' Martyrdom.Several reviews on this page confuse the two, the photographs are of the little  mount shrine ."

I followed it and reached this church and it was wow I found peace there! No one talked much about this church, though it is one of the tourist spots in chennai. I did not know the history, I was only in search of peace and I found it there, I would say. As mentioned in the other comment, there is a small cave (a very cool place to beat the heat of chennai) which is the attraction point in this church. I find lot of crowd in and around church, but when I get into the cave and sit there for a while I will feel as if I am meditating. It's a good feeling and it is worth visiting this place in chennai."
Little_Mount_Shrine,The_Pale_Ridah,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-10,St Thomas the Apostle was killed in India...this is no joke!,"St Thomas travelled the long road to India to spread Jesus‚Äô teachings & like many of these Apostles, died a violent death. Modern day Chennai aka Madras or Mylapore was the location of his martyrdom, making the Indian Church the 2nd oldest church community in the world, next to the Catholic Church, with a direct connection to Jesus.The holy site at Little Mount or locally known as Chinnamalai comprises the cave where St Thomas lived, a holy spring, a stone carved cross & a small circular chapel. Inside the cave is a stone boulder with an imprint of a hand on it, supposedly St Thomas‚Äôs hand print or that of a large beast. Being alone in the cave I thought about this being the hand print of a bloke who hung out & drank wine with Jesus! Near the cave is a fresh water spring that miraculously appeared to quench the thirst of followers, a shame Hindus didn‚Äôt drink wine, a mysterious wine spring would create some buzz id imagine. Inside the locked shed that protects the stream is an ancient stone cross that was uncovered recently & believed to have been carved by the saint himself & on which he hugged while he was violently stabbed to death by a hating Brahmin priest.Little Mount is located in Saidapet, Chennai near the Maraimalal Adigalar bridge. The chapel is open all day & is a cool blessing from Chennai‚Äôs heat. Many auto-rickshaw/taxi drivers might not know where it is but just tell them to go to Saidapet & ask around. There are no admission fees but the old man who holds the key to the natural spring & stone cross might appreciate a small ‚Äòdonation‚Äô for unlocking the door to access the cross & spring, u can find him loitering around the place. A visit to Little Mount cannot be complete without a trip to the San Thome Basilica which is one of three places in the world where a church has been built over the tomb of an Apostle of Jesus, the others being the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain for St James & St Peter‚Äôs Basilica at the Vatican in Rome."

The weather nice, and the garden sort of wild, with plenty of trees, a real oasis. The pride is an old Banian tree, measuring 70 x 100 meters, but it‚Äôs difficult to get a sense of it, as the Banyan is sending DOWN air roots, which will take root, and it looks like a forest by itself. However, I take them on their word. It was nearly empty, a work day - so I had the garden almost for myself. Beautiful magenta water lilies, some other lilies among the grass, and at least two tall trees full of mega bats, which I think are Flying Dogs, sort of. They made bird like sounds. It was also a loud choir of bird song.Along one of the roads were temples, and churches for different religions - a liberal Catholic Church (whatever that might be), a Hindu temple, a Singh shrine. All in all, I made the round in an hour or so, and was back in ChennI reality coming out of the main gate. Thousands of cars, scooters, tuktuks, fumes and exhaust, noise and serious pollution. Glad I went there, will I go again? Don‚Äôt think so. And I had a serious feeling that the Theosophical Society is a dying breed. "

This place has free entry but only on weekdays from 8:30am to 10:30am and then again from 2pm to 4pm which happens to be the least favored timing for any Chennai resident to venture outdoors due to the heat. Early morning and evening walks are hence not a possibility and that is a shame because the canopy of trees and pathways are delightful and an early morning or evening walk accompanied by bird song would have been the best way to experience the place. I happened to be there in the vicinity and had 1 hour to kill as i was waiting for someone to turn up and hence decided to drop in as it was a hot but not so sunny day. A stroll of 1.2 kms was comfortable and there is good tree cover and foliage to delight the walker. Trees were named with little boards displayed but there were no proper gardens to linger on. Benches to relax were also very few. No drinking water facility hence do bring your own water if you set out to walk. The banyan tree is more like a complex of trees now and is mind-blowing to behold. The place is clean and dust bins are set up hence pls do not litter. Recommended for nature lovers. Kids would get bored. One star less due to unreasonable visiting hours and lots of scope to develop the place into a blooming garden attraction which Chennai lacks. "

But a very few have heard of this little paradise called Eco Park in Chetpet. What sounded like a refreshing change from the usual TVs and ipad tablets, turned out to be a truly good one.  Having said that this is just a good start. Cameras like slr ones had to be kept outside (this was a disappointment for me - not sure what they were hiding) and so are plastics.  The park has a lake with boating inside. Anglers can merry in the second half, though you are supposed to put the fish back into the lake. Angling kit is available on rent. Boating is reasonably priced and this where the crowd lies. You have to be patient till your chance arrives. The queues can be longer. The boating experience per se is decent and they gave life buoys to all. Some of the walls are painted with artistic sceneries etc.  The flora and fauna quotient is a bit lacking. All we could see was ducks. They can probably introduce many more species. Congratulations are due to whoever thought through this idea for an eco Park very next to the EMU train station (may be that's why less fauna). Before this eco park, I would have crossed that area a hundred times without getting amused. Now it evokes a feeling of being part of the nature amidst the other unavoidable urbanization in a city whose Air Quality Index is degrading by the day.

Light_House,Valavanur Natar... K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Write up of Chennai light house on the Marina,"If a visitor to Chennai or for that matter a local resident,  has never had a birds eye view or a Panaromic view of Chennai's east Coromandel coast line with  its vast beach (the 2nd longest in the world) it is best done from the watch  tower of the light house,  on Kamarajar Salai or Marina beach road as it is the closest tower nearer to the beach front .As for the purpose of the light house itself ,it may not hold great importance for providing  navigational  direction for modern ships as they  are  now equipped with  GPS, radar and other modern  electronic devises for finding directions at sea for heading to the port of Chennai .But Fishermen ,  venturing into deep  sea with trawlers with no GPS ,  would still depend on this light house beacon with unified set of  timing between two powerful beam of  revolving  light , to identify the land mark of Chennai port . Mahabalipuram  lighthouse to south of Chennai and 60 kms is the next nearest to this and has  a differential timing for light beacon.This would help Fishermen  living along the long coast to easily return to their hamlet using this beacons. It's interesting to trace  the history of light house in  Chennai. Chennai has had four light houses in the past.The history of the Madras Lighthouse dates back to 1795. In 1796, the roof of the Officers Mess in what is now known as Fort St George, was selected as the site for the first warning beacon. It was nothing more than a large lantern. To be more specific, the first Light House of Chennai functioned (1796 ‚Äì 1841) at the Building in the Fort St George where the Fort Museum is located.The second light house was erected between the 1838 and 1844 on the north side of Fort St George.Light House (Old), ChennaiThis lighthouse operated until 1894. Though its lantern room was removed long ago to fit in the third light house also located in the Madras High Court Complex, the Tower stands tall even today.The third light House was functioning from the tallest dome of the Madras High Court. It started functioning on June 1, 1894, with argand lamps and reflectors manufactured by Chance Bros, Birmingham which had originally been installed in the 160-ft-tall lighthouse tower.The present light House  is located opposite the office of the Director General of Police and was opened in January 1977. It is one of the few lighthouses in the world and the only one in India with an elevator.The Mahabalipuram  lighthouse near chennai was located in Mamallapuram and It was open to tourists since 2011. It was closed in 2001 following perceived LTTE threat. The first light was commissioned here in 1887. The lighthouse with a circular masonry tower made of natural stone became fully functional in 1904. India's oldest lighthouse, built around 640 AD by Pallava king Mahendra Pallava stands next to this modern structure. The Pallava era lighthouse is a protected monument, maintained by the Archaeological SurveyThe Chennai light house is open for tourists on all days except Mondays and the fee is very nominal Rs 10 for children Rs 20 for adults and Rs 50 for foreigners ( I wonder why this disparity) This includes a stroll through the museum in it .Camera will be charged extra at Rs 25 .It has adequate number of car parking and two wheelers parking space .I would caution visitors to gather avoid the South view as it would be a little depressing ."

Light_House,TheWorldNut,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Very nice view,"You can't have a better view of Marina beach then one from the top of this light house. There is an elevator followed by fewflights of steps to reach to the top. Not much space on the top viewing platform, hence if crowded this can be not so much fun but given there were not many people on a Sunday afternoon, one can safely take a chance. Neverthless the views from the top is great and, you can see a great expanse of the sea, follwed by the sand and then a nicely urbanized stretch. Quite a good view I must say. The viewing platform is grilled but still be careful with very small kids. Just fyi - They don't allow bags inside, which has to be kept with the guard outside and cameras (even the big DSLRs) are allowed for a fee."

Some of these Indian tourist sites also have annoying rules about not taking photographs - this is one of those sites, but everyone up in the light house ignored this rule.  It is relatively inexpensive to take the elevator up, so by all means take 20 minutes, check out the lighthouse, then walk the beach."

We were able to have good elevated view of the beach, beach road and Tamil Nadu state's police headquarters. We were not allowed into the top most floor that housed the lamp and its associated mechanics. There wasn't a lot of space as it was more like an 'U' shaped narrow balcony. Clear sunny day is a must for good experience. There was a small museum on the ground floor which we peeked our heads into and found unappealing so skipped to the exit."

Some very tragic one with regards the wives of those who were here.Beware: Entrance is now by an online ticket. My driver used his phone to buy and I reimbursed him.

Interesting collection of a lot of military inspired memorabilia along with some India artefacts. The most ""interesting"" room is the oil paintings of some.british royal family members - but do remember to look up and to the left.....Not allowed to take photos inside the museum"

Faded exhibits of unremitting boredom. A desultory collection of tat. An enormous statue bunged  into a stairwell. A porcelain and coin collection cobbled together in a lazy afternoon in the 1940s when someone had nothing better to do but didn't want to do this either. And guess what? Such a bizarre place.

We drove past a military installation and there was much security around the highway in front of the place - my uber driver was unsure about the place and I knew nothing but what I saw on websites so I stepped out and some of the military guys said that I was in the right place but the museum was in the back.  So don't be flipped out if you feel you're in the wrong place here because it's not well labelled or visible on the road.Displays are interesting enough and it allows for an understanding of all the countries that have had their hands on this country over the years.

Fort_St_George,Peter S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Fantastic historical site - with appalling interpretation,"Fort St George represents the genesis of British rule in south India. It was created in the mid-17th century and continually changed and strengthened through many iterations and  changes. It's still a working military and governmental installation, but visitors can freely walk around the fort seeing a wonderful range of historical buildings until stopped by various 'no entrance' signs. Several buildings (Clive's House, St Mary's church and the appalling Fort Museum) deserve reviews of their own. But in general, if you are at all interested in the physical manifestations of imperial military rule, take a wander around the fort. You can see the huge barrack blocks in which troops lived, see the massive ramparts and gates, and see how in many ways India has simply adopted the fabric of the fort to meet its own (actually very similar) needs. The up-keep and interpretation of this historical heritage is almost entirely absent (in Britain or Australia etc. everything old would be cared for and explained - in India, it's simply used but not explained). But at least you can see and photograph it, which I did. But the fort's buildings are very poorly maintained, and even a few yards from the 'lines' of the various military units (which are kept spotless) there is litter and rubbish everywhere - the moat is full of crap. This is disgraceful for any historical site dating from the 17th century (and the church is certainly that old in origins). As ever, India delights and disappoints in turn."

Fort_St_George,Atul G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,British Fort Worth Seeing,Fort St. George is the earliest fort built by the British to protect their first enclave in India against potential French aggression. Sadly we arrived here fairly late in the day and it closes at 5pm. There is quite a bit of police security as you enter given its prominence as a tourist site and the fact that the museum is located right next to a Navy compound (which is obviously off-limits to civilians). The architecture and layout is good to see and the museum itself is very good. Plenty of militaria from various foreign settlers including the British and French through the centuries as well as a fantastically detailed model of the entire fort are on display. If you can go upstairs you can see there are some amazing wall-length paintings of famous English monarchs and Indian maharajahs and nawabs. There is also access to the roof but we arrived to late to utilise it. Definitely see this place if you are in Chennai and have an hour to spare.

The downside is that almost all the Fort area is in modern day use by the Government, Naval College, and other departments, somewhat restricting what can be visited. However the museum just inside the Fort entrance is worthwhile and really shows just what a remarkable bunch of people they were, who built it. The entrance fee is 10 rupees for locals, and 100 rupees for tourists!!! As India was in the throes of a currency denomination change when we visited, it was impossible to obtain rupees and so had to barter with US dollars. The second building to visit is the Anglican Church, still used for services today, and the many fascinating tombstones that surround it.

Historians tell it was built on uninhabited land along the shores of the Bay of Bengal and the old city of Madras (Chennai, today) evolved around the fortress. Amazing history! The construction, considered a military architecture wonder, was declared a protected monument by the ""Archaelogical Survey of India"" and includes some famous buildings, as ""St. Mary's Church"", ""The Fort Museum"", ""Wellesley House"", ""Clive House"" and many others. The complex houses also the headquaters of Tamil Nadu State Legislative Assembly.

Kundrathur_Murugan_Temple,SubashSL,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-18,"The ""cutest"" Murugan you can find!","Not an ""Arupadai Veedu"" but a very holy shrine for Murugan nevertheless, that you cannot afford to miss. The easiest way to go there is via the GST road via Pallavaram. Actually it is also located not far form the ""Thiruneermalai Perumal Temple"" which means you could visit the ""Neervanna Perumal/Ranganathar Perumal Temple (Divya Desam)"" also if you can figure out the closest route to this temple which on Google Maps looks pretty close. Went there on a Sunday and it was somewhat crowded. There is ample parking space for two-wheelers and four-wheelers. The flight of steps is not steep and not many in number either. The best tip is to avoid walking the lengthy empty ""snaking"" queue, particularly if there is no crowd. Lookout for an entrance near the columns located to the left of the main shrine, where you can enter the queue easily instead of going through piped long winding enclosure. Chances are that if other people find this entrance you end up even more behind  the rear of the queue. The ""Darshan"" is blissful. Your ""Archana"" coconuts will have to be given to a priest who breaks them before you reach the main deity. So do not forget this step as they will not allow you to break the coconuts before the deity . The route from Kundrathur back to GST via Pallavaram is traffic chocked and so if you could find another alternative that would be good too. "

The idols are quite similar to the original ones in Puri, Orissa. The pooja time is one of great spiritual experience with the blowing of the conch shell and the arthi. The Lord is housed in a structure similar to Puri Jagannath, a huge chariot-like structure. The Lord is a beauty to behold and you can sit for a few mins of meditation right outside the sanctum sanctorumOn either side of Lord Jagannath, we have Goddess Vimala and Goddess Lakshmi, each with their own shrines. Right below the Lord Jagannath structure, there is also a smaller meditation hall with few other deities. There is also a Buddha statue in the lawn just outside the main templeThere are no hundies, but a donation center at the entrance, where we can contribute to educational donation done by the temple trust. The temple is neatly maintained and because this is a private trust, the house of the temple pundits are situated right within the premisesIf you are in the mood for a spiritual experience while driving down the ECR, I would recommend that you not miss this temple. It truly is a wonderful experience!"
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,roshu6682,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,An oasis of peace and devotion,"I am a person who loves to visit temples to imbibe the positive energy generated there but find it a futile exercise with the accompanying crowds, pushing, shoving, queues and taking tickets for so called express darshan! Except neighborhood temples and far flung temples of architectural value I hardly visit a temple as a place of worship anymore but on janmashtami I just had to go and wish Krishna but wanted to escape the crowds hence iskcon was ruled out. I just chanced upon the reviews of Jagannath temple on TripAdvisor and bypassed iskcon and went further down to find this unique temple to my great delight! Beware Google maps takes you on the wrong right turn in the last leg which leads one to a dead end but this issue has been reported and hopefully will be resolved soon. Despite being janmashtami there were just about a dozen devotees around. The temple premises were well maintained, spacious and the layout was thoughtfully done. Welcomed by a modern art deco version of the dwaja sthamba and up above a graceful flight of marble steps is the small sanctum sanctorum housing the decorated deities, Krishna, balaram & subhadra in the likeness of the puri temple. The pujas are done in typical Oriya style with minimal fuss. The ceiling is beautifully decked with colorful patachitras. Basement of the shrine houses the utsav muthi and the jhula for Krishna. The other deities housed around the main shrine are Ganesha, Kasi Vishwanath, Buddha amidst a well maintained lawn, Laxmi and vimala Devi. The pathways are laid out well and surrounded by the garden on all sides. It was a pleasure to be in this oasis of calm away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Only disappointment was that despite being janmashtami there was no prasad offered. A simple dish from the Lord's kitchen would have been the icing on the cake but then again maybe Jagannath in his mysterious ways, wants me to make another visit to see him which I would love to undertake soon! A highly recommended outing for the spiritually inclined. "

It might be because it is very recent (inaugurated in 2001), but in any case it is perfect if you want to pray peacefully or if you want to see the difference between typical Oriya and Tamil architectures. This temple has indeed been built based on old Oriya temples style (mainly Puri famous Jagannath temple). You can directly see it from the structure and the style of sculptures. Any person who has been to Orissa will appreciate the memory and any person who has not been there will get an idea of how temples are there.Do spend time to check the central pillar which depicts all Vishnu‚Äôs avatars (lower part) and the beautiful nagi / nagini (top part). There are several shrines around the main temple and a tree under which there are several gods‚Äô and goddesses‚Äô vehicles (including an owl that I had personally never seen or noticed before that should be one of Lakshmi‚Äôs vehicles). There is also a smiling Buddha on the left side.

As the visitors enter the premises, they are awe-struck by a soaring granite tower over the main sanctum in the Kalinga architectural style with a long flight of broad steps leading to it.  In the sanctum are the idols of Jagannath, Baladeva and Subhadra. On the walls and the ceiling there are spiritual paintings.   In the front on the ground stands a lofty Dwajasthambha with sculptures etched on it.  Consecrated in 2001, the temple is said to be similar to the Puri Jagannath shrine.  The entire Dakshinakshetra complex is in a beautifully landscaped space amidst emerald lawns, flower plants and green trees in a quiet environment.  It is said that only the flowers grown there are used for worship.  Seen in the compound are three trees intertwined with each other ‚Äì neem, banyan and peepal.  This ‚Äúunion‚Äù of trees is likened to Kalpataru.  There is a colourful Buddha image installed in the open on the lawn.  A marble-floored meditation hall is also located in the complex.

Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,ChinmayHota,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Far from the madding crowd,"Far from the hustle and bustle of the city, the temple complex dedicated to Lord Jagannath and his siblings Balabhadra and Subhadra, is an island of tranquility, and sheer bliss. Once upon a time there used to be only one Jagannath temple, located at the original kshetra, Puri in Odisha. Over centuries many princely states built temples for the revered deity at their capitals. Now that the royals are gone, the responsibility of building Jagannath temples at different locations have been assumed voluntarily by the common devotees. The Kanathur temple is one such attempt.The big compound is very well maintained with a mandap at the entrance, the sanctum sanctorum built in style of Puri original at the centre and lush green lawns and garden plants all around. The Garuda Pillar facing the deities is imposing and beautifully carved. There is a small structure dedicated to Kanchi Ganesh on the left of the complex, a statue of Buddha, also on left,  and a nice lotus design water tank at the back. Jagannath culture also assimilated the Buddhist philosophy, and it is said that the deity at Puri has the tooth of Buddha hidden in his naval.The priests are from Odisha and I found them to be very sincere in their worship. The temple can organize various types of pujas or rituals for you at different fees, which are displayed on a board.Not far from the temple complex is a quiet beach, which I found as peaceful as the temple with no visitors. It looked like a fishing beach with many small boats dotting the place.The place where you have to take a left turn from the ECRoad if you are coming from Chennai is easy to miss if you do not look for the traffic police signs and bikes there. The turning is near a fish market. Take flowers from here, beacuse they may not be available near the temple. The 150 metres road leading upto the next turn for the temple is crowded, rough and somewhat dirty. Ignore it and press ahead, because what awaits you will leave you cleansed internally."
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,Aaqarsh Aiyyar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 ‚Ä¢ Couples,South India‚Äôs own Puri,"This newly constructed temple, conceivably the cleanest temple of Chennai, is located at about 400 metres from Kanathur (ECR road) and is the new home of Puri Jagannath (of course along with Balabhadra and Subhadra). I had been to puri last year and had to wait for long hours in queue to meet my little friends. This temple is less explored and so getting Jagannath's appointment was much easier.The temple also houses Kasi Vishwanath (Lord Shiva), Kanchi Ganesha, Mother Basil (Tulsi or Tulasi) and navagrahas (surprisingly in human form). The atmosphere is serene and it would be nice to spend some time out in the green lawn and enjoy the sea breeze. My advice to travelers is to avoid the beach closer to the shrine (about 200 meters), for it is one of the filthiest I've witnessed and more over you stand a good chance of getting bitten by crabs."

Minus the heat everything seems okay for me in the first place.But I must say the place I visited with my friends worth a visit for everybody staying in Chennai.It's just a 20 Mins drive from Thiruvanmiyur on the ECR Road towards Mahabalipuram.You can go by bike, Car & as well as in busses, there are frequent buses from Thiruvanmiyur Bus Depot.The drive itself was an enjoyable one on the ECR.It was Saturday when we visited the temple, expecting a little bit more crowd than the usual days but to our shear surprise it was not that crowded.That eventually went well for the beautiful n serene place.You can feel a sense of purity & calmness.They tried to keep it simple & make it as similar to The Jagannath Temple in Puri & they successed  in that also.I wish, it could only keep an eye on the road connecting from ECR to the Temple, as that was really filthy, thanks to the local people.Apart from that everything else was divine.And of course they do have an AnandBazar preparing the famous ""Abadha"" (the traditional prasad).One meal per person costs 70/-. Try to book prior. As they make food only call on service basis to avoid the wastage of Prasad.Visit once in a while & I bet you'll love it."

There are residential places, I guess even an industrial building bordering the edges and it's obvious that they have made the backwaters a mini-dumping yard. Bottles,covers floating in the water ; garbage mounds visible within minutes of starting the ride don't really make it an enjoyable affair. I assume that the place had a sprawling fauna because even now after all the contamination I could see quite a few birds which actually is sad. Needs an overhaul badly to save this place and experience."

The boats are big and you have to wait until nearly all the seats are filled before the boat ride. It's nice. I love the sea, I love boats, and all this neatly fits in. My son loves boat rides too. The way the fishes jump out of the water make you think whether it's Barracuda hunting grounds. Pity no BRracuda has leapt out yet, ever. If you visit the restaurant, stay away from the kitchen or risk losing your appetite. Brave that and risk loosing your bowels. The kitchen area, though strictly vegetarian, is not for the faint hearted, just the fleet footed. Overall, a great way to spend a lazy Sunday evening with family."

Kovalam_Beach,Samshell2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Stinky and average beach,"I would definitely not suggest this beach for a visit as it is mainly a fishing beach and stinks. There were lot of fishing boats parked along the shore hence to get a proper calm place to sit, you need to walk a bit along the beach shore. I visited this beach on a Saturday evening as this was very near to my house like around 8 km. If you are new to Chennai then there are better beaches to explore like breezy beach and Elliot's beach which are more cleaner. The crowd at the beach was less and you can easily get paid parking near the beach. The sea was rough and the waves get higher and higher as the sun sets so be aware if you are not a swimmer. You can find too many fortune teller's with a cute little parrot in a cage hanging on their arm and can definitely try your luck as they charge just rs. 30/- per person. I did try it and it was not so worthy. Beware of beggars around the beach as they curse you if you don't offer them money üòúüòú. This is not the place for people who is looking to spend some peaceful and quality time with family. Worth a visit ?? definitely No. "

Kovalam_Beach,SagarVS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Dirty beach,"I see no reason for you to visit this beach. Its dirty for sure and the same as any fishing hamlet down the coast from Chennai. If you go after 9 am you might see the fishermen come back from sea with their normally disappointing catch. But, that you can see in other places too. Also be careful when you swim, there are no guards, no warnings and people have drowned before. Skip."

Kovalam_Beach,Nedungilli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-15,Good beach to visit,"I have at least visited this place 15 times in past 8 months. I usually start 6:00Am on saturdays using OMR. In OMR once you reach kelambakkam take left to reach Kovalam beach. THe main purpose I go there is to buy fresh fish. If you reach there by 6:00AM you can see 100s of boats returning with lot of fishes. If you want to buy fish directly got to fisher man and start negotiating. I wont say it would be cheap but surly fresh.For a fish worth of 300Rs . The price will start from 500. But you can ask your price. Do not hesitate to ask the lowest price. I usually ask for Rs100 for worth of Rs 300. SoI will end up paying RS 250. But its all based on your skiil to talk to them in local language.If you have the skill to identify fish name by just looking at it and familiar with its price, then you can make good buy.Those people will easily identify your knowledge on fishes. For example if you ask them , "" Is this fish good for frying? "" It simply shows your lack of knowledge in fish. If they find you dont know about fish then differently you will be cheated.You will also find small market and local women selling fishes there. Never buy from them. Instead you can buy spoiled fish from roadside shop at higher price. If you want to know more about this place, Please write to me."

But we were quite surprised. the beach has lot of rocky formations where we could actually climb. The place that we approach the beach might be crowded with the fisherman boats and the fish market etc. But we can walk past this and walk further right the beach will be quieter and neater. The place is not commercialized yet. It is very less crowded than other beaches of Chennai. So don't expect coffee shops/ ice cream parlors next to the beach front. The beach is at a walkable distance from the bus stop.

This now deserted church with a watchman and a family of caretakers was built by the thriving Armenian trading community so many years ago. It still stands tall in the silence. The watchman strictly prohibits photography  and so there are no photos from my visit. The small church has a closed sanctum, shielded by a curtain, I think that only the priests are allowed in. There is not much to see in the church but the premises offers a peaceful rest for a weary person.There are some photographs in the entrance that throws some light on the place but I wish there were more."

Several Armenians migrated from current-day Iran to Madras in the 17th century and became thriving merchants. Naturally they built a church in 1712 (which was destroyed) and a new church was built again in 1772 which stands to this day. The city has evolved to a noisy and bustling environment outside the church - the traffic is almost unbearable. The church is a very welcoming place with a nice garden and several historic markers inside. It was a cemetery before it was a church and you can see the tombstones of the early Armenians who were born in Iran and died in Madras. The caretaker is a very friendly Anglo-Indian who fills you in with the history of the church and the Armenians. The place is also a testament to the religious diversity and tolerance of the Chennai people. Definitely a visit worth making when one is in Chennai."

Parry_s_Corner,Ravi D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-16,Foreign travel?,"When I first arrived in Chennai as a student in 1967 the local accent lingo made me wonder how we could have a ""Paris Corner"" in then erstwhile Madras (now Chennai). It took me a while to figure out that the presence of Dare House, the Headquarters of Parry & Company. Factually, I was aware of Parry's because those days when I was only 5 years old the Mathrubhumi Weekly had a comic strip on the back inside cover, sponsored by this Corporate - Baban & Molly (transliterated from Malayalam spelling). Often the last strip would have an advertorial where the bus is not moving and to a query ""where is the driver? ""the stock answer was, ""He has gone to buy Parry's mittai"". That said, the presence of the Burma Bazaar nearby offers a wide range of 'foreign' goods, from perfumes to 2-in one tape recorders, travel bags and torches to variety items. Broadway stretch offers the middle class and poor an excellent opportunity to buy fruits and vegetables and flowers, though the wholesale markets have been progressively shifted out to Koyambedu. Once the iron and steel and other traders are also vacated this will become an old world charm of residences with a few temples dotting the locality. The lighthouse atop the High court is the oldest dating back to Madarasapatnam with the court buildings with its Indo-Sarscenic architecture in red brick being a sight to cherish in itself. One kilometre away is the Goddess temple(Kalikambal Kamadeswarar) Temple reportedly visited by Chatrapathy Shivaji during his Southern conquests. His picture still hang inside."

I got a nice frame for my Rayban (a bounty dished out from my rummaging of my shelves after a long time). I could not get the frame in any formal shops. But in the platform, for Rs 200, i could get the frame and two years now, it is still intact. I have just given an example.Please make sure to get the ver kadalai (groundnuts) as you are walking or else you will not get into the spirit of shopping. You have every type of shop to address your various needs, not to miss out the umpteen eateries. Every hotel there has few good items to savour - samosas at Cosmo, Snacks at Ramakrishna, full meals at Saravana, With the Sea just a kilometer away, you will always have the sea breeze caressing your face and hair (if you are lucky to have some left - this punt only for guys).

The name of the place, ‚ÄòPatalAdri‚Äô also gives a similar expression, as in Sanskrit ‚ÄúPatal‚Äù means red and ‚Äúadri‚Äù means hill.This Narasimha Swamy temple is constructed on the hill; rather it appears as if the hill by itself is the temple. It was originally a cave temple, which was later extended by Gopuras and Mandapams. It is considered as one of the Abimana Sthalams of Lord Vishnu.The Garbhagriha of this temple is a cave. The Moolavar  of this Temple is Ugra Narasimha Swamy (gigantic deity) in a sitting posture with Abhaya Hastha, holding the Paanchajanya and Sudharsana Chakra .A unique feature here is that, in this temple devotees can worship the third eye of Ugra Narasimha Swamy. It is a very thrilling experience to witness the priest lifting the Naamam on the forehead of the Lord, beneath which the third eye is seen. It is said that if one gets to worship the third eye of the Lord, all miseries get destroyed.The Garbhagriha is a cave and the Moolavar is part of the hillock itself. Hence, devotees who want to do Pradakshina , have to go around the entire small hillock. Hence, Giri Pradhakshinam is very popular hereWhile walking around the temple, one can spot an Azhinjal tree. This tree is considered most sacred and is said to have been mentioned in the ‚ÄòNaachiyaar Thirumozhi‚Äô composed by Aandaal. Devotees praying for marriage or children tie a small piece of thread from their clothes on the branches of this tree. By doing this with a wish, it is believed that their wishes are granted."

This Ugra Narasimghar has third Eye, like Lord Siva and while making aarthi, the priest showed us the third Eye of Lord Narasimgha, by lifting the jewelled Thiruman of Lord. Oh, we felt Lord Narasimgha's blessing from His abhaya mudra hands. Another important aspect of this temple is Pradhakshanam - circumventing the Lord's  sanctum. Since the Lord's sanctum is inside the rock cut cave, we have to go around the small hillock- with convenient steps to climb and descend , making pradhakshanam easier for all.

The place has been maintained clean and always provided inner peace whenever I visit the temple.In 1956,¬†Chandrashekarendra Saraswati¬†Swamigal, a twentieth-century saint and seer of the Kanchi Mutt, visited Chromepet. On looking at the hill, he proposed that a temple be built for Murugan. The temple for Siddhi Vinayagar was built in the same year. Twenty years later, while clearing the hillside for a path, a lance, the prime weapon of Lord¬†Muruga, was found. This inspired the devotees to speed up work.¬†The consecration of the Sri Swaminathaswamy temple was performed in 1979. Slowly, more shrines were added for Shiva, Sarabeshwara, Ambal and the Navagrahas.A five tier Rajagopuram has been constructed recently. Though the spade work had commenced long ago, the actual construction work on the Rajagopuram commenced in 2011-12 and concluded in January 2014. Renovation and painting works have also been carried out in the temple in connection with the Mahakumbhabhishekam (consecration ceremony). A new Artha mandapam adjoining the Rajagopuram has been constructed. A few civil works remain to be completed(February 2014). A new Dwajasthambam (Flag Mast) has also been erected. Cultural and religious events like music, dance and discourses were held at the Arunagirinathar Hall inside the temple precincts every day for over a year in 2013-14 as a part of the Rajagopuram construction and temple renovation."

The deity and the poojas are very good. the temple timings are pretty much standard timings but check on those religious /auspicious dates for lord Murugan as this temple will be very crowded on those days. Do not miss the lakshmi narasimhar temple which is just opposite to this temple (at the foothill). That is also a very nice temple. There are small shops nearby for buying pooja /archana items.

Sure it has its locational advantage, its features, its car parking areas, near the Marina, with all trendy shops inside, but of late this is becoming a little outdated and stale.  Sometimes one has opportunity to have a glimpse of celebrities and their families too.  One of the best attractions as per me is the LANDMARK shop and of course the digital theatres.  Eateries are aplenty.  A pricey place but on festive occasions you do have some good bargains."

I love to watch the games from galleries and enjoy the fun with spectators including dancing, whistling, mexican wave.  Since my boyhood days, i have been going to this stadium.   Those days we use to carry Curd rice, Tamarind rice, idly etc along with friends and enjoy home food.  I still cherish the great innings played by Gundappa Viswanath in 1975 against mighty West Indies.  He scored a magnificient 97 runs unbeaten. Sachin Tendulkar's century in 2008 chasing 387 runs was also special. IPL matches were delightful, colourful.  The TIE test in 1986 against Aussies."

MS Dhoni has taken active interest in designing the stadium so  that the bowlers and the batsmen could take advantage of the evening breeze.

The chennai crowd is always sportive and give a standing ovation to all performers even if it is India or any other country. The mexican wave is a nice thing to experience here. Things to improve: food spread and a bit of cleanliness needs to be taken care of. The beach is close by. So the stadium might get windy at times."

The match was headed for a nail biting finish on the 5th day (which sadly got washed out).Also been here for a few IPL matches.The stadium experience is simply different with crazy shouting and cheering.However, the seating is not entirely appropriate since there is literally no ventilation.

Very pleasant but the seating could have been better. Plastic deck chairs were not comfortable. The snack and lunch vendors were not good, not very organized to sell to the crowd within the allotted lunch hour.

Seating was comfortable, a miracle given that just a couple of days before it had been strewn all over the stadium by a cyclone. Entry is chaotic, not helped by our gate being next to the open sewer/polluted watercourse that runs along one side of the ground - its best to breathe through your mouth. Reasonable selection of food on offer but water only available in paper cups which the vendors handle insides of with hands they use for the money. You cannot bring bottled water in yourself.There were more security and ticket checks than I have ever had including boarding international flights."

Sadly half of the stadium was shut due to the fact (we were told) that three stands had been built without planning permission.Would recommend a visit - maybe to a Chennai Super Kings game - if they ever return to the IPL - they were banned due to ""irregularities"" sadly something that seems to plague cricket in the sub continent."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,ErnieGodalming,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Basic stadium,"Not the greatest stadium that I have been to with half the ground out of commission due to planning and construction difficulties. seating comprised old plastic bucket seats with tie straps. The ground was having to cope with a recnet cyclone but was filthy and overwhelming stench from the Buckingham canal was at times overpowering and food should be avoided as one person from our hotel ate the doughnuts on offer and was hospitalised. The cricket did provide plenty of the right runs, however. "
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,oaksfield,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Indian Bureaucracy at its best!,"Went to see the text match cricket in December 2016.  They wouldn't sell tickets to anyone until the actual day.  People were coming out at 'tea' and not being let back in despite valid ticket.  Had to queue from 6am to get ticket for 1 day.  Three sections not uses as apparently they didn't have necessary permissions to build them so couldn't use them.  The bureaucracy was diabolical, the stadium was only half full (at best) but they still didn't want to sell tickets.  Seats near the river had an over powering 'odour' ..... try to get seats up wind of these!  Such a pity they couldn't get their act together, very bad publicity for the country. Sadly England didn't do well either - but it was great watching the match."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Elaine,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Attractive stadium but could be so much better,"First of all, congratulations to the ground staff who got this stadium ready to host a test match just days after the cyclone had caused such devastation.We were in the main pavilion area with views of the attractive individual stands. However three of these are not used due to a Supreme Court ruling about planning permission and therefore detracts from the overall experience of sight and atmosphere.Our seating was plastic chairs cable tied together. Quite comfortable but far to many in each row obstructing the steps and no clear path between sections and the stairs.Considering the ground was half empty there was no need for this.Leaving the stand in a hurry would be almost impossible as there's only one exit to channel through.There were plenty of food and drink stalls with good prices. But drinks were served in paper cups, no bottles allowed. I prefer a bottle so I can keep sipping rather than drinking it all in one go.Security was shambolic and inconsistent which was frustrating.A nice stadium (please open all the stands).I enjoyed my visit."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,shrinikethv,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Needs to be organized better,"Recently visited this stadium for 5th test, India vs England. Stadium has improved a lot, getting much better. But three stands are currently useless which is a pathetic sight. Something has to be done to ensure these 3 stands are in use. The pricing of food inside the staidum is nearly twice as the MRP, which is too much!"
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,blueandy1mac,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Much improved,Looks a great stadium but needs to pass local planning requirements before 3 of its stands can be used again. Strangely they were in use for thee WC in 2011.
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,APK24,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Enjoyed a day at the cricket!,I visited recently for the India v England test match that took place here. The ground was in good condition inspite of the cyclone that lashed the city earlier in the month. I had a great fun day at the cricket. However i strongly recommend taking public transport or a cab to the ground as parking is an issue
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,ChrisJS51,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Shambolic organisation and poor facilitiews,"We watched the Fifth Test Match between India and England. Some highlights (or lowlights):- Two huge new stands were completely empty. This apparently is because of a dispute between the owner (who believes he is a law unto himself) and the local planning authorities who want him to pull the stands down- We arrived with tickets telling us to enter at Gate 10. Stewards gate 120 told us to go to Gate 11. Stewards at gate 11 told us to go to gate 10. They eventually got this sorted out on the second day- Most days, prospective spectators were being turned away on the basis that the ground was full. In fact, not only were the stands mentioned above completely empty, but none of the others were much more than half-full either- The stadium appears to be staffed entirely by contractors who have never worked at the place before and don't know how it should be run- The TVs in our air-conditioned box were almost completely invisible as the box was south-facing and the screens were in front of us - so the glare was overpowering- Access to the box was via one lift which took 12 people, and two staircases which ran from the ground floor to the fourth. The fourth was one floor above us, and provided open seating and ad hoc catering facilities. Both staircases were almost permanently locked (except for exit at the end of the day), and lift access to the fourth floor was disabled. To support this, the lift contained an operator who sat on a stool all day (taking up two spaces in the lift) and did nothing but press the buttons, and two security guards who sat all day by the locked gates to the staircases doing nothing. This was apparently done to stop people without tickets for our air-conditioned floor gaining access to it. The consequences were that: (1) the only access during the day in or out of our box (which sat several hundred people) was via one lift which took ten people; (2) to get up one floor for the catering or for an outside view, we had to go down in the lift to the ground floor then walk up four flights; (3) there was a massive fire risk. When our tour group leader remonstrated with the authorities about the fire risk, they said it was OK because in the event of fire the man with the key would come and open the locked gates (if you believe that you'll believe anything). We suggested that the security guards on the staircases unlock the gates and actually check tickets - this would be better than having them sat down all day next to a locked gate doing nothing - but we were ignored. Our tour guide contemplated taking us all out of the box for safety reasons, but it would have been quite obvious that the authorities would have done nothing about it and we simply wouldn't have been able to watch the cricket."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,jaytara,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Pompous staff,"Paid Rs 4000/- for a season ticket to watch the cricket Test in Dec 2016. Seats were fine, but the security was over the top, they wouldn't allow anything in, not even newspapers, and one had to buy overpriced and mediocre stuff inside. The bigwigs sat happily in the pavilion with nary a care. Chennai should not stage Test matches, the stadium is as bad as the airport."

It's easily one of the best stadiums to watch cricket in India. Scoreboards are well placed but there is only one big screen TV to watch the replays. Generally, snacks are served but they are not as hot/cold as you would prefer. The food court areas are always a mess and untidy and the toilets suck. Note that you would not be allowed to take any food items inside the stadium during matches - and that's just to make you buy the local fare available there at an exorbitant cost. Please be seated well in advance (30-60 mins) for the matches. In most cases, there are no seat numbers and you may end up standing for the entire duration of a match.Having said all this, there is no comparison to watching a match on TV and experiencing the match live on the grounds.

W. Spencer in Anna Salai, then known as Mount Road, in the Madras Presidency. The property originally belonged to Spencer & Co Ltd. Spencer & Co opened the first department store in the Indian subcontinent in 1895. It had over 80 individual departments. After a few years, Eugene Oakshott, owner of Spencer's, shifted the department store to a new building, which was an example of Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. The building was designed by W. N. Pogson. In 1983, the original building was destroyed in a fire.The present Spencer Plaza was constructed on the same site, measuring about 10 acres, and was opened in 1991.Spread across a million square feet built in three phases with parking space for 800 cars, the plaza is a major hangout for the people of Chennai. The mall was developed by Mangal Tirth Estate Limited in January 1993.It is said that the work started in 1985.One of the most sought after properties once about 38 years ago where all the main shops and showrooms were located and slowly there was a gradual deterioration in maintaining this place and then it became deserted and had a gloomy look and I was very disappointed to see this place with pigeons flying all around and I was wondering what happened to this place that I once used to visit and had such fond memories ?? Slowly it has been renovated and it‚Äôs trying to regain its past glory !!Dr.Javed Rasheed"

You can fins almost anything here at best prices.  Merchants will haggle the first price offered, but don't insult them by trying to get something for too low a price.  They need to make a profit and remember they will not agree to a price unless they are making some profit.  Clothing, artifacts and art pieces (if you hunt and know what you are hunting for), furniture, food, +++ can be found here.  I don't enjoy the modern malls in India as much as Spencer's  and I hope it continues for a long time to come."

During those times life in Chennai revolved around the Mall but slowly things started to decline. I would blame the shop keepers and tenants who slowly started to keep their wares outside their shops and showrooms, my friend has a shop there and he says that many of the tenants would not pay their maintenance. Due to lack of regular maintenance and acrimony among shop owners the Mall could not keep up their quality of maintenance and now hardly anyone goes to the mall.

People do try and persuade you to enter their shop if you so much as look in that direction, the goods itself are quite cheap compared to the shops some tuk tuk  drivers take you too, but you have to be careful in the scarf section since everything is pashmina even if you can swear its mixed polyester. The shops are all over the place and it's quite hard sometimes to locate where exactly you are since they are no maps around just names of shops as you go up each floor.Don't worry the shop vendors are quite helpful.But it you are looking for a good bargain, this is a good and cool place to start, just have a bit of patience and don't run on an empty stomach and this plaza will be enjoyable."

First the Jewel Mine (Phase I ground floor) has wonderful jewelry and with a little bargaining you can get awesome prices.  The staff is wonderfully friendly and they will also custom make jewelry for you.  In an annex to the jewelry store you can find other great items of good quality like pashmina or cashmere scarves and wraps, traditional carvings, and replicas of items like the old mogul knives.  Plan to be in this shop for a good while as there is plenty to see and they will want to show you everything lol...but in the nicest of manners.I also like Nuts N Spices to stock up on any hard to find items like premade spices for Masala Chai which I love.  If you live in a city where Indian ingredients are hard to find this is a great destination as they carry everything you might need to create that favorite Indian dish.  There are still additional nice shops for clothing and other goods at Spencer too.  Many of the newer malls gouge you on parking...but not this one.  Do check it out."

It is also called as Nadu Naatu Srirangam and is one of the 108 divyadesam.At the base of Thiruneermalai hill is a temple for  Neervanna Perumal who is in a standing posture. The temple atop the hill which can be reached by climbing about 250 steps, and many elders also climb with spirits easilyThe main one is for Lord Ranganatha, reclining on the serpent Adisesha and facing South with  Sridevi and Bhudevi  Thayaars near the feet. The other deities on the hill-top are  Trivikrama (seen in the walking pose), Narasimha (in the seated posture) and Goddess Lakshmi, enshrined as Ranaganayaki Thayar, the consort of Ranganatha.In the base temple there is a slogan "" Narayanan ingu ninraan irunthaan nadanthaan kidanthaan"" implies Lord vishnu lives here in four poses.An important feature of Thiruneermalai is that Vishnu is seen here in four poses ‚Äî standing (as Neervanna Perumal), seated (as Narasimha), reclining (as Ranganatha) and walking (as Trivikrama or Ulagalanda Perumal). While the procession deity (utsava murti) in most Vishnu temples is generally worshipped in front of the main idol, in the hill-top shrine, only the large central deity is seen and His processional idol Azhagia Manavalar is inside the temple at the foothills.Moolavar (Nadandhaan) ‚Äì Thrivikraman ( Vamana) seen in standing posture facing east.Reminding the Vamanavathara (Dwarf incarnation), the Lord is in the walking order asking where to place his third step after measuring all the worlds in two steps . The left leg is lifted up to shoulder level unlike in Kanchipuram and Tirukoilur where it is the right leg lifted to 90 degrees .Moolavar (Irundhaan) - Saantha Narasimhan seen in seated posture facing east.Considering the appeal of boy Prahlada who was afraid of his fury, the Lord appears in a calm and pleasant mood as Shantanarasimha and also as Balanarasimha. (There is a small moolavar with prahaladha kept in front of the main lord about 1 foot tall) The lord is welcoming bhaktas with the left hand and the right hand shows abayam Yesterday when I visited the temple there was chariot pulling of Neervannaperumaal along the neighbouring streets.People celebrate this event welcoming Neervannaperumal by decorating their house front side with Rangoli along the streets.The local residents celebrate the event with light music and giant speakers renting the air.This temple is a divyadesam and also a swayambhu kshetram.I noted this event in my calendar with a hope to visit the temple again next year on the same day.

Actually in Google Maps it looks very close to the Kundrathur Murugan temple too and so you can plan to visit both these temples in one go. The steps aren't many or very steep but do carry water as they can run you out of breath, particularly in hot summer. Watch out for monkeys though they aren't much of a bother here at this temple.

Chokhi_Dhani,monitrathore,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Traditional,"Visited this place for celebrating mom's birthday. There's nothing much to see here. It's a replica of the ancient deserts of Thar, which you won't feel like. When I went inside, the start was good but later, I got bugged. Can't stay here for more than two hours. Food was totally Rajasthani, not my type. But you sure can visit this place ONCE, for those camel rides & bullock rides & mini-boating & tobacco-based hookah & so on."
Chokhi_Dhani,Praveenop,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,A place with lots of potential but held back due to mis management,This place can actually be a hub of entertainment but the management started this venture with a great idea but somewhere the place did not match up to my expectation. The vision seem to be fantastic but  the result and the vision seem to be far away from each other but there is hope...... If the management wakes up and give the management to a professional set up it will work out well for all.

Atleast they could have explained this to me on my arrival that its too late to cover everything. I was fooled, really upset. money minded people. Never prefer, so costly & cheaters too.Food taste is not that good, magician borrowed money from me forcefully, Guide too asking tip. Dont go here"
Chokhi_Dhani,Wilson J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Kind of okay,Amazing place to hangout with friends and family. Kids will enjoy. Went there with my and cousin's family. All the kids enjoyed the place and rides. But far from the city but worth going there. Reasonable price. Shopping inside the place had good Rajasthani collections. Camel ride was good. The tall guy standing at the entrance was a good entertainment.

Offers a variety of entertainment and rides basednon the package you choose. It could be pretty much crowded on a weekend or holidays. The food is excellent  and offers varieties of Rajasthani dishes. Ideal for vegetarians and those who love vegetarian food. If you are looking to spend 3-4 hours away from Chennai and bored of malls and beaches, this place  is for sure worthy of a visit. It opens only at 4pm and the dinner (Thali) starts at 6 30 pm. Make sure to buy the appropriate package based on your need and not what they offer"

Chokhi_Dhani,Anand Subbu,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Great place, excellent ambience, unique experience, BUT","The place gives you a very unique experience of Rajasthani culture. There is folk singing, dancing (and Ghoomer!), magic show, camel and bullock rides, chariot rides and many more to entertain both kids and adults. An excellent way to spend the evening, and to experience the rustic atmosphere. Now, as to the 2 star rating, it is because of the following:a) The food - while the taste was pretty okay, the service is pathetic. There is no cutlery; it is served in thin silver foiled plates and paper cups. The dining halls were stinking with bad odour. For the money you shell out, this is a total no-no. b) The Khichidi and sambar rice were COLD! Ever imagine eating authentic Rajasthani khichidi which isn't hot? It was a let down. When asked, the staff were not polite and mocked the guests aloud about serving hot curd rice. So much for good service...c) Cleanliness was lacking around the food stalls. The staff were using unwashed hands to serve customers. The kulfi stall will especially make you wince, since it lacked the basic hygiene -- the staff using a dagger to open the ice candies with bare hands in a dingy and dark place outside in the park!d) Lastly, the ticket counter charges Rs. 10 extra per ticket if you are paying by credit or debit card. At a point where the whole of India is moving towards digitization, it seems the folks at Choki Dhani want to penalize people who do so."

Nothing a bit has changed on the rides. they are equally comfortable and enjoyable. What we were taken back is on the food . A lip smacking Rajasthani cuisine serving was oru craving and expectancy ( like the first time we visited). Our craving was put to grave and the offering is not something to recollect. It was new for a foodie like me to know that sambar rice / curd rice /  kerala papad  were added to rajasthani cuisine. Adding to the slip was oil soared puri , 6 small servings of eatable small bites that were failing to tingle our taste buds,. Outright it was a not a worth try in visiting CD for a lip smacking Rajasthani cuisine and the best option is to taste it else where but for CD. our 450 rupees had been drained as kalapani  ."

One more reason for this choice for new year celebrations is that this is closer to my home, just 5 min drive.As mentioned in reviews, right from the spacious parking lot to 5 different chats, good quality buffet of north indian and south indian food - highlight being that it is of Pure Veg which is very rare nowadays.Also there were many cultural programs going on which we can attend like rajasthani dance, rope walking, magic show, DJ etc. Also the architectural finesse of rajasthani has been captured well right through the place. Nice place to chill out with friends and family, though am not sure it will be of the same during other days of the year too."
Chokhi_Dhani,Compulsive Traveler,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Good, but Not quite the original ","Having experienced the excellence of the original Chokhi Dhani in Jaipur and the Pune establishment, we were really looking forward to a repeat at Chennai this time. Whether it was the new year eve or something else that I couldn‚Äôt lay my finger on, I came away a tad disappointed. Infrastructurally, it nearly matches the other two with all attractions in place. They have the full complement of animal rides (Camel, Horse, Bullock Cart) and cultural performances (Traditional dance and folk songs).However, in terms of the variety and quality of snacks offered, it is not at par. The main course, though, comes close to the original. The famed Rajasthan ‚Äúkhatirdari‚Äù was on full display.The performances also lacked the energy seen in other branches, perhaps because of the sheer fatigue of entertaining over 2500 guests in one evening.However, the venue still offers one of the best showcases of Rajasthani village life in the South.Definitely worth a visit for those who want to experience the magic of Rajasthan in an evening."

Chokhi_Dhani,YashiR25,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Mini Rajasthanin Chennai,"Went here in June. Those who want to experience Rajasthan in Chennai, it's a place for them. From the camel safari to the traditional welcome; from the food to the ambience, from pot-making to welcome drink, everything is amusing and authentic Rajasthani.Staff is courteous but a bit greedy for the tips. Besides, booking a cab (Ola/Uber) back from there is very difficult. So, better go by your own car/or book a cab in advance to avoid the hassle. Else like we did, Fasttrack is always available :DOverall. recommended at least for one visit. Nice place to spend time with your crazy group :D But it is situated too far from main city. The tour can be clubbed with visiting QueensLand Water Park as it is nearby only (Though, I have not been there)."

Chennai people may like to have a long camel ride but all the rides were short distances.Initial starters were good.Better to be in the place by 4pm and book dinner time as 730pm is very ideal.Food served is good but not great. Very difficult to sit down and eat with the table provided.Very cramped seating arrangements.The dining hall staff were courtesy.Best place to relax with kids and one time can be visited.

Chokhi_Dhani,Sasikumar C,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Very bad attitude of staff, poor management, zero hospitality.","on 12th August i went with my family to this place for the 1st time. at the entrance we were impressed the welcome dance. we booked for a INR 800.00/person package. it was  little raining that evening at 6.00pm later it stopped at 6.45pm. Once you purchase the ticket the staff attitude changes. It is 15 acers theme park, they have quiet a few spots were you interact with their staffs. The traditional dancers, the pot maker were very kind with all the visitors. But the staff at all the rides are very arrogant, they 1st denied ride saying because the soil is wet there is no Horse and camel ride. we were told to take bullock cart ride. Then i went to the reception counter to complain. the manager said it is raining and they cannot have the ride. but actually it was not raining then. I kept insisting to start the ride. the manager was with no care attitude. then i had to raise voice in front of the incoming guest thus the manager told me to go the spot and he will start the ride. I came back to the ride location the boy over there told me. he cannot start the ride. i have taken my little son only to have camel ride, so i went back to the manger, who came with me and told the boys over there to start the ride. After 40 mints of struggle i succeeded in getting a camel ride of 2 mins for my son. We went happily to this place to enjoy but all that we got was only irritations after paying them. Food was very average.The most annoying part is there are many child labour engaged on job.If the service remains same, they may get one timers but nobody will repeat."

The place is a perfect family outing spot since it is situated on a sprawling open ground and you need to spend atleast 5-6 hours to enjoy all the fun it has to offer.You can travel on camel, bullocks among others. There is also a boat ride but it is not open always. You would also get to see magic show, traditional dance apart from other games like shooting, ring throw.You can also get your head massage done. You would be served welcome drink and dinner. All these are included in the package.To summarise, it is a perfect fun destination which will not cost much but gives you the ultimate pleasure. Advisable to go in the evening."

Rides:The place is not worth the cost they charge, there are camel rides, horse rides and bullock cart rides available but they are just for 10 to 15 ft's distance.They charge extra for camel safari, it just goes some extra distance that's all.For kids above 3 yrs, they are charging 450, 550, 600, including dinner, how many 3 yrs and 4 yrs will eat full thali, they can reduce amount for kids.2. Refreshments:snacks are good, but drinking water is cooled corporation water, water bottle should be bought at extra cost, for 25Rs bottle they charge 30 Rs.3. Rest Room:No proper lights, water is dripping, the heath wash doesn't work.4. Dinner:Its rajastani cusine so south Indians will not like it, they serve in some order chapathi and poori first and then later only if everybody in the square has eaten they provide rice, since my son dint like the chapathi I asked for white rice, they declined serving it. They said only after serving sambar rice and pulav they will serve white rice itseems.3 persons served for our square, all wore gloves but still they served in left hand the chapathi's and poori's, even rice, which was so horrible.I heard comment from everybody in the square was "" we should have some idly on the way to home"".we have sit cross legged for dinner, even though there is cusion, how will elders sit down, they should have some provision for them atleast.5.

It does take about 3 hours, so best to book the dinner time accordingly. In summers, later the better. "
Chokhi_Dhani,Naveen J N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,NOT a Must see attraction!!,"Choki Dhani originally having their branches only in Northern India / Maharashtra etc., branched out to the South India in recent years.Chennai was one such location.Concept is to mostly display the Rajasthani culture, mostly folk culture & to an extent it is successful. Architecture does resemble the Forts, Village houses that you get to see in Rajasthan, Gujarat or Haryana states in India. You do get to see the traditional cooking styles, pottery making, Folk dances, Rituals etc. There are different ticket prices / ticket structures based on the no. of attractions you opt for.There is a basic level ticket where in you can go inside watch everything, have dinner at the end.Then there are higher priced tickets where you get to go on camel rides, bullock cart rides, play few games etc., Typically highest priced ticket covers all attractions.Dinner & snacks is covered in all the tickets, so never stop from eating your heart out since that was the biggest attraction as far as I was concerned!! ÔÅäI had paid for the highest priced tickets. One has to select your dinnertime before hand‚Ä¶. This is done may be to avoid large crowds at one point of time.So, you get inside with a traditional tilak on your forehead. A guide will accompany you through the session.If you are a bigger group or pay for higher price tickets, you get a dedicated guide for your group.There is a small water pond for a 2 min. fun boating (Peddle boats). Then you get to see local village magician, traditional pottery making, Folk dances etc.You can get some designer mehendi (Henna) on your hands if interested. Further there are camel, horse, bullock cart & horse chariot rides.Then there are fun games like shooting, archery etc., similar to what you see in the Village melas‚Ä¶ or if you have watched old hindi movies with Mela scenes then you know what I m talking about here!The only thing I might recommend or ask you not to miss is the Head massage. Cools your body & mind‚Ä¶ ensures a good nights‚Äô sleep ÔÅäIn between all these activities you get to taste some local snacks & drinks (Non-alcoholic & healthy ÔÅä ) like jalebi, gulab jal, Bhajjis, miniature rotis etc. all cooked in traditional vessels & stoves. There are few small shop setups selling handmade articrafts‚Ä¶ Though they were attractive, I found them pricey.After you are done will all the above stuff, it‚Äôs time for dinner!I have to tell that I was bit disappointed. After what I paid for the ticket, I was expecting something extravagant‚Ä¶. At least some where close to the Rajdhani Thali!!But there are limited items on the menu.. they do taste good & authentic, satisfy the taste buds to certain extent. I have to tell you that there were few Expats with us who thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, as everything was new & exciting for them.It was not the same for us‚Ä¶ So interpretations might differ based on your personal experience.How to reach : Plenty of buses running from Chennai Koyamedu Bus stand, T. Nagar, Tambaram etc. to Sriperumbadur. Take an AC bus run by Chennai MTC to beat the heat & get down at Thandalam bus stop.It‚Äôs a 5 min. walk from Thandalam bus stop. There are no trains‚Ä¶ Else, just take a cab from where ever you are in Chennai. Ubers, Olas or any other local taxi services will drop you here.P.S : Restrooms are not well maintained, you may skip this place unless you are going to burst soon!!Overall it‚Äôs an average experience for me‚Ä¶ Nothing to lose if you skip this place!"

Chokhi_Dhani,Vijay S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Beautiful concept spoiled by 'tip hungry' staff,"The concept is beautiful. The place is done up well. The food is good...tasty and hygienic. Activities (rides, dances, magic shows etc.) are good, but the staff who facilitate these are always hungry for tips. They go on with their 'Ram Ram' after every activity. If this is the case, why does Chokhi Dhani charge an 'inclusive' price for these activities?My thought process is this...when I have paid the money for a particular package, I am looking for a decent experience. I want to smile and say a respectful 'Thank You' to every performer / staff who is trying to make our evening enjoyable. But the moment the staff / performer starts with her / his 'Ram Ram' when they are not supposed to, the entire respect goes for a toss, and I just want to leave that place without even looking at their eyes.Everywhere there are boards clearly mentioning 'No Tips Please'...then why do these performers / staff expect tips for everything they do? And why is the management not monitoring and doing something about these greedy individuals (right from the activities facilitators to the dining hall staff) who are bringing a bad name to the place."
Chokhi_Dhani,He Makes All Things Beautiful,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,GOOD attraction spoiled by the staff over there.,"The attraction is near Queensland theme park not very far from chennai. The entrance welcomes you saying parking at owner's risk .Mgmt is not able to provide proper security for your vehicles. Reception staff are neither enthusiastic nor friendly to receive  you. Have a village type environment neatly planned .Maintained well. Lawns are dry, may be improved.Rates are bit high. Hospitality is very poor.They provide five varieties of snacks in addition to a welcome drink of jeera water. The snacks will be given as per the token given. Snacks qty is less but of ok taste.The left out snacks were lying in the area as proper cleaning not available to remove the left out snacks from that area. The facilty has lot of attractions. But main worry is that they will do the task if only you show them the currency. Everywhere no tips board is available. But why every staff is asking for money from you with authority. May be they may provide a begging vessel to every employee . Really poor discipline among the staff  and no control over them. The rides were not free. Staff taking money directly  for the ride. we have horse, camel rides along with carts drawn by camel, horse and bullocks. Good experience and children enjoy a lot.No proper guidance. The artists will perform on request but will request for some tips by their gesture.Felt embarrasment by everyone over there by their gesture. These things will definitely spoil the environment. The food was served in a hall in Rajasthani style. Food was nice and varieties were few. However it was tasty. Management may look into the discipline of the staff. During evening time you can spend leisurely in few locations for  a family chat. Proper seating arrangements may be given."

The food served was not really hot, variety was limited, servers very just keen to complete their job quickly and without even waiting for your response used to fill plates and if you request for something they felt very hesitant.

Chokhi_Dhani,kathan5,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Mini Rajasthani Village @ Chennai,"Chokhi Dhani - a good place for a weekend evening time. A good ethnic village depicting the heritage and authenticity of Rajasthanis. You need to be a little early to spend and utilise maximum time as in weekends you get decent crowds. Kids will enjoy the place as they have several activities like bullock cart ride, horse ride, camel ride, mud pot making, butter churning etc. You will have a crowd who will never follow queue, they will make all their kids sit and then even the mom will sit, in fact the pot maker only makes everything and only for photo sake he will make one to keep the hands close by the pot making wheel. Cultural dance was good, people join along with the dancer and make the movements was more lively.The entire place was clean and decent. They say everywhere NO TIPS, but everywhere tips is expected. Food served was good but not the wide range of choice like the rajdhani way. Taste is good. Clean food serving area. Seating was good. Rajasthani photography was good, wearing their ethnic dresses and taking pics, but very expensive. One print costs 250/-. Go early and enjoy. Being late will surely disappoint you. Ensure you have atleast 3-4 hours to spend here. Worth a spend for a weekend getaway."

Chokhi_Dhani,gausan51,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Visit a Rajsthani village in Chennai,"While I had been to Jaipur during 2001, I had the opportunity to visit CHOKI DHANI near Jaipur. Nowadays many youngsters who are from city atmosphere do not know the habits and functions of villagers and the their traditions. I enjoyed for more than four hours and at Chennai recently I visited the CHOKI DHANI along with my family members. It is situated in the main national highway from Chennai to Bangalore next to Queens land. On an average it is twenty kilometres from the heart of the city and from the main road the village is available at a distance of two kilometres and sufficient parking place is available. For the inforamtion of the visitors, they have established various pavillions and various types of traditional dances are performed by the efficient dancers from Rajasthan. We can have a nice tea along with some snacks. We can have a bullock cart ride; camel ride and we can also play some games - like baloon shooting; ball hitting and many more. Ladies can wear rajasthani dresses and take attractive photographs and people will really believe that they are from Jaipur or Udaipur. One man is walking on a rope from this end to that end duly supported by bands. Still many more are available like - fire dance, fire drill etc., Dinner is provided as per Rajasthani style and the food as per Rajasthani menu is provided and we can see people enjoy the food like anything. The village is open by 4.00 P.M. and by night it looks a typical village only on account of minimum lighting and it takes minimum five hours to viisit the maximum places in the village. Do not forget to visit the village while you come to Chennai and you can tell your relatives as if you had visited a village in Rajasthan."

The service is also very good.Tips:Go early in the evening to this place so that you can enjoy before it gets crowded.Weekdays are more crowded as usual. Going early on a weekday would make this more pleasant.Don't eat too many small rotis that are given in various huts as this may spoil the dinner appetite :)Visit this place without any expectations and you will be more than happy!"

Not worth going again"
Chokhi_Dhani,parthansr,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,A glimpse of Rajasthani lifestyle,"Right from the welcome drink to snacks, entertainment and rides everything will let you experience a typical Rajasthani way of life. The place is perfectly built to replicate such an experience and has people from Rajasthan to run the show. Although public announcements could be made in English or Tamil to benefit the non-Hindi speaking crowd. The best part of the experience is the dinner bhojan in a typical dining hall where you get to sit on the ground (on cushions) while they serve typical Rajasthani cuisines on your place. The rates are nominal considering the food and the rides that comes along with it. Nothing comparable to theme parks but nonetheless a different experience indeed."

Chokhi_Dhani,Saritoo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Bit of north in the south!!,"A great place to visit for an evening of cultural entertainment and fun. We were a family of 5 adults and two toddlers. We visited on a Monday and arrived nice and early around 4 PM. We were one of the first ones to arrive and it was great.  A grand welcome of drums and traditional bindi before you arrive at the ticket office was a nice touch. Ticket prices vary depending on the package you choose. We chose one of the mid range option which included 5 rides and dinner. You are provided with a guide throughout your time inside except during dinner time. Children (and the adults) enjoyed various animal rides, Camel, Horse, bull cart and camel cart. The highlight for us was the live music and the various folk dances on small stages. When the sun sets for the day, the lantern style lights transform the place into something magical. The restaurant was very nicely decorated and seating arrangements were very good. The food was very good. We were told it gets very busy during the weekend, so its best to visit on a weekday."

Their food tasting, music, songs, people, and their courtesy is amazing. No peddlers, no expectation of tips, and they are simply eager to exhibit their heritage. Folks dancers are the best and mesmerizing. Puppet show is amazing. Kids enjoyed the camel ride. My daughter saw camel for the first time and she had a blast. Care takers were gentle and did not torture the animal with long rides. I did not care for the boat ride. Dinner was superb and almost has dream like feel in the restaurent; ambience with folk singers and art work is simply hard to shake it off from my mind. Finally, people are so amazingly polite and humble. Not very spacious but a must see in Chennai."

Chokhi_Dhani,Sanath Kumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,A great place in the city,Have been there twice.. I think it's a great place to visit in the weekends when you have guests visiting. I suggest you reach there after 6 pm and you can spend around 4 hours. The place has various attractions from Rajasthan with local delicacies. Attractions include.. Magic shows.. Traditional dances.. Mehendi.. Massages.. Puppet shows.. Animal rides.. Artificial caves.. Boating... Etc.. The dinner however is the only let down. Not really authentic rajdhani food. Entry starts at 600..Surely a suggested place for the weekend.. 
Chokhi_Dhani,Prakashroops,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-15,"A place to getting the traditional touch of Rajasthan, worth a evening tripping","Locating the exit from the highway was difficult to find, but after a call to the office prompted us to locate the sign board. Once we reached the place, we realized that we were in a different world. We were welcomed by the traditional drummers of Rajasthan and we entered the fort. You have three packages to choose fro and the primary difference is on the rides. Children under the age of 12 would really enjoy. The winter weather was a welcome change from the heat and humidity of Chennai.It took me back to my childhood days while watching the street shows, rope walk......which most of the urban kids never get to see.  Traditional snacks and drinks can be had from various counters within the premises and they are all part of the package. The various rides available are on horse, camel, bullock car and camel cart. It was nice to also see the ""Parrot"" Astrologer. At the farther end of the venue is the dining area where dinner is served. Its traditional Rajasthani vegetarian food and it was fantastic.I'm of the opinion that this venue is not suitable for people who can't walk for long and surely not suitable for people on wheel chair.."
Chokhi_Dhani,BIJU_SAIL,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,High Expectations but returned disappointed,"Had a opportunity to experience Rajasthani Food and Culture during one of my visits to Ahmedabad , which had filled my heart . Had such high expectations after reading through various reviews about Chokhi Dhani . Finally on the Day of Christmas ,we a group of 12 had visited Chokhi Dhani which was closed to 30 Kms from Chetpet . There was heavy crowd at the reception/Ticket area which could have been well organised and also could have placed few more staff at the welcoming point which unfortunately had only one person . Tickets were priced between 450 to 700 (approx) . We had requested for camera to be taken but were advised that mobile cameras are allowed but professional cameras will be allowed at an non-refundable amount of Rs.5000 , which i think is unjustified since now a days modern mobile cameras have better resolution than professional cameras .The Village was well organized with complimentary Snacks like Chats etc. Also had good entertainments for children like Pottery , Magic Show , Games etc. Also had animal rides like camel and bullock cart, was totally shocked by the way the Bullocks were treated by its rider. He had not given the animal any rest as was trying to accommodate more people beyond its limit. Had to request the management to advise the rider to give the animals rest , which they readily did.There were two dinner options  Buffet and Table , we had opted for the table at 21.45 slot.The tables were spread in four rooms  , we had to wait for 30 mins after entering into the dining area going from one room to another to find seat for all twelve of us to sit together . Waiting out side the rooms were like we were waiting to be served free food . Finally at the Dinner table was disappointed since it was no were close the food that i had tasted in the past , the food served had a more of Tamilnadu touch than of Rajasthani . In All except for the Dinner ,rest of the Activities at the Village was worth Visiting."

Also during morning there is also drinking water. Beach is absolutely safe even in very early morning (I start my walk at 5AM and I see many people started before me). There have been lot of articles in local newspapers praising this beach for many goods. Currently I see lot of people flocking this beach during day time. From future consideration, I believe with the influx of more people, obviously parking will be an issue, so authorities should take right action so as to make sure it is not a mess."

The Breezy Beach in Valmiki Nagar is not that accessible and that means only locals frequent the beach. I usually stop by in the evenings to catch some fresh air and soak in the atmosphere.

The other way was some lovely very expensive looking houses and then a 'fun park' which I used for their toilet, but although it was trying to simulate Disney land-type experience it was just sad.  In need of a good coat of paint and some attractions.  Like all Indian beaches, covered in rubbish.  As this is a major turtle nesting beach, this needs to be addressed."

Several reasons to it... It is not as busy and crowded as the Marina or Elliots.  This is in a residential area so not much of trouble with automobiles and unruly traffic and not many hawkers too... Relatively cleaner than most other places as it is maintained well by well wishers and associations around Valmiki Nagar.  If somone outside of Chennai wants to have a peaceful evening at the beach and take a dip this is the place.  The skyline looks really beautiful and on a good high tide day you are sure to spot several vessels on the horizon."

In the evenings, the sea breeze is brilliant ! These days, you have hawkers like in Marina. So the place gets messy in the weekends.Avoid weekends - too much crowd, and parking can be a pain."

Secured because police patrolling is available.Peaceful because less crowded when compared to other beaches which are secured. There are many other beaches which are less crowded and clean than this, but they are not secured by even a person or lights. So this is the best beach to stay even till 9-10 PM. Beach is pretty calm and can be enjoyed by family with kids during evenings. Eateries are available but of limited varieties and that too made by localites. Good for walking.Good for evening stay and enjoying with family.Little eateries and toys selling for kids.Best accessible by public transport till Tiruvanmiyur RTO and from there you have to walk around 1km. Else direct transport is preferred.Cons : Beach is not so clean. Always crowded over week ends."

There is ample parking available on the roads leading up to the beach and there are not too many vendors around.A good place to visit in the evenings and enjoy the breeze. Grab a packed of roasted groundnuts from the cart-vendor and find a clean place to sit.You will see kids frolicking in the water, couples walking hand-in-hand and families enjoying a picnic.Getting into the water is not recommended, considering that it might not be as clean as you would hope. Anyways, you can get your feet wet!As with any beach, do not stay there late into the night since it may get quite lonely. Best time to visit is early in the morning, or after 5.30 pm."

Stood close to sea and enjoyed the sea waves coming towards us washing our feet and going back which is an excellent feeling every one should feel it to understand. We were warned not to venture into walking into sea as it may be deep and we may be dragged by waves into the sea. After some time we sat in a bajji - a south indian snack counter and tasted hot fresh bajjis of potato, banana and onion.

It's designed and looks like a zoo. The kids seems to have fun, but, I was pretty disappointed with the dry land (maybe due to my expectation that it would be more like a botanical garden). The animals were so well fenced in that it was difficult to see them even. Two standout exhibits were the aquarium and a cassowary (looks like a cross between a turkey and an emu). I payed 20 Rs for camera but would recommend others. As the animals and birds were fenced you can't get any good photos besides people were using their mobile phones for taking photos without any questions."

Try to visit the park in two trips as doing it all on one go can be very tiring. Pack somethings to eat as the options i found there did not look clean/ healthy. The animals looked tired and exhausted from the heat, although i found the zoo keepers busy with their feeding trucks restocking foods in the cages. Given the choice i would not be too happy seeing animals locked up but for the lack of anything better will be forced to go here to show kids/children what wild animals look in their living from as they have not seen anything else other than their pictures in school books. Do visit the animated show for a additional cost of Rs 40 but it is only in Tamil but do check it out for the AC -cooling factor a bit of solace from the scorching Chennai heat."

Guindy_National_Park,MArasu2000,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Don't have Great Expectations,"As kids, we grew up with only the Guindy National Park doubling as the Zoo @ Chennai. Later...came the Vandalur Zoo which took most of the animals (mostly wild) from Guindy to Vandalur.Must have been there over 10 times before I was 10 yrs old...atleast 6+ times during my kids growing stages...definitely kicked a lot of nice old memories. Now, Guindy Park is a typical park with very few animal attractions. The entrance is usually crowded...parking just ok - for both Cars and Bikes. To be avoided during long weekends and Pongal times. The park entry looks worrying with a lot of paper and plastic waste lying on the roads..but inside the park, its much better. There used to be checks at the entry to stop plastic covers inside...but did not see that happening these days.We start with a stroll and see about 3 to 4 varieties of Deers (Samba, Antelope etc), 6 to 7 varieties of Snakes with live chickens waiting to be eaten, an open birds areas with about a dozen varieties of cranes, spoonbills etc... 2 to 3 Crocodiles, 2 wild dogs, about 6 Peacocks, Sea Otter, Parrots, Parakeets etc..The star attraction of the evening was the peacocks...the white peacock which was dancing with his feathers fully open and then the other bluish green feathered Peacock too joined the rains oncoming with its rain dance. A large play area for the kids with swings, slides, see-saws attract all the children and parents crowd to this park.With an entry fees of Rs. 5 for the bikes and not sure for cars, Rs. 5 for kids (between 2 to 12 yrs) and Rs. 20 for adults, Rs. 20 for a camera.Guards will force to buy Camera tickets for any cell phone too (since its got a camera),but if you dont wish to take snaps, just be clear that you dont want to take snaps.There are a lot of crowded food stalls at the entrance serving Coffee, tea, sandwich, pizza, tender coconut, ice creams etc..A good idea to spend about 2 to 3 hours strolling and watching the birds, animals and the public in the only known green patch in the middle of Chennai.Having seen many wonderful parks in Washington DC, NYC, Sao Paulo, Brasilia, Taipei, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Bangalore etc...Guindy maynot be impressive...but being a proud Chennaite...this is our local pride...Saving another weekend for a trip to the Vandalur zoo...very soon...Until then...Ciao..."

You have high chances of missing the full view. ISRO wing is good and motivational for the kids. Zoology section was bad with formaldehyde smell - During our visit, some one pushed a jar down and the fumes were all over. Science wing is good but let not your kids touch any of the exhibits.

What a horrible waste of tax-payers money. I would give 0 rating if possible. The planetarium was actually closed for renovation though this was nowhere mentioned on the website. Instead of that, there was a horrible, tacky video with jarring visuals and unclear audio which was shown in a temporary setup. That video and audio quality was so horrible that we did not gain anything from the experience except for a bad headache. We moved onto the Science museum with some hope to salvage the remainder of our trip. But that was not to be. 90 % of the exhibits were not in working condition. For the remaining 10%, there was hardly any information provided on what that exhibit is about . My daughter was totally disillusioned.Don't waste your time coming here.

In most of the galleries - specially on the first floor, almost all the exhibits are non-functional and broken. Disgusting maintenance.

This section was on par with any international science centers. But, this section condition has to be carried forward to other sections as well. The science park which was opened in 1988, needs renovation. Most of the play area items dont have placards to display about the play area item and significance of this. Overall, very good place to spend a day for children to learn something new. Parking is ample and charges are very reasonable for both parking and also entrance ticket.

I will summarise by saying that though it must have been one of a kind planetarium once upon a time, today it is a sad reflection of its glorious past.2. Chennai is a hot and a humid place. However it is alarming to see that not 01AC or cooling system works, thereby making it an oven for anyone visiting, especially people from outside Chennai.3. There are actually a lot of things to learn no doubts. However due to pathetic equipment maintenance and lackadaisical staff, 95% equipments are simply non functional. ITS A PITY !!!!!! However Kapil Sibal,s inaugural plaque stone is in all its shinning glory. It is a shame how our politicians and bureaucrats just use the tax payers money for their personal career progression and let the common man and resources rot to hell.4. Cooling system at all places non functional. Please go at your own risk in Chennai heat.5. Knowledge wise this place is amazing. One can easily spend 5-6 hours here all alone. But.......6. Space movie and the 3D are such a huge waste of time and money. No educational value. 7. Tickets cost Rs 60 for the all inclusive shows and Rs 30 for a child.8. Honestly as this was my 1st visit here, I was extremely excited. However it was a DISSAPOINTMENT at best to sum it all up."

It is a pity on maintenance,"A visit to a science center and planetarium should excite a child and a child in us. Unfortunately that isn't true at this Tamil Nadu Govt maintained facility. First on the science center there are many theme's - automobile, ocean life, anatomy, math lab, Space research, nuclear power etc..... 95% of the interactive panels / counters don't work ! Huge disappointment for the children and old alike. Wish the Govt gives the responsibility of managing this facility to some private companies at least the maintenance would be good. Secondly on the planetarium, with the school vacations approaching it is difficult to understand why the authorities have started a maintenance now. Instead of the regular planetarium dome they have made a tent - yes tent which can seat about 25/30 people. The audio and video quality is bad to say the least Dont waste your team for visiting this place. With so many good schools and emphasis on education in Chennai we wish that this facility is maintained to enliven the scientific temper in the local kids"

B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Deepakrao1080,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-17,A Big Disappointment,"Located in the heart of the city of Chennai, next to premium technical institutes, this would have been apt to be called the Science Learning center of Chennai. However, this place is far from it.I visited the premises about 2 weeks ago with my nephews, mainly with the intention of interesting them with the ""science experiment"" exhibits that I saw when I visited the place almost 1.5 decades ago ( I was on a school excursion). The only thing they learnt was about optical illusion as it was a painting on the wall and was the only thing that was not yet damaged. They should sell tickets according to the seating capacity of the Planetarium!The planetarium:The Plantarium is one of the biggest attraction in this premise. It is neatly maintained and works flawlessly. However, be prepared to ""run"" and occupy the seats early as the ""late-comers"" get plastic chairs to sit. The organisers shamelessly let in people even after the show has started and is a big disturbance to the show. They make a big fuss if some tourist kid playfully points lasers after the show has started, but they keep flashing lights and letting people inside even after the show has started. They arrange the plastic chairs very close to the main projector. The program is a big let down, as it has not been designed for a young audience. It talks about whether Mars has life or not and concludes saying that future mankind will live in mars! They could have made a program about the solar system or moon or common constellations. Instead they choose Mars and 2-3 constellations that is difficult to identify when you look at the night sky.3D Theater:I suppose this is one of the latest additions to this premise and I should say that it was not necessary here. The 3d movie telecast here is the same ones they telecast in ""trade fairs"" and amusement Parks.. in fact, they make it better by making it a 4D or 5D show! And the program content is again to be reviewed here. 2 movies are screened - one is a roller coaster ride (common in all amusement parks) and the second is a ""horror"" show that had toddlers crying because it was 3d and demons were flying towards you!!Exhibits - ""the science center""This was a big big disappointment, because none of the experimental exhibits were working! Pendulums were missing the balls.. you press buttons and nothing happens, kinetic & potential energy exhibits didnt work, the ball that was supposed to travel and make you understand potential to kinetic energy conversion was missing from all exhibits. There is a section that has dolls from around the world (I dont understand its relevance to science though) and it looks just like the doll cabinet store that features in Conjuring Movie.To make matters worse, they were welding some huge structure inside.Outdoor Parks:The swings , slides etc seem to work well, but we could not use it as the security were sending people out of the premises the moment the clock struck 5:30 pm! So I really cannot comment about it.Overall, I regret having gone half a day earlier, buying tickets in advance and taking my nephews there. Instead, a visit to the beach would have interested all of us better. This campus is a classic example of how the Government agency is wasting its resources. The content could be better designed."

Though they covered the solar system, that days show was on planet MARS .To our surprise much of the latest informations like NASA'S curiosity mission and other explorations were lacking and needs to be updated a lot.Next the ticket allows us to a 3D animation show which is really a horrifying experience since the there was no coordination beween the loud sound and the 3D visual effects.Most of the Adults including parents were mute spectators of the so called 3D show needless to say the children seem to enjoy the fun of animals coming too close to them at times.Then There is a museum section which is good and informative.New addition is a separate section dealing with the Nuclear Engergy including the pioneers of nuclear power plants  and various models illustrated nicely.It would have been more useful to include a pre recorded information about each display so that even non scientific common people can easily comprehend.As a whole at the end as you leave the planatarium you are left with a thought that I should  have read some of the reviews from TripAdvisor before venturing such trips."

Will anything change? But then I thought, isn't it important to bring to attention, the sorry state of affairs, if I really cared about bringing the change?Reading a few isolated posts in Trip Advisor did not really prepare me or my family to expect what we saw at the Chennai Birla Planetarium, I visited, with my kids, in June 2016.It was in 1988-89, when I went there first, as a young boy, on my school educational trip. Oh what an amazing place it was then!Buzzing with activity, working science models, fresh and bright paint and more importantly, a planetarium which gave me a glimpse of the wonders of our solar system, at a time when internet was in its infancy; an interest which has stayed with me all these years and helped me pass the same feeling of wonder and amazement, to my children.Almost 30 years down the lane, what a difference; one of utter disappointment! Not just for my kids and me, but also to the many young children; some accompanied by their parents, some with their grandparents, some IT employees (who wished to spend their day off), some maybe from Chennai, others from towns, villages across TamilNadu. How would the children/visitors have felt? Did they know any better?The visitors made most of what the place had to offer; patiently visiting all the dilapidated rooms, sitting through outdated sci-fi programs and planetarium shows. Stray dogs roamed freely in the poorly maintained parks outside. The staff however, were very patient, respectful; few of them recalling, how things have gone bad over the years.Going from one room to the other, my 11yr old commented ""If only these models were working, this planetarium would be on par with the best I have ever seen""; and he has been to a few and was actually comparing this planetarium with those in the UK and USA.At the end of it, I became slightly emotional and wondered when would this callous attitude change!Suddenly, two things struck me.One, if India is able to launch a successful Mars mission, why then, has these advances not reached the main metropolitan city only a few hundred kilometres away?And two, With IIT Chennai just down the road, why has a joint effort to showcase science in a better way not been considered/possible?With the current government's focus on 'Make in India', why then doesn‚Äôt our biggest make, be showcased with pride in our planetarium programs? Why cant the state and/or the Central governments make this a priority? How many countries around the world can boast of a space program like ours?As we were leaving with disappointment etched on our faces, ""Next time when you come here sir, I promise it will be much better"" the guard at the entrance told us, in an exuberant tone. Can our government too, give us similar hope?"

B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Lakshmi RP,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Poor maintenance ,"I remember visiting this planetarium as a child and it was in good shape then (20 years back) right now more than half of exhibits don't work . Stairways stink . No order maintained . People were pushing and shoving . Show was Marvels of Mars which was projected only on one part of screen, which made it difficult for people seated on other side. I have been to two other planetariums, one in india and another abroad , they were way better than this one . So much of government money got wasted. Staff of middle / higher level conducted a presentation about liquid nitrogen and showed examples of science in real life , that was the only good part of the whole visit. "
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,H V,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Poorly maintained, horribly hot, badly execulted","The science exhibition is in a concrete building with glass facade. Gallery 1 did not have a single fan working - which on a May afternoon was really horrible. The Goldberg machine that was there was turned on for some special people - demonstrated and then switched off and the balls that are supposed to smoothly transition between different stages kept dropping off - a dangerous thing given that they were solid metal ones the size of squash balls. All other sections of the exhibition hall had broken pieces, peeling plaster, chipped wood etc. The planetarium was a good facility but the show itself was amateurish with poor commentary and asynchronous sounds and picture. The worst was the 3D theatre. It looked so amateurish that I am sure it was created by someone learning to do 3D animation for the first time - with no storyline, random bits of dinosaurs, Alice in wonderland type sequences and strange stuff interspersed in between.  There are better ways to spend time with your children than going to this place in summer."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,KAPIL K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Very Bad,"In the planetarium, projector video is very small, poor  and very low resolution. Even Keystone effect is not corrected in the video. Displayed video and projector are very old and no colors (seems like Eastman color). No full screen video except stars. Moving video is almost null, only some old still pictures. Audio system is poor. Seats are not adjustable, no A/C in hall. Better to see astronomy videos in mobile phone. Latrines have no doors or hooks. I visited Calicut (Kozhikode) Planetarium which was excellent."

An overzealous watchman chases people away from certain exhibits quite rudely. The only exhibit worth mentioning is the locomotive, which is of almost no educational value. The planetarium program is laughable by most standards, with projections falling onto one side of the dome, the heavily mother tongue influenced narration offering outdated and meaningless facts, and international units in indian units (eg crores and lakhs) the graphics and animations were gifs, and low resolution google images and looked like they were made by a 2nd grade student for his science project.

I wasn't expecting anything better, anyway!There are a lot of science-based rides and games for kids, none of which work.

I think even now, no such drive-in restaurant available in Chennai. We can enjoy food just relaxing in our car/bike. Many celebrates can be seen during evening . Many changes happened now and Govt is trying to revive it's original beauty. Lot of renovation and maintenance work going on now. Good parking facility for two wheelers and few cars. Good crowd when we visited there, being weekend. Small canteen with Aavin parlour, chat items and coffee-tea, next to children play area. Parking rates - 2 wheeler Rs.15.00 and for car Rs.40.00.

After the lease contract was over the Government of Tamil Nadu took over the land and build this park.  Just next to the US Consulate, the ever busy Cathedral and Anna Flyover it provides a break from the noise and pollution.  One can definitely spend 2 to 3 hours at peace in this place which is full of trees and shade.  Though designed to be a wonderful garden, it lacks maintenance and upkeep thanks to successive changing governments.  A nominal entry fee of INR 15 is charged at the entrance.  Enough parking space is a welcome thing, which is charged separately.  For those who want to visit the place, I suggest going there on weekdays and no-holidays to enjoy the peaceful set up.  Of course if someone is near the cathedral road and does not want to spend time in the scotching heat, this is the place to go."

Located bang in the heart of chennai near the american consulate, this 20 acre park is such a soothing site for the eyes and mind. It's literally green all over, with trees, a lush green lawn, more trees and some architectural ideas thrown in. If you want to relax in the midst of nature, this is one of the few  places to go. It has a small park for kids with a couple of slides, roundabouts and swings - enough to keep your toddler happy. There is also a small pond with some ducks in it.The only black spot of this entire park are the couples that use it as spot to romance. It's ok to see them sitting together having a chat - but what is disgusting is to see them in compromising positions doing compromising things - try explaining that to your kid when they ask you what those couples are doing! The management should do something about this menace - but since this is a govt park, nothing's gonna happen.All in all it is a wonderful, peaceful place in the heart of the city and is a must visit place if you want a chill out doing nothing."

There is practically no civic consciousness, people spitting all over the place with some even blowing their nose in the street. It was disgusting. The roads were narrow and crowded,  hardly wide enough for one vehicle yet vehicles were travelling in both direction. And they just plow their way through blowing their horns. Yes, you can find all sorts of items here at a reasonable price but you still have to compare prices and bargain as you can easily be taken for a ride. Most of these items can be found at other places in Chennai for a little more. I personally would prefer the later option."

Sowcarpet,Raxcor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,If you are snack lover then never miss this place,"This place is good for so many things right from shopping to food. I would concentrate more on food as a food lover. We wanted to visit this place for a very long time, we had plan A, B and C but everything failed, but just like that we made it to this place and we were not disappointed. We went as a team of 15 and we did a food walk in the late evening.The roads are narrow, so I would advice you to go by foot. This is place will make you feel good and it is not trademark Chennai, it may look like a different place altogether. Majority of them north Indian and this place is paradise for them. We started with Vada Pav, it would bring back memories if you are a Mumbaian. Next we moved on to Lassi part, where you got lassi in huge glasses. Next we moved to a street sandwich vendor, who made sandwich in style. Amazing taste!Next we moved to Place called Ajnabi, and do not miss the Kaakadi Sandwich and mix snacks. And we almost tried everything in that place. Jallabi is another main attraction and taste it to fulfill the trip.Next we went to Kakada Ramparasath, there we had Aalu Tikki, they made it fresh and it was nice. Next we moved to Seena Bhai, this is very different you would get idly and Doasa but very different. They soak the idili in podi and Ghee. The dosa are not typically dosa it is a mini oothappam with onions. He made it in style and it is a good visual to see and taste. I am sure you will love it.Right opposite to Senna Bhai we had sweet beda which you should not miss that is the finishing touch to the whole trip.So this place is filled with people and if you are a foodie and I am pretty sure your stomach will also be full and it wont cost you so much. Worth a Try!"

Sowcarpet,Gupta_Rahul_Dev,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A North Indian enclave in the heart of Chennai,"Sowcarpet falls on what is generally referred to as North Chennai. It is an old neighbourhood and not designed for cars so has traffic congestion. If you don't want to walk, its better you take a cycle rickshaw (yes, these do run here).If you know Hindi, you will feel quite at home here to converse in that language.Why should you go here? Some reasons that come to mind are (not necessarily in order of priority) -- (i) to see a slice of old Madras (ii) to buy various household goods at cheaper prices (iii) to have some good cheap North Indian food.As in most other outdoor places in Chennai, it is better one goes there during the coolest (or rather, least hot!!) part of the Chennai weather cycle; say 01 December to 15th January). This is not to say that a trip at other times cannot be worthwhile -- like in most things in life, it depends purely upon your frame of mind. For example, I went there on the 21st of April and still thought it was OK."

Tip: Go to the Theme park early in the morning, cover the dry rides before afternoon, have lunch and relax in the shade and in the evening after 4 pm you can go for water rides.-- For water rides you need to wear their uniform/water clothes.

VGP_Golden_Beach,Sb R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Dirty beach. Money trap,"I have visited this beach last week with my and friend's family. It charges handsome amount as entry fee and again collects huge charges for all important rides inside the park. The mandatory costume for water world is also chargable @ Rs 150, probably more than the amount it was purchased. The food vendors inside the park  are of the quality of footpath stalls and have no concern about hygiene. We were chosen the place mainly to introduce our kids to a friendly and clean beach. But, it was opposite. The beach was dirty like hell. It doesnot have swimming facility. There is no change room to change clothes also."
VGP_Golden_Beach,rahulgautam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,the golden beach,more than the beach the amusement park takes all the credit if this place. water slides are amazing. although a bit expensive it deserves a visit from the children. lots of swings and slides. if you go there make sure you have 4 to 6 hours of time to enjoy this place.

VGP_Golden_Beach,Stevens Manuel,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Think twice,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 days and there were quite few nice things about the resort.1. Most staff were friendly2. Rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable3. The bathroom, though the Jacussi does not work is one of the best. Really big and  open to sky and 24hrs hot waterNow to negatives1. WiFi does not work at all. I had to miss two key meetings because of this. Now to their credit they did try to fix it even in rain but it just did not work.2. Over the phone I was told that my check out time of 12 can be considered and extended. But on the departure date they stood their ground and made me and my pregnant wife to depart by 12. In spite of only about 30%occupancy. They say it is because I booked through make my trip. Possibly because I got a decent offer online. I would have expected a hardly occupied resort to try and win mire customers.3. Rooms smell damp and fungal. Very little scope for air to come in.Bottom line: think twice before booking here. Not worth it"

VGP_Golden_Beach,krishseshadri,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,VGP - Very Glitched Place :(,"For heaven sake, don't ever visit this place. ‚ÄúHorrible‚Äù is the one word to sum it up!!Entire world has caught up with services ""oriented"" towards customers but sadly the VGP management is taking the other direction and critically lacks customer service or has any process in place :((Those who enjoy mediocre entertainment, basic rides and get thrilled with sloppy 80s or 90s style infrastructure, who don't care for personal hygiene, may like this resort.  These are the issues faced by my family within few hours of time spent in this resort:‚Ä¢	Some 3-4 people inside the ticketing counter are talking to themselves and they seem to not bother that the customers are standing in the line and they need to be helped with the tickets..huh?? ‚Ä¢	Most of the rides are under repair or under maintenance. There is no board or sign, we have to walk-up to the nearby ride operator to enquire/find about the status of the rides.‚Ä¢	As it rained the night before, the operator or the management didn't even care to clean the roads or seats in the rides. The operators were telling us it‚Äôs not their job and their attitude towards the customers speaks in volume about how they are being treated by the management. Poor souls they need some time-off or some change in shifts.‚Ä¢	When in the middle of the ride, the power was shut-off and we were sitting in a balloon ride for about 20 minutes and when asked to start the generator, operator told us that it will take 30 minutes to resume the operations. He said that he can‚Äôt speak to his supervisor and he doesn‚Äôt have his number. Thank God, we were not in the Ferris wheel when this happened ;)‚Ä¢	We were instructed that we can go to the water park, apparently those rides also need power for the operation. After about 30 minutes, the power got resumed, one of the ride operator told us that he is going for lunch and someone will come and operate it. Already the people were going bonkers that the power was shut-down, on top of it, the operator was now walking-out for lunch. Who in the world to question them?‚Ä¢	Worst experience is, there is no co-ordination in the water park to collect and distribute the tube floaters. When my daughter went to collect the tube near drop-off point, she slipped, fell on her back and severely injuring her hip and also got a big bump in her head.  She was suffering with headache, dizziness due to the trauma from the fall. To our surprise, there were no staff in the vicinity to assist or there is any first-aid kit available.  One has to walk to the ticket counter and took us somewhere far-off to get us some ice in a paper napkin. He is neither first-aid trained or has any experience. Surprised, why they can‚Äôt afford a Doctor in the premises? God only has to save us if any such untoward incident happens. ‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs a pure negligence of the management as the stagnant rain water wasn‚Äôt cleaned properly especially in the places where young children/teens walk-by. The algae formed in that busy junction has never been cleaned‚Ä¢	When went to the Veg restaurant near by the Horror House, the guy serving the food on an uncleansed plate (soap scum was still there). When we pointed out, he just removed the soap scum asked us to adjust as the food has been served? Who want to compromise for this? Is anyone in this place care for food hygiene?? ‚Ä¢	People who come to eat in this restaurant feed the crows and dogs and these animals come nearby to the table and also attempt to pick the left-overs from the plate. Yuck !!ÔÅåOf all the bad things happened, one good thing is their Snow Kingdom, they maintain sub-zero temperature where you can see some snow. Please keep in mind, the jackets they give really stinks ÔÅåHow many ever new rides they may introduce in future, without fixing their customer service and basic process, there is a big question mark in getting repeat customers."

VGP_Golden_Beach,AshokMela,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A sought after destination for the last 3 decades !!,VGP Golden Beach is a entertainment place or picnic spot for locals of Chennai not just in the last few years but for the last 3 decades. The theme park inside has been added a decade before. But the property and the beaches and the park and the gardens are very commonly noticed in the south indian movies of late 80s and early 90s.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Namrata S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr-15,First Beach Visit Ever,"This was my first ever beach visit and my first trip to South India. On a local's recommendation we went to Golden Beach and it was totally worth it. The waves are rocking, the beach is pristine and well-maintained and the premises are beautifully preserved and maintained. Absolutely love the architecture and the wonderful side-activities that are available, like palm readers, swings for both children and adults, horror house, etc. The washrooms are hygienic and well-maintained and the staff is courteous. Not a lot of variety when it comes to food but definitely enough to satisfy the post-swim hunger pangs. "
VGP_Golden_Beach,cool1960,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Full of FUN,"Maintained by a Private party. This Beach was very first of its kind in Chennai.To entertain people lots of fun filled dramas, music, skit are being conducted. You can find Tamil culture is bieng played and Portrayed there. Lots of eateries are there which will make to keep eating.Lots of trees are there which makes us to really relax. Beach is superb.We need to walk a lot so we have to plan the route and walk slowly."

VGP_Golden_Beach,Bhalaji N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-15,Out dated,"Been to this place after a decade and was so disappointing in the 90s it used to be weekend leisure spot for my family and we used to stay as well. It used to be so good, now i see an aging, under maintained place with bad shape. The food has gone bad, entertainment is literally not jelling well. Its high time they renovate. Lots of space and the animals that stayed within has been lost to the divided cottage space. Inter this has shrunk the overall space for the park. The beach is the only good thing that still exists. The beach is clean, tidy and good for kids to play."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Janak S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-15,It's essentially dead,Came with family on the 24rd Dec 2015. Paid 300 per head only to find the entire park is like s graveyard. All the rides are empty and out of repair. The food place is like a road side outlet with two items (fast food) on the menu. We simply walked out of the park and into the hotel next door. Overall very disappointed.

VGP_Golden_Beach,tinu123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-15,one of the cleanest beach of chennai,"This is one of the cleanest beach in Chennai. There is an entry fee which restricts the visitors so the beach is moderately populated. If you are lucky then you'll get to see some celebrities shooting a movie sequence here. I got to see Hansika Motwani here with her crew for a movie shot. I personally prefer this over Marina Beach for its add on attraction apart from the beach. Inside there is a small deer park, exotic birds, there are unlimited joy rides and food court. Overall it's a good place to enjoy on weekends."

This was one place we could really unwind and let ourselves become kids again. I really enjoyed the place along with the family and recommend to come with family. The snacks are a bit expensive for the quality. All in all well worth the effort to come & time spent."

VGP_Golden_Beach,Manish Bansal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Weekday fun at Golden Beach,Had heard a lot about the Golden Beach resort. My visit here was on a weekday and hence it was very less crowded. There is this guy who stands as a statue and is interesting to see people trying hard to tease him to move or smile. The place is wide spread with many rides which are included in the entry ticket except for a few. Not happy to say that many of the rides are old fashioned and needs maintainance. There is a water park also inside the place for which a ticket can be brought separately. Dint venture there due to lack of time however appeared to be good because of the long water slides and people seemed to have fun. Less options of eating there and dint appear to be hygenic though final call may be taken by the one wanting to eat it. The escape to beach was good from there which was clean.
VGP_Golden_Beach,SenthilESR,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan-15,Terrible .. Very bad maintenance,"Recently i went to this theme park with my family.We had horrible experience. The maintenance of rides were very bad, especially the dashing cars. Will not recommend for anyone"
VGP_Golden_Beach,Lavanash,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May-15,Fun for the family,"One of the oldest and biggest Adventure parks of Chennai. Has become a little run down, nevertheless it is being revamped and repainted slowly. Plenty of rides for adults, kids and babies. A small petting zoo, plenty of restaurants, a gaming arcade and the major attraction...the beach. Good place for kids. Can spend time with family for half the day. Better to reach there early evening. Holidays and the morning times will be fully crowded. The rides will have longer queues. By early evening the visitors who use public transport start to disperse, so the rides seem lesser crowded. Plus as Chennai is a hot and humid city the evening times are much cooler. There is a newly started Snow park. The entrance & ticket to that is separate and is through the car park.Try to visit during Pongal time (January) when you can see many ancient south indian traditions like Karakatam, Poi kal kuthirai and lots of group dances. Has a resort too for those who want to stay overnight."

As the place is very big, crowd doesn't affect you much. You can enjoy with friend and family. Lot of entertainment over here. Most importantly its much cheaper compared to other places."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Hemkumar G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 ‚Ä¢ Family,No quality,"Visited it after almost 25 years to show my little daughter. Should say, they have not upgraded the facility. The look and feel of the amusement park is it is very old. Though you have to pay an entry fee of Rs 200/- approx. for most of the interesting and reasonably good raids inside, you again have to shell out Rs25/- each. The rides are in very old condition. May be for someone very new to amusement park concept, it may have some interest. For others, who might have enjoyed much higher standard amusement park even within India, it is very poor cousin."

VGP_Golden_Beach,Svetaspy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 ‚Ä¢ Family,good with kids,the entrance costs about 320 RP including waterpark and some attractions. Also zoo. But what i didnt like was the dress for swimming which you must wear there. Also the swimming pool is not  deep  just for a kids. The water rides is cool but the water made me the allergy on the skin.. This place is for active ppl - you would't find any personal chears to stay 'n chill under the sun.

VGP_Golden_Beach,Amit G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Heard Chennai is cheap but VGP makes you wrong- Its indeed a capitalist place,"My experience with Chennai so far has not been nice, and VGP did icing on the cake. I and my colleague reached this place in order to spend some good time on the beach as we heard very good about this beach. But on reaching there we realized that we have to shell out entry fee of Rs 225.  Entry ticket is for amusement park but you have to purchase the ticket if you wish to go to the beach. This place is more suitable for families with  kids not for couples or friends."

The water on the beach is very clean. The location is ideal for movie shootind and on the day of our visit we did come across Tamil Movie Shooting. The environment is very good and much better than any other beaches I have visiten. Only Kovalam beach is as clean as this beach. On the day of our visit some south African artists performed and the performance was par excellence. Must visit place.

The water is literally dirty with loads of dirt floating . Most of the rides are not functioning and the ones that are functioning are badly maintained. Though we pay an amount for entry we have to pay for each ride inside too. We were forced to buy clothing for the water area, they were pathetic. Most of the suits were torn and dirty."

Most of the joy rides were kept closed although it is maintained. The name was very famous for theme park , but except that the beach area is neat and some nice goods made out of shell available , overall it was disappointing. VGP has to ramp up and make it more more attractive so that people can have one fun and spend time over there.  Expects more...."

A multifaceted man with loads of charisma and talent, he was looked upon by everyone and became an iconic figure in every stream of his life.At the cost of sounding ignorant I will accept that when I landed in Chennai and decided to visit the Marina Beach, I had no clue that there was a memorial in his name. So how could I miss it?There are no entry tickets and there is a museum in the same campus which we missed due to lack of time. According to available information the memorial has undergone a lot of renovations to look like what it looks today. It is best if you read a bit about the man and the memorial before visiting it, especially if you have no idea of his cult following.The place is well kept and neat but very crowded. People throng to it like a pilgrimage site. We were there on a weekday and were told that weekends are jam packed. Spent approximately 2 hours roaming around, watching people and just chatting.There is an ever burning lamp and people make sure to bow down to it. We noticed some people putting their ears and trying to listen to something. When we enquirer they said that there is a ticking sound coming from inside the black marble/granite structure. Some said it is MGR's heart and some more reasonable ones said that when the structure was built MGR's wrist watch was buried inside and one can still hear the ticking. When we tried we could not hear anything but believers are believers.So if you stay long enough you can gather enough stories for dinner :) Either way it is a good way to spend a few hours and chat with the locals and get to know more about how the public looks at MGR.There are finger foods and snacks available and then the beach is right next door with many eating options."

It was a battle between the British, Portuguese & French, with the Russians & then Germans also wanting a piece of the action.Where has that wealth gone since independence?That is the important question.They don't want to share it with you!Alas, it was closed on the day we visited the Fort."
Fort_Museum,Anand M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,India Story that lends a deep insight,"It is amazing to understand how a handful of British on lookout for business, converted the divide and vulnerability of this country into an empire without fighting any serious war by using just some hired local talent. The museum also reflects how British artists and freelancers made a career out of visiting India and applying themselves. When you are committed and love your profession, success is a natural fallout. That sums up this Museum."

The Armaments section has displays of different kinds of weapons such as cannons, guns, swords and daggers in use during British rule. There is a section for uniforms worn by officers in the British army, the various medals conferred on them and the coins minted during British rule.The first floor has portraits in oil painting of the different Governers of the Fort and their wives, the Kings and Queens of England and the Arcot Nawabs. There are also aquatints of different places giving a glimpse of life in those days. The second floor houses burial urns and a sacrophagus and gives a good understanding of burial practices in South India during the Neolithic and Iron Age. The piece-de-resistance is the only surviving Indian flag that was hoisted on the First Independence Day. Loved the collection displayed in the museum and most certainly recommend this place"

Fort_Museum,Peter S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A disgrace!,"It's commendable that the former British officers' mess is open to the public. I was intrigued to enter it - it was uncomfortably warm even on a January day with fans going: what might it have been like in summer heat with only punkahs? (And the punkah bars are still visible fixed to the ceilings - fascinating!)But as a museum, the Fort Museum is a complete disgrace. It comprises half a dozen room over three floors displaying a random collection of historical tat - old crockery, weapons, coins, copies of portraits of various monarchs and governors etc., and on the top floor the most negligent display on the freedom movement you've ever seen. The whole thing is a complete mess and a waste of your time and money. The only really interesting room was the display of a huge model of the fort c.1870. The rest was pointless, mouldering junk, unexplained, or poorly explained, and not worth the 200 rupee fee foreign visitors are charged. Photography is supposedly prohibited - presumably to stop the world knowing how bad the place is, a ban easily evaded. (Why would you stop people taking of photos of stuff they want to remember? I was very interested in the history of the fort: why would you want people not to take photos of the excellent model of the place?) The whole thing was as appalling as the worst historical 'museum' I've seen anywhere in India. Don't miss it!"

Fort_Museum,Carlos Scott Lopez,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo, Weak offerings given the price ,"Notable site with several rooms of paraphernalia spread over several floors, but likely only of value to locals. Indeed, the pricing scheme where foreigners pay over 1,200% more than locals (200 versus 15 Rupees) makes the site not worth visiting unless one is a local and can pay the local price. (This said, one could envisage paying slightly more (e.g., 10%-20% more) to find the site worth the entry fee, but nothing over this.)Also, seeing wealthy Indians coming to visit - while students on small budgets were charged so much more - proved somewhat saddening to witness."

The displays were old, no descriptions to bring them to life.  A whole room full of coins and medals with no details of their significance.   Overall, it really needs the whole place starting again.

Once more I was struck by the seeming lack of care India has for its history. The museums, which I accept most probably lack funding, are in a poor, bedraggled state. I am sure the exhibits are fascinating but they are, in the main, so badly promoted and exhibited that the effort involved in seeing them outweighs their artistic and educational value. I found the experience a little dispiriting. "

For example there was  a case full of swords but no explanation of each sword or why it was in the museum.The China collection was visibly dirty and dusty,  Cases were labeled but not individual pieces.There is a room with very large oil paintings of important figures in Chennai history.  The room was obviously a ballroom at some point but there is no explanation.  Its a wonder that the portraits survive in the heat.  None of the rooms have an explanation of what they had been used for.No air conditioning in this 3 story building.  Not disabled friendly.  Chennai is hot and inside the museum was hotter.  The temperature went up on each floor visited.  By the time I got to the 3rd floor the heat was unbearable and I could not visit the exhibits.If you need the rest room, the man who works in the museum brings you outside and then asks for payment.My visit was disappointing and uncomfortable and I can't recommend this museum to any traveller to Chennai."

Fort_Museum,travelgirl254,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Fort St George: Fort Museum,"It is quite eye opening to read about how Chennai was first settled by the British at this location. Also to see from the model & illustrations how big the whole Fort area is, like a mini village. It is mostly occupied by the Indian army, navy, police & government now, so there are security checks getting in and when wandering around you'll be told not to go past certain buildings etc. The historic St Mary's church is a bit hard to find but worth it. It's well maintained as its still used. Not a big cathedral but a peaceful little sanctuary, including the garden. Allow about 2-3 hours. Bring your own snack & drink. Foreigners pay 200Rp entry. No photos allowed. It's interesting seeing inside the Museum building, although I was a bit sad to see the deterioration happening to the paintings and find other things. Most of the museum is not air con either, so it gets very warm inside. "

My 8 year old son was very mesmerised. Those little tiny turtles running towards the ocean waves in the evening was a sight which lasts a life time. It‚Äôs simple and yet amazing. The team to conserve the olive ridley turtles is putting a great effort. Number of hatchlings depend on the time of the season and varies.A bit remote to find it.We saw hatchlings being released into the ocean and not the mid night turtle walks for laying eggs.Thats not done in April, but in feb March.All in all good experience "
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,Aviott J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr-17,Great way to meet people interested in nature conservation issues.,"Between the months of December and April each year, several thousand Olive Ridley turtles come to the sandy beaches along the outskirts of Chennai to lay their eggs. For nearly four decades now, several dozen volunteers of the Chennai Students Sea Conservation Network SSTCN meet at various spots along the coast to patrol the beaches at night. When they come across a turtle laying eggs, they mark the nest and collect the eggs for hatching in an incubator. 45 to 60 days later, the hatchlings are brought to the same spot and released close to the water's edge. Volunteers stand in the water with torches to guide the hatchlings towards the sea. This interference with nature is necessary because the beaches are not protected and human habitation has encroached almost up to the waterline. Google the SSTCN website for details of meeting points, contact numbers and times to visit. I participated in a walk that began at 11 pm and ended at around 6 am and covered around 7 km of beach. It was a mixed group of about 30 people of all ages. The walk began with a short introduction to nature conservation work, turtle habitats and species. The introduction was done in two language groups, for English and for Tamil speakers"

Altough the road on the beach to the shak looks unmotorable, do not worry it is motorable. Seeing those little hatchlings trying so hard to climb out and then seeing them run to the ocean waves is an experience. One thing though there are not thousands or millions of hatchlings, its just a basket full so keep that in mind. We have steadfastly killed every possible lives around us and making them dwindle to as few as possible."

The female turtle digs a pit in the sand with her back flippers and drops about 50 to 100 eggs. After 40-50 days, the eggs hatch and the hatchlings instinctively turn towards the sea and find their way to the depths of the ocean. The walk is conducted for 7 km from Neelankarai to Besant Nagar from 11 pm and goes on till 5 am.

Mind you, I walked every sat night for those 4 months to witness all this. So, keep your expectation low, cause a turtle will nest only even it wants to. Also, the volunteers are amazing - with real knowledge in them they have great life changing conversations and they do a thankless job on all our behalf."

I've had friends who've said they've walked for hours and not come across anything. I'm not the most adventurous of people but was so glad my friend convinced me to come along.

I was fortunate enough to witness many hatchlings (and hold one of them in my hands) being let out in to the sea. The mid-walk break was refreshing. We were also lucky to spot a nest (glad to touch one of them) with about 126 eggs (usually between 80 and 120). The demonstration of replicating the wild nest and packing of the sourced eggs inside them in one of their hatcheries is icing on the cake."

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,SubbaramDanda,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,A good mall and a nice place to hang aound,"We visited the Ampa Skywalk Mall in Aminjikarai, Chennai, recently when we wanted to see a film in the top floor of the mall.  From the moment we passed through the security in the ground floor till we reached the cine complex we could see hordes of people everywhere.  They thronged shops, eateries, entertainment hubs and a variety of other enclosures.  Escalators and elevators were operating to move people from one floor to another.  The corridors and walkways were clean and the air-conditioning was pleasant.  Of course, there were no benches for seniors to sit and relax for a while.  They had to essentially step into an eatery for the purpose. The Ampa mall has been there for quite long and it should be said to its credit that it is  maintaining standards of good house-keeping."

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,06Adam,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-15,Average mall on the West side of the City,"Whilst there are number of malls coming up in the centre of City from the Spencer plaza of those days to the Express Avenue of today, this place has a history of various hotels operated during its lifetime. Now this has been a new mall which is accessible for people of the Anna nagar and surrounding area.I have seen some people claiming this is dirty because it is situated on the banks of coovum an ester year river which has turned now to be a disposal river for all toxic waste. Well the mall and there are millions of houses on the banks and the cleanliness comes from withing. If you haven't dropped a litter on road in your lifetime you can call this place as dirty however it is the cleanliness inside that matters.CONS:High parking charges similar to most mallsHeavy traffic generated as there is no control of in and out flowing trafficPROS:Mix of Food and entertainment catering to most age groupsAverage cleanliness maintained.Good collection of stores to keep you busy if you are visiting this place."

Just what you would find everywhere else. This review is specifically for the MOMOS you get at this PVR. Dudddeeee, the chicken momos are so damn tasty here. I am from Delhi and I long for the street food and the momos cause you cannot find it here. But the only reason I prefer ampa skywalk over other cinemas is the momos here. Well as many of you will know momos are nothing if not for the chutney you get with them, cause lets be realistic, momos in themselves are nothing but just all-flour and boiled chicken...tasteless! What makes momos great is that awesome sweet, tangy, spicy chutney which should always come with KFC's tagline ""IT'S FINGER LICKING GOOD"". Well long story short...do go and try that awesome momos !!"

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Skribbles,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good HyperMall,"Though Spencer Plaza and Chennai City centre was available for shopping and mostly food court, chain of restaurants for weekend and holidays, AMPA SKYWALK was the first Hyper Mall in Chennai with all the facilities. For the locals from Annanagar, Mogappair, Ambattur and Avadi this is an easy access from shopping. eateries and esp. movie at PVR cinema. The atrium most of the time is lively and has a theme according to the season and festivals. For families, after a movie, taking the kids to games zone, lunch at food food court/restaurants and complete the shopping at boutiques was an ideal option including the groceries, veggies-fruits at StarBazar like the Big Bazar at Express Avenue..Don't know why it does not exist now, closed last year i think. I am seeing the Spencer's Hyper ""To be opened shortly"" banner every time i visit from last year.Two wheeler parking fees at Ampa Skywalk mall as in April 2016:Managed by CPS parking system.Wkday - 20 rs per hour & Wkend/Holidays - 25 per hourSame applies for every additional hour.*Loss of ticket - 150 Rs,"

VR_Chennai,Lax,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,"""Unhappy Experience @ VRMall, Chennai""","The design of this mall is very poor in terms of usability. It hauls for long walks with people looking for lifts. One has to walk a minimum distance of 250 mts one way to find the nearest lift or escalator. It's painful when we have to carry the grocery, milk, vegetables with kids, elders, walking for haunting distances to the car park. Just be thoughtful if you are taking kids and elders, for they should be prepared to walk long distances with no support for differently abled ones as well. The support staff inside SPAR were very helpful but the mall services are below average."
VR_Chennai,Anand,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Customers beware of the cleanliness of tables in the food court,The food court looked clean. But I observed the housekeeping staff were mopping the floor and with the same mop they cleaned the table and went to the washbasin and cleaned it with the same mop in full view of the customers. Just wondering about the customers who think the table is clean and putting food stuff over the table and children touching the table !!!Absolutely unacceptable. Will the management take some action over it???
VR_Chennai,Mano,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-21,Thumbs up for VR mall,"Compared to other malls in Chennai. the recently built VR mall offers great dine-in, shopping & fun for kids.The best part is the PVR cinemas, which has shining decor with light fixtures. In general, the mall was neat and clean all the time, I have seen the cleaning team is often cleaning the food court. I appreciate their dedication to maintenance. Furthermore, the shopping part was really great, couldn't stop shopping after buying clothes in all branded shops. Tommy Hilfiger & Jack and Jones collection for men was great (didn't visit all shops for men). Ritu Kumar, west side, mango, Vero Moda and lifestyle had a great collection for women. Noticed great watch collections, cosmetic collections as well. Toni & guy offer the best salon & spa service. Basically, you can find everything in one place. The food court looks crowded all the time, especially on weekends. however, the taste of the food from the food court was average. I really recommend the writer's cafe (small dine-in), their pizza was delicious. Karaikudi food tasted good however, the ambience needs to be improved. last but not least, my son really enjoyed the fun city.Overall, it is a great location to spend time together with family, kids & friends"

You will be taken for a ride with high car park charges but other than that the mall is a good one.The food choices here is excellent. There is hardly any cuisine which is not served here (one can get all Indian cuisine like Chettinad, Tamil, Kerala, Andhra, Punjabi, North Indian plus international cuisine including American, TexMex, Chinese, Italian, Thai, Lebanese, Turkish, Arab, Japanese and many more fares are served. So many Bakers, Patisserie, Cook specialists, Dessert specialists, coffee lounges Shake specialists, Ice cream vendors from Arun, Hagen Daaz, Movenpick, Ibaco, Cold Stone and many more are present here. The Mall has all retailers from India and International queuing up here. The good thing about the mall is that they have life saving seating arrangements in all levels which is very comforting for old people, parents with babies, Bored husbands etc. The entertainment includes a superb Multiplex, Games for children, Virtual gaming zone. The Mall also has modern office spaces for rentals. In the near future they management plans to open a Pub, Club and a hotel.  Over all it is a one stop shop for a weekend fun."

We mainly visited the mall to get some cute Japanese stationery and traditional dress.Accessing the mall:I think we went to the wrong metro station because none of the auto drivers wanted to take the route to V.R.Mall. They said its a long ride before taking a U-turn, because of the bridge in-between.  Google map showed only half-a-kilometre but there was no road link directly connecting the metro to the mall.Also the drop-off and pick-up zone for auto or taxi is only at the main road, not inside the main gate of the mall.  On a rainy day with water puddles on the street, we were pushed to the edge. The mall real estate owners need to consider easy accessibility for all visitors."

VR_Chennai,JumboMumbai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Big mall ,I would rather go to Phoenix for better options than pay hefty parking fee which makes this mall as one of the most expensive malls to visit and shop if you want to hang out for longer duration. The shops will eventually have to face the consequences in future as people will start worrying more about staying longer in the mall than to shop with peace of mind. Definitely not recommended. No malls can survive if the customers cannot spend time peacefully.

VR_Chennai,Hari Shankar,,,,"VR mall opened its door to Chennai almost a year back and now the place is teeming with people. A few months back there were leeser visitors but there is quantum jump in visitors. The summer and the vacation time could have increased that along with better publicity and management. In terms of choice there is a lot in VR. The best Food joints, Multicuisine restos, International chains, Coffee shops, Creameries, restaurant chains, sweet shops, bakeries etc have set shop here, the best food clothing and leather retailers in India and abroad are present here, the mall has one of the best multiplexes in Chennai and in India itself. The air-conditioning is excellent here.There is loads of parking in the mall. In fact there are there are 3 levels of parking in the basement. Recently the parking was hiked after the multiplex opened but I think after a few complaints they have reduced the parking a little bit which is good. If the security staffs dont speak Tamil nor English. It is a must for them to speak the local language. Nearly 30 - 40 shops are still not open which is not good. A few things are missing here. A decent pub and a club would be great, a few shops selling exquisite Indian handicrafts, Sculptures, Indian carvings and memorabilia   would be a great addition. A decent sized hotel would have been great here. I hope VR Chennai is hearing this. If not for all this I would have given VR mall a perfect 5 star."

The facade of the mall sports a multi-coloured design based on the traditional gopuram. The mall is relatively big one with different outlets in four floors. The prices of many house hold, grocery, dress and etc, etc items were really low in Spar. Went for lunch at the food court located in the fourth floor. All veg and non-veg outlets selling items at much higher price. While entering the mall at the parking lot was informed about the parking charges priorly that for first hour it is Rs.40 and for every additional hour extra Rs.30 will be added.  I have just crossed one hour and paid Rs.70. In that GST was Rs.10. Too high parking fee. From Koyambedu bus-stand it is about 1 km. "

Tried for movie on the first visit and couldn‚Äôt get the tickets had to roam around the mall and booked the movie tickets and went for second time. Ample car parking available. The food court though it is small area has different combinations South Indian Veg only, pizzas, North Indian mix with Non-Veg, ice cream parlours, Madras coffee shop etc, some of restaurants are under construction. Some shops accept food zone special card whereas Dominos pizza doesn‚Äôt accept them . Why this two different policy needs to clarified. The VR zone was totally a waste of time. The shops are not so big branded ones, but then the taste differs as to what you plan to purchase.The movie theatre in which we saw Spiderman must be around 200 -250 capacity but the interesting part was long queues for popcorns and Nachos. Many of the sales counters was not fully operational and it seems like the mall was more interested in selling extra large sized popcorns rather than promoting the movies. Some chilling art work on the lower floors needs to be really appreciated. The writings on walls depicting old songs praising Lord Krishna is really wonderful ‚ÄúMaadu Meikum Kanne Nee Poga ‚ÄúSome light music band live was entertaining. This too be promoted to encourage music lovers Overall the food cost, car parking cost to be reduced so that more people enjoy. The entrance and exit chaos leading to busy stretch needs to be taken care. Do visit once yo have a feel of it "

St_Mary_s_Church,Valavanur Natar... K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A DETAILED WRITE UP ON ST MARY'S CHURCH IN FORT ST GEORGE CHENNAI,"St Mary's in Fort St George, Madras - An  Oldest Anglican Church If one is a visitor to Chennai from any part of the world or India,  it surely will be worth their while to visit this historical Anglican Church built inside fort St George,  the Seat of Power fir  the Government of Tamil Nad,  even today.St Mary's in Fort St George, Madras was consecrated in the year 1680 which makes it one of  the oldest Anglican church in Asia ,with very important historic significance in the evolution of Chennai or Madras .Sadly history tells us that  during the 3-year occupation of Fort St George by the French 1746 - 1749 , it was put to use as a water storage .The church is within Fort St George , a fort built by the British  as a  secure trading post and  completed in  1653 and then gradually kept expanding  to its present size and then went  on to become and remain the seat of the state government even today .. The church was built with private contributions, with  East India Company,  who developed the  fort , and on its own had no part in its Construction actually.  Streynsham Master 1640 - 1724,  was appointed governor  in 1678 after spending number of years with the Company based in Surat on the west coast of India .Soon after taking up the appointment in January 1678 he determined, entirely on his own initiative and without reference to London Office ,  that the settlement needed a proper church. Until then divine services had been held in the largest room in the fort, the  common room, which served as a chapel besides being put to other uses. Master and his colleagues in council contributed about half of the 800 odd Pagodas raised that is  about 400 sterling pounds in those  days and  Elihu Yale, a Merchant on the Company's rolls contributing  15 Pagodas. Rest came mostly from other Merchants in the Company's service. William Dixon was the  Chief Gunner of the East India Company's Madras Establishment and also an  Engineer  to the Army .The Governor instructed him to build the church. East India Compaany later did contribute to its  construction .The church was 80 feet by 56 feet when  originally built with  the separate tower added  sometime later and conjoined to the old church built by Dixon .¬†The church resembles a  fortified structure to meet the security needs of those days and  St Mary's church almost finished as a bomb proof structure with over 5 ft thick walls having a  vaulted roof of 4 ft thick maximum and 2 ft minimum.Its  window shutters are about two foot wide ang more than 6 ft height .When the French bombarded   Madras in 1746, the church was  one building in the fort,  to come through unscathed. The French did manage to damage the steeple though , when they attacked again in 1758 but that was not built by Dixon, since the tower was added only around  1701 and a spire in 1710.Dixon, first  castellated the parapet and  never  used wood in the structure  to render it fire proof in the event of bombing.The interior looks beautiful although the exterior is  squat looking as a fortress should ..It has a nave with two aisles and a gallery at the far end from the altar. The roof  is vaulted with rose ornaments in relief on the curved ceiling with classical touches .The church itself derived its name Since construction commenced on 25th March 1678, My Lady Day, so it came to be christened as  the church of St Marys and consecrated on its completion on  Thursday, the 28th of October 1680. The Fort had had a Chaplain on its establishment since 1676 and the incumbent in 1680 was Richard Portman. He obtained  a special licence from the Bishop of London to consecrate the church with Streynsham Master assusting him .Being the oldest Anglican place of worship in whole of  Asia and it is  therefore associated with a number of events  in British Indian history .This  is what makes this church so special, in addition to its construction and its charming interior.The church now maintained by ASI of India still maintains a register, which is continuous since its 1680 inception, well  preserved and the volumes from 1680 to 1819 are loaned to the Fort St George Museum, a stone's throw away from the church and certainly worth a visit. A copy in thick vellum of the original register, copied in the 18th century, is on display inside the church and all original records from 1819 onwards are also available in the church for inspection, .which I did nor personally see.The credit of first entry goes to the marriage of Elihu Yale to Catherine Hynmers, on 4th November 1680,  and within a week of the original consecration with the Governor, Streynsham Master, giving away the bride. The lady was the widow of Joseph Hynmers, a Member in Council and friend of Yale, who had died in April of that year and David Yale, the son of Eli and Catherine Yale, is buried in the original churchyard, having died in 1688. Yale went on to become Governor of Madras between 1687 - 92   later endowed a building after his name in the college which later came to be called Yale University,  from his personal earning as a trader.The most famous marriage recorded in the church register is, of course ,that of Robert Clive to Margaret Maskelyne, 18t February 1753. The painting in the  alter is  by George Willison 1741 - 97 , a Scottish artist, who came out to Madras in 1774  with  the patronage of Muhammad Ali, Nawab of the Carnatic, who  himself  ane to be based in Madras by this time. St Mary's church in thii  Fort  deseves to be presented to the world for its rich heritage and history of British in India .Its heattening to lnow  it is under the very good care of the Church of South India and the maintenance is being taken care of by ASI ,India This church in my view takes its place of  pride in the historu  of Chennai."

Hence, there may be a large queue to navigate - the police may help you queue jump if its obvious that you are a tourist rather than someone seeking to go into the administrative buildings.Once at the church the shift in ambiance is palpable and its worth spending some quiet reflective time just wandering around and taking in the history of the place and the many lives are referenced there in the plaques and gravestones."

All who so ever present in church stood up in a single line and wait for his turn.to my surprise father is not giving prasadam to everybody. i noticed the same from long distance however don't know what is happening exactly. when me and wife reached to father he asked prasadam (sweet, holy water or whatever) is only for catholic so he cant give to us. this happened with many people there and everybody was shocked how come a priest can do this kind of behavior with the children.otherwise good place for prayer."
St_Mary_s_Church,Peter S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Wonderful relic - worth visiting,"St Mary's church's origins date back to the very beginnings of English rule in Madras - the gravestones that cover the ground inside its gates testify to that. The fabric of the church's interior is later, but is still evocative of the British period, not least in the many memorials on the walls.But the most impressive thing about the church is that it is not just an historical monument - I was there on a Wednesday lunchtime, and there were easily a dozen people using it, for prayer, Bible-reading or (possibly) having a quiet snooze. Most were members of various Indian uniformed services or government servants employed nearby in the huge and busy fort.There was an interesting-looking booklet on sale 'A Walk around St Mary's' which I would have bought but there was no one around to take my money. Still, it was a most enjoyable and interesting visit: highly recommended."

Every Tuesday of the week is considered to be a special day to visit this church and every first Tuesday of the month is considered to be very special and lots of people come in to worship to St.Anthony. The faith on this church has no religious difference, not only Christians also Hindus, Muslims and people from other religion come here. People from different parts of the Chennai city as well as people from other parts of the country and even foreigners come here to worship. Adjacent to it is St.Mary's Higher Secondary School where I did my schooling, so I was lucky enought to do my prayers daily till I was studying in that school. Now I go and worship every Tuesday on my way home and pay my devotion to Mother Mary and St.Anthony.

National_Art_Gallery,MarkfromtheIsland,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-19,Review of the bronze gallery - main museum is closed,"So the main museum here is closed because nobody noticed the roof was leaking till all the art was damaged.  That pretty much sets the stage for why I rated this poorly.The bronze gallery has some beautiful work in it but it's marred by a total lack of care.The ground are all dug up for some renovation work.  That's understandable.  But dumping loads of gravel across the walking paths isn't.  Having a gallery with the air conditioning out and not expected to be working for 60 days isn't.  Allowing a large group of elementary school children to roar around screaming while other visitors are trying to see the sights isn't.  The display and display cabinets being full of dust both inside and outside isn'tGet it together here.  These are historical artifacts, not the contents of your aunt Karen't garage."

National_Art_Gallery,KANewYork,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Local art,"Entry tickets can be bought adjacent to the main gate from where you enter. Different rates for Indians and foreigners. If you want to take pictures you can pay extra. The complex contains many buildings. Many were closed or in the process of renovation. The anthropology section was open partially.. just a couple of rooms on the ground floor displaying weapons. The highlight was clearly the Bronze gallery with some pieces dating back to the 9th century AD. Most are forms of gods and goddesses. The large nataraja or dancing shiva statue from Tanjore is the the one whose copies are sold everywhere in India from small trinket sized to large show pieces. No photography was allowed in here.The complex has lots of shade from a large number of trees, so it‚Äôs relatively pleasant walking in here as compared to the city streets."
National_Art_Gallery,Nigel G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Nice Selection of Art,"The National Art Gallery is within the National Museum compound. I was thoroughly confused here when I arrived regarding the ticketing and by the advice given by my driver. You buy your ticket at the ticket office. There is NO ticket for the National Art Gallery - it is only a National Museum ticket which covers all six houses of the complex. That's the first mystery solved. Second - why do I need to go to Gallery 1 - Mogul Architecture if I want to see the art - that's because you need to activate your ticket there and if you want to buy a camera pass that's where you get it from for R250. Now you are free to go anywhere and in any order. Did unit 1 as I was there then moved the the Art Museum in building 6. It's very messy as there is much renovation going on. You are told to disregard the no photography signs if you have purchased the camera pass.Arrived at building 6 and the lower floor was all about handicraft and models etc. True art on the two upper levels. I had heard this Museum has an excellent presentation on holograms which is on the 2nd floor but unfortunately this was closed. So the art collection - as you enter some examples of officials of the British Colonial Administration. Not of much interest to me. Moving on nice ethnic art of all sorts. You can see the influence of Picasso for example in works by Narasimma Murthy - very impressive. Excellent portrait of Gandhi by KV Vaidayanathan - Father of the nation - a great tribute. Some mogul art paintings . Excellent collection but less than excellent lighting. As it goes, not too many attendants in the museum so I chose to alter the lighting if I wanted to take photos - of course returning it to the original position afterwards. Excellent collection. - disappointed upper floor was closed but I guess it was being renovated. Book shop in buildings 1 and 6. Parking - anywhere you can find. "

National_Art_Gallery,John S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Outstanding Bronzes,"The museum complex has exhibits scattered theough several old Raj era buildings.  The surrounding grounds are run down, with dry fountains, broken fencing, a few pie dogs, etc., but I like that kind of atmosphere.  I only went in the Chola bronze museum and the contemporary art exhibit.  The later can be missed, it's more like a craft show, but if you're into folk art, then give it a look.  The bronzes, on the other hand, are spectacular.  These objects date mostly from the 9th to 11th centuries, are displayed well in glass cases, and have not been cleaned up, so the patina of centuries of incense and smoke remain on the surfaces.  The artistic talent that went into the crafting of these works of religious devotion is amazing.  There is a large sampling of Siva Natraj images, each one with subtle variations, and a large one at the far end of the hall that is displayed against a backdrop of a galaxy of stars, very fitting for the symbolism of the figure.  Budhist and Jain figures are also included, along with well written wall monographs on topics such as the iconography of the figures, and the various methods used to fashion the images.  Also, the room is fairly cool, always welcome in Chennai's perpetual heat.  If you are foreign, you will pay more that a native to get in, but I am glad to help support such a fine collection.  You will not find such a collection anywhere elso in the world."

However the Senate building is an important Indo-Sarcenic building which is a Victorian picturesque style with blended Italian and Sarcenic designs. It is the masdterpiece of architect Robert Chisholm and was completed in 1873. In addition the Presidency College which gave photo permission is also on site and is another good example of the style.

I just happened to view the dome of Madras University's Senate Hall from across the MGR Samadhi at Marina Beach and was immediately attracted by beautiful domes painted with vibrant colors. I am glad that I walked through the subway to this great monument.The architect from outside is so captivating that I took numerous rounds of the Hall to capture it in my camera from various angles. From the outside the architect dominated by domes appears Islamic. But from inside, there is a complete transformation in style. With its tainted glasses, curved walls, long pillars, painted ceiling and a podium, it can pass as a beautiful Catholic church. Carvings of Hindu gods and godesses  on the columns at the entrance compliment the architect blend.Architect alone is not the only attraction. There is a permanent exhibition of documents, photographs and  paintings depicting not only the history of Madras University but also history of education institutes starting from 11th Century.Some of most important documents display the curriculum, salary paid to teachers and allowance paid to students during height of Chola dynasty in South.Building and its surroundings can do with some improvement is house keeping.

One day Devikarumari took the image of old nomadic lady and went to Sun to forecast his future. Without realising her as Devikarumari, He simply neglected her. Devikarumari immediately vanished. Sun has lost it's brightness and its glory started declining. Realising his mistake He begged Devikarumari to forgive and excuse him. Sun also requested Devikarumari to celebrate Sunday as the day of Devikarumari. Devikarumari also accepted it.He also got permission from Her to pour on her sun rays twice in a year in the month of Panguni and Purattasi. So Sunday is celebrated as the day of Karumari . We can happily witness the scene of sun rays falling on the head of Devikarumari twice in a year. Devikarumari made Narayanan Seat there.Once upon a time Lord Thirumal came to Thiruverkadu to witness the grace rule of Umadevi. When Thirumal personally met his sister Karumari, she requested him ""to seat there as Srinivasan of Thirumurai and assist Her and bless the devotees who worship Navagraham and stand towards southern direction"".

The sanctum sanctorum houses a beautifully decorated bust of the goddess Karumariamman, and devotees are allowed to worship in small groups of 15-20 people in order to avoid congestion in the very narrow space.The streets around the temple are very crowded and traffic moves in a chaotic manner.   Better traffic regulation is definitely required.  There is no chappal stand, and footwear is left in a haphazard manner all around the entrance to the temple.   The highway leading to the temple is also in bad condition, potholed and narrow.  The temple is open on all days from 5am in the morning and closes only at 9.30pm.  On Sundays which are especially auspicious to visit the goddess, the temple opens and closes an hour earlier and later.   There are special entry tickets for Rs.50/- and Rs.20/- in addition to the free darshan queue.  The 50/- rupee entry tickets allows you a closer look at the goddess.The temple has a legend associated with the sun god.  Parvathi Devi is believed to have visited Surya in the guise of an old woman, ostensibly to forecast his future, but was not received with respect.  Furious, she cursed Surya to lose his divine radiance, and the penitent sun god is believed to have undertaken severe penance in order to have his radiance restored.   The rays of the sun also fall directly on the idol of the goddess twice in a year, during the Tamil months of Purattasi and Panguni.The temple can be covered in half a day along with the Vedapureeswarar temple, also at Thiruverkadu, and the Kamakshi amman temple at Mangadu.

Saravana_Stores,bgonner,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Wide variety of items,"Our tour group visited this store a few days before we headed back to the U. S.  The store has a lot to choose from with what seemed to me to be reasonable prices.  We recognized some of the items as being the same or similar to what we found at outside vendors, but in a more organized and tidy environment.  The elevator options are a bit confusing, with one side going to odd numbered floors and the other going to even numbered floors.  We ended up using the stairs as the elevators were often crowded and the wait time seemed long.My husband and I purchased a few hair items for our daughter, along with some earrings and bracelets.  I purchased a stainless steel masala dabba which seemed of nice quality and weight.  It included a spoon and seven containers; a cover with a clear plastic piece was nice, to be able to see the spices once they are placed in the dabba.  The checkout process was interesting.  You start at one end where someone enters all the purchases into a register, and then go to another person who seemingly checks everything and then gives you a receipt, which you hand to the next person, who seems to check everything once again, and then put the items in a bag.  I'm not clear why they employ such a labor intensive process; I guess they have their reasons.  When we arrived at a different floor with the bag containing the dabba, we were motioned over to an area where they sealed our bag shut.  Also interesting was that at a point where we were about to get our receipt, a young lady came by with a tray, some metal cups, and tea.  The check-out staff were served tea.  We knew tea time in India is very important, but had never seen it at a shopping center.  Even for people at work, everything seems to stop for tea.  The British influence is very obvious!Although our tour guide cautioned us to watch our bags, for men to put their wallet in a front pocket, and for anyone with a backpack to carry it in front of them, I didn't feel threatened in the store."

We regularly visit their T' Nagar store on Ranganathan Street. Each store has 5 or more floors, with additional mezzanine floors.  They cover textiles, garments, household items, electronics, luggage, etc. They have a  wide range of goods and prices are usually below MRP. We go at 9.30 am when the store opens, as it gets quite crowded later. They have branded and unbranded items. Many of the sales persons are from North and East India. Speaking to them in their language or in Hindi, will illicit a better response from them. Ready made garments can be altered for free, by their tailors in the basement. They are very fast.There is a fruit section on the 5th floor with an inexpensive cafeteria too. Patience and perseverance are required if one is looking for a specific item, as there is such a variety."

I decided to go grocery shopping and asked my host for suggestion. He suggested this place and I visited this place along with a friend at 6 pm.It looked huge from outside with many floors and only when we entered its gate did we realize the mistake we made. Every inch of the mall is filled with crazy crowds and there is no space even to walk. We saw their collection of clothes which are cheap and old style.There is a huge queue near the grocery section and we decided to skip shopping as it would have taken at least 30 minutes for us to get billing done. There is also a huge queue to get on to the lift and we decided to take stairs to rush out of this mall. It is one of my most terrible shopping mall experiences.

I wish the management of the stores would recognize Sarala for her outstanding customer service. You can buy any product form this store without rustifying outside at a cheaper price. A must visit for any shopper if you are visiting Chenaai. Only issue I observed was that the Restaurant area was smaller and cannot accomodate the large crowds that flock the area during the lunch time. Also kindly improve the standards of washrooms as they are in a bad status."

It is on the main Rajiv Gandhi Salai and easily accessible. It gives a great shopping experience. There are six floors for shopping whatever you need. Ground Floor has gold show room. There is also a separate vegetable & Fruit Shop. In the first floor is a ladies saree and chuddidhar section. In the second floor is ladies ready made section. The third floor is earmarked for Branded cosmetics, hand bags, travel bags, school bags, gents shoes & chappals, ladies chappals & shoes etc. Fourth floor consists of all Home appliances, vessels & plastic items. Fifth floor has Gents ready made items & cloth material and lastly the sixth floor has Home appliances & furniture. There are escalators & lifts for moving to different floors. Some sections are still under construction and the shop is not fully functional. It will take some time to go for it. The items vary from budget to high end. It will definitely suit all pockets. There is shortage of staff and billing takes much time particularly during peak hour in the evenings & on holidays. Good place to shop with family & children and no doubt caters to them all. Better to avoid peak time for hassle free shipping."

Saravana_Stores,Michelle,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Enter this shopping mall at your own risk!,"A shopping mall with inexpensive rates: Saravana Stores is a huge mall on purasawakkam road, known for its inexpensive rates and vast range of items. There are about nine floors or more and have a variety of things ranging from appliances, groceries, furniture etc. Our Experience as a family: We visited Saravana Stores (Purasawakkam branch) as a family of four with one child after much hesitation on account of the mixed reviews we had heard - some loved the rates and recommended it and others warned us to stay away from the place.  However, we were definitely not prepared for the shopping experience. It is a known fact that the place is very crowded so we picked the afternoon so it was fairly crowded. The first thing that greets you is the absolute rudeness of the staff (imagine people herding cattle) at every point. Ignore that and there is a price to pay as we found out. The basement is where we chose to go first simply because we did not have to stand for the elevator as there were about 25 people waiting to get it. The girls and ladies in blue and white order you around telling you what to do. At one narrow passage, there was a young girl (Chandramati) who took a crumpled packed and asked that I put my bag/purse (about 6 x 4 n inches) there. This puzzled me as I could not understand why I would have to give my money and original documents (which was in the bag) to be put into a crumpled bag. No one explained but the staff opposite told her to let me go. She did and I went on only to turn back and see her venting her rage by throwing the packet on the floor in disgust. What she did not realize was that my whole family was following behind and was witness to the unprovoked rage and they objected to the display of anger for no sensible reason. It was very unsettling and quite a traumatic experience given that we come from a suburb where customers are treated with some basic dignity. A passing shopper then told me that this was the way the staff usually behaved and the attitude they displayed was as though they owned all the things in there (quite a consolation indeed!!)  We spoke to the manager, who was very polite and understanding and he called for her and spoke/reprimanded her (in private) but nevertheless, with our traumatic personal experience, it will mean that the first time we walked in there would also become our very last time. Should you shop here? If you are a person/family who is fine/comfortable with crowds, the heat (no air conditioning seemed to be on when we went) and is prepared for experiences like this, this place would be good to go to as it has all things at a lesser rate all under one roof. However, I am not sure of the quality of the items as I have never had the opportunity to enter in peace and make a purchase."

It was booking ( not on line ) no movie apps on cell phones ( there were no cell phones then almost 45 years ago when one went with friends or the family to enjoy a movie with ones loved ones in a movie theatre which was a sheer delightful experience especially if the movie was good as one enjoyed the ambience experience,company... it was indeed sheer delight !Dr.Javed Rasheed"

Unlike its other cinema halls located in the Express Avenue and Forum Vijaya Mall, this is located in a slightly congested locality. However, the movie halls are clean and offer a good experience for the movie goer. The food sold in the canteen is of good quality. Some of the favourite items include the cream doughnut, vegetable puffs and chat items. For those who love popcorn, their varieties are the best. Only thing is you have to buy those big tubs of popcorn unlike the earlier days when they would serve in smaller quantities. The ID restaurant is also located inside the complex.

As for this particular visit, since the show had begun with the screening of advertisements, due to whihc the lights had already dimmed out, we struggled our way to our seats as there was no, numbering. Luckily we could locate our rows easily. However, one had to quickly count and check if we were going towards are reserved seats only.

Madras_War_Cemetery,Thangam M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 ‚Ä¢ Family,""" Love's last gift, remembrance""...","The Madras War Cemetery is a little known and even less visited attraction at Chennai (Madras) - which is indeed a great pity, since it is lovingly cared for and meticulously maintained.This war cemetery resembles a huge acreage of lawn but for the stark contrast between the verdant land and the orderly rows of gravestones that indelibly mark it. Walking through here one actually feels the emotions expressed in words poignant yet all too incomplete, by families that lost their loved ones to the great wars.Here the gravestones speak if one has ears to listen. Gravestones that speak of lives lost too young, of families torn asunder, of young widows and young ones who lost a parent, of the nobility of defending comrades and country, of supreme sacrifice to protect the highest human values.The Madras War Cemetery is located on Mount Poonamallee High Road, at Nandambakkam, about 6 kms from Chennai airport and just about a kilometre from St. Thomas Mount. It can be reached easily by road and by suburban rail - the closest railway station is St. Thomas Mount.Visiting hours at the cemetery are 8am through 6pm all days of the week.Established in 1952 in homage to the men and women who made the supreme sacrifice in World War II, this cemetery is maintained jointly by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) and the Government of India.The CWGC which was set up almost a century ago in 1917, has the noble mission of ensuring that the over 1.7 million who were killed in the two world wars are not forgotten - they do this by taking care of cemeteries housing the war dead in 154 countries!Apart from 856 casualties of World War II, this cemetery also lists and commemorates 1039 servicemen who died in various parts of India during World War I (1914-1918). The 1914-1918 memorial is located at the rear of the cemetery.After entering the cemetery through a cupola that marks the entrance, one's eyes are instantly drawn to the Stone of Remembrance that bears the immortal words from the Book of Ecclesiasticus: ""Their name liveth forevermore.""Behind and to both sides of the Stone of Remembrance are six plots of gravestones in rows set in neatly trimmed grass with flowering plants or green shrubs gracing the foot of each grave stone.Each granite or marble gravestone bears the insignia of the corps to which the service man or woman belonged, service rank followed by his/her name, the name of the corps/force served, the date of passing and his/her age when death on the battlefield abruptly cut short a brave life and left only tearful memories of a martyr gone much too soon. This is followed by the epitaph and in a few cases the the relationship of those dedicating it to the fallen soldier.Beyond this section is the Cross Of Sacrifice - a crucifix set on an octagonal base with a huge bronze sword on its shaft glinting in the harsh sunlight. Behind the Cross of Sacrifice are three more plots of gravestones. Bringing up the rear of the war cemetery is the Madras 1914-1918 memorial to those who lost their lives in World War I.Madras has a hot and humid climate - so a suggestion to all who would like to visit the Madras War Cemetery and spend some blessed time here is to carry enough drinking water and an umbrella to protect yourself from the merciless sun. Even better, make sure to start your visit by 8am itself which is when the war cemetery is possibly at its best - the grass freshly watered, the earth still damp and the flowers happily turn up their faces to greet the new born sun.Here is a selection of epitaphs that grace the gravestones at this war cemetery - beautifully worded, yet so inadequate to the task of narrating the stories of so many lives cut short too soon. Too far thy grave to see, but not too far to think of theeAmidst life's changes we love him yet, he is ours to remember when others forgetOne to the world, but all the world to usSo loved, so mourned, so missed time heals all wounds but time can be so longSweet memories will linger in our hearts forever Good night darling, not good byeTo the world he was just a part to me he was all the worldSay not good night, but in some brighter clime bid me good morningIn India alone, but in our hearts at homeA day to remember, sad to recallwithout farewell he left us allRemembrance is the only paradise from which we cannot be drivenA cheery smile, a heart of goldone of the best the world could holdWithout farewell he fell asleepleaving only a memory for us to keepThey shall not grow old, as we that are left grow oldGod will link the broken chain as one by one we meet againHis life a beautiful memory, his absence a silent griefSleep on dear son, as days go by no flowers can I place on the grave where you lieThree little words Forget-me-not, they don't seem much but they mean a lotGod's garden is most beautiful, he only picks the bestLove's last gift, remembranceThe futility of war is the one thought that lingers on as one leaves this final resting place for so many young lives."

It's very beautiful and well maintained. I have seen this type of places only in Holly wood films. I was surprised to see a similar place in Chennai. Many people doesn't know about this place. I followed Google Maps. Its very neat and calm.     This place is built as tribute for the soldiers who died on the war. What I felt is none of the visitors are having any respect to this place. Every one just want to click some profile pic and cover pics. They will sit, stand, lie down in front of the burials for a pic. Walking through the lawns is not good as it will affect the beauty. Please don't litter. Pay respect to the place."

I would have passed it by, if I had not been looking out for it. Built and maintained by the British War Graves Commission, it is a memorial of young lives lost during World War II. Row upon row of headstones tell stories of young British lads who fell on foreign soil. Almost all of them were between 20 and 30 years of age.It will be an emotional pilgrimage for those with a family connection; for others like me,  it is a grim reminder of the price that others may have paid for our peace."

A quick walk around the place shows, the headstones are set up date wise and as many as a dozen or more soldiers have died on the same dates in various combat situations.                 The headstones are remarkable with the amount of detail on them esp. with regards to the elaborate engraving of the emblem of the respective Corps of the fallen Officer/Soldier...Coldstream Guards,The Kings Regt.,R.E.M.E., Royal Airforce,Royal Signals,Dragoons/Armoured Corps.,Royal Artillery,Rifle Corps.,Wiltshire Regt.,York & Lancaster Regt.,Worcestershire Regt., East Yorkshire Regt.,The Gordon Highlanders,Royal Scots,Medical Corps. ...                         Soldiers as young as 19 have headstones here.. Details on the headstones are very revealing..give the age,name,rank,corps,hometown[sometimes],qualifications[of the military surgeons] and the names of the family members who've buried them...along with gut wrenching messages from bereaved finacees/wives/parents/siblings and daughters.                      Some tombs have inscriptions by the bereaved family in Welsh...and one 19 yr old soldiers headstone says ""A foreign grave is a painful thing to a mother's aching heart.""                  A glimpse into the past..of people born more than a 100 years ago in Victorian and Edwardian England and lost their lives in a India.

A lot of fun games and electronic rides for small kids including bike, car, and roller ride. A lot of gaming options for kids to enjoy but prices are a little high. One can spend a lovely time watching movies, play games and eat good food.  It is one time to visit this place if you are not accustomed to shopping malls having gaming zones and food court. People staying in metros may not appreciate this on bigger scale. Since it is the only mall available in ECR so people hop on to this place very frequently on weekends."

The outdated system of some sort of prepaid card for purchase of food is a big put off. Men's room is almost never well maintained. Parking is a challenge, and the cost of parking is a top off, in addition to the toll you pay.

But the decision turned out to be a disaster. The whole place stank like anything. Food counters were unhygienic and staff maintaining it were rude and impolite. The worst experience awaited us inside hall. There was a strange smell all the while and seats and floor were unclean. The screen was very small and sound system is nothing to write home about. The eatables were also exorbitantly priced. Many of the floors were unlit and looked like sets from horror movies. Don't go unless you've nothing to do.

We drive down from Pondicherry quite frequently to catch up with the latest Bollywood and Hollywood movies.Maayajaal as it proclaims to have 16 Screens, is Aisa's largest Multiplex. All the screens are excellent in terms of Picture quality and sound effects. The airconditioning inside the screens is awesome. The seats are reasonably comfortable and the theatres are quite clean.However Maayajaal fails miserably in terms of other attractions. The food court is pathetic. The airconditioning is very bad. The ticketing on site is horrible. The escalators are not so well maintained. The parking is overflowing and no shade available in the parking despite being charged.The shopping arcade on the ground floor does not run the airconditioning at all and that is unprofessional.The car spa & Nilgris superstore save the grace."

The 'so called' mall has deteriorated a lot  in the recent years maybe due to the growing number of malls in Chennai... 16 screen multiplex.. All the screens are small.. Parking space is good.. Not much to do over here... You can come here once or twice.. After that it wouldn't seem an intresting place... Overall to sum up.. It is an ok-ok place to visit and spend a good evening..

Mayajaal_Entertainment,Ganesh S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Weekend Movie,Visiting it Maayajal after a very long period and it hass definitely lost it's charm. Had to go there since I couldn't find movie tickets for a movie that release over the weekend. Place is dull inside compared to the malls that are brightly lit. Lacks air conditioning and what one expects from such a place. Theater needs attentions with modern amenities with which the theaters in the cities attracts people. Had to go round and round to locate the screen we booked(may be since I was going there after a really long time). The ECR road which is itself an attraction now is being expanded and hence it's difficult to enjoy the ride.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,meghna4409,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Okay-ish,"It's an average theatre where the staff doesn't mind you much. You could buy the ticket for one film, get in, and then watch three films and nobody would find out. There's no cloak room, so you're allowed to take your bags inside the theatre. So feel free to get cheap food to snack on inside the theatre rather than buying from inside which is x100 times priced."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Sakthivelu Raja,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Just ok ,"Average quslity theatre. If you are desperate to watch a specific movie and difficult to get tickets in city halls, head here."

In an nutshell, THIS IS NOT AN ATTRACTION... i would avoid it like plague. The owners should visit other similar facilities such as the ones in Express Avenue. Shame on Mayajaal to take customer's money and not providing a clean and tidy environment to relax and enjoy."

It has 16 cine- screens for movies, gaming center, huge food court and other entertainment options. Situated on the ECR Road I visited the place only once out of excitement and once there all my excitement died. The establishment was poorly lit, AC was not working in its full capacity, food court had some awful items to eat and the overall maintenance of the property was in shambles. Washrooms were pathetic, parking was chaotic and security was near zero. If I have to opine that Mayajaal is the last place in Chennai to visit for watching movies I would rather stop watching movies all my life than visit here again."

Mayajaal_Entertainment,Ramkumar R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good If you are looking for less crowded Mall in Chennai,"Its seems nowadays Mayajaal is being considered as last choice for the city people. It could be due to the long distance. But if you want to go on for a little travel in ECR , then this is the perfect spot to have some time spent on the way. The plus point is you can always get tickets for the movies as there are many screens, you can randomly go to the mall and watch your choice of movies. Overall i would say its a good place though not as fancy as other malls in the city."

We had a nice evening with various animals & birds in enclosures like, langoors (monkeys), Deers, zebra, Turtles, Peacock, EMU,Parrots, lovebirds, Rabbits, varieties of snakes etc. It was sad to notice that lots of enclosures were empty and many were still under construction. There are two or three play areas & children like it very much. More than a children‚Äôs park it is a lovers park, as you can see them a lot loitering here & there. Hardly you can spend Two or three hours here, as it is tiring & no other entertainment & empty enclosures. Lot can be done to make it more attractive not only for Children but also for those who accompany them. But not a bad idea to take your children and visitors once in a while away from the busy life in a concrete jungle. Best time is after you leisurely finish your lunch at home, but not in the hot sun."

I naturally judged it by western zoo standards, and this place would without a doubt get shut down in Europe.The enclosures are tiny and inadequate and what we saw of the diets for the primates in particular was also less than adequate.  People were able to get too close to the animals which inevitably meant that many of the primates were fed chocolates and proded through the enclosure fencing.The grounds are a mixed bag of having a couple of beautifully landscaped sections interspersed with crumbling paths badly kept lawns and large areas where rubbish seems to accumulate.Positive Points - It is very cheapNegative Points -Poor quality enclosuresPoor quality facilitiesUnhappy looking animalsVery dirtyVery poor staff presence"

We took a motorized rickshaw, which was fun, even though a few hair raising moments - which took about 20 minutes from the Raintree, St Mary's Road. When we went in, there were several lovely ladies to help customers, and one of them kindly took us to the floors which contained the goods we were after. All was painless and a nice experience - and we were satisfied we were not being ripped off. It seems particularly good for reasonably priced saris (cotton silk), and material in general. We didn't want ready to wear clothing, but on a quick glance, that floor looked as if there were bargains to be had. We had a quick look at the household section, but couldn't find exactly the copper bowls I had wanted, but settled on a couple of small copper and steel cooking pots. Very cheap.We wanted some silver jewellery, but on the jewellery floor, they only have 'imitation' - were directed to OKJ, 2 minutes up the road, and again we were satisfied and got what we wanted at a pretty good price.Definitely my way of shopping - and all done in less than an hour!"

This temple is in Nemmeli, near Mahabalipuram, ECR. It is open between 7 AM to 7 PM"

Jain_Temple,Anand G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Great ambiance and good architecture,"This is a lovely temple (Shanthinath Jain Temple) located in G N Chetty Road. The  main entrance is unpretentious but once you enter the courtyard you are welcomed by the statues of a pair of life sized elephants. That alone would bowl you over. Beyond that the flight of steps lead to the sanctum. As is popular with Jain temples, it is marbles all the way. The architecture is attractive. The atmosphere is  great. The silene is not deafening but pleasant and invigorating. Excellent place to visit to control stress and recharge bang within the city. Its popularity among the devotees is indicated by the number of high end cars arriving and departing the gates throughout the day."

I found it very clean and noise free and a good place to visit apart from the asthetic sense ."
