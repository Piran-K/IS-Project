Aarupadai_Veedu_Temple,RamGanesan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Six seperate shrines for the six faces of Lord Muruga,"I had been to this temple several times and visited this place after a long gap.  The temple is very close to the beach in Besant Nagar area of Chennai. There are six separate shrines for Lord Muruga, signifying his six abodes and six faces.  What used to be a very peaceful and serene place has now become a commercial place with many marriage functions happening inside the temple. Personally i would feel that the temple is no longer the temple it was in the yester years and has become so commercial. Otherwise the temple is quite well maintained.  There is no dedicated car parking and one has to park in the side streets without disturbing the entry way to the houses on either side."
Aarupadai_Veedu_Temple,Dilip Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Near the Shore -six forms of lord Murugan,"It is a very novel idea to have the replica of all six famous temples of LORD MURUGAN at one place. Had been in chennai for three years and didn't heard about this temple. The one acre temple complex has six murugan and one Gsnapati temple representing all the six famous murugan temples of tamil nadu - 1. Swamimalai at the northeast, 2. Tiruchendur at the east, 3. Palamudirsolai & 4. Tirupparankundram at the south, 5. Palani at the west and 6. Tiruttani in the northwest. The Mahavallabha Ganapati temple is in the center.It is behind the Astha lakshmi temple. Where as the Astha lakshmi temple is directly on the shore - this temple is slightly behind. One cannot see the beach from here. However there is a pathway for the beach from outside the temple - for which I have not ventured. There is a wall before the main entrance facing the shore - may be some construction? Really an ideal place to spend peaceful time with sea breeze and the spiritual aura. And moreover not much crowd in normal days. If you are LORD MURUGAN FOLLOWER - keep the temple on your weekend must visit place list. May god bless all. "

Aarupadai_Veedu_Temple,Pradeep R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,Seashore temple for peace of mind.,"In the year 1984, the sage Kanchi Paramacharya was camping at Gulbarga in Karnataka State, when Dr. Alagappa Alagappan, an Ex-UN Official went to have his darshan. He mentioned to the Acharya regarding having a single temple complex for all the six Padai Veedu temples of Lord Muruga at one place and that too in granite. The sage readily agreed and immediately arranged for an acre of land at Besant Nagar in Chennai near the sea, through the then Chief Minister of Tamilnadu, Late Mr. M. G. Ramachandran and HR & CE Minister Mr. RM. Veerappan. The Temple Complex is located on the shore of Bay of Bengal, behind Ashtalakshmi Temple. Dr. Alagappan is the pioneer in building Hindu temples in the USA. First he built Maha Vallabha Ganapati temple in New York and was instrumental in building many others like the Venkatachalapati temple in Pittsburgh and the Meenakshi temple in Houston. He was advising and helping as well as organising temple architects (stapathis) from India to build these temples. The Kanchi Acharya advised Dr. Alagappan to take up the project and guided him well. He has stressed that it is difficult for the devotees to visit all six Padai Veedus when touring Tamil Nadu. He wished it should be in a single seashore site and he was sure that Tamil Nadu would become prosperous on account of it. Swami Malai praharam and temple were built first in 1995, in remembrance of Paramacharya, whose original name was Swaminathan. Another three temples -- the Mahavallabha Ganapati, Palani and Tiruttani temples -- were completed and consecrated in 1998. Three other temples, namely Tiruchendur, Tirupparankundram and Palamudirsolai, have also been completed with the concecration having taken place in the presence of HH Śrī Jayendra Saraswati Swamigal of Śrī Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam on 21st June 2002. Mr. Muthiah Stapathy, who has built many temples in India and in USA, is the architect of this project. The Mandalabhishekam of the temple was completed on the 4th Aug 2002. It is widely believed that Pamban Swamigal, an ardent devotee of Lord Muruga, who lived in the last century and whose samadhi is very close by, had a premonition that the six temples of Lord Muruga were going to be constructed nearby. Already a number of miracles have been happening in this temple complex. At Swamimalai, in the form of Gurunathan, He is blessing students with school / college admissions and excellence in their studies. When the Trustees of the temple went to order a Vel from the Vummidiar Jewellers, to their great surprise they were told that they had a Vel ready with them especially for Swaminatha Swami. There are many other such instances. The temple complex is unique in its construction. In this complex, Swamimalai is situated in the northeast, Tiruchendur in the east, Palamudirsolai and Tirupparankundram in the south, Palani in the west and Tiruttani in the northwest directions, respectively. The Mahavallabha Ganapati temple is in the center. This temple complex is attracting a large number of devotees from far and near. In addition to local dignitaries and devotees, even devotees from abroad have visited and worshipped in this temple. Unlike other places, the seashore is ideal for meditation with a cool and peaceful atmosphere. Homams are regularly conducted at the request of the devotees. Festivals revering Lord Muruga are celebrated here in the traditional way. Valli Tirukkalyanam at the temple has become popular with parents of marriageable girls, and many of them have had immediate grant of their wishes. The morning Darshan timings are from 6:00 AM to 12:00 noon and evening Darshan timings are from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The darshan and puja time of the temple are extended during auspicious days. There will be change in the opening and closing time during festivals, important rituals and eclipses. Visitors / tourists to Chennai should make this temple as ‘must visit’. "

Aarupadai_Veedu_Temple,chidambaram k,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Visit with family,"The idea behind the concept of this temple was to bring the 6 major Murugan shrines under one roof. In my view, this does not make sense as each of those shrines has a history behind it. Visiting them individually is a different experience as compared to bringing them all together inside one temple. Nothwithstanding, this temple is quite average. "

It is right on the seashore and the Thiruchendur Murugan's temple is facing the sea - east.  The Rajagopuram is still in the making. The expanse of the compound with stone paved floors is clean.  The Archagas do not demand any thing for your offerings.  There is no fee / tickets for archanga or Aarthi. What the devotees offer is happily accepted and kept in the Hundis by the Archagas.  During evenings some of the oldies in and around the temple gather for chanting Rudram /chamakam.   Sincere thanks to late MGR for initiating this complex.
