Ananthaa_Padmanabha_Swaamy_Temple,Mihir C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,Utter mismanagement in Padmanava Temple in Trivandum,"We went to the temple on the 22nd of September, 2019. There was no management to control the devotees. In fact, it was free for all. Only the mighty people can make their way to darsan. I was in the 3rd row and I could see nothing. More number of priests obstructed view. I expect local administration to take a note of that. Devotees should try toavoid going to that temple. We were very upset afterspending almost 3 hours there could see only the priests. Temple authority should arrange video screen in the temple like that in Mahakaaleswar temple in Ujjain, MP."

Visit to this temple was organized by our client for us after as a one day trip to Chennai after our audit assignment was concluded. The temple is big and widespread over a large area with open space for parking and shops around its corner. The architecture concept of the temple is exactly that of Padmanabha Swamy temple of Kerala. Even the statue of Lord Narayan is also same in the exact lying down position. The major difference is that the original statue of Kerala temple is made of pure gold while that of Chennai is stone with decoration of gold and silver metals.People visits lot here to offer their prayers. You will find accessories shops of flowers, sweets, fragrance sticks to offer prayer inside the temple. Some other shops are also there like music, clothes, wall frames, decorative pieces, toys, etc. Moreover, there is strict security checking just at the entrance of the temple. It will take around one hour to explore this temple from the time you stop at this place till you move out from this temple.

Ananthaa_Padmanabha_Swaamy_Temple,vinayan20152015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,Example of modern yet traditional South Indian Temple architecture and Ambience,"Having already visited the Original Padmanabha Swamy Temple in Triivandrum several times, I was very keen to see what the Chennai version was like. We were not disappointed.  This temple has taken the essence of the Trivandrum shrine, and has imparted the unique Tamil ambience to the Murti. The temple is centrally located , in fact with possibilities of traffic jams on key days... The Padmanabha Swamy idol is in the same reclining position, viewed through three doors....one for the feet with the Holy Consort Devi visible, the middle door for the Torso, with the Umblical Cord and Brahma seated on it; and the third door showing the head and hand drooping on the floor just above the Shiva Linga . There are other deities in the background looking on...The piety and gravitas of the atmosphere in Trivandrum is not so prominent here. Instead of being awe-inspiring, here it is more democratic or transparent(!) is the feeling we get...But either way, this place gives you the indefinable presense that electric feeling you get in places close to the devine... Visit on a non-busy day or time, if you want to actually soak in the atmosphere leisurely...."

Ananthaa_Padmanabha_Swaamy_Temple,Shaji V K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,a good worship place but did not give me the inner peace,"A temple, in my opinion, has to have that feeling of serenity and not make you feel awe about the place. Eg the old temples like Marudeeswarar temple at Tiruvanmiyur or the Vadivudaiamman temple at thiruvottiyur. At this temple, I could feel a rush with people, all walking quickly as if to catch a train. The prasadam is excellent here but you can see that many boxes are being packed and sent off...not sure to whom. "

Only Hindus are allowed inside the temple. Dress code is there also - dhoti for men & sharee for women which I didn't like.

This level of tolerance and affection for devotees  is missing even in today's democracy and should be a lesson for all.
