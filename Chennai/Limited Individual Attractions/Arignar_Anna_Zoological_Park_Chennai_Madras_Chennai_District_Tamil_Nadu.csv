Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,megu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Friends,One day trip for friends and family,"One is the best Zoo in India.There are many things to say about this Zoo.1. This Zoo has a huge range of animals in it.2. The area is very huge, needs atleast an entire day to view all the animals, it's best to take a cycle, Elders and children can use the battery car service, others can walk if they want/can.3. 90rs. per adult, 50rs per child and mandatory to buy tickets for mobile 25rs per mobile.4. Outside food strictly are allowed only in stainless boxes and reusable plastics, but not in use and throw containers.5. The Zoo has a restaurant inside.6. There is also a milk and an icecream parlour inside.7. Car parking available"
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Jayesh Chandra ... P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Nature,"Take all the tickets outside.  The entry fee, the camera fee, the lion safari fee, the battery vehicle fee etc.  The cycle fee is inside if you want to ride a cycle.  and the food inside is so so.  The kids will complain.  But the Lion Safari and Deer Safari can be done first in the morning.  Then go around the Zoo.  The white tiger is beautiful.  So is the Rhino and Hippo.  If you can't cycle, take the battery vehicle, but you will miss many enclosures. The day we visited a lot of cleaning was going on, so it was neat. "
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Vinodhan Vidhyasagar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Visit Early or Wait at long queues.,"We had visited on Saturday and arrived at 10:30 AM against opening time of 9:00 AM. It took about 20 minutes to get the entry tickets. Heck, the ticket counter did not provide any information on the Ticket Options. Note, You would have to pay Rs.25 for cell phone if you wish to take photos with them. We took Zoo Round or whatever name they want to call it for Rs.100. They would take you around the zoo in a Golf Cart. They would stop at few places and let you down. Its best suited for elders. If you are with a kid, choose cycles which can be hired inside the zoo. They also have the Lion & Deer 'Safari' which was a just a waste of time depending on your luck!We first went by Golf Cart and saw the routes and familiarised with the location as the place was extensive. We then went to hire the cycle and went around the park as well. If you want to hire the cycles, please do so by 11:00 else expect huge waiting time as they have limited cycles only. Charges for Cycle was Rs. 30 per hour. Child ( less than 3 years ) they provide with a child seat fixed on front. They also have electric scooter charged at Rs. 90 per hour. They DEMAND a Security Deposit of Rs. 500 for two cycles which was given back! Over all, its better to take Electric Scooter, if unavailable take the Cycle. The food joints was pathetic. Bad enough, You cannot bring your own food as well. However, somehow few other smuggled them which made me wonder how could they do it? Anyway, the food was pathetic. They have drinking water around the park though I would refrain from drinking from them. Water bottles were available. If you are with a kid, better have some snacks and bring it in a box and not in the plastic cover. Inform at entrance as they would allow. Else, you have to deposit it with them. Oh! The animals, well, its to your luck. You can see most of them. However, if the park is crowded, expect animals to take shelter. I felt bad for the Elephant. It was chained and made to stand under scorching sun. Overall, Way lower than Tiruvandram Zoo or Mangalore Zoo. If you havent been to any of those, you would enjoy."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,ThAnUsHaNaVaS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Travelling inside with Buggy cart,"Since it have a vast area , we thought of taking buggy cart to see the Zoo by paying additional 200 bucks for each person ....But unfortunately it was disappointing .... In one hour they cover the zoo visit with just 4 stops .... and each stop will be having just 5- 10 minutes .... I suggest you to walk and see the zoo .....since it have lots of rare species in the zoo ......  like white tiger ...."

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,asmath t,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Family Visit ,"I have visited yesterday with family (4 members ).. When i reached the entrance thought of going Lion safari, when i was searching where to take ticket for lion safari then the driver (No name batch - Couldn't find the Names) immediately respond me and told you sit in the van and while you get down you can pay the money to him. I thought that's the procedure.. (Since i am riding first time to lion safari don't know the procedure )After the safari finished driver took me Rs. 400 for 4 adults. (But non of other passengers paid to him). Then only o realized that the driver taking the money directly from the people and keeping it in the pocket.. If this is the practice then imagine how much money will the earn everyday.. (I hope they get the monthly salary ). If this mal practice continues then the zoo revenue will go down and we have to take out this kind of practice from the staff.. Secondly we tried having food in Tamilnadu hotel inside the zoo. Went 5:10 pm in the evening approx. By seeing menu in the notice board i asked for chilly chicken then the cashier told all this menu now not available.. Fare enough.. But then they should not display in menu board and to keep in cashier counter.. At least they should keep the available menu only written on menu board.. When i ask this to the cashier(On his face full of pimples were there No Name batch was fixed. Couldn't take the name) he replied that it's our wish, we keep the food, erase the food, we sell the food or we don't sell the food. Shocked by his answer.. Because i am basically a hotelier from hospitality background.. If at all you are not a kind to people at least you should respect the job and know ur limit.. If you have staff like this will the hotel get revenue?? Because you get different different people from the world everyday.. You may not get the same guest everyday. But the experience at your hotel matters.. This all my observation and wanna to get to the Aringar Anna Zoo - Vadalur Zoo management notice.. Thanks.. "
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Shubhi06,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,I would recommend it !,"One of the better zoos I have visited in India, full of big cats and reptiles and birds. It is spread in a wide area enclosing parts of natural habitat and a shallow lake. It becomes particularly chirpy during winter migratory season when numerable birds arrive. It boasts few mating centers for big animals as well.They provide bicycle on rent to explore inside. One can bring their food (not in plastic) and enjoy a picnic day. Only tic is if you have a mobile and it has a camera, you will be charged for it."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,ArpanPahm,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,It is located in Vandalur,This is basically zoological park. It s located in Vandalur. Good place for visit with family. Cleaning and cool environment was really nice.
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,It's far away from city but must for children,"Zoo park in Chennai is very far from city. It too long. There was a local  train route. It was too hectic trip. We bought all the snacks outside. They are taking so much care about the environment. They don't allow even the biscuit packet covers and chips packets covers or any other packet covers. But it's a wrong idea I felt. We had to put all the chips, biscuits in a newspaper. So don't carry more if you don't need. Because if there any things remaining all go waste.Once you enter inside book electric vehicle. Otherwise you will have to walk long and lose all your energy in especially if it is a hot summer. There is long queue for electric vehicle ticket counter. Coming to animals, there many varieties. But we lost interest because we had been with elderly people and missed the station as we had been here for the first time by train. Everything went wrong. So it was not a great experience as we already had seen many zoo parks. But small kids enjoyed. "
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,angelmaria,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Vandalur Zoo,"Arignar Anna Zoological Park, also known as the Vandalur Zoo, Chennai.The wide range of wildlife seen here includes a variety of endangered species like the Asiatic lion, bison, white tiger, ostriches, Asiatic wolf and many more.A butterfly house along with an insect museum is another popular attraction of this park."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Thia M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Elephant on Chains,"I took my children there yesterday. We all very sad to see that an elephant chained to tree. It was all by itself and clearly under a lot of distress as it rocked back and forth and whipped the chain around. The area it is kept in is large but has no fence or moat to keep the elephant in. This needs to change. Elephants are extremely emotional, intelligent, social animals, and chaining them to tree alone is incompletely inhumane. I really hope they make changes to this. All of the other animals seemed to have free range of appropriate size enclosures."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Bhalaji N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Improved and nice to visit,"I had visited the place once in school time 90s. Felt very bad and complaining about its ways and have to walk a lot to see things.I had a different experience this time. Worth to say improved. Its now well organised. No outside food. No plastic containers. Looks like time needed to walk around will be less than 2-3 hrs for all. I felt the lake inside was filled with Algae - post monsoon effect. Extreme end zone containing fox was quite dry and needs cleaning. Rest is very nice. I can compare it with european experience of well laid path ways, clean directions. Bit stinking aquarium. Odd experience was the food shops i found in two places, looks like a loot with sub standard stuff."

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,BigWoo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo,Very wide range of animals ,"I called here whilst working in the area.  A huge site which can either be traversed by walking, by hiring a bicycle, by battery buggy, and by safari bus.  I chose to walk and experienced much, if not all, of the site.  A very wide range of animals, generally in large enclosures, although some are difficult to photograph.  There are many signs, not all of which were very clear, but it would have been useful to have had a paper map, the better to find way around."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,sathish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Arignar Anna Zoological Park - A must visit Zoo to enjoy,"Arignar anna zoological famously called as vandalur zoo. It is located next to tambaram. It was as opened to the public in 1985.

Visit of this zoo is useful for kids and adults for their educational and project purposes. Battery car is available inside the zoo to visit all the places for a normal fare. Visit of zoo during morning time is advisable. overall, a best place to visit for fun and entertainment. Happy journey."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,ashokd2007,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Great place to spend the day,"It is one of the best zoos that I have seen in the world. The animals are kept clean and healthy. There is a battery car ride. We can walk. We can ride a bicycle. There is also a lion and deer safari, where we can see the lions up close. There are a couple of things which can definitely be improved1. The tickets can be sold a little bit controlled way2. The food quality of the restraunt is very poor, being the fact that there is no outside food allowed in the park."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Karthika,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Food inside are low in quality,"Although zoo seems to be good gives us a trekking experience. Road maps listed there are not clear. Mainly food items part they are not clear. We were not allowed to take food and it a mentioned outside. But I came many took food in silver boxes. Polite advice is quality of food is poor in the stalls inside zoo. Even cooked bread toast ciz of onions and tomatos wic are uncooked one,created food poison for my child and myself. Other one was hotel Tamilnadu not sure of quality over there but there is only limited menu. If u r travelling with child please get out for nearby good restaurants. Very horrible experience with food"

Couldn't even see the lions as they were so far away, same situation with the elephants. Non indians had to pay more than 5 times the price of Indians and it just was not worth it at all. They only good thing about the place was the playground. We couldn't get away fast enough... Avoid at all costs!!"
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Deadman17,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,Nice zoo,the zoo is a good place to visit with your kids. Ofcourse the timings are such that going in summer is a bit difficult. This is because the zoo is open between 9 am to 5.30 pm when the sun is at its peak. During the summer the animals prefer to remain in shade just as us humans. Hence would suggest going in other months. There is entrance fees that is chargeable.
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Praveenop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018,A huge place and good for kids,"The Anna Zoological park is a huge place and has almost all the large animals of the world.

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,BhushanRangnekar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Huge Zoo with decent number of animals,The Chennai zoo is a huge area with all the usual animals and birds housed into it. Traversing by foot is a real pain given the heat in Chennai. Battery operated vehicles are available bu they dont give you enough time to spend at the animal enclosures. Be sure to carry lot of fluids and fruits. Plastics are banned inside the zoo.
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Karpagavalli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,Another picnic spot of the city,The place is so big and has an entrance fees.we are not allowed to take any snacks inside.the place is very famous among the children as park has all sorts of ani als and birds on display.but still the trees were not that maintained and has to be taken care of when compared with other zoological park of the country.
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,jaysheel_dani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,'Hidden Gem of Chennai',This is one of the best zoos in India especially considering it's in a Metro city of India. The enclosures are big that allows the animals to live and behave in 'closer-to-natural' atmosphere. The zoo is very big and it will take from 3-5 hours to explore it fully. Definitely worth a visit. Avoid holidays as the crowd can get quite large on those days.

Loved the deer & lion safari. Huge space for them to roam around The four Bengal tigers born in the zoo were a treat to watch.White tiger was awesome. It's a plastic free Zone. They can enhance drinking water availability as most of water tanks ran out of water.Its a huge space and lots of walking required. Great that they have bicycle and e-vehicle option to roam in the zoo. Wish I had more time to cover all of the zoo but still happy with whatever I cud watch.They have an adopt animal program so guys with serious interest in animal conservation can check their website and contribute.

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Dhasarathy S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Good Place For One Day Outing @ Chennai,"The Good:1. Versatile collection of animals - Lion, Tiger, Leopard, Giraffe, Zebra etc.2. Lion & Deer Safari a new experience for old timers; against the conventional ""meet the animal in cage""3. Option to pick cycles (manual, electric, kids) cycle on hourly basis to roam around the huge real estate4. Banned outside food to be carried in on disposable packages (allowed me to carry my lunch in metal lunch boxes)5. Availability of golf cart like vehicles for the benefit of less fit folks such as senior citizensThe Bad:1. Quality of food available inside the zoo is not great. This even applies to the Aavin shop inside.2. The vans doing the safaris are quiet dated and don't live up to the international standardsThe Ugly:1. The maintenance of the restrooms are pathetic. It hurts more when they collect money from us to go through the experience"
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Dhwanit S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Great place! Must visit,"It's a big nice zoo. Visit during cloudy day to enjoy the fullest.

Also, for elders or not willing to ride have option of battery operated car.You can spend 3-4 hours easily depending on your interest and activities.Food options are limited but ok.Cycle staff if rude, you'll have to fight for good cycles.

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Yogitha K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Tiring but worth it!,"First of all....NEVER go there on a public holiday...we went on Christmas and the crowd was too much... Because of this,all the battery cars and safari vehicles were already fully booked..And we had to walk throughout the park...We were a group of 6adults  and 6 small kids...we were told that we were not allowed to bring any snacks or food..so we went with only water...but after going inside,we saw that many of them had brought food and snacks...it's not a problem for adults,as there are snacks counters near butterfly park,tea,aavin ice-cream booth etc.,But if you are going with kids,make sure you have something for them  to eat.Because it took us Almost 5hrs for us to walk and cover the park,so we had to skip lunch...You can't cut short and go the exit halfway..But they do have almost all animals and colourful birds to excite the kids...We saw lions, tigers, white tigers, hippopotamus,otters, elephants,a giraffe,a zebras,snakes,,and lots of different kinds of monkeys and colourful birds..there is an aquarium too...but we were too tired to check it out..So if you want to show real animals to your kids,this is a great place...but remember not to go on a public holiday,..(I think it opens by 10am)and book a battery car and safari jeep...and take plenty of water with you..."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Mukta2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Nice Zoo,The Arinagar Anna Zoological park in Chennai is a fairly decent zoo to visit especially with kids. The zoo is spread over spacious grounds and there is an option of going around with  battery operated trolleys. The animal enclosures are quiet big and the short  lion safari inside the zoo is worth the extra money and drive. Overall a good experience with kids.
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Q01635,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,UK visitor - WORST ZOO - AVOID,"Where do I start, maybe with a positive, at 50 Rs each it's the cheapest Zoo I've been to. You need to pay for phones if you want to take pictures, there really isn't anything to take pictures of, so that's a moot point.Sad and pretty dilapidated in general, (animals have reasonable space, I'm not anti zoo). Went to aquarium first, about 20 small fish tanks with dirty glass/water, really the carp at an average UK garden centre is a better display than this.Things didn't get better when we used the toilets, we paid 10Rs each, I've no real problem with paying (although it's odd when you pay to come in already) but if you do pay, a nice experience is expected, nasty wet dirty toilets.Typically you would look at the zoo map to see where to go, indeed there is a map, on a nice big board, but unreadable due to sun damage. Lots of staff, about 4 or 5 organising lion safaris (needs 1 at most), 3 guys in nasty aquarium, so lack of staff is not an issue, it just seems that they do not understand how nice a zoo can be.If you really have nothing better to do and you do visit, pay the extra for the lion safari, it's a bit sad with a handful of lions but the best of a very very bad lot.If the proprietor reads this, I suggest you visit some foreign zoo (any country will do!) to see how zoos can be, yours is pretty sad attempt."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,TheHelpfulReviewer,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,"Just terrible, do not go","This is the worst zoo I have ever been to. First, the toilets are terrible and you need to pay, second, you need to pay to take photos on a phone and more for a DSLR camera, and third, there is just nothing there...if you want to waste your time then look no further and come to this poor attempt of a zoo."
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Krishnaveni S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Wonderful zoo,"Very huge zoo with lots of animals. The walk is tiring, but the animals make up for it. There is safari, battery operated vehicles and cycles to go if you cant walk. Come in november to january the winter of chennai. There is lion, tiger, leopard, hippo, deer, otter, giraffe, zebra, bear etc. The lion and tiger can be seen moving freely as well. The white tiger is another attraction. Also there are variety of birds including emu, ostrich, macau, peacock, phesant, etc. So colorful and chirpy. There is an aquarium section and butterfly section. 2 to 3 canteens are there, many drinking water taps were there without water. Carry water bottles. Outside food and plastic are not allowed. Visit once"
Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,ChicLifeByte,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,A massive zoo which is a must attend for kids as well as photography enthusiasts!,"With my key interest towards Wildlife and animals, a visit to the zoo is always on my agenda whichever city I visit. Spread across a huge area, the famous Chennai zoo houses 160 species of insects, birds and animals. One can spot crocodiles, blackbuck, lion-tailed macaque, panthers, peacocks, lions, hyenas, jaguars and much more. The place is huge, hence I recommend taking the safaris to save time and energy. There are different safaris available at this park including a lion safari and a deer safari, for which there are different costs based upon the age of a person. My recommendation is the Lion Safari in which they actually take you inside a restricted area where lions roam. If you would like to explore the zoo on your own, then you can rent a bicycle during the start of the tour so that you don’t exhaust yourself walking. Also at the zoo is a library, where one can know about the living environment and the habitat of these animals. Perfect for families who want to showcase different animals to their kids, the place is also a must visit for photography enthusiasts."

Its a vast expanse of dry decidous scrub forest.. Covering entire zoo requires walking of around 5-6 km, but thats the real fun of it.Either go by walk, or by bicycle and enjoy the zoo in your own pace.. Never do the mistake of hiring those battery vehicles , unless you cant walk or old aged.. Its a very good experience to walk around this scrub jungle, you will feel you are inside a forest literally... Very well maintained , most of the animals are not caged.. Very good place for birding as well.Never visit in summer months.. visiting during winters will be very soothing experience.."

That too if it is vast and an abode for innumerable species of animals and birds, it will be worth spending time during weekend or holiday. Suffice to say that Arignar Anna Zoological park, Vandalur, Chennai is one of the biggest. Animals we find in all zoos as well as rare species are there to make our trip memorable.  The zoo is situated about 40 kms from the Central railway station/Central Bus teminus.It can be reached by buses, electric trains, partially metro and  electric trains. Ample parking for private vehicles is available.  Since the zoo is vast battery operated cars are availabe for all. We should carry some snacks and water to last for a few hours of tour. Time spent here will be cherished."

Today somehow made up our mind and completed the entire zoo in 4 hours time. variety of snake species was good to see. Had opportunity to see most of the animals in the close view.Bird species that you see here are really awesome to watch.

First of all this zoo is not presented or maintained to western standards but we did not expect it to be. It is a vast site and i would recommend taking the buggy tour around the zoo as it is too far and likely to be too hot to walk around the site. There are some impressive animals there, there are also plenty of animals with very little space. The public areas are baron and unkempt which is not usual for India but the animals appear to be well cared for generally.There appeared to be plenty of refreshment stands around for visitors.If in Chennai this is worth a visit but it is not worth travelling that far for.Saltwater crocodiles the most impressive for me..."

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Bala,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,A very big zoo with a variety of animals ,"It is better to be here early , to avoid the mid day sun. And also the battery car, and cycles are easily available this time. But around 11 am , the place gets crowded and the wait could be long. The entry fee is 50 for adults and 20 for children. And battery car would cost 100 per person per hour. The place is really huge, and waking the entire distance could be very tiring , if not impossible . Cycles are also available for a cost of 15 per cycle per hour. The zoo has animals like elephant , lion, tiger , zebra , giraffe , leopard, bear, snake and crocodile park, and also many birds. There is also a butterfly park , which is not well maintained . There are few food stalls inside. And outside food is not allowed. There is a huge parking space, but again weekends could be crowded. On the other hand , during the weekdays , you may have to wait for the battery car and van ( safari) to get filled. "

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,rrumakanthan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,A Good Zoo,"-We visited (with a 2 year old kid) during the second week of March, and the Chennai summer heat is picking up and hence start early and finish before noon.-This park is very large and spread out and hence it is difficult to walk around and see all the animals. Bicycles are available on rent (very reasonable cost) and even with bicycles it could be difficult to see a large area in Chennai heat.( may be November to  February will be a comfortable weather to walk around) - The best I will say is Tigers (about 7 ) and one White Tiger .This is better than Singapore and London Zoo . Lions are also good ( three, one Lion and two Lioness) when we went. These are housed in a large open enclosure.-There are Cheetas,    Hippos, Giraffes, Orangutans, Otters, A small and nice aquarium with small fish , well kept are housed in the zoo .  A large water birds enclosure with plenty of water fowls, Peacocks, Monkeys Crocodile, Bison, Deers, Snakes (a large number of Pythons are kept here) are also housed here. Many are housed in open enclosures-.The best way to see the zoo comfortably is to take the buggy (Rs 100 per person ) and takes about an hour . The driver will stop in important spots ( Tigers, Lions, Hippos, Aquarium, Snake House etc) to see the animals without having to walk a long distance between each other. If possible start the visit by first taking the Buggy trip. The Zoo opens at 9 am and the first buggy trip starts at 930 am. Each Buggy takes about 12 persons or so. There is a comfortable seating place to wait to take the Buggy trip..  - The Zoo is reasonably clean, though the car parking and surrounding areas are not kept clean and should be improved. Continuous manual sweeping is being carried out inside the zoo area to keep it reasonably clean.- Covered seating areas are available inside the Zoo to relax in between.  -  As informed everywhere, plastic packaging is not allowed inside the zoo and bags are checked at the entrance. You can take eatables in metal and other non disposable containers and water in non plastic containers. Children food is allowed to be taken.Week ends have many visitors and week days are not crowded as per the information. (number of visitors increase after 11 am ) .-It could take about an hour  to drive down to the zoo from the Chennai city when you start at about 730 am or so.  ."

Arignar_Anna_Zoological_Park,Sram81,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Great place to take your kid!,"Situated a bit outside the city limit, drive till here would easily take a hour or so. Parking is adequate though if you are late you have to park at least 1 km away. Worst part is there is no pick up and drop service and you are left at the mercy of local Auto rickshaws.There are 2 ways to explore the park, we can either hire a buggy or we can walk down. Thanks to heavy tree cover we decided to walk down and did not regret it a bit. This gives you freedom to spend as much time as want inside the Zoo. We did take good breaks and were adequately hydrated. Animals were ok, most of them were well maintained and compared to other Zoo's in India abundant space was available for the animals. Majority of the enclosures were not cramped. All in all my kid enjoyed the day out and so did we. Not sure how our experience would have been if the day had been hotter!"

Lots of animal to witness and good things end here.Plan properly, never visit on weekends. It's 5km walk around zoo and with Chennai weather ,you will be drained out and with elders or children it's going to be big issue.so next option is battery car or some safari,wait you will not be assured and its not available all the time. they stop if they want. In counter if you ask any clarification or suggestions,you will be met with not so friendly staff.I went inside the zoo and then I was told safari was available and was asked to go outside to counter to buy tickets, which I did.But why on Earth I should walk again to counter, can't they provide inside or can't  they give it in counter itself in first place.So it's pure luck if you get any vehicle. One suggestion plan it in morning when zoo opens, my friends told me after my disappointed trip."
