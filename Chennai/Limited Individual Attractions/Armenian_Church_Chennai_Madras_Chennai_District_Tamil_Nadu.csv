Its members, as they did all over Asia, built a church, dedicated to St Mary, early in the 18th century. Today the Armenian community is no more - its members have migrated elsewhere. But the church remains, looked after by  Mr Jude Johnston, who keeps it looking as if it is expecting them to return tomorrow. The church is located through a gate in the middle of Armenian Street and is a quiet haven away from the bustle outside. Mr Johnson shows you around. It's a moving reminder of the faith that sustained the Armenians through good times and bad over the three hundred years they lived in Madras. Highly recommended."

This now deserted church with a watchman and a family of caretakers was built by the thriving Armenian trading community so many years ago. It still stands tall in the silence. The watchman strictly prohibits photography  and so there are no photos from my visit. The small church has a closed sanctum, shielded by a curtain, I think that only the priests are allowed in. There is not much to see in the church but the premises offers a peaceful rest for a weary person.There are some photographs in the entrance that throws some light on the place but I wish there were more."

Armenian_Church,Ram K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Historic Place in a Crowded City,"Having lived the first 20 years of my life in Madras (now Chennai), imagine my surprise when I found out that the city was host to a thriving Armenian population in the 1700s. Several Armenians migrated from current-day Iran to Madras in the 17th century and became thriving merchants. Naturally they built a church in 1712 (which was destroyed) and a new church was built again in 1772 which stands to this day. The city has evolved to a noisy and bustling environment outside the church - the traffic is almost unbearable. The church is a very welcoming place with a nice garden and several historic markers inside. It was a cemetery before it was a church and you can see the tombstones of the early Armenians who were born in Iran and died in Madras. The caretaker is a very friendly Anglo-Indian who fills you in with the history of the church and the Armenians. The place is also a testament to the religious diversity and tolerance of the Chennai people. Definitely a visit worth making when one is in Chennai."

Armenian_Church,Sriganesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,Peace in the midst of noise,"As you enter the Armenian Church from the noisy Armenian Street in Parry's, you will be shocked. Of course, very positively. Enter the door and you forget the rush and noise outside. Built by Armenian traders in 18th century, the church is currently only a heritage site and there is no service. Highly recommend it. "

I find the Church fascinating, and if you can get to speak to the caretaker, he will be happy to discuss the lives of Armenians in Chennai in the bygone era. Today there are only 2 known Armenians practicing their religion in the Church. "
Armenian_Church,Shiva S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Solo,Nice church in Parrys,"Armenian Church is one of the oldest church in India and is located in Armenian Street, Parrys. It is near the St.Marys Catherdral in Parrys. All over the garden and in the church corridor are tombstones laid out flat, some replacing the large tile slabs in the corridor. The monument is well preserved, especially the Bell Tower and the ancient bells at the top. There are a number of old paintings by old Chennai Armenians in the passage."
