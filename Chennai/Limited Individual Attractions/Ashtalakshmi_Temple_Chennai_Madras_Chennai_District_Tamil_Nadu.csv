Ashtalakshmi_Temple,Narendran J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Lovely place with beautiful deities,"We went to this temple to celebrate my in-laws 40th wedding anniversary. Before you enter, you need to decide if you are going to offer any darshan or you are only going to pray and move on. This is because there are 2 separate queues and they are separated by metal bars to ensure no one crosses over and I guess also to ensure those who pay more gets ahead of the queue. The guy who was responsible for issuing receipts for the darshan helped us at the very first goddess, there are 8 goddesses in total and you would need to navigate them through narrow steps, but the view from each level is breathtaking. Definitely worth a visit but be informed that the priests will ask/cajole you to buy gold-plated coins or request you to place a rupee note at the foot of the deity and another rupee note for him to pack the bindi for you to bring it back home.

Ashtalakshmi_Temple,13arvinds,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Lakshmi temple next to Besantnagar beach,"Relatively new temple, just off the southern end of the Besantnagar beach with a number of shrines devoted to Lakshmi along with a few other shrines to other deities (one of Lakshmi along with Vishnu, one for Ganapati, one for Hanuman ...).The design of the temple is rather different with several of the Lakshmi shrines arranged in a spiral fashion. The approach is for most part via a narrow staircase with sharp (right) angles more or less along the sides (internal and external!), and it is so narrow that only one reasonably well-built person can fit between the walls in many places; so, there was a long line in (mostly) single file slowly proceeding through. (For some reason, there was a huge crowd on the day we visited; several busloads of pilgrims were also there at the same time.)Anyway, the design of the structure reminded us of a small fort!The location on the sea shore doubtless also contributes to the degradation of the structure. (I assume that the sea breeze is a significant factor to the paint wearing off and other minor damage to the carvings on the temple.)  But I wish it was maintained in better condition. Also, some of the shrines were not opened at the time we visited (don't know why)."

Ashtalakshmi_Temple,AKTHAKUR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017,Excellent temple by the sea to enjoy the architecture,This temple has eight forms of Goddess Lakshmi consort of Lord Vishnu as wella s Goddess of Wealth.It is a must visit if you go to Chennai.There are shops around the temple to buy offerings.Avoid holidays sundays as it can be extremely crowded.It is better to take a auto rickshaw or car.You can donate in the hundi as per your capacity.you can take a guide from the shop if you wish so that you can see the whole temple easily and understand the religious significance of the temple.
Ashtalakshmi_Temple,WayfarerIndia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,Unique temple in a unique location,"Though she is the goddess of wealth, Laxmi doesn't have too many temples devoted to her. Here is one in which she is depicted in 8 forms, hence the name.Situated bang on the beach adds even more to its uniqueness"
Ashtalakshmi_Temple,Iratdog,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Beauty by the sea,"I was here just recently. It's quite a sight. Right on the beach. As is the case with most Hindu shrines it's hard to get a good picture. Absolutely impressive. One detail I don't like is the constant pestering for money. This was the most bothersome to date. Even the shoe keeper was pushy. As soon as I entered the site a ""guide"" attached himself to me. He wasn't particularly helpful, but he was nice enough. I learned more about the eight forms of the goddess from reading than this guy could give me. Usually it's the other way around. The downside of this experience is that they planked the whole place over, so the lines of sight are basically obliterated. You get the added value of walking next to everything. You lose any hope of appreciating the actual as built conditions. Here's a tip, go in with 5 rupee coins. Lots of them...Hope you enjoy it. It's not to be missed."

Ashtalakshmi_Temple,Shankar1206,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Ashtalakshmi Temple,"One of the rare temple, where all the eight forms of Goddess Lakshmi has temple built. The temple is located near the sea shore at Besant Nagar. A must visit for those spiritullay inclined."
Ashtalakshmi_Temple,Bhuvana S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,Temple by the sea,"Ashtalkashmi temple being one of the popular spots in Chennai has been on my bucket list, so visited this temple recently to clear my bucket list and also to get the blessings of the 8 Lakshmi's  (ashta means 8 and Lakshmi is the Goddess of wealth in the Hindu religion) .We went around 530 in the evening and the sea breeze really made it a wonderful experience. Walking around the ground floor, we started with the Lakshmi Narayana ( goddess lakshmi and her husband Narayana) and then we climbed up the stairs to see Gajalakshmi, Santhana Lakshmi,Vijayalakashmi, vidyalakshmi, and climbed up one more floor to see Dhanlakshmi, and came down to see the remaining 3 lakshmi's who are on the ground floor - Adi lakshmi, dhanya lakshmi and veeralakshmi. They also have separate small temples for Ganesha, Guruvayurappan, hanuman and chakrathazhvar. This temple is not accessible friendly at all and anybody who has a Knee issue will definitely have trouble climbing the stairs up and down as the stairs were small and narrow as well. Definitely not suitable for old people at all."
Ashtalakshmi_Temple,Anand G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Unique and interesting,"It is not every place you find a temple dedicated Goddess Lakshmi. This is still more interesting that it has the eight forms of the Goddess. Although located in a questionable area, the inside is as clean and neat as any temple can be. A must visit if you are a temple fancier. The sculpture on the tower (Gopuram) is typical Tamil style and quite ornate."
Ashtalakshmi_Temple,pacchhu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,"If you are fond of gods, only then","This is certainly one of the locations, that specifically devotes the temple to goddess Lakshmi ( and all avatar's associated ).I have been to this temple multiple times, but during this visit in Dec, 2016, the major portion of the temple was closed for renovation ( Dhanurmasa ) and hence, was bit of a lop sided visit with my wife."
Ashtalakshmi_Temple,iSkylark,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Temple by the sea,"It wasn't until I reached the top of the temple that I realized its proximity to the ocean and was taken by the breeze. This was my first visit to a temple in this area of the country and served as my introduction to this type of architecture. If you are a Westerner not accustomed to the rituals or customs involved in visiting temples, please note you will have to leave your shoes outside and should dress modestly. If it is a hot day, it will be hard on your feet so try to go early in the morning, if possible."

Ashtalakshmi_Temple,jiyer2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,Revival of childhood,"Each time I visit India, particularly Chennai - I make it a point to visit to visit this utterly charming, breathtaking temple nestled along the shores of Besant Nagar beach. I try to remember the eight beautifully adorned Lakshmi's and enjoy the beach breeze that sweeps through the open terraces near the sannadi of Dhana Lakshmi. This temple is a must see for its beautiful architecture coupled with its beautiful location."
Ashtalakshmi_Temple,KrishnaBalaram,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Taking darshan of mahalakshmi,"My evaluation of 4 out of 5 for this site mostly has to do with my poor planning and less to do with the temple itself. As with many mandirs in South India, darshan is closed during afternoon hours. I discovered it's closure only after buying pushpam offerings so was walking around a bunch of closed altar spaces with a box of flowers. Sensing my frustration with not being able to make my offerings, a prabhu compassionately took me around to all but the main Lakshmi-Narayan installation so I could make my offerings. With that being said...It is a beautiful temple, the people are very, very friendly.  So many beautiful manifestations of mahalakshmi! And on the roof level there is a nice Ocean view above Elliot's beach. We also took Prasadam with the locals and had an otherwise lovely time. Would love to revisit during darshan hours. "

Ashtalakshmi_Temple,Bharani K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,great temple to visit,"Very impressed on the temple,  people had to visit and know the history.  It would be advisable to have more history of the temple in either writings or video for people to learn.  Priest were very friendly.   Tamil Nadu government need to spend time/effort to clean the nearby area to preserve the history."

Ashtalakshmi_Temple,Ra_Radha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Combo of Temple + Beach,"Located in Besant Nagar, this temple of Goddess Lakshmi is very famous and attracts lot of tourists. Beware of priests, they insist on offering money everywhere. Better offer your offerings in Hundi and not in Arti thali, as that money goes in pockets of priests directly. 8 avtars of goddess Lakshmi is here and after you done with temple, you can visit the beach adjoining the temple. beach is not clean and full of dead fish and thorns, walk carefully in dark."
