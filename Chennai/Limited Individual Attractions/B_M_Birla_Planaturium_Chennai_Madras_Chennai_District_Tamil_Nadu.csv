B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Amitrpatil,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Just normal nothing extraordinary,The planetarium is pretty normal but the onboarding could be better. Unlike nehru planetarium mumbai there is no expert to onboard you to the content. Its more like a theatre with fancy projector. We need to transform our science experiences beyond just ticking the box. Helping common man get excited about science rather than just being low grade entertainment.
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Krishnaveni S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Pretty good but can be improved,"The planetorium has many other things luke a science park in open with many things based on science principle. Science nuseum inside with many interactive exhibits, nuclear gallery, fun with mirrors and 3D show. So plan your time keeping all this in mind. The whole package costed 60 for adult so definitely not high priced. They beed to maintain many exhibots which are nor working. The planetorium show was really good"
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Wil Chung,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Very old exhibits - desperate need of a renovation,Unfortunately the main planetarium was full up so unable to actually review that part .I visited the rest of the science centre and honestly though I could have spent my time doing better things.I would say that all of the exhibits were made in the 1950s and just not been updated or even looked after since then. Exhibits were either pictures/posters and a lot of writing or things to do which were mostly broken...
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Bhalaji N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Best in class sky theater experience,"Not sure how many of them will agree with me. But the sky theater is the best you can get of the trip. the organiser will say any seat is good. Dont buy it if you want a good experience. Take a middle row and not in the path from entrance. You have high chances of missing the full view. ISRO wing is good and motivational for the kids. Zoology section was bad with formaldehyde smell - During our visit, some one pushed a jar down and the fumes were all over. Science wing is good but let not your kids touch any of the exhibits. WE felt a lot of dust. Outside park\play area is good and as usual maintenance is bit poor.Must see is the steamer engine out there. You will get a good feel of how it works. Climb carefully."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,DrMC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Business,Planetarium under Renovation,"Recently visited this place. All the galleries are really good. Children will definitely enjoy all the interactive displays. A 3D show is also there. Though the display clarity is not there, it is also enjoyable. The sky theatre is recently renovated. All is set for opening. It has a high resolution digital projector. Once it's open, every one will definitely enjoy the hd projections. The old style of circular seating is gone   Now it's only a unidirectional viewing. Projection on the dome and side walls on 360 degrees will make a virtual reality effect. Like to go once it is opened for public. "
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,SMLikestoTravel,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Horrible! Don't ever come here!,"So, I took my 9 year old daughter here with great expectations. What a horrible waste of tax-payers money. I would give 0 rating if possible. The planetarium was actually closed for renovation though this was nowhere mentioned on the website. Instead of that, there was a horrible, tacky video with jarring visuals and unclear audio which was shown in a temporary setup. That video and audio quality was so horrible that we did not gain anything from the experience except for a bad headache. We moved onto the Science museum with some hope to salvage the remainder of our trip. But that was not to be. 90 % of the exhibits were not in working condition. For the remaining 10%, there was hardly any information provided on what that exhibit is about . My daughter was totally disillusioned.Don't waste your time coming here. You would be better off showing some natgeokids or discoverykids videos to your children instead."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Semmalar Prem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Fun filled place for science education,"The planetarium and 3d show are worth watching. There are 8 - 9 shows per day on various space related topics, in both Tamil and English.Science Park has play things based on physics. My daughter loves it. There are many play activities for children based on pulleys, gears, sound waves, etc.The evolution park has life sized dinosaur models.There is also a play park with swings and slides.The are exhibition gallerys showcasing nuclear power, defense equipment, space etc.The toy shop has interesting models and simple science based toys. There is also a small snacks shop.Children interested in science can easily spend half a day here having fun and learning at the same time!"
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,whirlwindexplorer,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,PATHETIC CONDITION : HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Visited Birla Plentarium after many years and was shocked to see the utter neglect and disrepair this once attractive place has degenerated to. The Planetarium hall was under renovation and we saw a 20 minute show in a make-shift igloo with broken chairs, unclear sound-track and babies screaming in the hall. In most of the galleries - specially on the first floor, almost all the exhibits are non-functional and broken. Disgusting maintenance. If the authorities cannot maintain the Science gallery, they should shut it down. Utterly shameful with so many foreign vistors come in and we make a laughing stock of ourselves."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Ahamed,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,3D show,Was worth the visit. Paid just 60 and came out fully satisfied. You can choose between English and Tamil.
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Chintan m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Be on moon and stars...,"B M Birla planaturium is an excellent place specially for young minds for knowing some astronomy facts. It runs audio visual programs which amazes the visitors. Solar systems, cycle of starts, seasons etc are worth enjoyable for sure"
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Ramya S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good place ,Birla planetorium is set in Kotturpuram near the Rajaji and Gandhi memorials. We should visit place for kids to learn science. 3D show is there to teach science for kids.
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Venkataraman R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Very good planetorium. But, science park needs renovation","As renovation is currently going on in the Birla planetorium, we saw the planetorium show in the mini planetorium (contingency plan) which can house 85 seats. The show was very good about universe and my son enjoyed it. The exhibits near the planetorium were good. The nuclear reactor section which was opened in 2016 is in very good condition. This section was on par with any international science centers. But, this section condition has to be carried forward to other sections as well. The science park which was opened in 1988, needs renovation. Most of the play area items dont have placards to display about the play area item and significance of this. Overall, very good place to spend a day for children to learn something new. Parking is ample and charges are very reasonable for both parking and also entrance ticket. The package ticket is a good concept and covers everything for Rs. 60/- for adults and Rs. 30/- for kids. Government is doing good job to set up this science center. but, needs to maintain it. Staff are very friendly and courteous."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Minecrafter2014,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Can‚Äôt tolerate phenoyl smell,I recently visited here with kids. Starts by 10am. Need to buy tickets to watch cosmic and 3D shows. It‚Äôs just 10-15min shows.There‚Äôs exhibit on Indian military and physics related science.They can provide new things. Since this place is frequently visited by school children from all over south India.Big issue I would like to highlight is the strong smell of phenoyl. Really making drowsy and vomiting üëéüèº
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Maruthu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Good learning experience for kids, but poorly maintained","This place has got really useful things for the kids to learn, in particular kids will enjoy the 3D show here. Evolution park which showcases different types of dinosaurs was also good, but maintenance was very poor. They have two children parks also inside, but they are also poorly maintained and most of the play items are broken. They have Defence and Mathematics museums also in-house, which would a really good learning experience for kids and even adults too!"
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,DayaMass,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"""Space Spectacular""","I visited this on my summer holidays.This planetorium is situated in kotturpuram.This is a must visit place in chennai.The main attractions here are science park,evolution park,science gallery(defence and other galleries),3D show,space show.U can enjoy a lot here!!!üòéüòéüòé"
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Victor21101985,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Could be maintained better,"Place is huge and lots of things to look and learn. Most of them are not working or under maintenance. If they are maintained better, this would be an ideal place to visit for family."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,drvalan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,Good place to take Children,Visited Birla planetarium last month. The entry fee is the cheapest of all the planetariums i have visited in our country and abroad. Kids enjoyed the place. However Government should take measures to maintain the natural history park and may allocate more staffs to explain the scientific exhibits.
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,diva k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Informative for kids,The shows are on both english and tamil.The huge dome shaped screen is awesome. Kids will definitely enjoy the show. There is a big park as well
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Sudharson S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great place but not well maintained,It‚Äôs sad to see such a place not well maintained...many items of educational importance and explanations were found missing or under repair..
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Prabin Y,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018,Good place for students ,Visited this place with family. Kids enjoyed a lot. Must visit place for school students. Science play park should be maintained well. 
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Traveleasy15,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Must for science loving people, spare half to full day for viewing in total.","Good place to learn and see development and advancement in science and technology in our country, Need time at least half day or full day if you want to see and learn. Must visit for science loving anthusiast."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,HappyTraveller,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Has potential, but zero maintenance","The planetarium was opened in 1988, and I think after that it has never seen any maintenance. At first glance, looks interesting. But when you get closer, nothing works. My 5 year old was highly diappointed. The show was a huge let down. I've visited this place a couple of years before. The show was decent then, telling about astronomy. Though the movie was old, we got something out of it. This time it's 3 D show with hardly anything about Space. Go there only for the playground, there is nothing else interesting."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Janani P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Birla planetarium,This place is must visit for students and kids.weekend educational spot for family.it has so much on educational content. Space and 3D show is best.
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,anandabose02,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,Sheer waste of so much talent. DISSAPPOINTMENT......,"1. I will summarise by saying that though it must have been one of a kind planetarium once upon a time, today it is a sad reflection of its glorious past.2. Chennai is a hot and a humid place. However it is alarming to see that not 01AC or cooling system works, thereby making it an oven for anyone visiting, especially people from outside Chennai.3. There are actually a lot of things to learn no doubts. However due to pathetic equipment maintenance and lackadaisical staff, 95% equipments are simply non functional. ITS A PITY !!!!!! However Kapil Sibal,s inaugural plaque stone is in all its shinning glory. It is a shame how our politicians and bureaucrats just use the tax payers money for their personal career progression and let the common man and resources rot to hell.4. Cooling system at all places non functional. Please go at your own risk in Chennai heat.5. Knowledge wise this place is amazing. One can easily spend 5-6 hours here all alone. But.......6. Space movie and the 3D are such a huge waste of time and money. No educational value. 7. Tickets cost Rs 60 for the all inclusive shows and Rs 30 for a child.8. Honestly as this was my 1st visit here, I was extremely excited. However it was a DISSAPOINTMENT at best to sum it all up."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,ramanathanv67,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Dont waste your time ! It is a pity on maintenance,"A visit to a science center and planetarium should excite a child and a child in us. Unfortunately that isn't true at this Tamil Nadu Govt maintained facility. First on the science center there are many theme's - automobile, ocean life, anatomy, math lab, Space research, nuclear power etc..... 95% of the interactive panels / counters don't work ! Huge disappointment for the children and old alike. Wish the Govt gives the responsibility of managing this facility to some private companies at least the maintenance would be good. Secondly on the planetarium, with the school vacations approaching it is difficult to understand why the authorities have started a maintenance now. Instead of the regular planetarium dome they have made a tent - yes tent which can seat about 25/30 people. The audio and video quality is bad to say the least Dont waste your team for visiting this place. With so many good schools and emphasis on education in Chennai we wish that this facility is maintained to enliven the scientific temper in the local kids"
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Indrajit B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Poor Maintained Facilities,"Went with great expectation, but in vein. Most of the outside and inside equipments are non functional due to non maintenance. As a result, kid will not learn much. 3D theatre is good for those who are watching 3D first time. Else average. Planetarium amphitheatre is causing neck pain as they project the picture on 2 sides instead projecting at middle. As a result no one can view it properly. Could not understand the logic. 4 wheeler parking is available with nominal fees."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Bala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,A good place . But could be maintained better.,"They have a show about space and mars and life on mars for about half an hour. It was very good . The show is available in both Tamil and English . Check the show timing and plan accordingly. They also have a 3D show which was ok. It was for 10 mins and it had a roller coaster ride and dinosaur show.They also have several halls , some of them are mathematics, science , space , mirrors . Each room has several experiments with explanations written below. Some have facts and exhibits . Most rooms also have a quiz . Children 10 and above would benefit the most. Some of the experiments don‚Äôt work. But overall it was a good experience and one can easily spend 2 hours here . They also have a store which sells diy and experiments. "
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Prasad B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,A collective science monument !!!,"Albeit of all the Birla museums located at Hyderabad, Trichy, Kolkata, and Chennai, the Chennai one has been found the best amongst all in terms of infrastructure~presentation~details."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Mahesh A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,"A nice, informative visit","We went as a group with many kids.It has many interesting sections. The first park has interesting scientific concepts explained in easy language for the children. The sound reflector example was simply awesome. A couple of machines were not working when we went.This also has additional interests like a plane, rocket etc.,The main attractions are the sky theater and the 3D show. Both were awesome and exceeded our expectations. For the sky theater show, they have different timings for English and Tamil versions. You need to choose one based on your interest.The car parking space was adequate.An interesting visit overall."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Deepakrao1080,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,A Big Disappointment,"Located in the heart of the city of Chennai, next to premium technical institutes, this would have been apt to be called the Science Learning center of Chennai. However, this place is far from it.I visited the premises about 2 weeks ago with my nephews, mainly with the intention of interesting them with the ""science experiment"" exhibits that I saw when I visited the place almost 1.5 decades ago ( I was on a school excursion). The only thing they learnt was about optical illusion as it was a painting on the wall and was the only thing that was not yet damaged. They should sell tickets according to the seating capacity of the Planetarium!The planetarium:The Plantarium is one of the biggest attraction in this premise. It is neatly maintained and works flawlessly. However, be prepared to ""run"" and occupy the seats early as the ""late-comers"" get plastic chairs to sit. The organisers shamelessly let in people even after the show has started and is a big disturbance to the show. They make a big fuss if some tourist kid playfully points lasers after the show has started, but they keep flashing lights and letting people inside even after the show has started. They arrange the plastic chairs very close to the main projector. The program is a big let down, as it has not been designed for a young audience. It talks about whether Mars has life or not and concludes saying that future mankind will live in mars! They could have made a program about the solar system or moon or common constellations. Instead they choose Mars and 2-3 constellations that is difficult to identify when you look at the night sky.3D Theater:I suppose this is one of the latest additions to this premise and I should say that it was not necessary here. The 3d movie telecast here is the same ones they telecast in ""trade fairs"" and amusement Parks.. in fact, they make it better by making it a 4D or 5D show! And the program content is again to be reviewed here. 2 movies are screened - one is a roller coaster ride (common in all amusement parks) and the second is a ""horror"" show that had toddlers crying because it was 3d and demons were flying towards you!!Exhibits - ""the science center""This was a big big disappointment, because none of the experimental exhibits were working! Pendulums were missing the balls.. you press buttons and nothing happens, kinetic & potential energy exhibits didnt work, the ball that was supposed to travel and make you understand potential to kinetic energy conversion was missing from all exhibits. There is a section that has dolls from around the world (I dont understand its relevance to science though) and it looks just like the doll cabinet store that features in Conjuring Movie.To make matters worse, they were welding some huge structure inside.Outdoor Parks:The swings , slides etc seem to work well, but we could not use it as the security were sending people out of the premises the moment the clock struck 5:30 pm! So I really cannot comment about it.Overall, I regret having gone half a day earlier, buying tickets in advance and taking my nephews there. Instead, a visit to the beach would have interested all of us better. This campus is a classic example of how the Government agency is wasting its resources. The content could be better designed."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,janani s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016,Childhood adventure,"A very good place for school children to learn especially if they are interested in Science. As a child, this was one of my favorite places to visit during the weekends. The doom show inside the theatre is an absolute delight. There are a number of small experiments to make children understand science related concepts. There is also a play area. It has a fighter plane placed in the middle of the ground which is a curious thing to watch for kids."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Karthik R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Educative shows,"Birla Planetarium is located very much in the heart of the city. It is opposite to the Anna university second gate. They screen Educative shows about the Universe - planets, stars, climatic conditions on the dome screen. The shows are once to see. The shows are still the same which is quite boring. The museum inside is very poorly maintained."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Ghiri T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A Largest Planetarium In Chennai.,Birla Planetarium is the largest planetarium in Chennai.

The DRDO is setting up a pavillion in the campus to monitor their defence related work. Additionally a space gallery is also being set up to showing the development of space technology in India. The Planaturium will be of interest to students and teachers though tourists and people coming for sightseeing may not show much interest. But during our visit my son was very interested in studying the various aspects and developments regarding astronomy."

B_M_Birla_Planaturium,VandPan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Only because this is one of the very few places you can go to,"The ticket price is nominal. We paid 60 RS per adult for entry, science museum, 3d show, planetarium. The show is outdated. there are still 9 planets in the solar system.

B_M_Birla_Planaturium,SyedIqbal123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Best place in Chennai for School Excursion,"This place offers good scientific treat about planets and space.  It has ground educational kits like solar clock.We should visit in low sunny days of year and not in Summer, to enjoy the outdoor exhibits.Better to go in vehicle, as needed to walk a long distance from the gate.Similar to Jantar Mantar in Delhi and JaipurThey will also arrange for telescope to view other planets coming near earth.  Best educational activity can visit at-least once."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Sridhar1962,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,The Reality ,"I visited the planatariumwith my friend  on a Sunday for the show in English  (Rs45/)which started by 11 A.M. Though they covered the solar system, that days show was on planet MARS .To our surprise much of the latest informations like NASA'S curiosity mission and other explorations were lacking and needs to be updated a lot.Next the ticket allows us to a 3D animation show which is really a horrifying experience since the there was no coordination beween the loud sound and the 3D visual effects.Most of the Adults including parents were mute spectators of the so called 3D show needless to say the children seem to enjoy the fun of animals coming too close to them at times.Then There is a museum section which is good and informative.New addition is a separate section dealing with the Nuclear Engergy including the pioneers of nuclear power plants  and various models illustrated nicely.It would have been more useful to include a pre recorded information about each display so that even non scientific common people can easily comprehend.As a whole at the end as you leave the planatarium you are left with a thought that I should  have read some of the reviews from TripAdvisor before venturing such trips."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,keerthy14in,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Chennai's Only Planetarium,"Went on a good Sunday morning.The park outside is good for some photos, reminding You of your childhood memories.It is really good if U take children below 10yrs along.The planetarium showed Marvels of Mars. Again it will b amazing if You are below 10yrs, but occasionally I learnt a point or two. A couple a seat beside, couldn't help himself getting a small nap. They need to b updated with knowledge, rather than giving what's given in our 10th std textbooks, years ago.The science museum was poorly maintained, but the atomic museum, which is newly built.The 3D theatre is strictly meant for kindergarten students, even though all adults are officially allowed..Worth for what they offer at 45rupees. Needs better maintainence and renewing facts accordingly to time. Had a good time taking Pix and fun with a friend."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Krishnaraj88,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Nice Planetarium, Lacks Maintenance","The planetarium is nice experience, even though I was not visiting the planetarium for the first time. You can choose between Tamil or English shows. The show is informative and worth a visit for children with science enthusiasm. There is a 3D show near to it, there you‚Äôll get the real 3D effects. Science center has many specimens to explain vrious theories in scence. But, most of them are out of order due to lack of maintenance.Overall, its worth a visit once."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Sujatha P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Has India really launched a Mars Mission?,"My discontentment has taken a few months to pen down.I kept mulling over things like, do my views matter? Will anything change? But then I thought, isn't it important to bring to attention, the sorry state of affairs, if I really cared about bringing the change?Reading a few isolated posts in Trip Advisor did not really prepare me or my family to expect what we saw at the Chennai Birla Planetarium, I visited, with my kids, in June 2016.It was in 1988-89, when I went there first, as a young boy, on my school educational trip. Oh what an amazing place it was then!Buzzing with activity, working science models, fresh and bright paint and more importantly, a planetarium which gave me a glimpse of the wonders of our solar system, at a time when internet was in its infancy; an interest which has stayed with me all these years and helped me pass the same feeling of wonder and amazement, to my children.Almost 30 years down the lane, what a difference; one of utter disappointment! Not just for my kids and me, but also to the many young children; some accompanied by their parents, some with their grandparents, some IT employees (who wished to spend their day off), some maybe from Chennai, others from towns, villages across TamilNadu. How would the children/visitors have felt? Did they know any better?The visitors made most of what the place had to offer; patiently visiting all the dilapidated rooms, sitting through outdated sci-fi programs and planetarium shows. Stray dogs roamed freely in the poorly maintained parks outside. The staff however, were very patient, respectful; few of them recalling, how things have gone bad over the years.Going from one room to the other, my 11yr old commented ""If only these models were working, this planetarium would be on par with the best I have ever seen""; and he has been to a few and was actually comparing this planetarium with those in the UK and USA.At the end of it, I became slightly emotional and wondered when would this callous attitude change!Suddenly, two things struck me.One, if India is able to launch a successful Mars mission, why then, has these advances not reached the main metropolitan city only a few hundred kilometres away?And two, With IIT Chennai just down the road, why has a joint effort to showcase science in a better way not been considered/possible?With the current government's focus on 'Make in India', why then doesn‚Äôt our biggest make, be showcased with pride in our planetarium programs? Why cant the state and/or the Central governments make this a priority? How many countries around the world can boast of a space program like ours?As we were leaving with disappointment etched on our faces, ""Next time when you come here sir, I promise it will be much better"" the guard at the entrance told us, in an exuberant tone. Can our government too, give us similar hope?"

It was the one impressed lot earlier days. Now I took my kids to show the science museum expecting to revert the same experience to my children. But the reality would be the average one. My children enjoyed the Mars planetarium show, 3D show and science centre. Some of them organized conceptually well like Ramanujar in Maths centre, ISRO space foundation, mirror house etc.This science museum easily accessible from kotturpuram road. Reasonable price - Rs 45 for package ticket. Lots of improvements can be done to make over this planetarium to higher standard. Many models are not functioning and no proper care & maintenance."

The unexpected bonanza was the outdoor exhibits. Even for adults, whether highly literate or the rustic artisan from the rural depths with a thirst for knowledge, this is a once in a life time visit you ought to make. Chennai is fortunate in having a planetarium; the credit goes to Sri R Venkataraman, former Minister, TN, who went on to become Union Finance Minister, and finally ascended to the highest office of President of India. It was he who persuaded Mr Birla to set up this unit in Chennai, after the ones in New Delhi and Kolkotta."

The science museum is very ill maintained. Almost nothing works. Every items are in dilapidated state. The entire museum looks like a junk yard. The dingy 3D theater shows couple of cheap films. The Planetarium, though a face saver, is also not maintained well. Very stuffy and suffocating inside, broken chairs and noisy fans. Most of the items in the garden are also broken. My request to the authorities to close it down and revamp it with latest scientific items with the help of IITs and other universities. Otherwise it paints a very bad picture about our advancement in the field of science and technology.Till then better avoid."
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Nearaja V,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Highly disappointing and poor execution,I was nostalgic when i planned a trip to this planetarium with my son.. Little did i know that he was about to have the worst version of it...this place is in such disuse and is more of a picnic spot than a centre for learning...I had taken my son to show him the wonders of science and the concepts explained through working exhibits..even the age predictor was not working..and no one was around to make the kids take some interest in the subject and enjoy the wonders...Not all parents have a scientific background and it would have been great if a teacher had been there to explain the concepts in a fun way to the kids...But the worst was yet to come..the 3D show was a joke and the icing was when at the end of it a gentleman walked in and warned us of a fine if the pathetic 3D glasses given were found broken...Without an age limit set for entering the planetarium..even month old babies were brought inside and they wailed and cried all through the narration as it was dark..the narration and the projection itself was poorly designed and executed with the BGM highly distracting...I really hope the person who designed the projector show sits through it to realise the absurdity and inferior quality..
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,Lakshmi RP,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Poor maintenance ,"I remember visiting this planetarium as a child and it was in good shape then (20 years back) right now more than half of exhibits don't work . Stairways stink . No order maintained . People were pushing and shoving . Show was Marvels of Mars which was projected only on one part of screen, which made it difficult for people seated on other side. I have been to two other planetariums, one in india and another abroad , they were way better than this one . So much of government money got wasted. Staff of middle / higher level conducted a presentation about liquid nitrogen and showed examples of science in real life , that was the only good part of the whole visit. "
B_M_Birla_Planaturium,H V,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Poorly maintained, horribly hot, badly execulted","The science exhibition is in a concrete building with glass facade. Gallery 1 did not have a single fan working - which on a May afternoon was really horrible. The Goldberg machine that was there was turned on for some special people - demonstrated and then switched off and the balls that are supposed to smoothly transition between different stages kept dropping off - a dangerous thing given that they were solid metal ones the size of squash balls. All other sections of the exhibition hall had broken pieces, peeling plaster, chipped wood etc. The planetarium was a good facility but the show itself was amateurish with poor commentary and asynchronous sounds and picture. The worst was the 3D theatre. It looked so amateurish that I am sure it was created by someone learning to do 3D animation for the first time - with no storyline, random bits of dinosaurs, Alice in wonderland type sequences and strange stuff interspersed in between.  There are better ways to spend time with your children than going to this place in summer."

The planetarium program is laughable by most standards, with projections falling onto one side of the dome, the heavily mother tongue influenced narration offering outdated and meaningless facts, and international units in indian units (eg crores and lakhs) the graphics and animations were gifs, and low resolution google images and looked like they were made by a 2nd grade student for his science project.
