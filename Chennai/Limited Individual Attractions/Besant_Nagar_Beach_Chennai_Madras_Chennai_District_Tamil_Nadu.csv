Some of these restaurants have seating arrangement in the open which goes well with the breeze. You can explore restaurants serving south Indian, tandoori and continental dishes. Sunday mornings are usually car free times so you can actually park your vehicles elsewhere and walk on the road along the beach sands. You also get to play games or participate in group activities during those few hours. Overall it is a less crowded beach and you can combine your visit here with shopping in the nearby showrooms."

There is fish market nearby and a very grand church. Nice place to spend during the evening with the sea breeze."
