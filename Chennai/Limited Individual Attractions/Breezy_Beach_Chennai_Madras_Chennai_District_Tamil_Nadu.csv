Breezy_Beach,Deadman17,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Less Crowded and Peaceful,"This is a not so famous beach near valkmiki nagar. A bit out of the way, and hence it is not frequented by tourists and then is not as crowded.  A good place to spend some time in peace. Walkers are seen aplenty in morning and evening. Limited street food is available."

Breezy_Beach,TripCritic151,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,"Not super clean not super dirty either, less people thou","Locals know this beach as  Thiruvanmiyur Beach?... Smaller crowds which makes it more desirable then the usual beach in India ..also not very dirty. Although as in all Indian beaches there is still trash around. There’s a trash bin every ten feet  which helps but it was jus twenty minutes stay   ...Not much around it and the water was the usual dirt brown ,I’ll try kovalam Tommorow it seems a good option"
Breezy_Beach,Anuragkumar123,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Best for couple,This beach is less crowd as comoared to other beaches in chennai but it is little unsafe because of less public
Breezy_Beach,Aravindh R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,A calm place to unwind and relax,"This is a very calm and quiet place for us to relax and unwind ourselves from the daily stress routine.  A good place to hangout with family or friends.  You get variety of roadside eatables like masala peanut, ice creams, chats etc.  You really forget the time."
Breezy_Beach,Karthik R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Beautiful and less pollution,Beautiful and less pollution beach on the ECR. This is one of the clean beaches in Chennai. We spent around 1 hour here and enjoyed the beautiful beach here.
Breezy_Beach,MKamath,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Very Well Maintained Beach,"I have been in this area for many years and have been a regular visitor to this beach. Also as morning walker, I have been visiting this almost every morning for last couple of months. I should say this is one of the very neatly maintained beach, thanks to ECR beach walkers association, there are proper lights, cement seats and dustbins. Also during morning there is also drinking water. Beach is absolutely safe even in very early morning (I start my walk at 5AM and I see many people started before me). There have been lot of articles in local newspapers praising this beach for many goods. Currently I see lot of people flocking this beach during day time. From future consideration, I believe with the influx of more people, obviously parking will be an issue, so authorities should take right action so as to make sure it is not a mess."
Breezy_Beach,Joji J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,"""loved the neat and clean beach""","Went to breezy beach with a friend and I was surprised since I could find only few people in this beautiful beach. Want to keep away from the maddening crowd and relax, the breezy beach is a good option. No disturbances from the vendors and soft sand where we can have a walk. We spent time till 7.30 PM and it was really dark but my friend was staying nearyby and he said he visits the beach frequently."
Breezy_Beach,krazikams,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016,dirty & isloated,"You may feel peaceful and quiet out here on this beach located on city outskirts, however, it is isolated and can get bit unsafe in dark evenings, especially if not many people are around."
Breezy_Beach,Arun K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,Beautiful place,"Beautiful place to visit - the crowd is almost negligible compared to the Marina & Bessy beaches. Also there are very less hawkers around for cheap food.However, the experience & sea view is quite beautiful in the evening and early morning times.Beautiful place to visit in ECR."
Breezy_Beach,bishnu s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,"Less crowd, more clean",Tried comparing this beach with Mariana beach. The big difference is almost negligible crowd here and it's comparatively much more cleaner.  You get to enjoy hours of solitude on this beach. The evening time is great with gentle cool breeze.  It gives relaxing and rejuvenating experience.  This is a very small beach and the experience here is very different from the experience on Mariana Beach.
Breezy_Beach,Rucha121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Calm Beach on outskirts,"Located on outskirts away from city noise and traffic, not so well-maintained, sand is covered with wild grass, but, nature is not altered, clean water and peaceful place to enjoy sea waves hitting the shore."
Breezy_Beach,Divya M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Foodie kitchen,"There is foodies kitchen near by, try to avoid going there, they even reuse the tea cup made from clay."
Breezy_Beach,Rajani K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Clean Sea Beach,"If you are looking for a clean, quiet and less crowded beach in Chennai city, this beach is your destination. Located near the residential area of Thiruvanmiyur, this beach is less frequented by the tourists and the Chennaities,  Mostly people staying near by visit this for morning and evening walks.  This beach doesn't have dirt and filth like the Mariana beach. We visited in the morning. Enjoyed the cool sea breeze while taking a morning walk."
Breezy_Beach,Rajanikanth B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Friends,Good beach but not well connected,"Pros:Beach is very calm. Seemed pollution free.Bella Ciao is nearby for a quick bite. We went there for Planet adventure paintball that is right on the beach. Overall, it was pretty good. Cons:only problem we faced was it was quite distant from bus stop. No problem if you are using own vehicle. "
Breezy_Beach,Samshell2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,Less crowded and clean beach,"I'm new to Chennai and definitely wanted to visit a beach. Googled couple of beaches to visit in Chennai and found this breezy beach interesting as I was looking for a less crowded one. Visited on a Saturday evening with my family, Wow, I was amazed the way the beach surroundings were maintained. Very clean and no litter at all, for every 10 steps you can find a dustbin. Crowd was descent, mostly family , couples, and few gangs of boys and girls. Being on a weekend, the crowd was comparatively less. You can play in the water as well as walk along the shore and can enjoy the cool breeze. The road which lead to the beach is also well maintained and don't miss trying yummy and mouth watering local street snacks near the beach."
Breezy_Beach,Narayanan S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,Beach near my home,"Valmiki nagar beach needs a lot of improvement. is reasonably un- clean. The bushy growth is helpful to those who want to use it as a toilet, attempts to make it clean by the residents in Valmiki nagar turned out to be futile"
Breezy_Beach,AdventuresSoul,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Solo,Nice n clean beach,"I stay in the vicinity, hence very near to my home.Nice n clean beach, very good for morning walks."
Breezy_Beach,None I,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Viewed the Sunrise here,"This is a quiet and calm beach located in Thiruvanmiyur, Chennai.  We visited this to view the sun rise. This beach is a very small beach compared to other beaches in Chennai.  There were very few people around who had also come to see the sun rise.  After viewing the rising sun on this beach, we took a morning walk along the sea shore."

Breezy_Beach,Rajani B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,"A less crowded, clean and calm sea beach","Thiruvanmiyur Beach is a less crowded and clean sea beach (when compared to Marina Beach) of Chennai. It is located 1km from the Beach Road of Thiruvanmiyur.  This is a relatively smaller beach. The beach is located close to residential area. It's a nice place to enjoy evening or morning walks and watch the Sun rise and Sun set.  This beach is not as commercialized as the Marina Beach. It's a quiet and peaceful place to enjoy the gentle cool sea breeze.  Thiruvanmiyur sea beach is a good place near the city to relax and enjoy pleasant, pollution free environment."
Breezy_Beach,Yin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Beautiful and clean beach,It is very close to my house and it is one of the best beach in Chennai and its clean.Very nice place for walkers and joggers and for families. Theres an Italian restaurant and a small coffee shop  by the beach..Overall its a beautiful beach ..must visit place!!
Breezy_Beach,Karthik V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Less visited Beach,"One more of the beaches dotting the long Chennai coastline, This Breezy beach is located near Thiruvanmiyur. This place is not much visited by outsiders but highly popular with the locals for their morning walks and evening sit outs."
Breezy_Beach,YatriForever,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,"Once the most beautiful beach of Madras , even now looks good !","I live about 200 meters away from the Beach of Valmiki Nagar, since year 2001. Have seen this beautiful beach since 1968. It is still better than Marina , Elliots, Thiruvalluvar Nagar, Palavakkam and few other beaches along the coast. This Valmiki Nagar beach at the end of 4th Seaward Road is not the same as the ajjoining beach at Thiruvalluvar Nagar, which has a different access road from the RTO. Both the beaches are reasonably in good shape, though the efforts to keep it clean and safe is tough.  Welcome to our beach ! Happy to answer any question on our beach ! "
Breezy_Beach,khalid0211,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Friends,Relaxing,"Beaches are easily the most relaxing natural spaces. And, this is especially true when they are not crowded. This is what I loved about this beach - not crowded and quiet clean.  Happy to miss out the endless consession stands that one encounters at the more popular spots. This is a place to chill and enjoy the waves."
Breezy_Beach,PremPandurangam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Best kept secret,"The Marina and Elliot's beaches are more famous but they are equally crowded. The Breezy Beach in Valmiki Nagar is not that accessible and that means only locals frequent the beach. I usually stop by in the evenings to catch some fresh air and soak in the atmosphere. If you are lucky, you can catch a view of turtles and whales (yup, you got that right)."
Breezy_Beach,Shyamis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016,Nice place,"Less crowded but nice enough, not too many street vendors and maybe could be kept cleaner, but we had a great time/"
Breezy_Beach,Ruth C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Covered in rubbish and poo,"We stayed nearby and locals warned us away from the fishing village although is interesting in all directions there were lines of men using the shoreline as a toilet, so not great.  The other way was some lovely very expensive looking houses and then a 'fun park' which I used for their toilet, but although it was trying to simulate Disney land-type experience it was just sad.  In need of a good coat of paint and some attractions.  Like all Indian beaches, covered in rubbish.  As this is a major turtle nesting beach, this needs to be addressed."
Breezy_Beach,Anupgeorge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,Excellent beach,"Amazing breeze, good to spend time alone or with your loved one. The Beach is very green on one side. We went on a full moon night which was awesome"
Breezy_Beach,Begaraaj S M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,Pleasantly Beautiful Beach !!!,"Water plants on the beach sand makes this beach so colourfully brilliant, away from the maddening crowd and still close to the city.Located in Valmiki nagar and within walking distance from ECR,autos are available for reasonable charge (Rs.30-50/-)to the beach,so,very easily accessible from all parts of chennai via city bus.Must visit for all age groups when you are in chennai,please experience this experience for the experience sake."
Breezy_Beach,kathiranand7,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Nice beach,This beach is very good and neat we go and relax and play with friends its nice to go there and enjoy....
Breezy_Beach,Nagarajan L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,Quiet beach when compared to other well known names,"Nice quiet beach, not that clean but still good place to hang out when compared to crowded Marina or Elliots. Not much issues parking 2/4 wheelers. its quite safe as well and well lit,"
Breezy_Beach,RamGanesan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,Alternative to the busy beaches,"Being a resident of Chennai for several years, I would think that the best beach in Chennai is this place.  Several reasons to it... It is not as busy and crowded as the Marina or Elliots.  This is in a residential area so not much of trouble with automobiles and unruly traffic and not many hawkers too... Relatively cleaner than most other places as it is maintained well by well wishers and associations around Valmiki Nagar.  If somone outside of Chennai wants to have a peaceful evening at the beach and take a dip this is the place.  The skyline looks really beautiful and on a good high tide day you are sure to spot several vessels on the horizon."
Breezy_Beach,Capri67,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,"Cleaner, less crowded version of The Marina Beach!",If you want to experience the vast expansive beaches of Chennai but still want it to be cleaner and less crowded then this is the place to visit. Predominantly frequented by local residents.
Breezy_Beach,SujaJai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,Great place ! But avoid weekends !! Gets VERY Crowded !!!,"I walk on the each EVERYDAY, and so I shd know this place quite well.Walking on the sand and the nice 1 km long walking stretch is great.When visiting in the morning, tray and make it before 7 am, else it gets hot (6.30 in summers!). In the evenings, the sea breeze is brilliant ! These days, you have hawkers like in Marina. So the place gets messy in the weekends.Avoid weekends - too much crowd, and parking can be a pain."
Breezy_Beach,VjZen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Not too commercial like marina / besant nagar,"I used to stay very close to this, compared to what it was 10 years back, its very crowded now. But still better than marina / besant nagar beach. This place is pretty far off from RTO bus stop, need to take an auto from there if using public transport.Parking was never a problem, you'll get some space in near by streets. Avoid going there on Sunday evenings. Police presence round the clock makes this a safe place."
Breezy_Beach,Vedant Jhaver,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,escape from crowds of Marina and enjoy the sound of breaking waves,Small and decent beach far away from crowds of Marina beach. Get early in the evening to find parking and enjoy. cleaner than before due to regulated food stalls.
Breezy_Beach,rajeshssil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,peaceful and secured beach in chennai,"this is the only beach which is best secured and peaceful as well in the whole lot of chennai beaches (except on holidays and week ends which is heavily crowded). Secured because police patrolling is available.Peaceful because less crowded when compared to other beaches which are secured. There are many other beaches which are less crowded and clean than this, but they are not secured by even a person or lights. So this is the best beach to stay even till 9-10 PM. Beach is pretty calm and can be enjoyed by family with kids during evenings. Eateries are available but of limited varieties and that too made by localites. Good for walking.Good for evening stay and enjoying with family.Little eateries and toys selling for kids.Best accessible by public transport till Tiruvanmiyur RTO and from there you have to walk around 1km. Else direct transport is preferred.Cons : Beach is not so clean. Always crowded over week ends."
Breezy_Beach,Srinath P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,Bessy...,"Good beach, gets crowded over the weekends.. good place to catch up with friends and family.. has a good walkway"
Breezy_Beach,sansanan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,A beach surprise !,"Chennai beaches are crowded. There is always a whole bunch of people wandering around whichever beach it may be. But this beach is a little different. I did not know that this was called Breezy beach !The beach is not as crowded as the others and is relatively quite clean too. There is ample parking available on the roads leading up to the beach and there are not too many vendors around.A good place to visit in the evenings and enjoy the breeze. Grab a packed of roasted groundnuts from the cart-vendor and find a clean place to sit.You will see kids frolicking in the water, couples walking hand-in-hand and families enjoying a picnic.Getting into the water is not recommended, considering that it might not be as clean as you would hope. Anyways, you can get your feet wet!As with any beach, do not stay there late into the night since it may get quite lonely. Best time to visit is early in the morning, or after 5.30 pm."

Breezy_Beach,BALASHOTELREVIEW,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,Bala's Marina beach visit,"Visited the beach one evening on a week day as it is too crowded on week ends and holidays. After parking the car, we walked on the beach sand and went near the sea. Stood close to sea and enjoyed the sea waves coming towards us washing our feet and going back which is an excellent feeling every one should feel it to understand. We were warned not to venture into walking into sea as it may be deep and we may be dragged by waves into the sea. After some time we sat in a bajji - a south indian snack counter and tasted hot fresh bajjis of potato, banana and onion. We sat near the shore and enjoyed tasting the famous sundal prepared from pulses, mango chips and coconut flakes watching the waves. "
Breezy_Beach,VijayAthreyan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Tiruvanmiyur Beach,Awesome..  No disturbance from vendors. Lesser foot falls comparing to Marina...  so you will enjoy the Beach...

Breezy_Beach,Dp03,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015,Thiruvanmiyur Beech,"I am a regular visitor to Thiruvanmiyur Beech. I come here 4-5 times in a week from Mogappair, where I live.This is a lovely Beech & un-polluted. But I observed two things as follows:1. Nowadays the visitor population has increased especially on holidays. Request to plan for a paid public toilets.2. At least on holidays request not to allow cars & bikes on the walkers road. The whole area becomes conjusted & becomes like a market place.Otherwise an excellent place to chill out with friends & family..."
Breezy_Beach,soundararajanm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Friends,Thiruvanmiyur Beach,Awesome location.Best place to hangout with friends.Nice view.Good restaurants near by.Cool place for bunking class.
Breezy_Beach,Blore r,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013,"Go there early morning, stunning views.",Early morning there are no peddlers & hawkers selling eatables & other stuff so its very quiet and nice. Its much better & cleaner than the other beaches due to the fact that its almost outside the city southwards. You can see large number fishermen boats at a distance.
Breezy_Beach,sincityalive,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2012 • Couples,One of the few less crowded beaches in Chennai,"There is nothing special in the beach, apart from the fact that there are very few people on the beach. Its next to my house so i am a frequent visitor. Immerse in the sound of the waves and feel the wind.Kottivakam beach is nearby so you can go and grab some snacks. Have some company if you want to go after sunset( just to be safe) there is a fishermen colony right next to this beach and you can spot people sitting and drinking alcohol on the shore."
Breezy_Beach,Madhan Raj J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,"Clean beach, good for morning walk as well.",Very close my house hence go there for morning walk. Also it is good place to take kids in the evening.We visit there quite often. No lifeguards so need to be careful.
Breezy_Beach,Aaqarsh Aiyyar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,The Pristine beach in Chennai,"This beach is located just a few meters near the new beach road in Thiruvanmiyur. The beach is highly rated because it is unspoiled and is a walkers paradise. It is a great point for networking as you may walk alongside one of the popular film, politics or sports personalities of South India. There are quite a few walkers associations and the entire stretch has a wide range of healthy eateries and restaurants. I often visit this breezy beach (as it is near to my uncle's place) and every time I've lost myself in the priceless sea breeze and in the sound of the waves. Best (and free) recreation zone in Chennai for nature lovers..."
Breezy_Beach,Raj K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Family,A mini Serene beach,This beach is strictly for A class people... Completely clean and environment friendly.. Great place to be peaceful.. Not at all crowded like Elliots or Marina beach.. Lots of restaurants are there nearby to the shore..
