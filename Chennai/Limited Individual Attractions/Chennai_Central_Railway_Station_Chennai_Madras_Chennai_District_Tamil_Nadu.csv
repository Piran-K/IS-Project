It is the busiest railway station in South India and one of the most important hubs in the country with the distinction of having the longest name among all stations on the Indian Railways. It is connected to Moore Market Complex railway station, Chennai Central metro station, Chennai Park railway station, Park Town railway station and is 2 km from Chennai Egmore railway station. The terminus connects the city to northern India, including Kolkata, Mumbai and New Delhi, as well as to Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Coimbatore and parts of Kerala.Opened in 1873 during the British regime it has a typical British type of architecture as it reminds you of Victoria Station in London ( I visited this place for the first time in 1986 ) and reminded me so much of central station or it should be the other way around ! I also do have fond memories of this place as I studied in Madras Medical College from 1975 to 1980 and then stated in Men‚Äôs House Surgeons Quarters which were situated across the road and one could hear the announcement of all the trains coming and going ! That was in 1981 and the house surgeons quarters have been demolished now to renovate the Government General Hospital. I also remember that we used to take the subway and go to the canteen situated on the first floor of the railway station occasionally to have supper there ! A lot of attention is needed as far as maintenance and cleanliness is concerned as   It‚Äôs very crowded and congested and little modernisation will help go a long way as it‚Äôs a pleasure to visit the railway stations in Europe !Dr.Javed Rasheed"

Chennai_Central_Railway_Station,Valavanur Natar... K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Business,A detailed write up on origin history and its present status of Chennai Central Railway station,"A detailed write up on origin ,history and growth of The Chennai Central station The century-old Chennai Central Railway Station was designed by architect George Harding in 12th-century¬† Romanesque architecture. It  is indeed one of the most prominent landmarks of Chennai that serves as the main gateway by Rail  to the  rest of the country along with Egmore Railway  station 2 kms away .These two stations are well connected by suburban and Road connectivity .The Buchingham canal built by the British to ferry goods by waterway upto Nellore in Andhrapradesh  lies to the west of this Station . The  suburban railways that includes MRTS and Metro has its main hub near  this central station .The Sub terrenian metro station and muti layered shopping plaza now under consruction will becomr one of Asia's largest .The headquarters¬†of the¬†Southern Railway¬†and the corporation ¬†Ripon Building.built during the¬†British Raj are to the east and west of this station respectively .To the south is the main General hospital .and Madras Medical college .To its credit of long history it has been renamed twice, from¬†Madras Central¬†to¬†Chennai Central¬†in 1996, in line with change if its city's name from. Madras to¬†Chennai, and then later to to¬†Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station¬†in 2019, after the late¬†Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu¬†M. G. Ramachandran..Perhaps this name must be the station in indian network which has  the  longest name now .About 6 lakh  passengers utilise  this  terminus each  day, making it the busiest railway station in¬†South India togather with¬†Chennai Egmore.¬†Although the cleanliness is never a high point of Indian railways, Chennai central has the distinction of being one of the cleanest scoring over 180 points Out of 300 points bench mark .It boasts of 17 Platforms of which 12 is for long distance, & 5 for suburban commute  and  has 30 tracks for interchanging . Pallavan metro bus service connects this station by road to all parts of the city Historically speaking  when the Madras Railway Company began to network¬† South India¬†in 1856 the first station to be built was not this station but one at¬†Royapuram,(Now defunct) and it remained the main station at that time.With expansion of the Madras Railways network  this Madras Central station  came into being in 1873 , in  the open grounds that had once been called¬†John Pereira's Gardens, belonging to Joao Pereira de Faria  a¬†Portuguese¬†merchant  who had  settled in Madras in 1660.In 1907, Madras Central was made the Madras Railway Company's main station and  gained prominence after  Royapuram station ceased to be  a terminus for Madras .The Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway Company was formed in 1908 and took over the Central station from the Madras Railway Company.The station's importance  grew  after the  the headquarters of the¬†Madras and  Southern Mahratta Railway¬†moved to the adjacent building  ans soon came to be  known as the¬†Southern Railway in 1922The year 1980s saw further expansion of central station that saw the annexing of  the erstwhile Moore market complex that was devastated in a fire .The Railways built a 13-storied complex to house the suburban terminus and railway reservation counter. With open space in front  becoming  a car park..In 1996, after  the station became known as Chennai Central  and increased passenger capacity compelled  further extension to  the main building and a new building was added   in 1998 with on the western side with a similar architecture to the original. After this duplication of the main building, the stations 12 platforms became 17 platforms .The multi-storeyed¬†Moore Market Complex¬†then became  a dedicated terminus with three separate platforms for the¬†Chennai Suburban Railway system.In the 1990s, when the IRCTC was formed, shopping stalls and  food plazas were set up.In 2005, the buildings were painted a light brown colour, but Railways bowed down to  public demand through  campaigns and also to retain the old nostalgic charm it was  repainted back  in their original brick-red color.To its credit it became the first  station  in India to be placed on the cyber mapand on 26 September 2014, Chennai Central got  free Wi-Fi connectivity. The renovated station now  boasts of bookshops,  restaurants, accommodation facilities, Internet browsing centres, and a shopping mall. And an inadequate waiting hall that can hold  about just  1,000 people.But to be frank even though it has a chequred history and undergone so many addition and changes its still a far cry from any internation standardsFor railway station for it  lacks several facilities such as drinking water, medical & prominent ¬†display boards and above all cleanliness .There are passenger operated enquiry terminals and seven touch-screen PNR status machines in the station.The station has three¬†split-flap timing boards, electronic display boards and Plasma TVs that mention train timings and platform number.A passenger information center in the station has been upgraded with ""Spot your Train"" live train display facility, information kiosks and passenger digital assistance booths.The terminus, however, has only 10 toilets, which is grossly  inadequate for over 4  lakh passenger movement at any point of time .Four-seater battery operated vehicles available to cater to the needs of the elderly and the physically impaired is grossly inadequate for many comevto the general hospital acroos the road by rail forctreatmentvfrom all parts the country . It is a pain to get one easily .On 15 April 2013, a new emergency medical care centre was opened thanks to PIL and intervention by judiciary . The centre now  has three beds, two doctors on duty and another on standby, four nurses, a paramedic team, and a round-the-clock ambulance. The centre is equipped with oxygen cylinders, an ECG, a defibrillator and resuscitation equipment. The terminus is also the first railway station in the country to have facilities of an ambulance.The station has parking facilities for more than 1,000 two-wheelers and  1,000 cars .But The station still faces parking problems and with on going metro Rail work chaos is an understatement .Once the Metro works with underground plazas are completed the Chennai Central station atleast on the outside I hope , will take back its pride of place in chennai city scape with its dominating clock on the central Red tower ."

Once you are inside the Railway station, no remarkable eateries or stores or anything significant to watch or learn. If you want to watch the hustle and bustle of life in India, you could head inside. Otherwise, do not expect any railway history or murals or any interesting installations. For the population it handles, a decent job is made in trying to keep the place neat, but public needs to co-operate. "

Interestingly, this is a station where all the incoming trains go back in the same direction, as there is only the sea on the other direction.So, you'll note that moving across platforms is very easy unlike other stations where you need to take an overbridge or an underbridge. Station is often kept relatively clean but still a great deal of improvement is required. It is also adjacent to the local train station. There can be better restaurants and food joints."

Chennai_Central_Railway_Station,nytikjoshi,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,Ok so it is not bad but you to accept it is a British Raj Heritage station what more to say,"Now with that said it is still a good functional station, with decent directions and fairly good connection to the rest of the country. Please factor two different time frames to reach your seat, one is the huge traffic build up to reach the station, second is the distance to your coach for the 1st easily keep an extra 1.5 hrs and for the latter keep atleast 45 mts to reach you seat.Avoid buying any food from the ubranded platform vendors and second still be extra safe and carry a lock and chain to tie your luggage no matter what others think of you.Enjoy your journey after about 1 hour once the train leaves the station till then keep your eyes and if possible nose closed:) as you may have to go through the ugliest sights of people still potting near the tracks. Things have changes nonetheless, today they are much better, also if you are calling an uber or ola tell them that you are standing near the CANARA bank atm and they can easily locate you. avoid the touts and the freelance taxis as they still having the fleecing mentality ."
