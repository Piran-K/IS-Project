It was crowded with people who wants to shop mostly for textiles. Can get good prices if you are walking with a local friend here, If you don't want to take risk just go to Saravana Stores. Local brands like Raymond and Indian Terrain also just along the T. Nagar street with many choices of restaurants to eat, I would prefer to have my lunch there at Nasikanda Pelita which is originated from Malaysia."

There are a few clothing stores, but some of the stores were shut despite it being a weekday evening. The place isn't very crowded, but the mall is very cramped. The food court has two functioning stores other than McDonalds, neither of which seem appetizing. There is a rooftop seating with two food stalls- a soda stall and a biryani stall. While the rooftop view of the ocean is nice, almost everything else in this mall is not."
Chennai_Citi_Center,sharathr23,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,A small mall with basic shops , A relatively small shopping mall that houses shops catering from clothing items to food items.

Chennai_Citi_Center,Shahid L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Grand from the Outside, Ordinary Inside","You couldn't miss the Citi Centre whilst driving past Radhakrishnan Salai. Grand in stature and ornate in visuals from the outside, the same however doesn't translate inside. Quite a compact mall to describe it positively. A one time visit for freshers in Chennai. It doesn't offer much other apart from the cinemas which fuels the majority of the crowd coming to Citi Centre. There is no Unique Selling Point to this mall (apart from the Cinema) to be coming back to it. Heavily hit by the rise of bigger malls, its premium location will be one of the factors driving the business through this mall."
Chennai_Citi_Center,YashiR25,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,For the architecture and proximity to beach,"Again, it is not a mall. But a hub of shops under one roof. Avoid eating anything there; we got food poisoning. The rooftop let you have a view of the sea. Architecture of the building is good.If you happen to be near Marina Beach, then can visit. A big NO for its cinema. The seats are terrible, poorly maintained.The old charm is lost; may be because of bad maintenance."

Chennai_Citi_Center,somsontravel,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Grand look despite losing ita sheen,"Citi center was among the forerunners in mall with huge layout, palace style entrance and most prominent location. Marina beach is at a walkable distance and it used to attract lot of crowd full day. But now due to other bigger better malls and speciality restaurants in proximity, Citi center has lost its crowds, it's stores and it's charisma. Beautiful entrance and architecture is still something to have a look at but as a mall, definitely a no go"
Chennai_Citi_Center,Nudrad N,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Waste  of time,Seems like a haunted mall ..less shop to buy .. only home deco store is good ..or else just waste of time 
Chennai_Citi_Center,RamGanesan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Has become quite now,"With a of competition this mall has lost its business.  Once a very busy mall, today it has become a quite place.  I went to the mall only for one reason.  To see a movie on the Inox screen and have some french fries at Mcdonalds.  The other reason I chose earlier to this visit was because it is very quiet on even weekends and we can have a peaceful shopping experience without too much of noise. In fact informal business meetings can be had at the food court!"

Chennai_Citi_Center,APK24,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A good option if you don't want to spend the whole day at a mall!,"This mall used to be one of the hot spots in Chennai about 10 years ago for people to hang out on weekends and after college. However over time and with the introduction of bigger malls , the footfall has reduced quite a bit. However it is still worth a visit as at least it wont be overcrowded like other malls and you can get in and out and do some shopping without spending the whole day walking up and down the mall. Lifestyle, Will Lifestyle, FBB and Max are some of the outlets worth checking out. Food options are limited but still available- Mcdonalds, KFC and a few others."

I was told this is the second best mall in Chennai, and very well so with its elegance, modern amenities, bunch of shopping and dining options and seemingly popular among the local crowd. You can find branded western clothing or Indian cultural dresses with different budget options to choose from. Lively and vibrant, close to the popular Marina beach, it's worth a visit to this mall if you're in need of some shopping or just want to stroll around for a change."
Chennai_Citi_Center,shrinikethv,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Very good mall in Mylapore,"The mall is in Mylapore. Very good mall with lot of top brand shops.

Chennai_Citi_Center,VAS1586,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"The first trendy mall of Chennai but now becoming a little stale, yet crowds galore","When this mall was opened, it was a big talk of the town those days.  Sure it has its locational advantage, its features, its car parking areas, near the Marina, with all trendy shops inside, but of late this is becoming a little outdated and stale.  Sometimes one has opportunity to have a glimpse of celebrities and their families too.  One of the best attractions as per me is the LANDMARK shop and of course the digital theatres.  Eateries are aplenty.  A pricey place but on festive occasions you do have some good bargains."

I think second mall next to Spencer's Plaza. This is located in Cathedral road and accessible through bus and also MRTS (Lighthouse station). Comparatively small in size and less shopping or dining options. It houses Inox Screens and it also has a food court and children play area.
Chennai_Citi_Center,Rupesh_Mishra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nothing much to shop,- The mall is not the best in the town. Its a medium sized mall with Lifestyle in half of the portion.- not much option to shop here. You cam go and watch movies in inox and eat though.
Chennai_Citi_Center,Srinivasan K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good place for hanging out in Chennai,"This is a good place for hanging out, especially during weekends. You can find a lot of shops and there is also INOX theatre if you want to watch movies. Variety of restaurants available to give food to your taste buds."
Chennai_Citi_Center,prabhuespn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A Landmark of Chennai - Citi Center,"Its located near to Mundakanni Amman Koil MRTS Railway Station. One had to walk through a nearby slum and can reach Cit Center. Its not a big mall compared to Phoenix Velacherry, but has its own imposing external structure along with good restaurants, apparel shops, gadget points, etc... Not to mention the only INOX screen at Chennai is in Citi Center"
Chennai_Citi_Center,d_world12,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Sort of....,"This one has lost it's glory quite a while back but then is an ok mall to go. It's not huge by any means so limited options, has cinema option (I don't go there usually), and a open rooftop where you can sit / eat while taking a glance at the marina (usually is hot though so good on evenings). Nothing more to say."
Chennai_Citi_Center,SanthoshRajan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 ‚Ä¢ Couples,My Favorite in Chennai,"Many would be disappointed calling this one as a mall. But. This is my favorite mall in Chennai due to certain factors. First of all it houses one of the few good cinemas in Chennai - The INOX. Another important factor is, it is less crowded than the other malls. And the most important factor is it is very near to the Marina beach. Who would hate a leisure time at beach after a good matinee show. You can also enjoy meal at the windy roof top."
Chennai_Citi_Center,s_ramsam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Very good mall,"This mall has all the facilities/amenities one expects from a modern mall in a big city.Plenty of shops, food court, good way to while away time window shopping and maybe some real shopping."
Chennai_Citi_Center,Aayush_Bagla,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Okayish Mall,The mall is not very huge but then this is comparitively one of the oldest in Chennai. But has all the ammenities such as a food court and movie theatre. Nice timepass.

This mall has all facility which one should have for their families.I have visited this mall to watch movie as this mall has INOX multiplex with them.Also their Food Court is amazing as i wanted to have some Burger i tried the same with McDonalds.
Chennai_Citi_Center,Raj kumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 ‚Ä¢ Couples,no so bad,"Price are done for not selling, just to see things ! Do u understand , exorbitant price, we cant buy, unless u print Gandhies ! Oh yes !"
Chennai_Citi_Center,Vijay Raj Selvam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,One of the first few malls in Chennai,"Long back this was the only mall in Chennai. Hence you will see that this mall is not as big as the other malls which has recently come up. Still, the place has its own crowd coming. Situated near to beach, you will see crowd walking straight from marina into this mall for having food at the food court. Well maintained mall. Shops are also good here. There is Inox theatres inside this mall too!"
Chennai_Citi_Center,Akshay G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 ‚Ä¢ Business,It's more of a shopping centre than a mall!,"Not many good brands and stores. The only reason why people still visit is because of the cinema theatre on the top floor. Otherwise very little reason to visit this mall. They don't have a food court, sometimes the escalators don't work. The movie hall at the top is pretty decent and that's why i visited this in the first place."
Chennai_Citi_Center,SagarVS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Mid sized shopping center,"This place is on the way to the Mylapore beach. Its mid sized with a sprinkling of local brands, cinema and cafe's. This place is meant for the people around this area and not for the ones visiting Chennai. Unimpressed."
Chennai_Citi_Center,Jagan80,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good Place for Shopping & Entertainment,This is one of the good place in chennai. INOX is available here. Good Options for food & shopping. very near to the beach.

Chennai_Citi_Center,hunter_nga,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 ‚Ä¢ Business,Existing Trip,"Hi, This place is nice spend time in city center, available lot of restaurant with spicy foods the most famous named INOX which is placed in city center."
Chennai_Citi_Center,osgoodk123,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Expensive, Great location for surrounding areas",I liked the location of Chennai to see nearby pondicherry and other nice temples etc. Unfortunately accomodation was expensive as it is a city built for business and not for tourism. I would recommend booking in advance and a 2 day stay would be sufficient to see the sights
