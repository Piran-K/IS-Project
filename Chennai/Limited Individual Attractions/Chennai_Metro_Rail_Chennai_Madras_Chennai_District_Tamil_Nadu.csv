Chennai_Metro_Rail,sathish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Metro - Best mode of transportation,"Chennai metro - one of best mode of transportation available in Chennai  for commuters. It's one of the fast transportation mode available next to suburban train. It's is the third largest metro system available in India. It covers a length of 45 kilometres. The Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), a joint venture between¬†Government of India¬†and the¬†Government of Tamil Nadu¬†built and operates the Chennai Metro. The system has a mix of underground and elevated stations and uses¬†standard gauge.¬†The network consists of two¬†colour-coded¬†lines. The services operate daily between 4:30 and 23:00 with a varying frequency of 10 to 20 minutes. There are 42 trains with four coaches each, making a total of 168 coaches, operating in the first phase. The train length is 86.5m. It's speed is about 80km/h. It's headquarter is at Koyambedu. But the price is bit costly compare to other mode of transportation. Overall it's a rapid transportation system for commuters. Happy journey."
Chennai_Metro_Rail,Anand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Fast and safe commute,"Metro is relatively new in Chennai compared to other megacities. So just for the experience went with family, although a call taxi would've been cheaper and straight-forward for the same destination.  For single journey we got tokens. At the entry station we scan the token at gate, and at the exit station the gate swallows the token. The metro train itself was standing two floors above ground, reached via escalators.  At first we were confused because the train door did not open, and there were no buttons on the door to open it.  Another passenger explained that doors are closed until the last few minutes in order to save air-condition.  So, three minutes before the train starting time the doors opened automatically and we entered the refrigerator-cold compartment.The station and the train were clean and well-maintained.  The commute was mostly above the ground on a bridge, which was interesting. I can see how much Chennai has evolved in the past many years.  Metro is very much a welcome relief, at least for the sake of fresh, cool, clean and safe public transport around the city."
Chennai_Metro_Rail,kurien2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,most comfortable commute,The metro from airport to various locations is a pleasure especially during peak hours. No rush and over crowding it is yet to be fully appreciated by people who are used to driving around.

Thpugh inam a chennaite,  i travelled for the first time as i go onlu by cab. But that day no ola ubder cab driver picked my call. So i was forced to choose metroI think it was the last trip for that day to go to central. Station staff were tired.  Station wore a deserted look.  Not very bright. I used metro at uk beijing Hk Malaysia and dubai. Definitely they are much better. May be. Over the years things might improve. I wanted to use the auto ticket issuing kiosk. But one staff guided me to the human operarating counters. I tried to forget that i am in a place where everyone speaks my language and tried to guide myself through displays and signs. Not very comfortable i would say. Finally forced to ask thw housekeeping ladies at top for a query(!). Statiom was clean and platforms were mopped even during the last trip. Train came. But started after 15 min. Waited. And atlast train started with thud. Lot of noise the train makes, which i have never noticed in other countries. Rails creeky scratching noise coach turns at the time of halts during eash stop at stsations.. quiet noisy. Few passengers only. Coach was clean.  Announcement system function well. Got down at vadapalani.station was little dark.got down through steps.little weird. Since i know chennao fear wasnt my mind.

Chennai_Metro_Rail,Unknown,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Very bad experience at High court metro,"The staffs working there doesn't give respect to people specially who are sitting in checking counter, they are violating the rules against Muslims,at high court metro station a lady she was using unparliamentary words and arguing like anything to remove the burkha and asking to show the face... Better you attach a board at every station as ""Restricted Place for Muslims"". Please don't insult any religion and in our country everyone seems equal."
Chennai_Metro_Rail,Zinia F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,State of the Art Infrastructure,"Chennai can be very proud of itself in how organised it runs the city, and metro rail is no different!State of the art technology, infrastructure and management, squeaky clean platforms and ticketing booths in line with Chennai's culture..Special mention to the sliding doors of the platforms separating the rail tracks, and will open with the rail sliding doors allowing passengers to enter only then.  I think this is a very very good safety measure as accidents can happen to anybody.Five star experience!"

I had the opportunity to travel a few days back. It was a wonderful experience. The facilities are amazing. The maintenance is extremely good. The train and coaches are well maintained.  To popularize this mode of transportation, the end points should be well connected. Also the extra spaces in the stations should be utilized properly by allowing some shops and small malls to come up. This will attract more passengers."
