Chennai_Rail_Museum,CHENNAI RAIL MUSEUM,,,,Like the engine kept in the park. Well maintained museum. Kids enjoyed the Toy train raid. The authorities allowed 2 rounds of toy train rides. It also depicted the first inception of rail factory with different kinds of coaches. Had a great time there. And for adult tickets you get snacks as well. It is kind of small feel good gesture.
