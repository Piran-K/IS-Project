Chennai_Turtle_Walk,J J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Beautiful experience to see the little turtle babies crawl out,"The turtle hatching is a beautiful thing to experience. My 8 year old son was very mesmerised. Those little tiny turtles running towards the ocean waves in the evening was a sight which lasts a life time. It’s simple and yet amazing. The team to conserve the olive ridley turtles is putting a great effort. Number of hatchlings depend on the time of the season and varies.A bit remote to find it.We saw hatchlings being released into the ocean and not the mid night turtle walks for laying eggs.Thats not done in April, but in feb March.All in all good experience "
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,Aviott J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Great way to meet people interested in nature conservation issues.,"Between the months of December and April each year, several thousand Olive Ridley turtles come to the sandy beaches along the outskirts of Chennai to lay their eggs. For nearly four decades now, several dozen volunteers of the Chennai Students Sea Conservation Network SSTCN meet at various spots along the coast to patrol the beaches at night. When they come across a turtle laying eggs, they mark the nest and collect the eggs for hatching in an incubator. 45 to 60 days later, the hatchlings are brought to the same spot and released close to the water's edge. Volunteers stand in the water with torches to guide the hatchlings towards the sea. This interference with nature is necessary because the beaches are not protected and human habitation has encroached almost up to the waterline. Google the SSTCN website for details of meeting points, contact numbers and times to visit. I participated in a walk that began at 11 pm and ended at around 6 am and covered around 7 km of beach. It was a mixed group of about 30 people of all ages. The walk began with a short introduction to nature conservation work, turtle habitats and species. The introduction was done in two language groups, for English and for Tamil speakers"
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,J J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,"April is Hatching time, Nesting time is Jan to March mid. A must do","we were able to catch the hatching season. the nesting season was over.these bunch of volunteers is doing a great job of saving the olive ridley turtles.however they encourage you to read all the FAQ on their site before asking any questions.Slot more time to find this place as it looks like a small shak on the beach far down the road. Altough the road on the beach to the shak looks unmotorable, do not worry it is motorable. Seeing those little hatchlings trying so hard to climb out and then seeing them run to the ocean waves is an experience. One thing though there are not thousands or millions of hatchlings, its just a basket full so keep that in mind. We have steadfastly killed every possible lives around us and making them dwindle to as few as possible."
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,manoj k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Business,instance of real wild life protection,"Every year from Each night during the nesting season, a group of college students would trudge along the coast looking for Olive Ridley turtle nests and relocate them to a hatchery. The female turtle digs a pit in the sand with her back flippers and drops about 50 to 100 eggs. After 40-50 days, the eggs hatch and the hatchlings instinctively turn towards the sea and find their way to the depths of the ocean. The walk is conducted for 7 km from Neelankarai to Besant Nagar from 11 pm and goes on till 5 am. They also conduct awareness programmes to educate the general public about the plight of these turtles.  One can Go go participate in the above activity"
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,Hare_Sahu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Amazing Turtle Walk,Was looking for this type of activity. finally got a chance to be part of the same. The volunteers are having super knowledge about that. It was a very good experience walking from 12 am till 5 am in the beach and collected Turtle Eggs for keeping them hatched.
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,Shyamis,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Family,"If you get a chance, one of the best","You have to know well in advance and join in. It is always in the night, so might not be suitable for younger children."
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,DrLakshmiKrishnan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Solo,"This is an experience, not a place!","Held between January and April for the public on weekends, this is probably the best thing I have done in Chennai...in life infact!I have walked in nights when there were nothing but dead turtles and the there were very few nights where we saw live nesting turtles (one amazing experience - there is no turning back from these walks once you witness them), few nests and hundreds of hatchlings. Mind you, I walked every sat night for those 4 months to witness all this. So, keep your expectation low, cause a turtle will nest only even it wants to. Also, the volunteers are amazing - with real knowledge in them they have great life changing conversations and they do a thankless job on all our behalf."
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,Paloma_Rao,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015,A once in a lifetime experience,"I was lucky enough to be able to go on the turtle walk a few years ago and it was a wonderful experience! I would recommend everyone do it, especially those of you that have little ones. I will remind you though that its often based on chance (i went for the one organised by Croc bank), and they said that we had a lucky night, because there are times that you may not come across any eggs. Thankfully we did! It was lovely to help the baby turtles into the ocean! The guides were friendly and helpful, and answered all our questions"
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,SagarVS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,Seasonal,This is a seasonal midnight activity and must be done in groups for safety reasons. I suggest you tie up with local volunteer groups and do the walk. This is basically to save the baby turtles that wander away in the wrong direction.
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,PoulomiRoy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015,One of a kind,"This will definitely be one of the most unique and rewarding experiences you can be a part of! What an amazing feeling! We have to thank our lucky stars though, because we encountered about a 100 baby turtles coming out of their eggs on our turtle walk, although it doesn't always turn out to be successful. I've had friends who've said they've walked for hours and not come across anything. I'm not the most adventurous of people but was so glad my friend convinced me to come along. It was wonderful to release the little ones into the sea. Kudos to the team at Croc Bank for taking care of us, being our guides, answering all our questions and allowing us to share in something special! Thanks"

Chennai_Turtle_Walk,retronai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Solo,Amazing and saddening at the same time,"This is essentially a midnight walk from Neelankarai Beach to Besant Nagar beach, led by a bunch of volunteers who have taken up the seemingly thankless task of protecting the Olive Ridley turtles that nest along this route. You'll end up seeing at least one dead turtle for every turtle you catch nesting. The situation seems quite hopeless - commercial fishing trawlers that ply along the coast with their menacing nets doing most of the damage."
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,Charlie A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Very Passionate Volunteers,"Very educational and to be able to experience and see the releasing of the hatchlings, so lucky.  Well worth participating."
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,kevinjohn1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Solo,Amazing experience,"Turtle Walk in Chennai, generally happens during the Olive Ridley turtles nesting season from Dec-Mar. If you are lucky enough you will get to see a nesting Olive Ridley otherwise the walk is mostly about finding the nests and releasing the hatchlings into the sea. The scouts take the unhatched eggs to the local hatchery and release the hatchlings into the sea when they hatch. The walk starts at Neelankarai Beach at 11:00 PM and ends at the Besant Nagar Beach by 5:00 AM. A great opportunity to mix with a knowledgeable and quality crowd. Please carry food and water as the walk is along the beach and there is nothing available there as of now. A great experience and add to that the starry sky and the moonlight."

Chennai_Turtle_Walk,Aaqarsh Aiyyar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2014 • Friends,A must-do activity in Chennai,"Turtle walk is a terrific experience where in you can live a night with turtles, sea crabs, some like-minded conservationists, volunteers, fisher folks, beach sand, moon and water etc. The walk starts around 11 Pm at the Neelangarai beach on Friday and Saturday nights with an orientation about olive ridley turtles and the need for their conservation (during the breeding season between December and March) and ends around 5 AM in the morning at Elliot beach (Besent Nagar). I was fortunate enough to witness many hatchlings (and hold one of them in my hands) being let out in to the sea. The mid-walk break was refreshing. We were also lucky to spot a nest (glad to touch one of them) with about 126 eggs (usually between 80 and 120). The demonstration of replicating the wild nest and packing of the sourced eggs inside them in one of their hatcheries is icing on the cake."
Chennai_Turtle_Walk,Nikon_3100,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2012,Unexpecting wonderful event . . .,"We should support and save turtle . I had a wonderful experience with this small turtle .
