Chetpet_EcoPark,Praveenop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Top class park,The best water park project in Chennai so far. Perfect work done by the government. Well maintained and well managed
Chetpet_EcoPark,Chithranath,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,A trip to Ecopark you should quickly forget,"I took my grandson to chetput ecopark and it was a really sad experience thanks to the staff working there. The place looks nicely maintained and the various activities as well but expect bad service right from the parking staff, to the ticket counter folks and the employees who operate the various activities. They are rude, clueless and downright unhelpful to people who visit.We wasted 1.5 hours because of improper communication and lack of signages. The final experience at the VR/ AR was interesting and the ONLY saving grace. If only the amount invested in landscaping and introducing state of art activities was also done on proper staff hiring and training, a visit here would have been a great experience."

Chetpet_EcoPark,worldwomantourist,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Simply the Best Park,Wonderful place for picnic with family and friends. Will enjoy the nature so much. The coo breeze makes your mind to relax.
Chetpet_EcoPark,Sriram G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Nice hideout for the City dwellers,"Chetpet, everyone in Chennai knows, ha been one of the prime urban areas with high rises, train station etc. Many even know the spur tank in Chetpet. But a very few have heard of this little paradise called Eco Park in Chetpet. What sounded like a refreshing change from the usual TVs and ipad tablets, turned out to be a truly good one.  Having said that this is just a good start. Cameras like slr ones had to be kept outside (this was a disappointment for me - not sure what they were hiding) and so are plastics.  The park has a lake with boating inside. Anglers can merry in the second half, though you are supposed to put the fish back into the lake. Angling kit is available on rent. Boating is reasonably priced and this where the crowd lies. You have to be patient till your chance arrives. The queues can be longer. The boating experience per se is decent and they gave life buoys to all. Some of the walls are painted with artistic sceneries etc.  The flora and fauna quotient is a bit lacking. All we could see was ducks. They can probably introduce many more species. Congratulations are due to whoever thought through this idea for an eco Park very next to the EMU train station (may be that's why less fauna). Before this eco park, I would have crossed that area a hundred times without getting amused. Now it evokes a feeling of being part of the nature amidst the other unavoidable urbanization in a city whose Air Quality Index is degrading by the day.  Kudos to those good souls to retain this green eco park. "
Chetpet_EcoPark,vasan224,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,green for fitness enthusiasts,"the Chetpet Eco Park is ideal for fitness enthusiasts and those looking for a spot of recreation. Walkers dodge the birds and continue walking, their gazes fixed steadily on the trail beyond."

Once the project is complete with the food stalls, children's play area, fishing point and other infrastructure developments as envisaged this will be one of the best attractions of Chennai. We went there and spent about three hours and the awesome atmosphere was enough to clear the fatigue of three day's continuous work. Though the work of the park is not completed we found several groups, majority were families, during our visit."
