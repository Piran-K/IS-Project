Children_s_Park,PranavKarnik,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,A good experience,"At Rs.20, with the kind of experience you get is with it. There are two parks - snake park and children's park. Both have an entry fees of Rs.20 each. Combined you get see a hell lot of snakes with information, lizards, crocodiles, deers, monkeys, peacocks, birds, emu, jackel, turtle, etc. It's a must visit place with children. Limited food is available outside the parks but since this park is in the city you can make your own plans to have food. "
Children_s_Park,mohit406,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Disappointed bit,"Went snake park to see  king cobra   to our surprise there was none , other snakes were kept in very small area which i felt could use more space.Basically looked a mini zoo with less amenities and space for animals    can spend few hrs  "
Children_s_Park,mani_kalai,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Just a mini zoo,Not much activities for children. Entry tickets  ₹20 for Adults and ₹5 for childrens which is value for Money. It's just a mini zoo with small play area. There are more adults visitors then childrens. And they totally occupying the play area which is meant for childrens. The play area is not. Maintained well and most of them are unsafe for kids. Local park play areas are better here. Except the trees and entry fee nothing special for kids.

Children_s_Park,mdkhaleel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Green patch in a concrete jungle,"          Suddenly it struck my mind to take my granddaughters who were getting bored to children’s park at Guindy, within the city limits of Chennai. We had a nice evening with various animals & birds in enclosures like, langoors (monkeys), Deers, zebra, Turtles, Peacock, EMU,Parrots, lovebirds, Rabbits, varieties of snakes etc. It was sad to notice that lots of enclosures were empty and many were still under construction. There are two or three play areas & children like it very much. More than a children’s park it is a lovers park, as you can see them a lot loitering here & there. Hardly you can spend Two or three hours here, as it is tiring & no other entertainment & empty enclosures. Lot can be done to make it more attractive not only for Children but also for those who accompany them. But not a bad idea to take your children and visitors once in a while away from the busy life in a concrete jungle. Best time is after you leisurely finish your lunch at home, but not in the hot sun."

Children_s_Park,Kaushik G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Couples,Park with few animals,"We had visited this park which is located right beside the Gunidy Snake park during our sightseeing in Chennai. We had to pay 20 rupees ticket per person and 20 rupees for digital camera but the experience was an average one in comparison with the snake park. We found many groups of school children who had come for learning excursion. The park has lots of trees and paved paths to walk around. We found many animal and bird enclosures all over the park containing spotted deer, sambar deer, migratory birds, otter, peacock, owls etc."

Children_s_Park,gausan51,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,Happy memories for children at park,"Children's park is situated at Sardar Patel Road, near Cancer Institute, Chennai and adjacent to Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai. On entering into the park, you can see various kinds of birds in a big encounter; tigers, wolves, parrots, snakes etc., It is the safest place within the city and it is a learning centre for young children. Children can be taken from one counter to another counter by the parents and they can be taught about the habitats of animals, birds, snakes etc., It takes minimum half an hour to one hour to see them and afterwards, the children have the opportunity to play in a park using different kinds of play materials. Elephants are available and after completing the above, we can enter into an area covered fully with trees and plantations etc., In fact even though the area is not much big, it is a very nice place available in the heart of the city and children surely enjoy the trip and we can find them to tell their friends about their wonderful experience in the park. When you come to Chennai, please visit the park along with children and there are plenty of buses coming from all directions and the landmark is Anna University, Gandhi Mandapam, IIT, Cancer Institute."
Children_s_Park,Shanker B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Average zoo for kids to kill some time,"We had finished visiting the Snake Park and since this was just next door - we decided to give the children's park a try. It is a beautifully shaded area with lots of seating and neatly laid paths. There is just a few animals like snakes, deer, monkeys, birds like peacocks, parrots, parakeets, etc. Not too may animals and some of the enclosures are under maintenance. Good place to kill time for about an hour"
Children_s_Park,tripadvicefromjo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015,Some animals left,"You cannot find big animals like tiger,lion, elephant.. This is just the park with some small animals like monkey,deer .. Be careful sometimes monkey is roaming outside. Don't expect anything more here.. This is good place for lovers. "
Children_s_Park,VRAMESH,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,Poorly maintained,Again had a chance to visit children park today. No improvement from the previous visit. Poorly maintained. Not much of animals. Not worth in visiting.

Children_s_Park,Bhargava Krishna,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015,Not so great except Snake Park,Not children's park.I call It is a lovers park. Better to visit only snake park entrance who want to see Snakes & other Birds etc through other Gate.
Children_s_Park,Padma Veeraragh... B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014,Small Park for Kids,"It's a small park next to Adyar Cancer Hospital. The park has small collection of deer, monkeys and other animals. Nothing like the bigger Vandalur Zoo. Not a must see place if you are from outside chennai. "
Children_s_Park,VRAMESH,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015,Nothing for Children,"Guindy National Park, Snake Park and Children park are one and the same. You will see only snakes and little bit of birds inside park. Nothing else."
Children_s_Park,kevinjohn1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Family,Kid's Park,Great place to spend a Sunday evening with kids. The park is located opposite the Anna University and adjacent to the IIT-Madras. As the park is located in the middle of the city and on the main road it is easily accessible from all major parts of the city. There is not a lot of variety when it comes to the animals that the park houses. *Excellent for kids*
Children_s_Park,Traveloney,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Family,Fun for kids,"There are games for kids like swing, slides and see-saw and few more. But everything is old. It looks quite dangerous as if anything may fall or collapse anytime. Owing to the sight of animals and birds around, this will be one of the best place to hang out for kids, if periodically maintained well."

One is for Snake Park another one is entry to the children's park. Both are in same place.Entry ticket to the children park is Rs 20 (adult) Rs 5 / 10 for kids.

Children_s_Park,amulbabyy,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2013 • Family,poorly maintained,"we were in the Chennai children s park last month.The park is really maintained very poor.There was no drinking water inside.Moreover the entire park is littered with lots of plastic materials like water pet bottles,carry bags........etc.There were only few animals and not really that attractive."
Children_s_Park,Vani J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2012 • Family,Very hot and sunny..check if you are in proper clothing before heading,"Place is fun for kids. Nothing much for adults though. Miniature type of a Zoo in the name of children s park. Place can get extremely hot during afternoons. Advisable to wear some clothes which will withstand the heat. Dont forget the coolers, comfortable footwear and plenty of liquids to drink."
Children_s_Park,TPHCJ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2012 • Family,If you are desperate,"If you only have a short time in Chennai, give this one a miss. But if, like us, you are staying in Chennai for an extended time with children, this patch of (mostly) shady outdoor space might be helpful to try out. There are animals kept in appalling cages. But the playground areas are well sized (perhaps the biggest in Chennai?) with swings and climbing frames and slippery dips. There is no grass, it is all sand and mud, so closed in shoes are a good idea.Cheap entry.  One great thing is that it's close to the fabulous library - together they make a great day out with kids in Chennai."
Children_s_Park,Kalpana O,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2011 • Couples,Poor upkeep,So much more can be done to this park to make it more appealing to the children.
Children_s_Park,senthilrajas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2011,Children's paradise,Be there in the evening around 4PM. Just to escape from the hot sun. Worth spending 2 hours  with your little one. Your little one will have lot of fun. i bet. There are lot of small games to play. Animals and birds are good in number.
Children_s_Park,G3ck0-Trav3ll3r,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2011,An example why many Asian zoos have a bad reputation,"The Childrens park was a real eye opener in to what is thought to be suitable housing for animals in some countries.  I naturally judged it by western zoo standards, and this place would without a doubt get shut down in Europe.The enclosures are tiny and inadequate and what we saw of the diets for the primates in particular was also less than adequate.  People were able to get too close to the animals which inevitably meant that many of the primates were fed chocolates and proded through the enclosure fencing.The grounds are a mixed bag of having a couple of beautifully landscaped sections interspersed with crumbling paths badly kept lawns and large areas where rubbish seems to accumulate.Positive Points - It is very cheapNegative Points -Poor quality enclosuresPoor quality facilitiesUnhappy looking animalsVery dirtyVery poor staff presence"
Children_s_Park,Jimm01,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2011,Good day out with children,"For a place to go out with children, this is a good one. if the kids are interested in wildlife, a good starting point to show them some of the deers and birds. Also to have a look at the crocs and otters. The choice of food and drinks are very limited and the condition of some of the play equipments are left to desire. But in the heart of Chennai, you dont have many places for an outdoor activity that will get the kids interested in nature as well.Dont forget to visit the snake park next to it.Remember that phones with cameras will be charged as camera equipment at entry point."
Children_s_Park,Prasanth P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,A nice place for a picnic with kids,"I had been to the Children's park a while back and when I went recently, I was pleasantly surprised as to how much cleaner the place looked now. The park has a mini zoo and lots of space with greenery all around. There is an adjoining snake park which is also worth a visit. Suggest the place for a leisurely picnic - pack your lunch and have it under a tree. Please do not carry anything wrapped in plastic as plastic is not allowed inside. The entrance is free for kids up to the age of 12 years. All persons above 12 years are charged Rs 10. There is also a camera fee."
Children_s_Park,Goutam D,2.0 of 5 bubbles,,Pathetic,"We went to the Children Park inside Guindy National Park. What we saw were Deer, Deer and Deers (kidding). There are some different types of Deers and very few of other category animals/birds. Some of the species which we saw are listed belowSpotted Deers, Barking Deers, Sambar, Wild Dogs, Monkeys, Owl, Pelicans, Tortoise, Crocodile, Parrots, Peacock, White Peacock etc.We had lots of expectation to see Elephants, Chinpanzees, lions etc. Its not maintained well. Please avoid this one. If you just want to relax for some time and your kids will play then its ok. The entry fee is also very less, Rs 10/- per person and kids upto 10 yrs are free to enter. Digital Still camera charge Rs 20/-.From Zoo perspective, Vandalur Zoo is far far better than this."
