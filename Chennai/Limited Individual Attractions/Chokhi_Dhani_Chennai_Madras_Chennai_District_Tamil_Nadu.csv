Chokhi_Dhani,Arul,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Not worth for money,"Recently we visited this place with family and office friends.Not worth for money paid.There are many other good places. The camel ride is the only enjoyable trip and that  is also as too short(> 1 min only) .The roti given is prepared in a unhygienic  environment.The entry ticket also  includes a very small roti,vada & tea.Even small kids(3 years old) are charged 400 Rs .For dinner you need to pay 300 more per head.For adults they charge 500 per head. IF A U ARE A DANCER then U have  platform here but not worth for money paid."
Chokhi_Dhani,satheesh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Lot more needs to be done ,"A place to experience ethnic north Indian culture , rides and culinaries .Apart from experiences they also provide animal rides -camel, horse and bullock cart rides .Songs and dance , magic show and refreshments are also included .But it lacks professional attitude and atmosphere. Some of the workers behave rudely and it hampers the good vibe"
Chokhi_Dhani,Deepali Shah Sarrof,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Management Needs to learn alot about Hospitality,"Our Trip Dated 17-07-2021, while the place itself is good, management is worst - for food is not so good, staff neeeds to learn basic manners and etiquettes on how to treat, food is kept open in display not being closed, saying meals is limited on counter while being served - management should inform its customers beforehanded about it.  very worst service ever"

Chokhi_Dhani,Sarath Babu S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Rajasthan in Chennai ,"Chokhi Dhani is a theme park which gives you the sneak preview of Rajasthan State. I was there with my family including my sister‚Äôs family and we had a gala time.It is off Poonamallee High Road & is very close to Queens Land. There are markers/banners put up & hence you would not miss it.It is advisable to go in your own car or a hired one for the whole duration, if you wanted to stay there till the end & come back because finding a cab at the wee hours is bit difficult.During normal hours, there are buses playing too.The property is vast. They have many entertainment options which is all included in the entrance fee you pay including the food.You will be served with starters as soon as you enter the property. This is unlimited which means you can have it for as many times as you like.The dinner will be a buffet & will be served after 7. The items are numerous. All are Rajasthani food. You would love it for sure."

Chokhi_Dhani,Aarosri,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Never visit this place, particularly with children","Experience of children went to this place for a school field trip to this place.Class 3, 4 and 5 students went for a field trip to chokhi dhani on 28th. 22 teachers went and no nanny was sent. By lunchtime, the school teacher was taken to a different dining hall and the students were left alone in another hall for lunch. Chowkidhani person locked the room and hit kids with toilet pipe, sticks to beat cattle and boys were pushed and slapped. My son's left hand has a mark of an iron rod. He screams while changing dress also. The manager had made 4 boys from my son's class to drink animal urine, few 5th-grade girls complained of bad touch to the management. The kids escaped from the room and were chased and hit in the open area at chokhi dhani. Later after eating lunch is when the 22 teachers came.One of the workers hit a kid's hand with a hard pvc blue pipe he has blood clots everywhere and he had slapped him in ears and pushed. He is crying with a terrible ear pain and a small bleeding is there. the kid is on treatment now.A boy from class 3 b  the guy strangled the kid's neck.3 girls have fractured their legs 5 girls from class 5 molested 2 boys are having head injury these are the major injuries, rest of the kids have injuries with blood clots in legs shoulder etc. School management at 8 in the evening on the same day sent msgs sorry for the inconvenience caused and serious action was taken against chokhi dhani. The next day all the parents went to school police arrested the manager."
Chokhi_Dhani,PTG1976,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Chokhi Dhani - an ethnic place to hangout,"The place is located on a vast piece of land and hence gives visitors freedom from the usual claustrophobia they experience while visiting locales in the city. One gets the feeling of having gone back in time and visiting a village carnival. The attractions such as a parrot astrologer are so common in every part of India that one's nostalgia is kindled upon re-experiencing such long-lost experiences. The short-eats and the sit-down dinner were fabulous. It is a worthy place, though a bit far from the city."

Chokhi_Dhani,Sdey1986,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Awesome outing place in outskirts of Chennai,"Once entered you will get a Rajasthani feel from the ambiance to food.Pros:1. Good Place for a day's outing.2. Food is good, lot of variety.3. Camel, horse cart ride, boating4. Folk dance, free mehendi.5. Small shops for marketing.Cons:1. Need your own vehicle.2. Snacks food quantity is less.Tip:  Choose your package wisely. Avoid holidays"
Chokhi_Dhani,vaibhav m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,superb buffet at night,worth the money you spend. kids will enjoy. nothing like this in chennai. no one seems to be exploited (what better were they doing in rajasthan or MP either ways)
Chokhi_Dhani,Rajagopal S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good place,"Long drive from our house but worth the drive. Especially for kids. Really enjoyable time. Actually a very nice concept overall. Guys in the billing counter could have explained us better. Initially they told the food is different for each package but that wasn't the case. We unnecessarily got 750 RS tickets for our parents who can't go on any rides. Could have got the 600rs tickets for them. Guys in the counter should be able to explain this to you instead of milking money from you.One more thing. Everywhere it says - avoid tips but everywhere we had to give tips. For example the dancers. They weren't coming to dance with us and we're expecting tips once they came and danced. Same with others like that magic guy. It's ok to give tips but that board is unnecessary I guess. Kids loved camel ride and horse rides. To finish it, food was awesome. Nice and quick service. "
Chokhi_Dhani,rashmi k,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,"Dusty, expensive but enjoyable",we had been to this place on a sunday and hence it was very crowded. We felt it was a bit expensive. Unlimted snacks was tasty. camel ride was enjoyable. DInner was the highlight. Had a good time dancing with folk dancers. Other than this nothing actually was impressive. People/staff are very money minded and ask for money for everything.
Chokhi_Dhani,nirav s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Weekend visit,A real nice place for an ideal family weekend outing. Includes good food and lot of activities to choose from. It has choices for kids to adults. A must visit

Food is ok. Serving and dining room was very nice.  +veGood place for time pass for different experience.Welcome drink and few starters was good.Dance was good and kind tooExcellent for photo shoot. Kulfi was good and head massage too. Paneer and sweet roti was tasty (served politely )- ve Dinner is not perfect for south indians taste.no spice (but paneer was tasty)Roti (starter) starter was hard.Boating is fine but the water is unclean looks muddy.Drinking water was little bit salty even though chill"
Chokhi_Dhani,Manoj Bokaria,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Overall good,"This place offers some activities like horse riding, camel riding, chariot, bullock cart, puppet show, magic,boating, rajasthani folk dance n much more. We went there around 6pm and spent around 4 hours,good for kids.Food was average, they serve rajasthani cuisine. Good for groups and families. "
Chokhi_Dhani,monitrathore,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Traditional,"Visited this place for celebrating mom's birthday. There's nothing much to see here. It's a replica of the ancient deserts of Thar, which you won't feel like. When I went inside, the start was good but later, I got bugged. Can't stay here for more than two hours. Food was totally Rajasthani, not my type. But you sure can visit this place ONCE, for those camel rides & bullock rides & mini-boating & tobacco-based hookah & so on."
Chokhi_Dhani,Praveenop,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,A place with lots of potential but held back due to mis management,This place can actually be a hub of entertainment but the management started this venture with a great idea but somewhere the place did not match up to my expectation. The vision seem to be fantastic but  the result and the vision seem to be far away from each other but there is hope...... If the management wakes up and give the management to a professional set up it will work out well for all.
Chokhi_Dhani,Carol Ephrem C,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Worst experience at Choki Dhani, they fooled me","Thinking that Choki Dhani is a restaurant I went there at 8 pm, After payment I came to know I was too late & can cover 40% of the things there (as per original plan). Atleast they could have explained this to me on my arrival that its too late to cover everything. I was fooled, really upset. money minded people. Never prefer, so costly & cheaters too.Food taste is not that good, magician borrowed money from me forcefully, Guide too asking tip. Dont go here"
Chokhi_Dhani,Wilson J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Kind of okay,Amazing place to hangout with friends and family. Kids will enjoy. Went there with my and cousin's family. All the kids enjoyed the place and rides. But far from the city but worth going there. Reasonable price. Shopping inside the place had good Rajasthani collections. Camel ride was good. The tall guy standing at the entrance was a good entertainment.
Chokhi_Dhani,Maruthi A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good time spent with family,"Travelling here for the third time. Good weekend get out for people in Chennai which is an hour's drive away. Offers a variety of entertainment and rides basednon the package you choose. It could be pretty much crowded on a weekend or holidays. The food is excellent  and offers varieties of Rajasthani dishes. Ideal for vegetarians and those who love vegetarian food. If you are looking to spend 3-4 hours away from Chennai and bored of malls and beaches, this place  is for sure worthy of a visit. It opens only at 4pm and the dinner (Thali) starts at 6 30 pm. Make sure to buy the appropriate package based on your need and not what they offer"
Chokhi_Dhani,Soumya Ranjan Satpathy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,many rides and food with less cost,"this place is good for half day visit. you can find many rides like horse ride,camel ride, cart ride within the campus. But the food they are offering is not Rajastani style, i felt like south indian food.overall experinece was good."
Chokhi_Dhani,Anand Subbu,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Great place, excellent ambience, unique experience, BUT","The place gives you a very unique experience of Rajasthani culture. There is folk singing, dancing (and Ghoomer!), magic show, camel and bullock rides, chariot rides and many more to entertain both kids and adults. An excellent way to spend the evening, and to experience the rustic atmosphere. Now, as to the 2 star rating, it is because of the following:a) The food - while the taste was pretty okay, the service is pathetic. There is no cutlery; it is served in thin silver foiled plates and paper cups. The dining halls were stinking with bad odour. For the money you shell out, this is a total no-no. b) The Khichidi and sambar rice were COLD! Ever imagine eating authentic Rajasthani khichidi which isn't hot? It was a let down. When asked, the staff were not polite and mocked the guests aloud about serving hot curd rice. So much for good service...c) Cleanliness was lacking around the food stalls. The staff were using unwashed hands to serve customers. The kulfi stall will especially make you wince, since it lacked the basic hygiene -- the staff using a dagger to open the ice candies with bare hands in a dingy and dark place outside in the park!d) Lastly, the ticket counter charges Rs. 10 extra per ticket if you are paying by credit or debit card. At a point where the whole of India is moving towards digitization, it seems the folks at Choki Dhani want to penalize people who do so."
Chokhi_Dhani,sarathy s,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Choki Dhani - Not for Food lovers,"this is my second visit to this place after a gap of 6 years. Nothing a bit has changed on the rides. they are equally comfortable and enjoyable. What we were taken back is on the food . A lip smacking Rajasthani cuisine serving was oru craving and expectancy ( like the first time we visited). Our craving was put to grave and the offering is not something to recollect. It was new for a foodie like me to know that sambar rice / curd rice /  kerala papad  were added to rajasthani cuisine. Adding to the slip was oil soared puri , 6 small servings of eatable small bites that were failing to tingle our taste buds,. Outright it was a not a worth try in visiting CD for a lip smacking Rajasthani cuisine and the best option is to taste it else where but for CD. our 450 rupees had been drained as kalapani  ."
Chokhi_Dhani,Aswin K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Below average,Rides and starters are very good. Dinner provided is below average and not in Rajasthan style. Can visit only once but not recommended frequent visits
Chokhi_Dhani,mannaiprak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Northy Feel in chennai,"After reading reviews went for this place on new year eve on 31st Dec'17. One more reason for this choice for new year celebrations is that this is closer to my home, just 5 min drive.As mentioned in reviews, right from the spacious parking lot to 5 different chats, good quality buffet of north indian and south indian food - highlight being that it is of Pure Veg which is very rare nowadays.Also there were many cultural programs going on which we can attend like rajasthani dance, rope walking, magic show, DJ etc. Also the architectural finesse of rajasthani has been captured well right through the place. Nice place to chill out with friends and family, though am not sure it will be of the same during other days of the year too."
Chokhi_Dhani,Compulsive Traveler,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Good, but Not quite the original ","Having experienced the excellence of the original Chokhi Dhani in Jaipur and the Pune establishment, we were really looking forward to a repeat at Chennai this time. Whether it was the new year eve or something else that I couldn‚Äôt lay my finger on, I came away a tad disappointed. Infrastructurally, it nearly matches the other two with all attractions in place. They have the full complement of animal rides (Camel, Horse, Bullock Cart) and cultural performances (Traditional dance and folk songs).However, in terms of the variety and quality of snacks offered, it is not at par. The main course, though, comes close to the original. The famed Rajasthan ‚Äúkhatirdari‚Äù was on full display.The performances also lacked the energy seen in other branches, perhaps because of the sheer fatigue of entertaining over 2500 guests in one evening.However, the venue still offers one of the best showcases of Rajasthani village life in the South.Definitely worth a visit for those who want to experience the magic of Rajasthan in an evening."
Chokhi_Dhani,Rucha121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Experience Culture of Rajasthan in Chennai,"Its a theme-style resort-cum-restaurant, where visitors can get to experience the rich culture and heritage of Rajasthan in form of dance, food, art, craft, games and activities. They offer 1-day package with rates differing for adults and child and entry tickets are costlier on weekends. Good place to enjoy with family and friends. Tariff is on higher side."
Chokhi_Dhani,YashiR25,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Mini Rajasthanin Chennai,"Went here in June. Those who want to experience Rajasthan in Chennai, it's a place for them. From the camel safari to the traditional welcome; from the food to the ambience, from pot-making to welcome drink, everything is amusing and authentic Rajasthani.Staff is courteous but a bit greedy for the tips. Besides, booking a cab (Ola/Uber) back from there is very difficult. So, better go by your own car/or book a cab in advance to avoid the hassle. Else like we did, Fasttrack is always available :DOverall. recommended at least for one visit. Nice place to spend time with your crazy group :D But it is situated too far from main city. The tour can be clubbed with visiting QueensLand Water Park as it is nearby only (Though, I have not been there)."
Chokhi_Dhani,SRIKAKOLAPU,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,depicts rajasthani culture,Go if you are staying in chennai and want to have a taste of rajasthani culture and I dont recommend this for tourists from a different place as there are lot other things to cover in chennai and time will be a constraint if you come for this.
Chokhi_Dhani,sarjujm,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Traditional location ,Good location to go along with kids Queues on the ride so wait for long on the weekend and holidaysTraditional food and variety If rain makes your life terrible Rides are goodDrinks are available in few points Quite far from city Little high cost per head

Chokhi_Dhani,Sriramseshan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Rajasthani Village in Chennai,Ample car parking.Entrance fee is slightly costly and some ride were not taken as per the token issued. Chennai people may like to have a long camel ride but all the rides were short distances.Initial starters were good.Better to be in the place by 4pm and book dinner time as 730pm is very ideal.Food served is good but not great. Very difficult to sit down and eat with the table provided.Very cramped seating arrangements.The dining hall staff were courtesy.Best place to relax with kids and one time can be visited. There is no charm for repeat visit.Some staff shows indifferent attitude( lethargic ).
Chokhi_Dhani,Sasikumar C,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Very bad attitude of staff, poor management, zero hospitality.","on 12th August i went with my family to this place for the 1st time. at the entrance we were impressed the welcome dance. we booked for a INR 800.00/person package. it was  little raining that evening at 6.00pm later it stopped at 6.45pm. Once you purchase the ticket the staff attitude changes. It is 15 acers theme park, they have quiet a few spots were you interact with their staffs. The traditional dancers, the pot maker were very kind with all the visitors. But the staff at all the rides are very arrogant, they 1st denied ride saying because the soil is wet there is no Horse and camel ride. we were told to take bullock cart ride. Then i went to the reception counter to complain. the manager said it is raining and they cannot have the ride. but actually it was not raining then. I kept insisting to start the ride. the manager was with no care attitude. then i had to raise voice in front of the incoming guest thus the manager told me to go the spot and he will start the ride. I came back to the ride location the boy over there told me. he cannot start the ride. i have taken my little son only to have camel ride, so i went back to the manger, who came with me and told the boys over there to start the ride. After 40 mints of struggle i succeeded in getting a camel ride of 2 mins for my son. We went happily to this place to enjoy but all that we got was only irritations after paying them. Food was very average.The most annoying part is there are many child labour engaged on job.If the service remains same, they may get one timers but nobody will repeat."
Chokhi_Dhani,Jemima S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Dancing,Well setup theme which really gives the feel of rajasthani village. Good things around to take clicks. But food can be improved. Enjoyed the rajasthani dance.

Chokhi_Dhani,Sarath Babu S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Indulge in Rajasthan,"Chokhi Dhani is situated in the outskirts of Chennai. It is very close to Queensland and Sriperumbudur. The place is a perfect family outing spot since it is situated on a sprawling open ground and you need to spend atleast 5-6 hours to enjoy all the fun it has to offer.You can travel on camel, bullocks among others. There is also a boat ride but it is not open always. You would also get to see magic show, traditional dance apart from other games like shooting, ring throw.You can also get your head massage done. You would be served welcome drink and dinner. All these are included in the package.To summarise, it is a perfect fun destination which will not cost much but gives you the ultimate pleasure. Advisable to go in the evening."

It was a unique experience for me, as I had never been to Rajasthan before. The location was a bit far, but we reached there by taxi at evening.The set up was amazing and we had a nice time. We spent around 4 hours at this place. It was awsome !!"
Chokhi_Dhani,Savitha V,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Not worth the cost of package,"1. Rides:The place is not worth the cost they charge, there are camel rides, horse rides and bullock cart rides available but they are just for 10 to 15 ft's distance.They charge extra for camel safari, it just goes some extra distance that's all.For kids above 3 yrs, they are charging 450, 550, 600, including dinner, how many 3 yrs and 4 yrs will eat full thali, they can reduce amount for kids.2. Refreshments:snacks are good, but drinking water is cooled corporation water, water bottle should be bought at extra cost, for 25Rs bottle they charge 30 Rs.3. Rest Room:No proper lights, water is dripping, the heath wash doesn't work.4. Dinner:Its rajastani cusine so south Indians will not like it, they serve in some order chapathi and poori first and then later only if everybody in the square has eaten they provide rice, since my son dint like the chapathi I asked for white rice, they declined serving it. They said only after serving sambar rice and pulav they will serve white rice itseems.3 persons served for our square, all wore gloves but still they served in left hand the chapathi's and poori's, even rice, which was so horrible.I heard comment from everybody in the square was "" we should have some idly on the way to home"".we have sit cross legged for dinner, even though there is cusion, how will elders sit down, they should have some provision for them atleast.5. The persons who put mehandi asks for tips, the cart riders asks for tips..if you don't give they say something in hindhi."

Chokhi_Dhani,YatriForever,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016,Fun for kids !,"Those who have seen/experienced other Choki Dhanis in North would be bit disappointed with this. I was disappointed with the quality and variety of the food; which comes as part of the entry package. The kids had fun with the rides. Our friends who were visiting Chokhi Dhani for the first time wee excited with the glimpse of the Rajasthani dress, style and other grameen stuff. It does take about 3 hours, so best to book the dinner time accordingly. In summers, later the better. "
Chokhi_Dhani,Naveen J N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,NOT a Must see attraction!!,"Choki Dhani originally having their branches only in Northern India / Maharashtra etc., branched out to the South India in recent years.Chennai was one such location.Concept is to mostly display the Rajasthani culture, mostly folk culture & to an extent it is successful. Architecture does resemble the Forts, Village houses that you get to see in Rajasthan, Gujarat or Haryana states in India. You do get to see the traditional cooking styles, pottery making, Folk dances, Rituals etc. There are different ticket prices / ticket structures based on the no. of attractions you opt for.There is a basic level ticket where in you can go inside watch everything, have dinner at the end.Then there are higher priced tickets where you get to go on camel rides, bullock cart rides, play few games etc., Typically highest priced ticket covers all attractions.Dinner & snacks is covered in all the tickets, so never stop from eating your heart out since that was the biggest attraction as far as I was concerned!! ÔÅäI had paid for the highest priced tickets. One has to select your dinnertime before hand‚Ä¶. This is done may be to avoid large crowds at one point of time.So, you get inside with a traditional tilak on your forehead. A guide will accompany you through the session.If you are a bigger group or pay for higher price tickets, you get a dedicated guide for your group.There is a small water pond for a 2 min. fun boating (Peddle boats). Then you get to see local village magician, traditional pottery making, Folk dances etc.You can get some designer mehendi (Henna) on your hands if interested. Further there are camel, horse, bullock cart & horse chariot rides.Then there are fun games like shooting, archery etc., similar to what you see in the Village melas‚Ä¶ or if you have watched old hindi movies with Mela scenes then you know what I m talking about here!The only thing I might recommend or ask you not to miss is the Head massage. Cools your body & mind‚Ä¶ ensures a good nights‚Äô sleep ÔÅäIn between all these activities you get to taste some local snacks & drinks (Non-alcoholic & healthy ÔÅä ) like jalebi, gulab jal, Bhajjis, miniature rotis etc. all cooked in traditional vessels & stoves. There are few small shop setups selling handmade articrafts‚Ä¶ Though they were attractive, I found them pricey.After you are done will all the above stuff, it‚Äôs time for dinner!I have to tell that I was bit disappointed. After what I paid for the ticket, I was expecting something extravagant‚Ä¶. At least some where close to the Rajdhani Thali!!But there are limited items on the menu.. they do taste good & authentic, satisfy the taste buds to certain extent. I have to tell you that there were few Expats with us who thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, as everything was new & exciting for them.It was not the same for us‚Ä¶ So interpretations might differ based on your personal experience.How to reach : Plenty of buses running from Chennai Koyamedu Bus stand, T. Nagar, Tambaram etc. to Sriperumbadur. Take an AC bus run by Chennai MTC to beat the heat & get down at Thandalam bus stop.It‚Äôs a 5 min. walk from Thandalam bus stop. There are no trains‚Ä¶ Else, just take a cab from where ever you are in Chennai. Ubers, Olas or any other local taxi services will drop you here.P.S : Restrooms are not well maintained, you may skip this place unless you are going to burst soon!!Overall it‚Äôs an average experience for me‚Ä¶ Nothing to lose if you skip this place!"
Chokhi_Dhani,AR-RENG,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Ok for one time visit,The place is good to visit for one time. Not that much great and also the food served is just average. Need to go as a group otherwise bit boring.
Chokhi_Dhani,Vijay S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Beautiful concept spoiled by 'tip hungry' staff,"The concept is beautiful. The place is done up well. The food is good...tasty and hygienic. Activities (rides, dances, magic shows etc.) are good, but the staff who facilitate these are always hungry for tips. They go on with their 'Ram Ram' after every activity. If this is the case, why does Chokhi Dhani charge an 'inclusive' price for these activities?My thought process is this...when I have paid the money for a particular package, I am looking for a decent experience. I want to smile and say a respectful 'Thank You' to every performer / staff who is trying to make our evening enjoyable. But the moment the staff / performer starts with her / his 'Ram Ram' when they are not supposed to, the entire respect goes for a toss, and I just want to leave that place without even looking at their eyes.Everywhere there are boards clearly mentioning 'No Tips Please'...then why do these performers / staff expect tips for everything they do? And why is the management not monitoring and doing something about these greedy individuals (right from the activities facilitators to the dining hall staff) who are bringing a bad name to the place."
Chokhi_Dhani,He Makes All Things Beautiful,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,GOOD attraction spoiled by the staff over there.,"The attraction is near Queensland theme park not very far from chennai. The entrance welcomes you saying parking at owner's risk .Mgmt is not able to provide proper security for your vehicles. Reception staff are neither enthusiastic nor friendly to receive  you. Have a village type environment neatly planned .Maintained well. Lawns are dry, may be improved.Rates are bit high. Hospitality is very poor.They provide five varieties of snacks in addition to a welcome drink of jeera water. The snacks will be given as per the token given. Snacks qty is less but of ok taste.The left out snacks were lying in the area as proper cleaning not available to remove the left out snacks from that area. The facilty has lot of attractions. But main worry is that they will do the task if only you show them the currency. Everywhere no tips board is available. But why every staff is asking for money from you with authority. May be they may provide a begging vessel to every employee . Really poor discipline among the staff  and no control over them. The rides were not free. Staff taking money directly  for the ride. we have horse, camel rides along with carts drawn by camel, horse and bullocks. Good experience and children enjoy a lot.No proper guidance. The artists will perform on request but will request for some tips by their gesture.Felt embarrasment by everyone over there by their gesture. These things will definitely spoil the environment. The food was served in a hall in Rajasthani style. Food was nice and varieties were few. However it was tasty. Management may look into the discipline of the staff. During evening time you can spend leisurely in few locations for  a family chat. Proper seating arrangements may be given."

Chokhi_Dhani,Pavan16,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,"Nice attractions, average food !","We 3 couples with 3 kids visited Chokhi Dhani recently. We really enjoyed the various attractions. The kids had a good time with came ride, bullock card ride, pot making, etc. The boat ride was small. Its a nice place to spend 3-5 hrs when in large group. Some of us also enjoyed driving the cycles, hair oil massage, parrot fortune teller, etc. However, the fun did not lasted long when it came to food and service during food. The food served was not really hot, variety was limited, servers very just keen to complete their job quickly and without even waiting for your response used to fill plates and if you request for something they felt very hesitant. Even some of the starters got finished before we reached for food at 7:30 !!! The food experience was very bad during our visit. However, we had fun with the other activities and the kids really enjoyed !!!"

Basically you can have Rajasthani food and they have added a few activities like camel, horse and bullock cart rides for you to pass time. There are also few Rajasthani dance, magic etc to give the feel. Overall it becomes a disappointment when you have to shell out Rs 800/- per head for this. It's Ok for somebody who has never seen any northern village/town. Food was good and filling."

Chokhi_Dhani,kathan5,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Mini Rajasthani Village @ Chennai,"Chokhi Dhani - a good place for a weekend evening time. A good ethnic village depicting the heritage and authenticity of Rajasthanis. You need to be a little early to spend and utilise maximum time as in weekends you get decent crowds. Kids will enjoy the place as they have several activities like bullock cart ride, horse ride, camel ride, mud pot making, butter churning etc. You will have a crowd who will never follow queue, they will make all their kids sit and then even the mom will sit, in fact the pot maker only makes everything and only for photo sake he will make one to keep the hands close by the pot making wheel. Cultural dance was good, people join along with the dancer and make the movements was more lively.The entire place was clean and decent. They say everywhere NO TIPS, but everywhere tips is expected. Food served was good but not the wide range of choice like the rajdhani way. Taste is good. Clean food serving area. Seating was good. Rajasthani photography was good, wearing their ethnic dresses and taking pics, but very expensive. One print costs 250/-. Go early and enjoy. Being late will surely disappoint you. Ensure you have atleast 3-4 hours to spend here. Worth a spend for a weekend getaway."

Chokhi_Dhani,gausan51,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Visit a Rajsthani village in Chennai,"While I had been to Jaipur during 2001, I had the opportunity to visit CHOKI DHANI near Jaipur. Nowadays many youngsters who are from city atmosphere do not know the habits and functions of villagers and the their traditions. I enjoyed for more than four hours and at Chennai recently I visited the CHOKI DHANI along with my family members. It is situated in the main national highway from Chennai to Bangalore next to Queens land. On an average it is twenty kilometres from the heart of the city and from the main road the village is available at a distance of two kilometres and sufficient parking place is available. For the inforamtion of the visitors, they have established various pavillions and various types of traditional dances are performed by the efficient dancers from Rajasthan. We can have a nice tea along with some snacks. We can have a bullock cart ride; camel ride and we can also play some games - like baloon shooting; ball hitting and many more. Ladies can wear rajasthani dresses and take attractive photographs and people will really believe that they are from Jaipur or Udaipur. One man is walking on a rope from this end to that end duly supported by bands. Still many more are available like - fire dance, fire drill etc., Dinner is provided as per Rajasthani style and the food as per Rajasthani menu is provided and we can see people enjoy the food like anything. The village is open by 4.00 P.M. and by night it looks a typical village only on account of minimum lighting and it takes minimum five hours to viisit the maximum places in the village. Do not forget to visit the village while you come to Chennai and you can tell your relatives as if you had visited a village in Rajasthan."

The service is also very good.Tips:Go early in the evening to this place so that you can enjoy before it gets crowded.Weekdays are more crowded as usual. Going early on a weekday would make this more pleasant.Don't eat too many small rotis that are given in various huts as this may spoil the dinner appetite :)Visit this place without any expectations and you will be more than happy!"

The place is perfectly built to replicate such an experience and has people from Rajasthan to run the show. Although public announcements could be made in English or Tamil to benefit the non-Hindi speaking crowd. The best part of the experience is the dinner bhojan in a typical dining hall where you get to sit on the ground (on cushions) while they serve typical Rajasthani cuisines on your place. The rates are nominal considering the food and the rides that comes along with it. Nothing comparable to theme parks but nonetheless a different experience indeed."

A grand welcome of drums and traditional bindi before you arrive at the ticket office was a nice touch. Ticket prices vary depending on the package you choose. We chose one of the mid range option which included 5 rides and dinner. You are provided with a guide throughout your time inside except during dinner time. Children (and the adults) enjoyed various animal rides, Camel, Horse, bull cart and camel cart. The highlight for us was the live music and the various folk dances on small stages. When the sun sets for the day, the lantern style lights transform the place into something magical. The restaurant was very nicely decorated and seating arrangements were very good.

Folks dancers are the best and mesmerizing. Puppet show is amazing. Kids enjoyed the camel ride. My daughter saw camel for the first time and she had a blast. Care takers were gentle and did not torture the animal with long rides. I did not care for the boat ride. Dinner was superb and almost has dream like feel in the restaurent; ambience with folk singers and art work is simply hard to shake it off from my mind.

Mehendi.. Massages.. Puppet shows.. Animal rides.. Artificial caves.. Boating... Etc.. The dinner however is the only let down. Not really authentic rajdhani food.

Once we reached the place, we realized that we were in a different world. We were welcomed by the traditional drummers of Rajasthan and we entered the fort. You have three packages to choose fro and the primary difference is on the rides. Children under the age of 12 would really enjoy. The winter weather was a welcome change from the heat and humidity of Chennai.It took me back to my childhood days while watching the street shows, rope walk......which most of the urban kids never get to see.  Traditional snacks and drinks can be had from various counters within the premises and they are all part of the package. The various rides available are on horse, camel, bullock car and camel cart. It was nice to also see the ""Parrot"" Astrologer. At the farther end of the venue is the dining area where dinner is served. Its traditional Rajasthani vegetarian food and it was fantastic.I'm of the opinion that this venue is not suitable for people who can't walk for long and surely not suitable for people on wheel chair.."
Chokhi_Dhani,BIJU_SAIL,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,High Expectations but returned disappointed,"Had a opportunity to experience Rajasthani Food and Culture during one of my visits to Ahmedabad , which had filled my heart . Had such high expectations after reading through various reviews about Chokhi Dhani . Finally on the Day of Christmas ,we a group of 12 had visited Chokhi Dhani which was closed to 30 Kms from Chetpet . There was heavy crowd at the reception/Ticket area which could have been well organised and also could have placed few more staff at the welcoming point which unfortunately had only one person . Tickets were priced between 450 to 700 (approx) . We had requested for camera to be taken but were advised that mobile cameras are allowed but professional cameras will be allowed at an non-refundable amount of Rs.5000 , which i think is unjustified since now a days modern mobile cameras have better resolution than professional cameras .The Village was well organized with complimentary Snacks like Chats etc. Also had good entertainments for children like Pottery , Magic Show , Games etc. Also had animal rides like camel and bullock cart, was totally shocked by the way the Bullocks were treated by its rider. He had not given the animal any rest as was trying to accommodate more people beyond its limit. Had to request the management to advise the rider to give the animals rest , which they readily did.There were two dinner options  Buffet and Table , we had opted for the table at 21.45 slot.The tables were spread in four rooms  , we had to wait for 30 mins after entering into the dining area going from one room to another to find seat for all twelve of us to sit together . Waiting out side the rooms were like we were waiting to be served free food . Finally at the Dinner table was disappointed since it was no were close the food that i had tasted in the past , the food served had a more of Tamilnadu touch than of Rajasthani . In All except for the Dinner ,rest of the Activities at the Village was worth Visiting."

My kid enjoyed camel ride, horse ride, boating, etc. The highlight is food and the dining hall. We all had great fun."
Chokhi_Dhani,Dev S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,A relaxing experience,"I have been here twice with family. So that explains how much I love the place. Kids love the ambience and village like setup. It is an entire village that has been re-enacted. It is like going to a village fair, with bullock carts, camel rides, horse rides etc. There are other fun activities too and a great place to click lovely pictures.The one thing that amazes you is the food and the way it is served to you. Everyone literally feeds you in your mouth!! They never cringe when you ask for additional portions. They wait for you to ask, and sometimes even when you don‚Äôt ask. In short, the hospitality is fantastic."
