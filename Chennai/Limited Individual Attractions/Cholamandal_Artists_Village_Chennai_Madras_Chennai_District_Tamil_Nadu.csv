Cholamandal_Artists_Village,sinan ertay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,Hidden treasure for art lovers and artists,"It was my first week in Chennai. I was looking for interesting places to visit by trip advisor and similar applications. I read the reviews about Cholamandal Artists’ Village and I searched photos in order to have a better idea, Scores and reviews were good, but not so interesting. Firstly google map sent us to a rich man’s big farm. When we found the correct address of the village, there was nobody but only two responsibles (one of them can talk English), lovely dogs in the garden and a two layers medium size gallery with beatiful paintings. The wonderful surprise started when I asked the possibility to meet up with one of the artists who was living in the village. The artist Latha Gopal was the daughter of one of the artist founders (K.S. Gopal) of the village. We learned from her the wonderful story of the village. She gave detailed informations about the paintings and their pioneer painters, also her painting. She also showed us the queen of the trees in the garden: wonderful “Banyan Tree”. Some important informations about the village: you can buy very important paintings exposed in the gallery (not in the museum) starting with the prices of 2000 euros. Daily rent of the exposition gallery is around 40 euros (area is far from the city but the place is so meaningful). Free drawing workshops on Sundays 10h-14h. This village is one of the centers of Madras Movement: contemporary step in Indian painting and sculpture. Besides, Madras (Chennai) Fine Art School is öne of the oldest fine art institutes of İndia. Entrance is less than 1 euro/person. Thank you Latha that you showed us some part of the hidden treasure in Cholamandal."

Filled with greenery International sculpture park welcomed us, followed by museum. Paying an entry fee we admired a great deal of paintings. From there we walked to Grand Oriole and then proceeded towards Japanese museum. An ideal spot for art lovers and sculptures. A unique spot to experience silence."

Cholamandal_Artists_Village,divgic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Unique Indian modern art collectoiin.,"I am not a modern art fan.  The art here, however, blew me away - it was so evocative of what I believe to be India that it made me aware of the socio-political contexts of art.  The museum itself is so unassuming that it's easy to pass it by.  But it's become a highlight of my Madras experience, and I will re-visit with friends (my friends from Spain were impressed too) whenever I can."

If you have no inclination for ART- better skipLocated off the main road and on the ECR Road, it is set up in a very peaceful environment. There is a small entrance fee to the main museum.  The artifacts and paintings are worth once a look. Lot of contemporary works in display. There are some books and souvenirs that one can buy too."

Cholamandal_Artists_Village,Eric G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,A Collective Exhibition of South Indian Modern Art,"On my way back to Chennai from Dakshin Chitra museum, I went here. I like modern art so I did enjoy my visit. Sample works by contemporary artists are exhibited here. Almost half of the exhibit is permanent (called ""the museum""), and the other half is temporary and the works are on sale (called ""the gallery""). Most or some of the artists live around the gallery, within the ""art village"" but it is not easy to visit them. It seems there are no ""open door"" days and hours when the public may visit their studios."

Cholamandal_Artists_Village,Atul G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,For those who enjoy modern art,This artists’ village displays modern and abstract paintings and sculptures from India. I very much enjoyed perusing the works on displays and it is definitely worth seeing if you are interested in the art scene from India. The pieces are well-presented and there is plenty of information about the different artistic movements throughout the 20th century and some of their most prominent artists. Outside their is a small sculpture park that is less interesting as most of your time is better spent indoors. It isn’t a big complex at all and can easily be covered in around an hour if you see it comfortably. Definitely one to see for art enthusiasts.

You can also purchase few paintings starting from 5000/- INR to 60,000/-INR  :) Not that big ,you can easily cover all in 1hrs to 2 hrs Ticket 30rs for adults and below 5 year kids are freeAbout Place-Cholamandal Artists' Village, established in 1966, is the largest artists' commune in India. Its artists are credited for the Madras Movement of Art (1950s–1980s), which brought modernism to art in South India. Their work is widely recognized as some of the best art produced in postwar India and is shown regularly in galleries across the country. Several Cholamandal artists have also shown in Europe, the United States and South America.In the village Injambakkam, 9 km from Chennai, India, it has over 20 resident painters and sculptors, who live as a community and pool their skills. They run the Artists Handicrafts Association, a cooperative which manages the village and sale of works through the permanent exhibition at the complex, which includes paintings, sketches, terra-cotta/stone/metal sculptures, batiks and handicrafts etc., making the village a self-supporting entity"
Cholamandal_Artists_Village,RAJKUMAR A,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,"Not for general public, Strictly! ","This place should not have been made a public attraction. Unless you have extreme interest towards art or you're an ardent artist, this place is a complete disaster. Don't waste your time and money by visiting this place. There's absolutely nothing here other than paintings and stones or statues. "
Cholamandal_Artists_Village,Krzysztof N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Better than I expected,"It is a kind of open-air museum with many examples of Indian architecture and village houses. You can also see here how sari is made, pottery, etc. The best part for me was surprisingly short videos presented in few places. That way man can learn about ordinary life in Indian home, family hierarchy, duties, privileges, etc. The museum is not offensive regarding number of details and site layout - very friendly from that side."
Cholamandal_Artists_Village,Dilip S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Where I Learnt Lot,"The 10th December , 2016 is the date we will never forget . On this day we first visited Dakshin Chitra and then very fortunate to visit Cholamandal an Artists’ Village brainchild of K C S Paniker , eminent painter and visionary who dreamt of an art Indian in spirit and world wide contemporary .  The place we visited was not a village , it was a multum in parvo , telling the story of the strength and the weakness of present day Indian art .  Thirty painters and sculptures acquired 3.5 ha of land 8 km south of Adyar  on then muttukadu road in 1965 to start the Village in order to rehabilitate the creative artists . Here the artists paints or sculpts through the major part of the day and earns through the sale of his art . The Village is perhaps the first of its kind anywhere in the world . On 1st feb 2009 , the Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art consisting of the K C S Paniker Museum of the Madras Movement , two commercial A C gallaries , Labernum and Indigo , and an open air international sculptures park surrounding the complex was inaugurated . Here we could revisit Paniker . The notion of a three dimensional linear space that the Renaissance  painters advanced and which they applied in the rule of perspective , and the pure theory of it which the cubists abstracted later on are to date the only technically sound solutions to the issue between drawing and picture . Paniker was one who would not submit his subject to received theory in its applied or pure form . Rather than relent Paniker broke off and set out arguing his own case . He made his departure in the landscape , the genre he used extensively for developing his arguments . Instead of solidifying the free space with the straight line structure of perspective or with regular blocks of colour , he made it into a fluid thing held up with a distribution of highly accented , broken and curling lines . The irregular edges of colour that one gets as a bonus when working in water colour , a medium in which Paniker excelled , might have suggested to him this very unconventional abstraction .   The second artist we studied was the sculptor Nandgopal . His sculpture looked open and perhaps continues to , probably because it Is not closed on all sides like something in the round , also because it is not spatial , I e , something fixed compositionally  in space .  We highly appreciated A Selavraj’s painting , which absorbed the rhythmic freedom that makes the dancer’s body reflect the pure joy of movement . A Selavraj is a born dancer . The dancing experience evolved his style both in painting and sculpture . It acquired a fluidity  and in painting he gets a flow of light and  shadow .  His style remains purely figurative and he felt inspired by dancers , deities , musicians and village dames .There were many inspirational sculptures around the complex , some of which were Dream of the black sun by N D Rajsekharan , the zen inspired  Emptiness by Hiroshi Mikami , Figure  by Kanyai Kunhiraman , Head by Mall Walsh , Landscape by Theo tan Have , Lord M..  by S Kannappan  , Seed by Nagji Patel from my Vadodara ,  Shape by Olaf Mooij , Temple by Cune van Groeningrn and  View by Ajit Chakravarti  .  There was painting by Dich Donker too ."

Cholamandal_Artists_Village,Bharatbackpacker,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016,For serious art lovers,"The artist village maybe more relevant to Artists themselves rather than tourists. Even though an art lover myself, was very disappointed as the museum while show casing works of the artists of the Madras Art Movement lead by Panicker, there is very little on the movement itself. I suppose that the commune still exists is an achievement by itself. Entrance to museum is ticketed."

However, I found some paintings on sale and others for display only. There were books but no artist to interact with and not much information about the movement in the museum. There are beautiful sculptures and buildings in the area. But I did not learn much as the works were not curated properly. This is just my opinion."

Cholamandal_Artists_Village,BananaLu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,4 stars for the symbol of the place! For art lovers!,"People can actually not exactly visit the whole Cholamandal artists’ village because we are not supposed to enter the artists’ houses but there is an interesting gallery split on two floors with a permanent collection and few items that can be purchased, and another gallery that seems to contain only temporary exhibitions. Though small the collection is made of paintings (oil, acrylic, and water colour), sketches, drawings, and sculptures. Sadly only few art pieces have titles and none has explanations written on the side to enlighten the visitors on the artists’ messages.I would not advice to tourists who have a limited time to go there as the galleries are very small and do not contain items that will blow their mind, but I would definitely advice people who stay in Chennai to go there. It is indeed said to be the largest artists’ community of India and in any case it must one of the only such communities able to survive like this today. It is also an important part of India modern art history (village inaugurated in the 60s!) and art lovers should not miss it!The artists also propose free sketches classes on weekends! A good opportunity for children and even adults if you live in this area!"
