Connemara_Public_Library,Raguram R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Brilliant place to see,"This is a hidden gem and a shocker. A thing of such beauty and not publicized is something unpalatable. The library is divided into new lib and old lib. Old lib opens at 10:30am and is a hot to behold. The inside stained glasses, roof top decorations are brilliant. It is under renovation and you are not allowed to see inside. If the government were to charge 100 rupees for each visitor and tied up with tourist agencies, you will get all the money for conservation and maintenance. I would gladly donate more.The wood work supporting each book shelf is exquisite and is unique in each design.Go and see folks, and if possible petition the government to do better on this one."
