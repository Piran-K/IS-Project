Elliot_s_Beach,Mudit Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 â€¢ Family,Visit,"Edward Elliot's Beach, simply called as Elliot's Beach and popularly known as Besant Nagar Beach or the Bessie, is a natural urban beach located in the Besant Nagar neighbourhood of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. It is located next to the southern tip of the Marina Beach, and was named after Edward Elliot, a chief magistrate and superintendent of police of the Madras Presidency in colonial India. It has the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Healthâ€”also known as Annai Vailankanni Churchâ€”on its shore, and the Ashtalakshmi Temple nearby.During the colonial era, Elliot's beach was fairly exclusive to white people only. Today, the beach and its Kaj Schmidt Memorial are cultural landmarks of Chennai, visited by thousands daily. Safety on and around the beach is ensured by a police outpost and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs)."
Elliot_s_Beach,Plan H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,good beach,visited on sunday and the road shows were there and i have enjooyed a lot. not much rush and nice to visit the beach
Elliot_s_Beach,Sunnywin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Interesting story,"I was drawn to this beach because of the story behind it's name, must admit that I was slightly disappointed that this white man had saved a white child not a local child but it's still a nice beach"
Elliot_s_Beach,SilverMani,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Unspeakably filthy,"I remembered this as a fantastic beach from my childhood (in the 1990s) in a quiet, residential part of the city. Sadly, a visit today after a gap of more than two decades has destroyed those memories - the beach is virtually a cesspit with rotting garbage or even faeces strewn virtually everywhere. The area around the beach has been ""developed"" in the worst possible way, with plastic waste producing eateries and stalls catering to the many thousands of people who amazingly still find this a beach worth visiting - sadly this perhaps is a reflection of what conditions the other beaches in Chennai are in."
Elliot_s_Beach,shishir,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 â€¢ Solo,Not very clean,I was expecting it to be cleaner and less crowded. However it was not very clean and neither less crowded.
Elliot_s_Beach,Jolly Traveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 â€¢ Solo,Beach wander Chennai,"I was excited to make it to Chennai and visit Elliot's Beach but it was a mixed meander along the sand I am afraid to say.While there is a lot to see and enjoy - the food vendors with vege momos for 50rp, hot corn cobs, ""spring"" potato twists on a stick and bhaji; a beautiful blue sky; old style rides with even one spinning chair ride that was hand operated; families, couples and singles seeming to have a great time; the monument on the sand - there was also plenty to not love.In my half hour shore walk I saw micro plastics, garbage, poop (literally puddles of it), discarded potato skewers, and a puppy corpse. This is saddening for many reasins but especially as it all washes out to our shared oceans.There were positives...seeing hoof, paw and footprints in the sand, bubbles blowing by, the stunning blue skyscape and the vendors were not pushy.There is activity and vibrancy of a different place and time - fishermen, cattle wandering along the sand, fairy floss and icecream (Kwality Wall's) sellers, pony rides (no dstails on cost or service sorry), bubble -blower vendors, rows of multi coloured chairs, concrete cricket pitch, people swimming fully clothed.If you are in Chennai it is worth a visit but my tips are wear sandals, really watch your step and look before you sit."
Elliot_s_Beach,AURELIO L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,not so bad,"all the beaches of the town can be considered not so bad but not so nice to go there to spend a day,they are crowded and the sea is not so clean"

Elliot_s_Beach,Phirasta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 â€¢ Friends,Exactly where the sky reflects itself,"Serene and peaceful. A string of cozy cafes are parallelly attached across the beach. Though crowded during the weekends, one should opt for weekday. Potato spirals are a must have beach snack, no matter whether you're having your coffee! Sunset treats you with dancing neon range of sky colors. And as my title suggests, the sky exactly reflects itself."
Elliot_s_Beach,cootmom,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 â€¢ Friends,So cool on a blazing hot night!,"Do not miss the spiral potatoes! The urban beach is clean, with many food and fun attractions.

Elliot_s_Beach,sguday,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 â€¢ Friends,The Easily accessible and cleanest Beast of Chennai,"We found this beach to be easily accessible as you don't have to walk much from the mail road. You hardly walk for 5 minute and reach to the edge of beach. We went to the beach in the morning and there were lots of walkers and joggers roaming around the beach. We realized that comparatively more people come to the beach in the evening because there were lots of shops for snack around the beach which were closed during the morning time. Those shops must be opened during evening . A nice spot to visit here as per your convenience either during morning and evening. During morning you have lots of option to have some natural herbs based drink, narial paani and filter coffee. During evening time you can even visit some good fast food  chain which are across the road."
Elliot_s_Beach,Maruthu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 â€¢ Family,Good one to spend time on weekdays,"This place is a good one to spend time with family on weekdays, but itâ€™s too crowded on weekends. Things to try here is horse riding and roasted corn, but clarify the terms for horse riding like rate and distance covered, before doing that, as they are inconsistent with words!"
Elliot_s_Beach,MJROHIT,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 â€¢ Friends,Calm beach,A good place to hang around with your buddies. The crowd is ok. A lot of restaurants around to pacify your taste buds.

Less crowd, not sure it is due to time of visit. But overall very happy to be here. If you want to spend decent time, this could be the one among them. Though it is bit far from city it has the edge. Try book a cab and visit, other mode of transport is not so convenient. Have good time. Evening hours say from 5.30pm will be right time to be here."

Elliot_s_Beach,Ankit2385,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 â€¢ Family,Nice but extremely Dirty,"We went to Elliot's beach on Sunday evening. It was heavily crowded and so much of waste & litter all around. It is located close to Besant nagar Bus depot and have lots of food joints near by. Also there are 100's of vendors selling stuff near the beach with all sort of food variety and some games. Unfortunately there are very few waste bins here, so mostly people just throw the waste here & there. Compared to Marina beach, it was not worth visiting here."
Elliot_s_Beach,Manoj Kumar C V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 â€¢ Friends,Elliott's beach,This beach is near Basanth nagar in Chennai. A nice beach with all ingredients with food and other items associated with beaches in this prt of the world

There are some activities young kids can participate in - balloon shooting, throw-a-ring etc. There are some stalls selling snacks like fried potato twisters, corn, peanuts. There are also some stalls selling sea food like king fish, prawns, crabs, squids etc. The fried squids were yummy.

Elliot_s_Beach,shivaraikod,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 â€¢ Couples,Not so good,"When nature has bestowed Chennai with such beaches , we should take care in keeping it neat and clean and not litter around."
Elliot_s_Beach,Puneetkumar Pattar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 â€¢ Couples,Its more or less Besant nagar beach housing the Elliots memorial,"Elliots beach is mostly the Besant nagar beach itself. This portion of the beach that hosts the elliots memorial is called elliots beach (named after Edward Elliot, onetime chief magistrate and superintendent of police, Madras). As I have noted in my review on Bessie, Besant nagar beach is one of the most happening places in Chennai, especially considering the mushrooming of a large number of restaurants along the beach. The beach itself used to be a nice and quiet place some two years ago. However, it has turned into an overcrowded place, especially in the recent few months. Still, it is one of the best locations to spend an evening or take a walk in the morning. The road that runs along the beach hosts a large number of eateries, and the beach itself has a large number of hawkers/street food. Marina doesn't have restaurants (but has hawkers) while Thiruvamiyur doesn't have either (available but in a very low number). So, this beach continues to pull a lot of crowd."
Elliot_s_Beach,Ruth M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 â€¢ Couples,Wow....,Wow....another beautiful and famous Beach in Chennai. Many local and foreign tourist like to visit and enjoy the waters here. We did not spend much time but we love the it. Just beautiful.

A Ramp to enter the beach and a wooden way all the way to the front of the beach would be much appreciated. "
Elliot_s_Beach,chidambaram k,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 â€¢ Friends,Regular walk along the beach front,"As someone who has seen this beach since the mid-seventies when it was so quiet and clean, I feel really depressed to see the poor state of this once elite beach. Growing crowds is something out of our control. However, what made the local corporation authorities permit the scores of bunk shops to be located on the beach. They are not only positively ugly but also encourage the public to dump plastic and other waste food products on the sand. Hygiene is another casualty as the food waste attracts flies and mosquitoes. Such an avoidable matter but the government authorities just don't seem to care."
Elliot_s_Beach,772Leanne,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 â€¢ Family,Check out the fish market,Amidst the many fishing boats and nets youâ€™ll find a local fish market which is a great place to check out the different varieties on offer

Elliot_s_Beach,ekta s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 â€¢ Couples,Cleaner and more happening replacement of Marina,"If you can't take the overcrowded Marina beach , just visit Elliott's. It's in Besant nagar and still unexplored by the outside tourists so very clean and calm. It still gets crowded on weekends so try to visit it on a week day. The entire beach side is lined with all varieties of eateries including all kinds of street foods and different cuisines catering restaurants. However they will shut down by 11pm and so will the beach.. There is also a police checkpost nearby so the beach is pretty safe even at night. There's  a small fish market where you get all sorts of sea food variety which will open around 9am till 11pm.Once you are there do try the Murugan idli shop which is my favorite!!"

My first visit was not very noteworthy as I had little knowledge about the place and did not know that I should not have eaten there! The next visit was with friends and then I explored the beach completely. It is clean, less crowded as compared to Marina and has a lot of good eateries around it. Visit the beach in early morning on a weekend and you will not regret it."

Elliot_s_Beach,AsifKhan_Delhi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,Better than Marina beach,"This is a small beach on ECR road in Chennai. Unlike Marina beach which is over commercialized due to lot of food vendors on the beach, it is much cleaner and with less crowd. The current is also low so it is a good for swimming also during day time. I would say one may skip Marina beach, but should not skip eliots beach while in Chennai."
Elliot_s_Beach,Rachna S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 â€¢ Solo,Similar to any other chennai beach!,"When i visited this beach in chennai, i was not expecting the pathetic condition to this level. I have been to better beaches in India (although i know india isnt as rich in beaches as it is in mountains)This beach is along the same coastline as marina beach, besant nagar beach and this too isnt preserved. The litter is all aound which makes the experience not pleasant at all. You wont feel like taking a sunbath on sand, you would preferably settle for just standing tall and watching the waves crashing and sun sinking down the horizon."
Elliot_s_Beach,Ankur_Rishi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 â€¢ Couples,Nice Elite beach,this is a cleaner beach than marina with good views and safety. Good to have a stroll on bank side and enjoy the breeze with lots of food outlets.

Elliot_s_Beach,Raguram R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 â€¢ Family,Awesome evening on the beachside ,"Spent the late evening with family at the Elliot's Beach. Initially found it difficult to get a parking spot. Found a difficult corner to park my car. It was jam packed. We found a good spot to sit down and chat. My kid enjoyed it. We played in the water and after an hour decided to take leave. We did try spring potato chips. It was good. We prefer the vendors more towards the road than near the beach. They were better, more neat. The beach itself has heavy footfall, you may see a lot of trash generated. I wish people were better educated and dump trash near the bins. The municipal guys also do not seem to clear trash regularly. A few bins were over flowing. One was altogether missing. Overall a ""decent"" beach to spend time. Good coffee joints along the road. Many options for entertainment. Go ahead and enjoy. "

Surrounded by empty stalls and lots of rubbish and stray dogs. Also the air was full of a slightly awful smell and poosnd faked polluted to breathe in. It is certainly no tourist area...surrounded by a rather bleak neighbourhood. "

If you love beaches and good food... This is the place you got to be at.... The entire stretch of the road along the Elliot's beach is lined with restaurants and cafes.... You get a lot of cuisines ranging from South Indian Veg / Non-Veg, Italian (Little Italy), KFC, Murugan Idly Kadai, Mash (amazing sizzlers available here)..... and more... And what more... It's located within city limits.. What more can you ask of a beach??"
Elliot_s_Beach,Robert H,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 â€¢ Couples,Overrated,Good to drive past but not the best beach in the world. Not many Indians swim in the surf but lots of people taking in the cooler air especially in the evening

Elliot_s_Beach,s_ramsam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 â€¢ Friends,Very good place to spend time,Probably the best beach area in Chennai city. Very good for family outings or morning/evening strolls. Close to well off residential areas so plenty of shopping and dining facilities also close by.
Elliot_s_Beach,Zinzan6,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 â€¢ Friends,A fun tourist stroll,"If you have some time, would recommend Elliotâ€™s beach over Marina beach. We arrived early evening and were able to enjoy a stroll onto the beach and along the â€˜boardwalkâ€™. Great opportunities to sample local food preparation and customs if you have the courage. Brilliant photo opportunities as you stroll aroundI missed having my children with me who I know would have really enjoyed the games for prizes all along the beach. "

Elliot_s_Beach,SreeSree,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 â€¢ Friends,Just alright!!,"If you are someone who has seen other beaches around the country, Elliots beach will not fascinate. As there is nothing special or wow about this one. But if you just want to enjoy a sea view and relax, this is a good option. No fancy food joints here, there are shacks that serve vegetable ""bhajjis"" and yes you have the fish fry options as well. I went for a Pomphret fry and it was nicely made. Murugan Idli is another place to eat one can visit. There are no water activities on this beach..."

Elliot_s_Beach,GrannyMaa,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Family,Good sea-front,"Another stretch of sea that is clean and well-maintained is the Elliotts Beach stretch near Besant Nagar. Not many people flock this place, hence, it will be less crowded and peaceful and no littering of trash or waste."
Elliot_s_Beach,EnigmaticIndia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 â€¢ Family,Clean and sr citizen friendly ,"After a disappointing visit to the famous Marina beach,  I wasn't expecting much from this beach, however it was a pleasant surprise when we visited around 4:30 in the evening.The approach is very clean, neat walkways which helps sr citizens also, not many vendors but enough for us to munch and feel good.Interstingly there were Frisbee competition happening all the beach and it was a spectacle to see the boys and girls enjoying the same.The beach is very clean, the water relatively calmer and as the weather was cool we enjoyed it. There is the Karl schidmt memorial after a Dutch sailor who lost his life saving others.Overall a nice experience."

Elliot_s_Beach,rasa006,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 â€¢ Couples,"Elliots beach, with good approach and walk-ways for senior citizens, is a good relaxing point in Chennai","Unlike Marina Beach, this Elliot's Beach is calm and Happening place for relaxation and walking. We can find many senior citizens walking and talking with family and friends. An important advantage in this beach is, parking. If you arrive bit early-say 4.30-5.30 pm on regular days, one can park his/her car just at the walking point and walk few meters to sit in beach sand. But in week-ends, the place is over crowded and police did not allow parking near the walking point.Just opp to this beach, we can enjoy snacks/quick bits of various types, in good ambience. Over all a good place for relaxation with family and walking."
Elliot_s_Beach,Arun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Friends,Another name for Besant Nagar Beach,"There is a brick monument dedicated to a Karl Schmidt Memorial, a European soldier who drowned trying to save the life of a girl. It is a monument built with bricks and no basement. It was damaged due to sea sand and water over period of time. Right now the Chennai Corporation renovated and has fenced the monument."
Elliot_s_Beach,Deepanarun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017,Home Sweet Home,"This is home so I can never say it is nothing less than excellent. Though in recent times the beach has become quite dirty and very commercial with all the eatery shops. I wish they put more bins, like one every 10-20mtrs and fined people for littering so that we can keep our beach clean."
Elliot_s_Beach,Lopaaaaa,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016,Best Beach of Chennai,"Yes, I know Marina beach is world famous and a must see tourist destination for Cheenai. However, I prefer the Elliot's beach as it is much smaller and more private. It is cleaner and quieter too. The stretch of this beach goes through residential areas and hence there are more local families visiting this beach than tourists. However, this is a good beach to laze around the whole day and you can also catch a bite or two of different cuisines all around this place. "
Elliot_s_Beach,Jayakumarp81,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 â€¢ Family,Best place to relax,Beach ... anytime you can hang out here .. bit crowded in weekends but a good place spend your evenings with family and friends
Elliot_s_Beach,Dilip Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 â€¢ Couples,Car free sundays are real cool,"It is relatively clean and posh compared to marina beach. But the beach is far from city center. The beach has asthalakshmi temple and famous church nearby. So you can have the spiritual angle covered too.Kfc, coffee houses are all lined up for a quick bite. There is a small amusement park with snow dance and games for kids.So overall it is a good package.And overall the above , car free sundays on sunday morning - is really cool. Zumba dances, kid activities are all nice to enjoy. Be there on sunday early morning before Six to have a mini carnival experience.ENJOY BEING THERE "
