It is situated very close to the Taj Clubhouse in Chennai. Chennai airport is just 10km from this place. There is a foodcourt on the top floor having several outlets. There is a centralized payment system to buy food here. You buy a recharge card & top-up whatever amount you want & then pay the many restaurants through this card. There are also some individual restaurants having separate enclosures on the same floor having their own payment system.

Also, in some shops they will take any larger bags from you for keeping until you leave. This is not a criticism, just the way that they do it. Very well air conditioned so a relief form the streets outside.  Easy to get a TukTuk on your way out, to your next destination. Opens at 10am for the shops and later for the cinema.

It is a 3 storied building built on the cast land area belonging to Express newspaper right in the heart of the city. The building itself is about 1750000sq feet with about 90000 sq ft area dedicated to retail trade. The rest of the areas are used up for offices and theatres etc. All branded stores have their own outlet here. The snacks and food court variety is mind boggling.  A good place to spend your spare time and catch up with fashion. The top floor houses all the cine complex and also the food court. The only drawback that we can see here is the huge parking charges that is being charged by the hour, both for the 2 wheelers as also the 4 wheelers. The rates are specially high over the weekends. When we try to follow the foreign markets to suit our needs, we should do so fully and not selectively."

All the major brands of clothes, footwear, fashion accessories, food, etc had a good presence here. A well kept mall in terms of variety and clean floors, I was a bit taken aback at the slight bit of shabbiness in the ladies toilets section. I prefer the washbasin slabs to be perfectly dry, especially since there was a lot of staff chatting away but not bothering to keep the place dry.Other than this, the mall is every bit a great one!"
