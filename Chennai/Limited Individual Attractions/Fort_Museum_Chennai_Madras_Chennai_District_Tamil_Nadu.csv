Fort_Museum,Hooray H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Quaint little Museum,"The origins of Madras. very important to see this & to realise why foreigners came from so far away; India is so rich. It was a battle between the British, Portuguese & French, with the Russians & then Germans also wanting a piece of the action.Where has that wealth gone since independence?That is the important question.They don't want to share it with you!Alas, it was closed on the day we visited the Fort."
Fort_Museum,Anand M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,India Story that lends a deep insight,"It is amazing to understand how a handful of British on lookout for business, converted the divide and vulnerability of this country into an empire without fighting any serious war by using just some hired local talent. The museum also reflects how British artists and freelancers made a career out of visiting India and applying themselves. When you are committed and love your profession, success is a natural fallout. That sums up this Museum."
Fort_Museum,Deepa Moses,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Must Visit Museum in Chennai,"This Museum is a must visit one in Chennai. The Armaments section has displays of different kinds of weapons such as cannons, guns, swords and daggers in use during British rule. There is a section for uniforms worn by officers in the British army, the various medals conferred on them and the coins minted during British rule.The first floor has portraits in oil painting of the different Governers of the Fort and their wives, the Kings and Queens of England and the Arcot Nawabs. There are also aquatints of different places giving a glimpse of life in those days. The second floor houses burial urns and a sacrophagus and gives a good understanding of burial practices in South India during the Neolithic and Iron Age. The piece-de-resistance is the only surviving Indian flag that was hoisted on the First Independence Day. Loved the collection displayed in the museum and most certainly recommend this place"
Fort_Museum,Praveenop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,A small museum which shows a piece of British contributions and history of Chennai,This place is located in the Fort St. George which is the office of the Tamil Nadu govt. There are a lot of excellent paintings connected to the British times which is worth seeing.The place could have been been maintained much better if the TN govt takes some interest and promote it.
Fort_Museum,Karpagavalli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,nice place,This is one of the most sort after place of the city as it's speaks history of the city and it's people.this is a must see place. 
Fort_Museum,kathy b,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,A dip into history,I loved this museum.  It showed and told how Chennai looked during the Colonial years.  Some of it made uncomfortable reading but it was fascinating.  Huge oil paintings of the people that governed here with models and sketches of how the city used to look.  Little bit shabby in places but overall a very interesting visit.
Fort_Museum,tristanr,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,"Small museum, heavy on detail","Located within the Fort St George base, this museum contains an assortment of colonial-era artefacts: coins, uniforms, weapons and paintings. They serve to tell the story of the fort across its ~300 year lifespan. Be prepared for lots of reading, however - this is a traditional museum. Stairs are steep and many. As others have said, this could be so much better."
Fort_Museum,Colin W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Business,Bit dull,"Went on Sunday, took longer to sign in than walk through the building. It is old granted, but its very dull and not well looked after. Shame, was looking to see how India evolved away from the British,  Expected more and disappointed."
Fort_Museum,Chris W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Could be very good,"Situated in the old government building by the prime minister's office it offers a glimpse into the English era in Madras. Established when artifacts could be displayed with a brief name of the item, we have moved on a good video talking about the time would help a lot.The 18th century prints of arriving and embarking at Madras were really fascinating.Even though foreigners pay 250 and locals only 30, there were hardly any visitors.A museum to see if you are in the area if you want to know more of the period."
Fort_Museum,RAMAKRISHNAN K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Must visit for tourist,The place is located inside the fort located on beach road .. The museum has got excellent collection and well maintained..The place has got two floors of collections ranging from war memories of British era ..One remarkable item is flag hoisted on Indian independence at chennai fort..One of nice collections ..History has been depicted very nicely..Children would enjoy a lot ..
Fort_Museum,Charles_and_Susan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,A selection of memorabilia ,"It's not a large museum but there's snipets of all sorts. Including uniforms, guns and ammunition of the period, pottery and information about the development of the fort. Some large paintings of Kings and Queens who played a part in the British India story are also displayed. Give it a go."
Fort_Museum,EnigmaticIndia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Some piece of history to see,"Getting here needs security clearance as the fort house govt offices.The whole place has three floors and in the ground floor one can see lot of coins, armoury anf history of how the fort was built.The next floor has a lot of massive paintings of the English kings and queens and some type of painting impressions.What we liked most was the huge Indian National Flag that was hoisted on 1947 here at Fort st George.Well cant compare this to other large museums but it does its bit of addition to the historical knowledge for people like us. "
Fort_Museum,Rajkumar R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,Interesting only for History lovers,"The Museum has Portraits, Statues, War equipments, coins, Medals and history of the Fort. It takes less than 1 hour to visit this place. You need to go security checking before entering the campus. Car parking is free and just opposite to the site."
Fort_Museum,Peter S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,A disgrace!,"It's commendable that the former British officers' mess is open to the public. I was intrigued to enter it - it was uncomfortably warm even on a January day with fans going: what might it have been like in summer heat with only punkahs? (And the punkah bars are still visible fixed to the ceilings - fascinating!)But as a museum, the Fort Museum is a complete disgrace. It comprises half a dozen room over three floors displaying a random collection of historical tat - old crockery, weapons, coins, copies of portraits of various monarchs and governors etc., and on the top floor the most negligent display on the freedom movement you've ever seen. The whole thing is a complete mess and a waste of your time and money. The only really interesting room was the display of a huge model of the fort c.1870. The rest was pointless, mouldering junk, unexplained, or poorly explained, and not worth the 200 rupee fee foreign visitors are charged. Photography is supposedly prohibited - presumably to stop the world knowing how bad the place is, a ban easily evaded. (Why would you stop people taking of photos of stuff they want to remember? I was very interested in the history of the fort: why would you want people not to take photos of the excellent model of the place?) The whole thing was as appalling as the worst historical 'museum' I've seen anywhere in India. Don't miss it!"
Fort_Museum,worldwomantourist,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Many rare artifacts on display,"Fort Museum is a famous Historical place. Wide variety of olden vessels and dishes kept in display. It displays paintings, guns, military items, Coins, statues of english men, their dresses, weapons and the products of their time when they lived here in India. . Fort Museum is a calm place."
Fort_Museum,hollySalisbury,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,Interesting colonial stuff,"Basically Chennai isn’t a tourist Mecca, but this museum did have some interesting artefacts and full length oils of monarchs, senior military and Indian moguls associated with the East India Company.  Security because the museum is inside the fort with its state government."
Fort_Museum,tomasvalter,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,No good choice,It was just pure. Compare to museums at Europe there is huge gap. They have what to show but building maintenance finish yers ago. As well family decide to visit toilet and this was challenge. Close to museum is nice church. Good to see.  But as well you have to go true messy areas. As There is a lot of ministry located at old for then I Do not understand why they cannot place clean and organize. Somehow I do accept that I have to pay 200 rupiahs for entry and local 15 but do not know where money goes. And not allowing to take pictures. ????
Fort_Museum,Thusanee L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Historical museum,"Nice museum to visit for those whom are interested in the history of Fort St. George and its meaning to Chennai. The exhibition are for porcelain was beautiful. I wish they could elaborate more about history and appearance of the tablewares. I wish also that they had more artifacts about Tamilnadu freedom fighters, as well as Indian freedom fighters. The coins and oil painting exhibition was marvelous! It´s worth a visit just to watch that!"
Fort_Museum,Carlos Scott Lopez,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo, Weak offerings given the price ,"Notable site with several rooms of paraphernalia spread over several floors, but likely only of value to locals. Indeed, the pricing scheme where foreigners pay over 1,200% more than locals (200 versus 15 Rupees) makes the site not worth visiting unless one is a local and can pay the local price. (This said, one could envisage paying slightly more (e.g., 10%-20% more) to find the site worth the entry fee, but nothing over this.)Also, seeing wealthy Indians coming to visit - while students on small budgets were charged so much more - proved somewhat saddening to witness."
Fort_Museum,Partha C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Fort Museum-Historical,"It is a famous place and Historical.  Many Galleries are there, paintings, Guns,  Military items, Coins, Statues are very interesting.  Entry fees are there.  Lot of development needed."
Fort_Museum,babarozsi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,If you have plenty of time,"Its an OK place to visit, altough I dont think its a ""must-see"" when in Chennai. There are some great old coins and other antiques, and the part of the exhibition which explains about the city's history is also quite interesting. "
Fort_Museum,Biddy50,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Not worth the visit,"There are 10 galleries spread over 3 floors. The is glass cabinets of military memorabilia, coins & artworks from colonial times."
Fort_Museum,PaulW0511,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Could be so much better,"Given the significance of this fort, it was really disappointing to see such a tired place that obviously hasn't had a rupee spent on it in decades.  The displays were old, no descriptions to bring them to life.  A whole room full of coins and medals with no details of their significance.   Overall, it really needs the whole place starting again.  A big plus, however, is the little cafe round the back of the museum, the best masala tea I've ever had in India, great food at rock bottom prices and lovely people!"
Fort_Museum,ghosal_rg,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,The British museum of Chennai,"How great and glorious were the faces of these rulers!How beautiful and immaculate were their coins(which they understood a little more than usual) and porcelains!How strong were their weapons which put any revolt for freedom in bay!What a fortification!What canons!Reminds us of Sir Robert Clive who brought civilisation to Indians!Alas,probably the sentries guarding these do not know the values of the materials,arranged shoddily and full of shadows."
Fort_Museum,SyedIqbal123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,English Men culture revealed,"Fort Museum is a calm place.  It is worth visiting this place once, as it has culture of English Men, their dresses, weapons and the products of their time, when they lived here in IndiaA nice variety of olden vessels and dishes is there.  Array of out dated coins are also available.Photography is prohibited inside the museum.  Outside we can take some pictures.This Fort Museum is located inside the Tamil Nadu Secretariat campus, which requires frisking of Personnel entering in to the Campus."
Fort_Museum,vasan224,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016,historical place,"one of the place to protect and care by chennai people, if it care it will be a good place to visit."
Fort_Museum,gargamit100,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Not well maintained!,"Good collection but overall just average. Museums in India have great artifacts but the maintenance & display is pretty ordinary (sometimes outright shoddy). If it needs a higher entry fees, so be it but the state of the museums must improve."
Fort_Museum,Deepak J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,Do visit if you are interested in history of British empire in India.,"You can find many interesting pre-independence things in here. One of such thing is the India's first tri-colour flag. You will get goosebumps after seeing that. Although it is nicely maintained, things can improve. It is located near Fort railway station only so you don't have to travel much,"
Fort_Museum,ChrisJS51,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Good background to hopw Chennai came to be the way it is,"History of the city, including the days of the Raj and leading figures who made the city what it is today. Worth a visit although it shouldn't detain you for more than an hour.f"
Fort_Museum,Alone_You_go,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,Small Museum....ok ...but not great,The museum is within the premises of secretariat and hence lots of security. The museum is not big and very great. The paintings at the 1st floor were good. It has some good interesting things. But the paintings are really good.
Fort_Museum,SydneySchoey,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Not worth the effort,Disappointing. Some decent artefacts but terrible presentation and very little information about the presence and influence of the East India Company.
Fort_Museum,SWmuse,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,One of the worst I have ever visited! ,"Poorly laid out, incredibly badly lit, stairs and no lift for disabled or infirm visitors. Once more I was struck by the seeming lack of care India has for its history. The museums, which I accept most probably lack funding, are in a poor, bedraggled state. I am sure the exhibits are fascinating but they are, in the main, so badly promoted and exhibited that the effort involved in seeing them outweighs their artistic and educational value. I found the experience a little dispiriting. "
Fort_Museum,Eat1Drink2Travel3,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Interesting but not looked after,"It seems that India doesn't care about the first ever flag which was raised after independence. The rag is disintegrating and won't last very long. Paintings were dusty and paint peeling off. It's a nice place to get out of the sun and view old coins, arms, paintings etc but also sad to note how little it is cared for. "
Fort_Museum,Akash K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016,Under cared Museum,this is a small museum with sculpture and paintings used by rulers of Madras.you can find many good pieces of art to explore here.
Fort_Museum,KeRa N,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Historic site,"This place is guarded by the police and they are not friendly towards tourists.

Fort_Museum,Albia-Newton,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Solo,Overpriced and under cared for,200 INR to see some not very well kept artifacts.The display on Indian Independence has some interesting facts in - as does the bit on the building of the fort
Fort_Museum,robcc1971,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Fort St George Museum,"The building itself feels quite grand, although there is not a great amount to see inside the museum considering its size.Coins, period costume, pottery / cermamics, paintings and some military weapons etc... are displayed over different floors.There are some paintings that record how the fort was presented in its heyday which did give a better overview. there is also a roof terrace which unfortunatley was not open, no doubt this would give a commanding view of the surrounding area. The fort is an intersting building and certainly worth visiting, although there are quite a few stairs (no lifts) to access if you want to view each room."
Fort_Museum,Sarah W,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Worth seeing as possibly the worst museum.,"This was the first place we visited on our tour of South India.It was shocking to see how historical artefacts are sometimes kept, some not lit, some not labelled, even mould on some exhibits.In the UK we have become used to a very high standard of museums, and I was amazed by what I saw here."
Fort_Museum,CARLOS Y,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Living on Madras English style,"This is a small museum, but with relevant information for that time the English rule the Indian country.You can not miss the 2nd floor ball room, with all the English and Minister portraits (Full size). If you have a little imagination, you can figure yourself on that ball room some years ago in a ""Gala Dress Party"".There is also a room related with Indian Independence main figures, and another that have some old English armory.

Fort_Museum,Patrick P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Fantastic museum in the old style,"The Fort Museum is a dusty throwback to the victorian idea of a museum. Great details about the history of Madras, maps and models alongside some great artifacts poorly displayed. There is a great art gallery on the second. Include St Mary's Church in your visit to the Fort complex. It is reputed to be the oldest Christian church east of Suez!"
Fort_Museum,Jagan M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016,Old Madras Inside,It does have the Madras Feel inside the building and has a lot history related art pieces from all the British and King period. Gives you a great insight about the early times and how Madras has changed and evolved from there.
Fort_Museum,moralinbala,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015,Great Museum..!,"This museum is great if you have small children, but there's not much for anyone above the age of 6. It would only take an hour for you to go through all the adult friendly exhibits, but it's really not worth it. At this time the THINK exhibit is there and it's painfully boring. It's really just a big room with a bunch of screens...The National Treasures exhibit was pretty cool, but it took maybe 10 minutes to see everything...My toddler had a blast in the children's place so that made the trip worth it.The Dino dig has very little shade and it's extremely small.If you've been to the museum before the renovations you will be very very disappointed cause 90% of the museum is gone."
Fort_Museum,balakec,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,Seed for Megacity Madras,"The fort Saint George is the place the English East India company built Madras. The museum has great collections of coins, busts, oil paintings of erstwhile royal officials. Near the museum you can find the Clive's House(Robert Clive). You can also checkout the register which was signed by Clive during his wedding the St.Mary Church inside the fort. Great place for history buffs."

Fort_Museum,Angus B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Pretty expensive for non Indians ,Costs Rs 200 each for non Indians for which you get two grumpy members of staff and an old museum in need of a refit. Some nice paintings of old British rulers but very interactive! Not really worth a visit.

There are interesting status and maps. The entire fort, with its fencing, moans is nice. It houses one of the oldest Church on what it claims is ""the oldest chura on east of suez"""
Fort_Museum,Simon J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,This is an amazing museum,"There are some incredible artifacts in this museum.

Fort_Museum,JumboMumbai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,History beckons,"The musuem is over 5 decades old in itself. And the remians of the fort are impressive.  One can watch out for different relics of the british era from crockery and cutlery to paintign of the nobility.  Then there are documents and letters which are dated and important and lots of antique stuff including church silver ware, There is lots of history waiting for one to visit and see"
Fort_Museum,Andrew P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,A must-visit site,"As the first English settlement in India this was a must on our visit to Chennai. The fort itself is hemmed in by traffic lanes and the usual modern buildings, but the museum was an island of tranquility. Whirling fans ( no air con) kept the rooms tolerably cool, and there was a range of maps, weapons, porcelain, portraits, uniforms (how did the soldiers wear , what seems to be, thick woollen uniorms in this heat?), medals, and other artefacts. The map showing the original fort and its growth over 300 years were really interesting."
Fort_Museum,fl o,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016,Nice historical artifacts and some old paintings,"Nice place to visit to see some of the historic leftovers from the occupation and how the city was at that time. Some old paintings, weapons, coins and such, nothing great but worth a visit."
Fort_Museum,LuizDutraNeto,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Relics of the British Raj in the old Madras ...,"Amidst ""Fort St. George"", you will find a beautiful colonial building, the former headquarters of the ""Madras Bank"". It now houses the ""Fort Museum"", with ten galleries spread over three floors: Uniforms and Medals; Porcelains; Portraits; Miscellany; Prints and Documents; Indo-French; Coins; Wodeyar Family Collection; Madras; and Reserve Collection. ""Fort Museum"" will remind you of the British rule in India, with the beautiful relics of the ""Raj"" period. Despite the museum's conservation and maintenance conditions, a visit is strongly recommended - old Madras and the British ""Raj"" are alive within its walls. Enjoy!"
Fort_Museum,David S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,Poorly run and in terrible condition,"The museum is in a state of disrepair.  I was saddened and shocked when I went to visit this museum.  Exhibits were poorly or not labeled at all.  For example there was  a case full of swords but no explanation of each sword or why it was in the museum.The China collection was visibly dirty and dusty,  Cases were labeled but not individual pieces.There is a room with very large oil paintings of important figures in Chennai history.  The room was obviously a ballroom at some point but there is no explanation.  Its a wonder that the portraits survive in the heat.  None of the rooms have an explanation of what they had been used for.No air conditioning in this 3 story building.  Not disabled friendly.  Chennai is hot and inside the museum was hotter.  The temperature went up on each floor visited.  By the time I got to the 3rd floor the heat was unbearable and I could not visit the exhibits.If you need the rest room, the man who works in the museum brings you outside and then asks for payment.My visit was disappointing and uncomfortable and I can't recommend this museum to any traveller to Chennai."

Fort_Museum,Chandrahasan KC,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,Visit Fort Museum,"Fort Museum is housed inside Fort St.George. There will not be any indications on the road that points to this museum. But through word of mouth and if you are able to refer websites, you will get to this place. Ideally, one needs to pass through a police check post at the entrance of Fort St.George, giving out the purpose of visit and noting down your address on the register. This is part of the security check, since the secretariat is inside Fort St. George and this check is mandatory.  The fee for seeing museum is highly affordable. The ground floor hosts artifacts like uniform, weapons, crockery and others. The first floor hosts paintings of famous people from the UK. The entire museum is maintained well and takes about an hour or so to complete seeing everything. Overall, the visit will be worthy of the time spent."

Sadly the definition of the exterior of the fort has been lost over time so is not overly impressive.

Fort_Museum,Bharatbackpacker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Solo,Must visit for History Lovers,"Fort St George being the doorstep for the British colonial rule over india, contains a lot of information that would interest any History lover. The museum is well maintained, but, as it in a high security area photography is not allowed. The evolution of the Fort is well documented as well as you get to see some pretty good paintings (some painted by Raja Ravi Varma) of nobles and Royals. Entrance ticket for Indians is 15."
Fort_Museum,Beatitudesooi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Good information,This is a museum in need for repair. Items displayed also needs to be taken care of. Information is ample with different languages available including the blind. Do pop by only if you are interested to know more about the Fort as there is a small fee to pay for the entrance.
Fort_Museum,H7417VMstefanom,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,Week end experience,I live in Chennai since over one year and during one week end we decided to go and visit the fort museum Is nice and above average of other musuems that i see in Chennai My young son get bored and it was a really hot day ( like 80 % of the days in Chennai )
Fort_Museum,travelgirl254,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Fort St George: Fort Museum,"It is quite eye opening to read about how Chennai was first settled by the British at this location. Also to see from the model & illustrations how big the whole Fort area is, like a mini village. It is mostly occupied by the Indian army, navy, police & government now, so there are security checks getting in and when wandering around you'll be told not to go past certain buildings etc. The historic St Mary's church is a bit hard to find but worth it. It's well maintained as its still used. Not a big cathedral but a peaceful little sanctuary, including the garden. Allow about 2-3 hours. Bring your own snack & drink. Foreigners pay 200Rp entry. No photos allowed. It's interesting seeing inside the Museum building, although I was a bit sad to see the deterioration happening to the paintings and find other things. Most of the museum is not air con either, so it gets very warm inside. "

Fort_Museum,Edgar K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Worth a visit,We visited the fort museum (Rs50 per person) and found it interesting. There is a lot of stuff without a huge amount of information or story telling but it is nice to see the inside of the building and the section about the construction of the fort was very interesting. We also walked around the grounds a little bit and tried to visit Clive's house but it was closed at the time. The fort is worth a visit and is enjoyable if you set your expectations appropriately before you go.

Fort_Museum,arunbsi1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,The Fort St. George Museum,"The Fort St. George Museum was organised and opened to the public from 31st January 1948. The museum began with a small collection of objects of the British Raj donated by the then Madras Presidency Government, the St. Mary's Church authorities, the disbanded army units and others. Over the years many objects were acquired by various means and there are now 3661 registered antiquities in the collection. Best among them (602) are on display in ten galleries.The building housing the museum is one of the oldest surviving buildings built within the fort. The building was completed in 1795 and served as the location for Madras Bank. The museum building has a history of its own."
Fort_Museum,Kymosavvy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Interesting colonial History,Small and intimate this museum is a good starting point for the early history of the British in Madras (Chennai). Situated as part of a larger government establishment (ex barracks) it is also worth visiting  St Mary's Church. i particularly like the paintings on the 2nd floor.

Fort_Museum,Pat D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Lots of medals and coins,"If you are into medals, coins or maybe pottery or some older weapons this is for you. It was a significantly smaller and sparse than the Government museum. The portrait gallery had some interesting pictures of British Royalty / Army and interesting stories on how they were associated with or affected Chennai.  "
Fort_Museum,Ruth C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Could be a lot better,"Disappointingly the fort is just the museum and you can't take photos inside. The history is interesting and they have a fair cross section of antiquities, paintings, etc, but could be a lot better."
