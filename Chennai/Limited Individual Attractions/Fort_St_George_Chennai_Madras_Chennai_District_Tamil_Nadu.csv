Fort_St_George,Baggywrinkle75,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023,"Lots of history here, St Mary's has incredible memorials","For those history buffs this is a must see. Muck of Britain's involvement in India can be seen in this place, lots of background the the East India Company which had the words biggest private army and trade block in its time.St Mary's is chock full of memorials to those who lived, served and died here. Some very tragic one with regards the wives of those who were here.Beware: Entrance is now by an online ticket. My driver used his phone to buy and I reimbursed him. I'm guessing this is due to security in the area as a large part of the fort is still in use by the military as well as locl Govt."
Fort_St_George,Richard G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Family History,"I wandered around there in the late 1970s when it was mainly Government Offices. At that time I was not aware that a Ggreat XXX Uncle, William Anderson, was a British Army Private there, in 1837. In the 45 Regiment. Wonderful old Buidings and nice to see some history preserved."
Fort_St_George,Hooray H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Superb,"At least they are maintaining a bit of very important History.Located in a secure Government area so your driver has to wait outside, if you have one.One of the first British Forts in India & played a very important role in the Colonial rule.The museum is closed one day a week, so do check.Behind it is a local cafe & a nice little shop selling all kinds of cotton products at ridiculously low prices."
Fort_St_George,Andy_Bickley,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Interesting history, but lacking in facilities",You have to get through government security to get into the place.  It contains some interesting things relating to the early history of the East India Company.  You have to go out into the civil service areas to get a tea or find a toilet
Fort_St_George,Dwightcr,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Historic and worth a visit for colonial history,"This fort built for colonial administration and defense of Madras.  It was the first English fortress in India, founded in 1644.  It now includes state administration, a informative museum and a very old historic church."

Fort_St_George,1777NT,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"Historicaslly this is possibly the main placer in Chennai - limited access, limited interest","From the old Dutch East India Company or the English East India Company days, the Fort is possibly the main attraction, historically, in Chennai.The Chennai City Council or Indian Government do not make a point of using this site as a 'cash cow' by attracting visitors, especially international visitors, very limited access to anything, very limited information, no 'tourist' facilities (restaurants, tourist information etc) in short a total waste of time locating it and trying to ascertain anything about it's former use."
Fort_St_George,Brian H,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Interesting,It was worth visiting if you are interested in learning more about the British in Chennai.  Informative and some neat artifacts - but as one other reviewer said it is in need of TLC.  See the 2nd floor - the painting room is amazing!
Fort_St_George,Wil Chung,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Interesting but needs a little tlc,"As the first base for the British in India, Fort St George has a lot of history. This now fully working base does have a museum attached to it. First of all to get in you need to show a passport/drivers licence. The museum is 300rs for foreigners and 50 for Indians. Interesting collection of a lot of military inspired memorabilia along with some India artefacts. The most ""interesting"" room is the oil paintings of some.british royal family members - but do remember to look up and to the left.....Not allowed to take photos inside the museum"
Fort_St_George,Alan N,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Extraordinary!,Sometimes travel throws up the strangest places and this museum is one of them. The most peculiar place. Faded exhibits of unremitting boredom. A desultory collection of tat. An enormous statue bunged  into a stairwell. A porcelain and coin collection cobbled together in a lazy afternoon in the 1940s when someone had nothing better to do but didn't want to do this either. And guess what? Such a bizarre place. I'll  be telling the story of our visit long after the nice places have been long forgotten. Seared on my memory. 
Fort_St_George,DJG_KAG,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Interesting history,"Small museum and interesting information about history of the Fort. Near to lovely church, also worth a visit."
Fort_St_George,Melissa Dsouza,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Museum,This place is again an official building you cant roam in this place and you can visit this museum you have to pay a fee to enter.
Fort_St_George,SteveS1970,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Government Fort,The old 17th century fort has become government buildings with plenty of nice cars with flags on the front. Photography is not allowed and there is plenty of military presence. Other than the Anglican church there isn't much to see here.
Fort_St_George,Pickleinwimbledon,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Disappointing with a dangerous staircase,"This beautiful old building has fallen into neglect with a collection that doesn’t warrant the 300 RS foreigner charge. Some money must have been spent in the past setting this up as when I asked for  I formation, I was given a glossy well written brochure with information about accessibility, Braille, outreach programmes etc. I didn’t see much of this in evidence. The building is in a terrible state with torn carpets on the stairs, be very careful you don’t trip especially between the ground and first floor. It was also stiflingly hot in some areas. Shame really as Chennai doesn’t have much in the way of tourist sites and this has so much potential. "
Fort_St_George,Chintan m,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Average...,"It was built for the official purposes under British rule. Now it is working as a museum for coins, paintings etc. you should visit this place only if you have spare time"

Fort_St_George,Peter B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Worth a visit if in Chennai,"Mostly uninteresting government buildings now, but see the old church - first Anglican (?protestant church east of Suez from the 17th century. Also the building where Clive of India first worked as a clerk"
Fort_St_George,ChicLifeByte,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,A historical marvel to be witnessed!,"The ancient landscape still holds an important place today and serves a seat of power for the Tamil Nadu Government.  A stroll around, you would see fascinating sights like old parade ground, basket ball court, National Art Gallery, St Mary’s church and other old buildings. A historical marvel is what I would call it! A must visit is also the museum on the backside which talks about how the fort developed."
Fort_St_George,Charles_and_Susan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,An area with history ,"In the museum of the fort there's a display on how the fort developed. You can walk around and see such things as the old parade ground, now a basket ball court, India's oldest Christian Church and other old buildings. There's a large new building too which houses the area's government. "
Fort_St_George,Mahipal B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,colonial jewel a historical monument with great heritage.,"it is place of history, actually it is the vidhana sabha of Tamilnadu. just a building is open for the public and there is high security. there is no cloak room over there please don't carry heavy things and cameras are not allowed as it is a museum. if you are intrested in history then it's place for you."
Fort_St_George,Komator,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,"Average fort, it is a military post","The Fort St. George is one of Chennai's highlights. It's not the typical fort but it is used for military purposes. You are not allowed to enter lots of stuff outside (tobacco, meds....). Inside, you can see St Mary's church. If you're there, it's worth a visit, but I wouldn't go on purpose."
Fort_St_George,RomaMinenko,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,Half day visit,"Being a museum magnate, I thought I'd give this one a try.  I think the biggest challenge was getting there and making sure you were in the right place.  We drove past a military installation and there was much security around the highway in front of the place - my uber driver was unsure about the place and I knew nothing but what I saw on websites so I stepped out and some of the military guys said that I was in the right place but the museum was in the back.  So don't be flipped out if you feel you're in the wrong place here because it's not well labelled or visible on the road.Displays are interesting enough and it allows for an understanding of all the countries that have had their hands on this country over the years.  Includes a section on their independence.  No photos or videos allowed inside."
Fort_St_George,Helen,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Afternoon visit,Although there are some run down buildings this is worth a visit for the historical and culrural significance.
Fort_St_George,Jeannie2207,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Interesting history on display here,"It’s a fairly run down museum now, but St Georges Fort and the area around it is worth visiting. If you are interested in the history of India then there’s a lot to be investigated here. "

Fort_St_George,Tawseef Khan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,A must for history buffs,"The fort is relatively small and well preserved. It’s not the typical forts that you can find in India but more of an European styled building with cannons. There are some nice collections of arms, uniforms and other items from the early British period in India. I particularly enjoyed reading the notes and descriptions behind the items. There are some beautiful life sized portraits hanging on the walls of various lords, generals and other important figures. I enjoyed that section. I think this is a must for history buffs and if you’re from SAARC countries then you get discount on entry ticket prices. "
Fort_St_George,ARedRose,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Not That Interesting,"The Fort is really the administration centre for Tamal Nadu, so not much to see.  The Museum was very disappointing and cost R200 and no photos.  Seriously there is not much that I would want to take a photo of.  The paintings are fairly interesting but the room of coins and old crockery are not!Wouldn't recommend it as there are plenty of other places to visit."
Fort_St_George,martevans,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,disappointment at the fort,"given the significance of Madras (Chennai) to the British East India Co I was expecting a more informative and well cared for museum at Fort St. George. This is a bit disappointing in terms of exhibits and general maintenance, a little sad. The site is currently an active military base and there is no freedom to explore the site of the original fort which has been cleared of any original walls moats etc"
Fort_St_George,Zinia F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Well worth visit to the past,"Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, if you aren't fascinated with history, but I had a lovely time.The incredible paintings of the past royals especially gave me goosebumps!"
Fort_St_George,Lovetotraveldubai,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Total waste of time,"You’d be strangling to find bits that represent the fort. It’s a messy wasteland with National Art Gallery, Museum and St.Mary’s church within its grounds. Do not loose any time on this one. Traveling hundreds of miles to see India I certainly did not thing my time was well used here. Boring and dirty. National gallery has a few good portraits and some reasonable contemporary art but not worth either the time or the money. The entrance fee for the lot is  250 + 25 for the camera."
Fort_St_George,sigzag,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Not wort your time,This country has so many amazing sites to visit so please do not waste your time here. Spend more time in other places. There is not much to see of a fort. Yes this place houses a few museums and the only one that is ok is the bronze museum. Max 20 minutes. All the others poor.
Fort_St_George,hareesha1,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,A reminder of the colonial era,"The first thing you notice is the tight security, for the fort complex houses the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly. The police are however very friendly. The fort museum is the only place to see for the tourist . There are no photos allowed inside. Thew museum contains many artifacts of the bygone era, but it is heavily biased towards the British, ands sort of glorifies the British rule here. You can spend an hour here."
Fort_St_George,Robert H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,More about the venue than the museum!,"Built by The British East India Company it now houses the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly. The fort museum houses an odd assortment of paintings along with weapons, coins, uniforms.More about the venue than the museum!"
Fort_St_George,Peter S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Fantastic historical site - with appalling interpretation,"Fort St George represents the genesis of British rule in south India. It was created in the mid-17th century and continually changed and strengthened through many iterations and  changes. It's still a working military and governmental installation, but visitors can freely walk around the fort seeing a wonderful range of historical buildings until stopped by various 'no entrance' signs. Several buildings (Clive's House, St Mary's church and the appalling Fort Museum) deserve reviews of their own. But in general, if you are at all interested in the physical manifestations of imperial military rule, take a wander around the fort. You can see the huge barrack blocks in which troops lived, see the massive ramparts and gates, and see how in many ways India has simply adopted the fabric of the fort to meet its own (actually very similar) needs. The up-keep and interpretation of this historical heritage is almost entirely absent (in Britain or Australia etc. everything old would be cared for and explained - in India, it's simply used but not explained). But at least you can see and photograph it, which I did. But the fort's buildings are very poorly maintained, and even a few yards from the 'lines' of the various military units (which are kept spotless) there is litter and rubbish everywhere - the moat is full of crap. This is disgraceful for any historical site dating from the 17th century (and the church is certainly that old in origins). As ever, India delights and disappoints in turn."
Fort_St_George,Swami1939,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017,British Marvel in Chennai,"The Fort St. George in Chennai - Previously known as Madras, is reportedly the first British establishment in the country, Fort St. George houses the oldest Anglican church in India and a museum. Built in 1644, the fortress originally served as a trading post until it became the birthplace of the modern Indian Army. Discover the history of the fort at the museum, which houses relics of the British rule, military memorabilia, and some colonial artwork. This fort is still under the control of the Military though the Tamil Nadu Assembly and the Secretariat are located inside the Fort."
Fort_St_George,Bhuvana S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,Decent but not great.,"My kids were very excited to go here but they were disappointed as there is not much to do. The museum keeps some coins, daggars from the british times and the fort also looks small. It is a good historic place but if you are having a huge expectation then it is going to fall short."
Fort_St_George,Tan T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Business,History of British Colonialism,"Museum is inside Fort St Thomas, a modern day Indian military base. Pass through the security screens and tell them you are visiting the museum. 200 rupees entry fee for foreigners. The museum building itself is disappointing. Exhibits inside a little sad and tired, truly relics of a bygone era. Coins, journals, uniforms and medals are on display. Classic grand full length portraits of the viceroys and their wives adorn the second story. Baleful eyes staring from Long ago. Queens and Kings, names resplendent of Asia - Dalhousie, Clive. The British legacy on display. A bygone era. Less than an hour."
Fort_St_George,worldwomantourist,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Famous old building in Chennai,"The building is quite famous in Chennai city among the local peoples. The architecture reflects the British intelligence. There is a museum very famous for the antiques and the artifact such as coins, medals, paintings and the letters used to communicate during olden days."
Fort_St_George,kashgo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,A good overview of the East India Company,We stopped in here as we had time to kill on our way to Madras Central Station. The entrance is cheap and you get to see part of the history of the British in India. There are about 6 rooms to explore and catch up on how the East India Company landed up in India and chose Madras to be their home.
Fort_St_George,marc l,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,good security very interesting,"give yourself time, there is a lot to see and don't forget to walk round to the church with all the plaques commemorating the English raj of the time. A lot to see and take in. As its within the government complex security is very high"
Fort_St_George,Atul G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,British Fort Worth Seeing,Fort St. George is the earliest fort built by the British to protect their first enclave in India against potential French aggression. Sadly we arrived here fairly late in the day and it closes at 5pm. There is quite a bit of police security as you enter given its prominence as a tourist site and the fact that the museum is located right next to a Navy compound (which is obviously off-limits to civilians). The architecture and layout is good to see and the museum itself is very good. Plenty of militaria from various foreign settlers including the British and French through the centuries as well as a fantastically detailed model of the entire fort are on display. If you can go upstairs you can see there are some amazing wall-length paintings of famous English monarchs and Indian maharajahs and nawabs. There is also access to the roof but we arrived to late to utilise it. Definitely see this place if you are in Chennai and have an hour to spare.

The objects on display in the museum are the weapons, coins, medals, uniforms and other arts from England, Scotland, France and India dating back to the period when Madras was ruled by the Britishers.The Fort now serves as the administrative headquarters for the legislative assembly of Tamil Nadu."
Fort_St_George,BALJIT SINGH S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017,A wonderful piece of ancient archieture which is rare due to its location close to sea.,"Many people dont know that in olden days the sea was coming upto the walls of the Fort.  Once the harbour was created, the sea receded.  That is why you can now see the Moat etc & the walls with the small windows embedded in them. I travel down this road at least once a week when I go to Ennore."
Fort_St_George,Harshalag,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Fort St. George of Chennai is a British architectural marvel,"One of the most striking buildings from early days is the Fort St. George Museum.

Fort_St_George,Lopaaaaa,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016,Landmark of Chennai,You can decide either to drive around it or even walk around it based on the amount of time you have at hand. The place gives you a nostalgic feeling of the British Raj in India as it one of the oldest forts built by the British in India. One can't help but admire the British architecture which still holds and looks good even today. The place could be better maintained by the authorities though.

Fort_St_George,Joji J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,"""one of the most important historical monument""","Fort St. George, the first fortress founded in India by the British in the year 1644 is currently the administrative HQ for assembly of Tamilnadu. The British East India Company constructed the Fort for trading activities and later lead to the formation of a settlement called ""George Town"" or as per Indian history as ""Black Town"". The Fort can be considered as two sections now a - The Fort Museum and St. Mary's Church. St. Mary's church is the oldest Anglican church in India and the tombstones in its graveyard the oldest British tombstones in India. The Fort Museum exhibits many relics of the British era like coins, weapons, uniforms, medals and other artefacts of the colonial period from India, England, France Scotland etc. The First Indian Flag after getting independance is exhibited in the 3rd floor of the Museum. The banquet hall in first floor holds paintings of the British Governor and other officials and we can see the canons of Tippu Sultan also. The three storied Fort building houses the office of the Chief Minister, other ministers and Government officials. Entry to some part of the Fort is restricted and to the new 10 storied building adjacent to the Fort but the while visiting the Fort we will come to know a lot more about the Colonial rule in India. Worth visiting this place."

The fort currently houses units of the Indian army.The museum, the only building open to the public, has a collection of historical documents, munitions, clothing, porcelain, and so on.  It has a model of the fort, as well as depictions of the various stages of building the fort.  It’s quite interestingStrangely there were absolutely no books or souvenirs to buy related to the fort, and it was against the rules to photograph text or graphics or any other exhibits in the museum.The museum is worth a visit in my view."

To enter this fort one has to take the beach road north of war memorial. One can enter the fort at the main entrance after security check up.

Fort_St_George,Northeagle66,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Not  very impressive but still worth a visit.,"The fort is mixed in a modern environnement so you do not get the same experience as when you visit an old and impressive historical fort.  You need to visit the museum to somehow get an idea of what the fort was and the importance it had in the past.  The fact that you will combine the visit with St Mary Church, which is in the footprint of the fort, is why I think it is still worth a visit when you are in Chennai."

Fort_St_George,PyttsPete,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,A remarkable monument to the pre colonial days.,"Worth visiting just to wonder at the fortitude and determination of the men and women who made the perilous journey from England to India and then built this in the 1600's. The downside is that almost all the Fort area is in modern day use by the Government, Naval College, and other departments, somewhat restricting what can be visited. However the museum just inside the Fort entrance is worthwhile and really shows just what a remarkable bunch of people they were, who built it. The entrance fee is 10 rupees for locals, and 100 rupees for tourists!!! As India was in the throes of a currency denomination change when we visited, it was impossible to obtain rupees and so had to barter with US dollars. The second building to visit is the Anglican Church, still used for services today, and the many fascinating tombstones that surround it. We found the easiest way of visiting the Fort was to use Uber - very cheap and very easy, with no chance of being overcharged! "

However,,the former officers mess now contains the Fort Museum,  with a wide range of exhibits covering the history of the fort, weapons, ceramics, coins, medals, British rulers and administrators, the Indian independence movement etc. Many of the exhibits, although interesting, are badly in need of better presentation- the silverware for instance is almost black and much of the beautiful ceramics have mould etc. The building itself is quite impressive, especially the ballroom upstairs. Lots of good stuff, badly needing lots of work. The temporary exhibit on the changing hairstyles throughout Indian history, with lots of great photos of stone carving etc was especially fascinating."
Fort_St_George,Akvince,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Historical Fort,"Built in the early 1600's, this is an fine example of old colonial architecture. St. Mary's Church is one of the oldest Anglican churches in the country."
Fort_St_George,ChrisJS51,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Good sample of Chennai history,Contains a useful museum and attractive Anglican church. Nowadays partly used by the military and partly by the local authorities.
Fort_St_George,Joanne,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,unimpressive,"There were some ok displays of swords, weapons and portraits in the museum, but you could do it all in 1 hour or less. Not at all interesting considering the local history. Needs a total redo and upgrade."
Fort_St_George,SydneySchoey,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Not worth the visit. Could be so much more.,"Given the role the British played in India's past this place could offer so much more. The artefacts and information in the museum are not presented well at all and the whole site is grubby and not well presented for tourists. Given the role of the British East India Company, this so called attraction was very disappointing. Not worth the visit."

Fort_St_George,TeamFlipFlop,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,"b b b boring!!! (sad, but true for us)","Made our way to Ft. St George yesterday and we were unimpressed. Tickets were 200 rupees per person, museum was poorly maintained, and had extremely limited info. The grounds around the museum were nice enough however we wouldn't recommend it."
Fort_St_George,sabnara,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Historical fort but needs better maintenance,"Fort St. George currently houses the assembly building as well as several govt. offices. Of great importance to visitors and history buffs are the museum, St. Mary's Church and Clive house.The entry fee for the museum is Rs.15. On entering, we would be greeted by a huge marble statue of Lord Cornwallis with a finely detailed bas-relief. This fine piece of art should have been in a better prominent place.Then, there were lots of clothes, canons, guns & ammunition on the ground floor. There is also a wooden cage into which a British officer was imprisoned.On the first floor, there are replicas of the coronation paintings of British monarchs who ruled India. This is in a huge hall. There is a coin collection too. Overall, it was a good place to visit, considering the history but the maintenance can be much better.Then we tried to go to Robert of Clive's house. It was behind the assembly building but you would have to go around it due to security reasons. Currently, this houses ASI's offices and exhibitions are held regularly. Just opposite to this is the Church of St.Mary. This contains several historical exhibits. There is nothing else to see in the fort.Overall, it is a good place to visit but it can be much better, considering that this was from where the city of Chennai originated."
Fort_St_George,SWmuse,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016,For history buffs only,"I wasn't enamoured at all about our visit. The Museum was poorly lit although it had a variety of objects from arms and armour to costumes and portraits but it was so poorly displayed that I just couldn't get excited. The Fort itself, represented by a scale model, cannot be reconciled without the greatest imagination, with the reality which can hardly be distinguished as being the same place. Overall I found it a very disappointing and dispiriting place. "
Fort_St_George,Jackie B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016,interesting look at British History,"This is nothing like all the other forts you see in India. IT is a secure area built by the East India company. There are a number of buildings which have been refurbished but still in period where government work is still carried out. The state cars of politicians are parked inside the grounds and it is quite busy with traffic. There are small museums with costumes Nr a rtifcts, guns etc. Also St Mary's church whereClive of India was married. All very busy and interesting. Worth a visit"
Fort_St_George,Anjali576,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,A good place of History,"Very neat and clean area, nice garden around.Many interesting buildings. Read from the web before visiting.

There's a through security check as it as in the same compound where the secretariat is . Entry fee is 15rs for adults (indians ) and 200rs for foreigners . The entire history of chennai is here. After you visit the museum don't forget to visit the church in the same compound .  I couldnt find any lifts in museum , so i guess people who are not able to climb steps will miss lots of things in the 1st ,2nd and third floor."

Fort_St_George,Issac0616,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Fort St. George - Travel back in history to know about Chennai!,"Fort St. George is located in the coastal area of Chennai where the Assembly of Tamilnadu is also located. Hence VIP movement and security checks will be there during the Assembly meetings.If you enter the museum you feel like we can feel the silent atmosphere with very less visitors during the day time.Better go alone with more time to spend inside.we can read the whole chennai history, how East India Company came and settled in Chennai and slowly captured the coastal places etc. The canons, guns, old maps, coins, Robert Clive's dress, letters, old madras patna's drawings etc will be nice to recall the history.Be prepared to climb the stairs on foot. No lift facility is availableWeek days are suitable to visit...Inside the fort, within 200 meters, you must visit the St.Mary's Church (200 years old) where one of the rare British style pipe organ is found."

Fort_St_George,JumboMumbai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,Heritage at its best,As you see the Fort building it reminds you of architetire that was typically British. That it has survived over centuries is testimonial to advances in this area.  Now there are govt offices in the fort but it is said to have been made to protect the land. A must see place.
Fort_St_George,Shivaram P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,Wonderful afternoon stroll,"there is an old museum in the precincts of the Legislative complex.  Entry to the museum is pretty cheap for Indians but more for Non Indians.The Fort comprises the legislative complex and also Army barracks, canteens etc.  the architecture is very old British and it is kept very clean. Be prepared for some tight security because of the Legislative Assembly security. "
Fort_St_George,LuizDutraNeto,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Visiting Chennai's birthplace!,"Whenever in Chennai, visiting ""Fort. St. George"" is indeed a must do! It dates as far back as 1644 and was the first English fortress in India! Historians tell it was built on uninhabited land along the shores of the Bay of Bengal and the old city of Madras (Chennai, today) evolved around the fortress. Amazing history! The construction, considered a military architecture wonder, was declared a protected monument by the ""Archaelogical Survey of India"" and includes some famous buildings, as ""St. Mary's Church"", ""The Fort Museum"", ""Wellesley House"", ""Clive House"" and many others. The complex houses also the headquaters of Tamil Nadu State Legislative Assembly. Take your time and enjoy ""Fort St. George"" with its quiet atmosphere, visit ""St. Mary's Church"" (the oldest Anglican church in India) and ""The Fort Museum"" (with relics of the ""British Raj""). This is Chennai and the exotic ""Coromandel Coast"" is in front of your eyes! Enjoy!"
