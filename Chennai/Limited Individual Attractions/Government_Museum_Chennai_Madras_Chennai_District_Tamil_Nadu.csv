Government_Museum,intrepid spacewoman spiff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Great place for a excursion ,"The building, the collection, architecture, every single thing about this place is steeped in rich history of India the Government museum itself is divided into various sections housing a plethora of stone and metallic artifacts. the added bonus is children's museum that houses toys and various things of a child's interest in a chronological order"
Government_Museum,Eileen108,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,HUGE Sprawling Museum,"This place is absolutely HUGE! Several sprawling buildings house the excellent displays on all subjects from history, plant, animal, culture, everything! Some of the displays are in serious need to maintenance, though. You could easily spend several days here."
Government_Museum,Joseph Carlton,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Business,Gothic building and good collection,The museum is an fantastic gothic building and stands out. The collection is quite fascinating. I spent the most time in Bronze statues. Don't miss the sections of bronze from Chola period. Quite a memorable visit.
Government_Museum,sheetal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Solo,Great Chola bronzes,"I am an art lover and how come someone skip the Chola bronzes and you get to see some of the most exquisite pieces of that period. Dancing Nataraja, Kalyansunder, different saints, deity etc all casted painstakingly in bronze. Its just in the centre of city."
Government_Museum,jgkrishnan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Museum to visit at Chennai,It is in heart of the city. Nice collections. Good arrangements. Parking facility available. Must see location. 
Government_Museum,Gayathri P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Very Informative and must visit place,"One of the well organised and maintained museum in TamilNadu, India.They have seperate wings and galleries for each section and they have exclusive kids museum which will be good learning cum fun for kids. connemara library is also located and functioning in this premises."
Government_Museum,Honisoiquimalypense,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Neat (fabulous) bronze section.,"We paid a flying visit to this Museum to see the famous Chola bronzes.  This is a superb collection of bronzes spread over 2 floors, some dating back over 1000 years. Lost of depictions do Shive, Vishnu and Parvati. The most famous is the Ardhanarishvara bronze which is half Shiva (  male right half)  and Shakti (female left half) each with their respective sensual attributes!We had no time to see anything else - there were neat buildings there but some needing repair!"
Government_Museum,Wil Chung,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Mixture of great and awful,"Visited here solo to take in more of Indian and Tamil life. The museum is made up of a number of buildings each with their own unique galleries. The cost for foreigners is 250 (Indians is just 15). I understand a ""tourist tax"" but the multiple is huge!The good first - bronze exhibits, stone sculptures and contemporary arts were gorgeous. Whilst pretty much everything else was terrible. The natural history exhibits were very old and not really well looked after, whilst the children's museum is pretty laughable (see picture of Indian costumes)It is a good way to spend some time in Chennai, I was just expecting more. Not angry, just disappointed."
Government_Museum,Cathy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Business,Outstanding,The building is magnificent and so is the bronze collection. I spend a couple of hours just at the bornzw sculpture section. Very good place to spend a couple of hours
Government_Museum,AURELIO L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,see it,"it s an interesting experiene to see the museums,you can begin to study indian art and indian culture "
Government_Museum,Mrudula,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Suburb of chennai,This is the very old museum in chennai and the architecture is built as in the Indo-Sarcenic style and it has huge collection of articles
Government_Museum,1777NT,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A typical dull drab Indian Museum,"From the far north of India to the deep south and everywhere in between there a dull drab poorly maintained crumbling buildings purporting to be marvellous museums. The general trend (and I have been coming to India since 1982) is to have little to no illumination, poor signage, glass cases that haven't been cleaned for decades. Nothing to try to attract visitors.The Chennai Government Museum was terrible, construction work going on all over the site, some excavated trenches that had clearly been open for years, filthy inside the building, a large percentage of it ""closed for renovation""  - by the look of it, for the last ten years.  No refreshment facilities, no information for visitors, a few staff asleep on stools scattered around this dire failure, and NO air-conditioning, which incidentally is useful for exhibits as well as visitors.  The system is obviously in need of serious financial input, a good way to start is to have suitable money raising add-ons, like restaurants, souvenir shops, rather than rip-off the foreigners with the disgusting system of charging them considerably more than locals.  Hope British Cathedrals/Museums latch on to that gimmick !!It's a disgrace that such a valuable collection of Cholla Bronzes are impossible to see."
Government_Museum,Milind Kshirsagar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Huge collection but bad maintenance,"It has numerous galleries housing rare collectibles. However some galleries are I'll maintained. Whatever, just go for it. The contemporary art gallery is having original paintings of Raja Ravi Varma."
Government_Museum,Adele Augustin,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Big disappointment ,I am very disappointed with my visit to the museum. We were told that they would close in half an hour right after they sold us the tickets. There is absolute chaos in the complex. Everything is in serious repair and there are no signboards. It is appropriate to keep it closed while repairs are in progress.
Government_Museum,Richard7,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Night at the Museum,"I love museums. If you don't like museums, then this is not the best place to start. I walked from Thousand Lights metro station so was pretty hot when I arrived. Most exhibition halls are not air-conditioned but they have a few fans. I was going to start with the bronzes, but the power was off, and it was pitch black in there. The main section had some windows but it was still pretty gloomy until the lights came on. By now I was ready for more macabre, and the moth-eaten stuffed animals did not disappoint. Take your kids to the Childrens Museum, inside the (airconditioned!) hall there are models of dissected animals and body parts. Elsewhere I found a cabinet with human skulls and best (worst!) of all, a wooden device used for human sacrifice. If you are looking for something else, you may find it in the eclectic cabinets. Some things are pretty shabby, but if you go with an open mind and a bit of imagination, you'll have a good day."
Government_Museum,Bhalaji N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Good place lacking lot of attention,"If you have kids, its a must visit. Its filled with lot of valuable things for them to learn. As expected its a poorly maintained place, dusty and little bad lighting. If you spend a a good time one day wont be enough to cover all."
Government_Museum,Ronan P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"Some wonderful collections, housed in a poor setting","The artefacts held in the museum are astonishing ,but they are housed in a way which gives concern for the future.The rooms were hot, with fans here and there, but the heat and the humidity are both things which modern museums seek to avoid. The buildings are vast, and filled with treasures. It is, in many ways, what traditional museums used to be before they went all high-tech and interactive. But the content (aside from a few rather horrid examples of old-school taxidermy) is fabulous. The collections of Hindu sculptures is fantastic. Having looked at similarly dated examples in Europe, the Indian statues are far more sophisticated. Incredible objects are found in profusion, but there could be more explanation.Having said that, the buildings (there are several) were filled with ordinary Indian families, who all seemed to be having a good time.I'm really glad I saw the collections.My favourite items were some artefacts from the Indus Valley civilisation, a wonderful little bronze Mother Goddess figure, and some huge copper plate collections of legal documents on gigantic rings, showing a way of keeping vital deeds and contracts in a climate where paper documents, or most other media, would perish."
Government_Museum,Krishnaveni S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Family,Amusing museum but needs maintenance,"It is a vast museum. We saw the main building with various sections inside. There is stone sculptures belonging to various era. The zoology section has skeleton of whale which makes you feel as if you are inside it's stomach. There is sections of reptiles, birds and mammals. It is really well maintained. We also went to the children's section, which has dolls representing various states and also many countries. A walk through prehistoric times to various civilization is very enlightening. Some of the things in the science section is not maintained and doesn't work. Even the playground needs lots of maintenance.We went to the building having the stamp and coins collection. Learnt  lots of thingsWe were very tired by then and skipped the archaeological section. I really wish there was a canteen in the museum complexOn the whole I recommend every one to go there with their kids"
Government_Museum,JPHStVincent,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,a place that is hard to rate,"It is very hard to give an overall rating, some aspects of the museum deserve a 5, others deserve a 1. There is a superb collection of stone carvings and a wonderful collection of bronzes, but the way that they are displayed leaves so much to be desired. At lot of the stone carvings, statues and more, are just in a room, pretty much any how. Some effort has been put into the bronzes, but not enough. Some of the historic sections of the buildings are in desperate need of repair. Work is currently going on, and a number of galleries are closed, but most of the effort seems to be directed towards laying drains in the grounds. This could be a really great museum, but it needs a curator with a vision and (most of all) a decent budget. That said, I would always go back for another visit!"
Government_Museum,bjerkseth,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo, Beautiful treasures in terrible environment ,"I had so looked forward to see the Government Museum in Chennai, which houses antiquities, a zoological section, etc. one can see that the buildings are pretty old, should not be surprised to hear they are from the time of the British. There are virtually hundreds of statues from various time periods, and from Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Wonderful work in stone. Everything is a terrible setting, either they lack money or the curator does not have a clue. The settings are very old, at times destroyed. Light fixtures are placed close to the Art, so when you want to take a photo, it’s impossible to do a good one without getting a light fixture on top. Labeling is also very badly placed. Background colors are not attractive, plywood in many rooms, which was at times broken. I was super disappointed, and the Government needs to act fast in order to get the Museum up to standard; such a wonderful collection, some of them in old-fashioned, dusty cabinets. Continuing in to the section with stuffed animals. May be good for school children. For others it’s a cabinet of horrors. Stuffed animals from a bygone time (British Raj?). Some lacking fur, some lacking feathers, and a plaster dinosaur up in all of it. Made for very sad sightings. Looking out of one of the windows I saw virtually hundreds of antiquities in the open air, wonderful carvings of various deities, standing among weed. The walkway was so full of weed and grass that I would not dare to walk there, in case of snakes. I tried to find them when I came out, impossible. It did not make matters better when a silver colored bolero car almost drove me down, inside the museum compound. Sad, sorry, but true. All of it. "
Government_Museum,Bala Tripura S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Nice Architectural musuem,"This musuem had a very nice collection of stone ruins of Amaravathi,Penugonda,Biccavole etc  from AP ,Tanjavur,Pudukkottai of Tamilnadu &bellary of karnataka.There are separate buildings for stone carvings,Bronze,Coins gallery etc.There is a open auditorium where some stone carvins are kept which visitors can touch and take photographs.This musuem is at walkable distance from city bus stop"
Government_Museum,Raghu1943,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Good collection,"It has several sections,stone sculptures,bronze statues,animals, birds etc. Some of the sections were under renovation.Bronze collections are from 10 th century onwards,shows the advancement of technology in those times.There is a section for children also."
Government_Museum,Greengrassbros,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Not an amusing museum,"To be fair, we did not go with a guide. That being said, the museum was large and full of objects with no descriptions. Unlike other places in India, there were not guides to hire at the location. The museum had no air conditioning and it seemed that the treasured there were not being taken very good care of. After having seen many of the statues and work in the rightful places throughout the country, this museum was disappointing.The children's museum was very pathetic. There was what could have been a nice play ground in the back that were based on scientific teachings, but a lot of that equipment was rusty and broken or missing vital pieces."
Government_Museum,Jaision A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Good Museum,"One of the oldest museums in India, or second oldest museum precisely, is in Indo-saracenic style. Houses several things related with human history and culture. It's also famous for a vast Italian collection, probably largestboutside of Europe. Loved the Chola bronzes. Children's museum and art-gallery is also worth to visit. Don't miss if in Chennai."
Government_Museum,TravellingSands,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Treasure Trove of Exhibits. Needs better Care !,"This is a must see attraction with thousands of exhibits in a variety of topics under 11 major sections and numerous sub sections. However, the maintenance is poor and there is much to be desired. Foreigners pay a fee of Rs 250 for entry. It is open on all days from 0930 to 1700 hrs"
Government_Museum,CK T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Worth to spend a few more hours to know the history of Tamil Nadu and India,"The museum is scattered in a few buildings and the artifacts are tremendous. I would suggest the visitor spend at least 4-5 hours or even a whole day to see all the artifacts. We arrived afternoon and was regret with the limited time left. The entrance fee for foreigner is high, but it is worth to visit."
Government_Museum,Praveenop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,The best Bronze collection in India and perhaps the world itself,The Chennai Government Museum is famous for 2 things its Bronze collection which is outstanding and its architecture which is stupendous. The Art gallery building is stupendous building along with the auditorium. It also has a great collection of rock sculpture which is not maintained well. Why the TAMIL NADU GOVERNMENT does not  take care of its priceless collection of antiques and architecture would have crossed many of its visitors but in spite of this it is worth a visit especially if you like Architecture and Bronze arts and statues.
Government_Museum,Nanthakumar Ganesan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Very Important visit for the people like to learn old culture,Very Important visit for the people like to learn old culture of wholel india..It is very nice place for all students.
Government_Museum,Ianfung,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,GOOD BUT VERY HOT!,Limited resource and hence no air-con ( maybe 1 or 2 rooms have air-con ). Basically it have many items but maybe the best are the bronze collection. Well worth visit....
Government_Museum,Karpagavalli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018,built during the British period,"The building is a red in colour which makes it unique and reminds the british era in India, chennai.this houses numerous arts,sculptures and has even a library within it making a good daytime pass "
Government_Museum,Igirl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,"Some Lovely,  Rare Collections","Located at Egmore, this huge museum is spread over 6 separate buildings.  The Natural History and the bronze collections really do stand out along with some lovely sculptures in an outside setting.    Other interesting collections include archaeological,  crafts, costumes, musical instruments, coins and paintings.  Two rather grand statues of the former Kings of England and Emperors of India, Edward VII and George V have been relegated to a place at the rear of the Museum.Well worth a visit."
Government_Museum,SmithaCherian,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,A great museum with tons of exhibits,A great museum with many exhibits. A day is not enough to go about the museum. So many different collections and well kept. But the way the exhibits are displayed and the maintenance should be improved. I was thinking if these were in some other countries they would have show cased it well and have demanded a good amount to see and would have publicised it well and made a good otvof money. You need to check this place out it’s teally awesome. But make sure you have the patience and carry loads of water to keep your self hydrated
Government_Museum,kathy b,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,The Bronze collection is outstanding.,"We were a small group with a guide and I was glad.  I learnt so much on this visit.  The subtle difference between the different Gods, how to tell a fake and how to appreciate the  history of the displays.  The bronzes were magnificent pieces of art but the story behind them was so much more important.  The collection was beautifully displayed and presented. thank you"
Government_Museum,hurricanekatrinarule,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Arranged Tour - but no commentary,This is a very good museum if you are interested in history and artefacts.  It is on two levels and I don't think there is a lift.  We were left to wander around - it was open on a Sunday.  You can get as much or as little as you want from the visit.  There is a charge to enter - it can take as little as 20 minutes to probably 60 if you read everything that is written.  Some lovely bronzes though.
Government_Museum,KMSMANIAN1049,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,One of the oldest Museums in the country,"One of the oldest Museums in the country, very well arranged , well maintained, worth visiting by all those interested in the countries history."
Government_Museum,SteveS1970,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Interesting museum complex,There are a lot of interesting displays in here including old statues of Hindu gods which are very impressive. It leads into a natural history section with a skeleton of a whale along with plenty of stuffed animals.Worth a visit if around.
Government_Museum,jayakumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Worth visiting once but not so appealing!,A lot of exhibits spanned between many buildings but none of the staff were ready to help out or guide the families. One would be clueless if you do not speak Tamil and nightmare to many of the foreigners. Tips being accepted by staff for explaining or guiding them.Government can introduce guided trips and collect money officially which is also a good revenue to make. No parking slips provided nor there is good cafeteria to quench thirst.
Government_Museum,Shaji Joseph,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,most attractive place to visit,"it is a very good museum well maintained, it is situated in a large area which you have to walk and see but it is time work.  Its covers ancient time monuments  etc.."
Government_Museum,rsraghavan6,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Good place to see,"This place has a huge collection of varied artifacts, quite interesting place to visit. Must go through leisurely, so might need more than half day to visit all the 5 blocks. Young kids may not find it interesting except a few exhibits here and there, but adults will love the place and the exhibits. Comfortable parking and a good place to spend a day out."
Government_Museum,Richard B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Superb galleries of classic Chola bronzes .,"If you have any interest in Indian art this place is a must !  Housed in a ramshackle colonial building the exhibits , for the most part , are poorly lit and uninteresting except for building 3 which houses an amazing collection of classic Indian bronze sculptures of dancing Siva's , Ganesh and Kali. These works are well lit , superb and well worth a look.  250rp . Open Saturday to Thursday."
Government_Museum,Nitesh Rajput,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Very under maintained,This government museum has some primitive statues and some old artefacts. The most striking feature or attractive thing about this is the collection of paintings from the British era. Some paintings are of great painter Raja Ravi Verma.
Government_Museum,Kathleen P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,A Good Introduction to India ,This was one of the first places that was visited. It was informative and covered a large space of time in history. It was a good eye opener for me as I knew a little about a little of India. There were many classes of school children on a field trip to the museum so that must mean it is a good place for some historical information. 
Government_Museum,nanuaa,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,"Average experience, could have been maintained much better",Went with high expectations.- Not much to see.- Science and kids museum was completely waste (not much to see as a learning experience.- Some art and craft are good to see (some paintings of Ravi Verma and old sculptures)
Government_Museum,Ranjani S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Great place to see South Indian artifacts ,"The museum has 6-7 buildings that are part of the exhibit. Fee is nominal for Indian citizens. You have to pay extra for taking photos. So make sure you get tickets for it if you plan to take photos inside the buildings or else employees confesticate the phones or cameras without ticket. The building with sculptures shows us beautiful examples from era gone by from southern India and also from Buddhist and Jainism. It also houses natural science museum with fossils, meteoroid, crystals, skeleton of whales, elephant, dinosaurs and real life models of wild animals and birds exclusive to India. Also has a working model of dinosaurs which is great fun for kids!The bronze gallery is an amazing exhibit showcasing Saivism and Vaishnavism sculptures.Don't miss the newly opened coins and stamps gallery which is housed behind the sculpture gallery. There's a very small board which leads to the building, ask any employee and they'll take you there. It houses coins from different eras, stamps from all around the world and currency from different eras too. The art gallery houses Raja Ravi Varma paintings and Tanjore paintings in addition to modern art. The children's gallery has dolls from various regions and showcases and entire floor of live size dolls in different clothing from different eras and different parts of India. Don't miss this too!Couple of buildings are under renovation so you can't see it. The Connemara library is one of the oldest and largest libraries in Chennai. It houses hordes of books and rare manuscripts. Also has beautifully done stained glass windows"
Government_Museum,Ollossm,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Some great displays,"The sheer size of the museum is impressive! Lots of galleries over 6 unitsWhat's on display is amazing, the bronzes and carvings are must visits.Whilst the exhibits were amazing sadly the same can't be said for the display housing and buildingsHas a very run down, shabby feel to it. Staff more interested in mobile phones than anything else.Staff are also next to useless when it comes to deterring touts who offer tours of the museum or for explanation of what's in a cabinet them expecting a fee..all right in front of staff who either ignored issue or had head buried in mobile phoneGovt should, on one hand, be very ashamed they've let it become so run down with poor staffing but on the other they've ensured some beautiful treasures have been preserved and displayedTaking everything into account this is well worth the entry fee and well worth you investing some of your time to enjoy & marvel at the exhibits"
Government_Museum,Toby G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,"Lots of stuff, poorly maintained ","Large selection of various thing on display but put together very poorly. The buildings are sad and not well maintained. Needs a clean. Some very nice buildings, however. "
Government_Museum,rudrakumar2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Poor,Dimly lit dusty and poor maintenance. Most of the staff were on their mobile phones texting or watching videos. Some of the female staff sitting on the benches meant for public with there legs stretched. The display glasses could be cleaned. Felt sad about the neglect.
Government_Museum,ekta s,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,The focal point is a huge Whale skeleton,"Museum is a typical government Museum which has a huge scope of improvement but has amazing historical things for viewing. They have sculptures related to Hinduism, Buddhism and jainism along with various fossils and preserved remains which could be a great history lesson for kids. They also have a huge Whale skeleton hanging mid hall and one entire gallery is dedicated to coins and stamps from all over the world. There are around six galleries so it will easily take 3-4 hours to cover all of them. One of the galleries - national art gallery has a good collection of paintings but remaining ones were still under renovation. Some part of the galleries is also disable friendly with stairlifts. "
Government_Museum,DAVID J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Poorly maintained museum,"This is a typical government museum, which could have been maintained better. However, one can't blame considering the fact that the entry ticket is only Rs.15. The entire compound is quite vast with multiple buildings and lush green trees nestling fruit bats and other birds.There are two main galleries and then a third bronze gallery.  One of the galleries exhibit anthropology related items : olden warfare equipments, models/photos of dresses and houses used by various tribal groups etc. The second gallery is more diverse covering multiple aspects - historic sculptures of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain deities, olden musical instruments, exhibits of various folk dances, science-related exhibits, etc. There's a dinosaur show at specific timings for school kids.The buildings look pretty much run-down with wooden creepy stair-cases and windows. It appears that no one has ever ventured to several corners of the upper storeys of the galleries. I could see cobwebs, pigeon excreta etc at multiple places (a few rooms have AC though). Nevertheless, the building evokes a rustic charm and drove me nostalgic of my lost childhood."
Government_Museum,rodhall3199,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,"Run down, shabby but some great hidden gems","Yet another government facility that is dirty and run down.  Never seen so many overweight staff doing nothing.  Dirt on everything.  Lights off in many areas.  Floors, picture frames, wall, paths, etc all lacking cleaning.  Rubbish not picked up.  Silverfish inside art frames.  Many items without dates.  Shabby and something the government should be very ashamed of.  Plus it’s not that there are not staff there.  They just sit around chatting.  No real supervision of displayed art work and shifting dirt from A to B is not cleaning.  Pity to see a regions heritage treated so badly.  Clearly no responsible management and no one In the bureaucracy taking any responsibility .. just their salaries."
Government_Museum,Dilip Kumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,A treasure trove for all ,"Museums generally sound boring. But not the case with Egmore museum.All age groups have something to enjoy here. Firstly for the kids there are two mechanized dinosaurs- one triosaurs and another flying dinosaurs. They are real fun to watch for kids but also for elders. The dinosaurs look realistic too. There are various animals skeleton, models, skins etc. But top attraction is the skeleton of blue whale. However kids playing area is a disappointment. For history buffs - the museum is a treasure trove - starting from the Mother goddess of harappan to the bronze idols of Nataraja  , the museum houses lots of sculptures. There is a library right in the center of museum complex. Some books are sold in the museum complex on museums, archaeology and history. Apart from this there are various other things. Many of the equipment in the science wing have become old and given up. Some sections of the museum requires overhaul.Nevertheless it is a place to be and moreover ticket is economical. "

Government_Museum,SirBritishMike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018,A Bizarre & Surreal Experience,"I preface this review by saying that this is not a perfectly maintained, shiny, polished museum to learn about things in great detail. That being said, I had a weird and wonderful experience wandering around these buildings for a few hours. It was more like an old curiosity shop/haunted house than a museum. There were rooms full of dusty artifacts, terrible taxidermy, and abnormal fetuses in jars of liquid. No explanations, no discernible logic. It was hot, it was dark, it was super creepy, and I loved it. "

Government_Museum,Prasobh K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018,Good collection of artifacts and sculptures...maintenance needs to be better!!,Egmore Govt. Museum is one of the top tourist draws in Chennai city and is a wonderful experience for lovers of history. The maintenance of the entire Museum however is poor and several sections were closed or under renovation. Main Building has several stone sculptures and archaeological artifacts. The animals and aquatic section with the whale skeleton was impressive and will keep kids interested. The bronze scultures section with the magnificent Natarajas is another key attraction. The Art Gallery has some British era paintings and Ravi varma paintings which were a treat to enjoy.

Government_Museum,patricklauwers2017,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,"Beautiful, but don’t go yet!",Everything is under construction. It contains very beautiful bronze statues. It is very good. But ... you pay full admission fee and can see less than half. This is a rip off. So wait ubtill construction is done. At this raid it could take years. 
Government_Museum,KaviKavi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,Totally run down - but worth seeing for a a few things.,"Go ONLY for the bronzes. They are quite a marvel. The Ravi Varma paintings and other paintings in the art gallery are also great. Everything else is in sad shambles. The campus is also lovely (dusty and falling apart, but huge trees and quiet and green) and an oasis in the middle of the city bustle. "
Government_Museum,Sram81,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Huge Museum...needs maintenance.,"Located in the heart of city is this wonderful museums. Its pretty big with a variety of displays. We can see old manuscripts, sculptures, weapon, a small science park, stuffed animals/ birds/fish, paintings. As mentioned though its very huge, still need lots of maintenance. Lots of dust, bored staff except for one gentleman in the painting section. With proper attention and bit more planned layout this has potential to be one of the best in India. Good parking facility, can become very hot during the summer. Only few sections are air conditioned."
Government_Museum,pnssnp,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,good collection of bronze and stone artefacts,the entry ticket is just rs.15/-  it is interesting for primary school students due to its collection of birds and animals. there are skeletons of several animals and a sculpture of a dinosaur is animated to move its head and produce sounds which fascinates them. but the centenary exhibition seems to be permanently closed and the modern art section  
Government_Museum,Dianclair,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,Viewed the outside and the grounds...,"This museum was part of a half day tour and not included in the cost of the tour. We decided not to go inside but to stay outside. I love museums in general, but this one had poor reviews and I enjoyed being outside."
Government_Museum,David H,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Great Bronzes ,The museums are well worth a visit.Allow at least two hours.The buildings are very hot so get there early.Sadly the buildings are not well maintained.Entrance fees for foreign ers is 250 rupees with a fee of 200 rupees if you have a camera.
Government_Museum,Lovetotraveldubai,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Along with the National Art Gallery ( part of same complex) : waste of time!,The only thing worth seeing is the collection of bronze artifacts. The art gallery is very small. Obviously no one cares about it . The staircase has half an inch of dust that hasn’t seen a broom in a decade. The whole complex is dull and poorly maintained. Very few exhibits. Waste of time.
Government_Museum,Christine Z,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,definitely worth a stop!,"This is a great stop to indulge in some local history.  This museum is extremely accessible and has wonderful displays ranging from snakes to geology to geography.  some of the displays from areas around the world (check out the winter wear on the Hawaii display in the Children's museum) are a little inaccurate, but the local artifacts are extremely fascinating."
Government_Museum,Ann M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,OK - interesting,"A lot of 'stuff' there and interesting to browse through it for a while, but for me, an hour was enough."
Government_Museum,Eric G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Focus Your Visit,"The museum complex is composed of many different types of exhibitions. If you are interested in Indian art and history, go straight to the sculpture galleries on the 2nd floor and then to the bronze sculpture exhibition that is in a separate building. You will need 2 hours to cover these.  "
Government_Museum,hareesha1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,A treasure trove of treasures,"The museum has a wide variety of collections of everything ranging from sculptures , artifacts . to  weaponry and fossils  . The sculptures present here are antique and many are more than a thousand years old, some older than that .You must not miss the bronze museum , Its is simply divine and has abronxze sculptures of lord shiv. I cannot describe the feelings that i felt when i saw  the statue of lord natatraja , so intricately carved but at the same time so powerful You name anything , and the Government museum has an exhibit on it.It is a great place to take your kids and kindle their interest in science  . But be warned, it is huge. It will take half a day to explore the museum ( which has many different sections and buildings)Only complaint is poor maintenance, which is very sad considering the fact that there are many priceless sculptures and artifacts housed here."
Government_Museum,ravikumartalara,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,nice place to spend kids,it will take two hours to visit entire place. good place to hangout with kids. dinosaur is superb.one of top ten attraction in chennai
Government_Museum,Cherianthomas,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Business,Wide range of artefacts from South India,There was a wide collection of artefacts over the centuries mainly from South India. Generally well documented - but overall the facility could be upgraded.
Government_Museum,Musafir69,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Magnificent ancient bronzes and idols,"What can one say about Indian museums that hasn't been said before? Some of the most stunning examples of art from antiquity kept in rather sad conditions of public display. The Madras Museum is no exception, sadly. Its musty exhibits and ill-maintained display cases however contain some of the country's greatest art treasures. A particular highlight is the Chola Bronzes section, with several magnificent Natarajas on display. Some outdoor displays also have great examples of ancient statuary and sculpture from across South India. Another section has some fine and rather famous paintings too but displayed in the most sad fashion, with bad lighting. When will the government spruce up such places and aggressively promote heritage and history to the largely apathetic students who are usually marched past these exhibits? One can only hope"
Government_Museum,GeethaBasappa,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Could have been so much better...,"Visited this museum despite the many negative reviews listed out on Tripadvisor.There are many impressive pieces of art, some  are more than a thousand year old, such as the  bronze and stone  statues. The Ravi Verma paintings were also quite impressive. Particularly also liked the doll section, with dolls with different regional attire. However, many sections were closed, and it was really sad to see the state of all the rooms. There was dust everywhere and some parts such as the children's activity area, was beyond acceptable. Would hope that some effort is put into bringing this museum to a reasonable conditions, as some of the exhibits are priceless and amazing examples of our history!!"
Government_Museum,Lilian J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Learn about culture,A lovely place to visit and learn about ancient and modern Chennai. A number of rare artifacts are on display. 
Government_Museum,YashiR25,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Visit for Dinosaur Simulation,"The place is situated at the heart of city. Easy to reach. That said, the museum is not well maintained and the staff may not be really polite, but if you are an explorer and a history buff, this is for you. The highlight is the Dinosaur Simulation - it moves as and when someone approaches it. Don't forget to get yourself clicked at the photogenic ancient bench :D"
Government_Museum,Olivier R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Interesting but overpriced (as it is in December 2017),"This is surely not a world class museum, but it is an interesting regional Indian museum, notably for the bronzes and sculptures collections. As others have written, it is somewhat poorly maintained and there is dirt almost everywhere. But I don't think it should refrain from visiting the place. I've seen the same situation in other Indian museums, including in Delhi and it is obviously a result of limited investments by the government rather than a lack of interest by the staff.As for the zoological and geological collections, I'd say they could be skiped if you've already visited one of the major natural history museum of the world: those galleries are quite uneasy to enjoy, considering how old and derelict the exhibits are.Unfortunately, many galleries are closed (December 2017), so the result is an overpriced entrance fee."
Government_Museum,Robert H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Outstanding collection of bronzes,"Spend your time in the rooms with the bronze statues. When you enter ther are good stone carvings but it is the bronze work that stands out. The early ones from about 10th century arespecially good. You can walk around the back of the display cases to see the detail close up. A must see.They do charge a high fee, relative to others , to take photos but simply pay it!"
Government_Museum,Sugu_thegreat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,Must Visit,Madras Museum is one of the oldest and finest place. Lot of places including Old Shark bone etc placed. Oldest sculptures and other things are here. Kids should be taken and explained of the fact for better understanding our culture and people.
Government_Museum,goduke2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,Must see attraction in Chennai!,"The amount and variety of ancient artifacts is amazing. It makes one really appreciate ancient Indian/Hindu culture. The Amaravati sculpture exhibit from 2000 years ago and the Chola bronzes from 1000 years ago are the highlights. Also, must see the collection of Raja Ravi Varma paintings including the famous Shankuntala. Yes, the museum is hot, and signs not clearly marked, descriptions of artifacts are poor, there are stray dogs running around the grounds, no water, and the bathrooms are dirty, but it's India. If visiting Chennai, one must visit this museum!"
Government_Museum,sharantotalfoodie,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,The museum needs to be kept in a museum!,"The museum speaks volumes about how antique the exhibits are, with ZERO customer/audience orientation. More than a third of the sections in each of the 5 buildings are closed/under permanent renovation. The bronze gallery is by far the best. The children's museum and the anthropology section can be given miss on all days and twice on Sundays!Better man-power deployment to maintain this heritage property and guide the customers better is mandatory!Amenities are figuratively non-existent - the toilets are extremely poor."
Government_Museum,hollySalisbury,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,Bronze statues are a must see.,There is a large room of bronze statues of many of the gods dating back to the eleventh  and twelfth centuries.  Very interesting but you really need a knowledgable guide to help you understand them.
Government_Museum,skkkd,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,165 years old museum,this is 165 years old museum.entry ticket is just 15 rs but camera ticket is 200rs .so we  took  photos out side the buildings.
Government_Museum,VjZen,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Poorly Maintained,"Ample car parkingRestrooms - Not cleanGood amount of exhibitsMilk / Icecream available in Avin kiosk.Dust everywhere - not much of cleaning done.Entry fee is very low, probably they can increase it and bring in private vendor for housekeeping.Good half a day outing for kids."
Government_Museum,Atul G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,Full of exhibits!,"The Museum is located within a complex that has several other buildings of historical importance. Once inside the museum, you can see many items throughout Indian history from prehistory to more recent times. The ground floor has many statues of deities and animals, many of which are in very good condition given how old they are. My favourites were old stone carvings and tablets with inscriptions in very ancient Indian languages with a character map showing how close they are to contemporary Indian languages. Further into the museum, there are less impressive natural history areas, including a quite loud animatronic T-Rex (which I initially didn’t know was capable of moving until I got quite a surprise). The animals on show are in reasonable condition but the layout and presentation is lacking and very dated sadly. But it is definitely worth visiting for the first half. I would have included more photos but photography is prohibited inside the museum. "
Government_Museum,Thusanee L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,"So much artifacts, and so much knowledge!","This is  great place to spend a whole day with. The museum has so many themed exhibitions, and there are so much knowledge in each. My favorite was Hindu and Ancient sculptures. Hats off to them who preserved these sculptures and pillers so well. Another one which made me gasp will you find in the Mammals gallery. A room full of Wet Specimen, from parasites and bacterias to embryo of an elephant. Worth a visit! One minor thing which could be better, is the tidiness of the place. Outside and inside."
Government_Museum,Thoufeeque B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Good,It's one of the famous museums in Tamil Nadu and has great artistic features of prehistoric and modern day amenities and facilities.

Government_Museum,DrSJ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Good exhibits display poor,"This is a museum with good things on display , however the maintenance and upkeep is very poor. I hope the government outsources the maintenance to a private firm. The information displayed is satisfactory. There are many exhibits which are touched by people who visit this museum so some measures have to be taken to avoid this. The paintings inthe art gallery are very good, however again, displayed in a pathetic manner. Prized possessions like Raja Ravi Varma are not very well illuminated and the photo frames need to be restored to their original glory. The cannons that are displayed outside are also very good and have to be displayed indoors with proper history."
Government_Museum,FredrickTerrance,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,A nice kid's spot!!,I didn't expect my kids to enjoy a lot until I reached there. There are a lot of things that kids from various ages would enjoy and also learn. This is a good place to spend a 2-3 hours if haven't taken your kids here yet.There is a lot of scope for maintenance and I really hope that the government invests on this and makes this a real kids' day out place so that all kids from various parts of the city and state would enjoy and learn.
Government_Museum,Mohammed Sohail Ahmed,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Solo,Not @ all recommended,Worst place to visit. The place is in dilapidated state. No mapping and no staff available. Total mismanagement.

Government_Museum,Carlos Scott Lopez,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Okay - but horrible pricing scheme demands skipping it!,"Quite notable museum, but the pricing scheme charging foreigners almost 1,600% more (250 Rupees) than locals (15 Rupees) is horrible.One can charge 10% more -- or even as much as 20% more -- but over 1,600% more is unconscionable - and really demands that one avoid supporting this institution.Indeed, seeing wealthy Indians coming to visit - while students on small budgets are charged so much more - or denied entry at the fair price - is painful and saddening to watch.Avoid this place - and don't support such a disrespectful approach to visitors."
Government_Museum,Ghiri T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,the oldest in Chennai,It is the oldest museum in Chennai and second in India.It is located in Egmore.It preserves all the materials used by our great rulers. It gives a great knowledge of our Indian culture.
Government_Museum,Ambati K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Good ,There are seven different buildings which all are not usually open at the same time. Summa buildings have better displays than the others. The bronze showcase is the best kept and displayed of all of them.
Government_Museum,Aaron,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,A well-traveled Westerner review ,"First off, what is a gem to one person isn't always to another. This is just my personal opinion. At the time of my review admission is Rs.15 for Indians and Rs.250 for foreigners. Discounts for children. A very fair deal for locals but I do not know if I would recommend it for the price they charge foreign tourists.  This is a very historical museum been over 150 years old. It's housed on 6 acres of land and consists of multiple buildings.  The structure of the buildings and surrounding do look this old since upkeep seems to be an issue. There are seven different buildings which all are not usually open at the same time. Summa buildings have better displays than the others. The bronze showcase is the best kept and displayed of all of them. Poor lighting, lack of labels and information in some displays, dilapidated surroundings, and lack of air conditioner in most of the buildings puts this at a lower level than most museums out there. It has a wide variety and some wonderful treasures but you are going to pay in comfort for having to seek those out. The heat is incredible and mostly unbearable after a certain amount of time. Basic facilities like drinking water and toilets are hard to find. Absolutely no state of the art displays or even TV screens showing video are used at this museum.There is a Rs.200 extra fee if you plan to use photography or video. Although I saw many local Indians taking as many photos as they want when staff were not looking. It's a very large complex and luckily there are benches in each building to rest. You will eventually seek out fans in order to cool yourself down.You're supposed to go to the buildings one through seven in that order done so in a type of chronological order of history.For me personally, after about two hours most museums get tiring from information overload. Add to the fact this place is incredibly hot inside and your patience might seem to be much less.As others have said, bring your own drinking water, and lots of it! "
Government_Museum,arunkk1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,Very Old Museum,A nice place to visit with family to get so much of knowledge in history. There are so much of articles and also quite big. Worth a visit for a ticket of Rs.15/-.
