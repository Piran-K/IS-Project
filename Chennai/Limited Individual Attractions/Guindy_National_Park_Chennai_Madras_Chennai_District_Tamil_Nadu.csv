Guindy_National_Park,Gma,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Zoo ... just a zoo....,This is not a national park if the nation can not enjoy it.  It is just a zoo. All the res of the gorgeous area is saved for the governor's family.... sham!!
Guindy_National_Park,Bhaskar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Zoo, not a national park","Firstly, it's not a national park. It is a children's park, more like a Zoo, where there are a few animals like deer, Blackbuck, jackal etc. and reptiles like lizards, crocodiles, alligators with a few birds. Not a place where one can spend more than an hour. There is also a snake park adjacent to it which is better. Ticket for adults is Rs. 20 and for children above 5 years upto 12 years is Rs. 15."
Guindy_National_Park,Jayesh Chandra ... P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Small Zoo,"There is a Snake park and a Children's Zoo + Park.. Both have different gates.  And different tickets.  Be careful when you buy tickets. The Zoo + Park does not have too many animals, but is well maintained.  I could not see too many animals.  Even the children's playground was crowded. There is a restaurant cum sit out outside the park. Not inside."

Guindy_National_Park,Michael A,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"A little-known, boutique Nation Park: but impossible to enter due to the Game Warden's reluctance to allow visitors!","I was bitterly disappointed to be unable to see and photograph the Blackbuck, rare in South India, in the Guindy National Park.Some fortunate‚Äîand determined‚Äîvisitors manage to get permission to visit this little-known gem of a National Park! A wonderful experience for the Indian wildlife enthusiast to see and photograph the graceful Indian antelope, the Black Buck of classic Mughal paintings, is inexplicably denied by the apparent indolence of the Present Game Warden, who is impossible to contact by telephone, email or gain audience by the overseas visitor!Why are some of the best things for the keen wildlife photographer made so difficult in South India‚Äîin contrast to the facilities in North India for wildlife photography by overseas visitor?

Guindy_National_Park,Richard7,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Shabby animal exhibits,The Children's Park is run-down and shabby.

Almost all children growing up in Chennai get their first taste of nature in this park. It's right in the middle of the city surrounded by greenery, right next to the lush green IIT Madras campus. There are some decent varieties of birds and animals...surely not as much as it used to be. The place is clean...It also has a jungle gym for kids where the equipments need some maintenance. The animals in the enclosure also need proper maintenance. There are very less or almost no carnivores...lots of deer...birds etc... Please authorities...wake up and save this place.

This is more of a children's park with just few animals and birds for display. Not well organized. Quality of food court inside the park is very poor.

Guindy_National_Park,lekha m,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,A bit of a letdown,The guindy park as such is a nice place butThe one thing i was sad and shocked about was the snake park where small live chicks were left in cages along with snakes so that they can feed whenever hungry... it was too cruel to watch the little chicks all gathered in a corner trying to escape. I do understand the snakes need to be fed but this was just cruelty . I hope they change this arrangement.Other than this the park has a small childrens area where kids can have fun and some animal exhibits which are fine.

Guindy_National_Park,Bharatbackpacker,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016,Exalted zoo,"I understand having a national park in the center of a sprawling metropolis is difficult, but calling GNP a national park is gross stretch of imagination. It's designed and looks like a zoo. The kids seems to have fun, but, I was pretty disappointed with the dry land (maybe due to my expectation that it would be more like a botanical garden). The animals were so well fenced in that it was difficult to see them even. Two standout exhibits were the aquarium and a cassowary (looks like a cross between a turkey and an emu). I payed 20 Rs for camera but would recommend others. As the animals and birds were fenced you can't get any good photos besides people were using their mobile phones for taking photos without any questions."

Guindy_National_Park,ArunaSrinivas,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015,A mini zoo and play area for kids,"If you are a nature and wildlife lover, dont miss this green, quiet hangout hidden in the woods on the Rajbhavan road. Kids would enjoy the company of free roaming deers and the animals. A well-maintained play area is also a plus."

Guindy_National_Park,abrahamsuji,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,National park in city,Away  from the bustling crowd in Chennai. Less number of animals as compared to other national parks.
Guindy_National_Park,nytikjoshi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good to go if kids need to see wild life near/in the city,"Good place, low on entry tickets, Visit it on a Saturday avoid Sundays and the rush that goes with that day. Try to visit the park in two trips as doing it all on one go can be very tiring. Pack somethings to eat as the options i found there did not look clean/ healthy. The animals looked tired and exhausted from the heat, although i found the zoo keepers busy with their feeding trucks restocking foods in the cages. Given the choice i would not be too happy seeing animals locked up but for the lack of anything better will be forced to go here to show kids/children what wild animals look in their living from as they have not seen anything else other than their pictures in school books. Do visit the animated show for a additional cost of Rs 40 but it is only in Tamil but do check it out for the AC -cooling factor a bit of solace from the scorching Chennai heat."

Guindy_National_Park,MArasu2000,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Don't have Great Expectations,"As kids, we grew up with only the Guindy National Park doubling as the Zoo @ Chennai. Later...came the Vandalur Zoo which took most of the animals (mostly wild) from Guindy to Vandalur.Must have been there over 10 times before I was 10 yrs old...atleast 6+ times during my kids growing stages...definitely kicked a lot of nice old memories. Now, Guindy Park is a typical park with very few animal attractions. The entrance is usually crowded...parking just ok - for both Cars and Bikes. To be avoided during long weekends and Pongal times. The park entry looks worrying with a lot of paper and plastic waste lying on the roads..but inside the park, its much better. There used to be checks at the entry to stop plastic covers inside...but did not see that happening these days.We start with a stroll and see about 3 to 4 varieties of Deers (Samba, Antelope etc), 6 to 7 varieties of Snakes with live chickens waiting to be eaten, an open birds areas with about a dozen varieties of cranes, spoonbills etc... 2 to 3 Crocodiles, 2 wild dogs, about 6 Peacocks, Sea Otter, Parrots, Parakeets etc..The star attraction of the evening was the peacocks...the white peacock which was dancing with his feathers fully open and then the other bluish green feathered Peacock too joined the rains oncoming with its rain dance. A large play area for the kids with swings, slides, see-saws attract all the children and parents crowd to this park.With an entry fees of Rs. 5 for the bikes and not sure for cars, Rs. 5 for kids (between 2 to 12 yrs) and Rs. 20 for adults, Rs. 20 for a camera.Guards will force to buy Camera tickets for any cell phone too (since its got a camera),but if you dont wish to take snaps, just be clear that you dont want to take snaps.There are a lot of crowded food stalls at the entrance serving Coffee, tea, sandwich, pizza, tender coconut, ice creams etc..A good idea to spend about 2 to 3 hours strolling and watching the birds, animals and the public in the only known green patch in the middle of Chennai.Having seen many wonderful parks in Washington DC, NYC, Sao Paulo, Brasilia, Taipei, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Bangalore etc...Guindy maynot be impressive...but being a proud Chennaite...this is our local pride...Saving another weekend for a trip to the Vandalur zoo...very soon...Until then...Ciao..."
Guindy_National_Park,ManuelSMD,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Nothing Special,"I went there expecting a bit variety of animals and to spend couple hrs, however didn't stay 1h. A bit disappointing the whole park, quite small and very few animals. Good side, at least I only paid 20 rupees"
Guindy_National_Park,Traveloney,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Can be better,"All you can find here is more of deers, monkeys and few birds like peacock, peahens and parrots. I remember seeing quite a lot of animals when I was a kid. But its been more than 20 years since then. The park surely requires maintenance and renovation. On the whole it is surely a place for timepass, nothing more than that. There is nothing much in here to be fascinated about."
Guindy_National_Park,Sanjay K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good place to pass time,"I went there by lot of Expectations..But disappointed.. As usual like other zoo..Nothing more than birds,and monkey."
Guindy_National_Park,writingale,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,The only city zoo in chennai,"Zoo may be a big word, this is a very small zoo / animal park but it's laid out well so you can spend a nice afternoon by yourself or with your family and kids. very cheap entrance fee but it closes by 6pm so you are advised to reach there at least a couple of hours earlier. Located opposite to Anna University and next to IIT entrance."
