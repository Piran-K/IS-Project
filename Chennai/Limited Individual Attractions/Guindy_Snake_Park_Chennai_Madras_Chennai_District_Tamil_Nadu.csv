K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,A write up on Guindy Snake park,"In continuation to my posting on crocodile zoo in Nemmeli village on ECR near Mahabalhipuram & 40 kms from.city , I thought the story and picture of Reptile parks in Chennai will be incomplete,  if I dont write about the Guindy snake park also established Mr Romulus Whitaker well with in the city , where it is easy for public especially the school children could easily visit for learning about reptiles .The Guindy Snake park was established in 1972 when I was in the 4 th year at Guindy Enginnering college just opposite to my college, under the aegis of Chennai Snake park Trust an NGO .Chennai can be proud, thanks to Mr Whitaker to have the proud reputation of having the first reptile park in India and it covers an area of approximately an acre of land next to the children's park in the Guindy reserve forest area .The park was recognized as a zoo from the Central Zoo Authority in 1995 . The idea was to establish this park, primarily to maintain and display captive collection of various species of snakes and other reptiles endemic to our native area and to kindle public interest in them while prompting the them to empathize with these reptiles and protecting them thereby our eco system itself .The main focus was to attract school children primarily to show all aspects of reptiles with the actual live species on display in order to aid research and understanding all about these reptiles in nature . It was also to dispell the notion that they are dangerous to humans and therefore has to be killed if they come close to human habitat .Going by the fact that this park over the years has been attracting 7 to 8 lakh visitors , in a year mostly school children, I must say this venture is a great success in promoting the ecology .The park produces adequate revenue by way of gate collection to maintain it in good standard .The park boasts of a huge collection of an assorted variety of 23 different snakes including adders, pythons, vipers, cobras and other reptiles housed with glass frontage .The crocodiles and large lizards are kept inOpen air enclosure that is well protected from public using parapet wall with mesh .Half a dozen turtles including black variety ,a few Tortoise Star variety included ,spotted rock gecko,and Asian chameleons completes the reptiles on display ."

Lots of trees are there offering shade and fresh air to inhale. Needs more maintenance to attract tourists."
Guindy_Snake_Park,Angelrun29,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017,A slimy experience,"Having been in Chennai for so long; this was the first time I went to the Snake park and it was indeed an enlightening experience. Many of these reptiles are on the verge of getting extinct but for the efforts of national parks like these. Well maintained place and all the snakes and other reptiles are kept in their natural-like habitats. Overall, it was an enlightening and knowledgeable experience."

Guindy_Snake_Park,sameernandan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Worth if you saw snakes only rarely,"Visited it thrice over the last 25 years. Pros:1. Located at the heart of city 2. Houses currently about 10-12 species of snakes including cobra, viper, boa and python among others3. Also has few species of crocodiles and alligators. 4. Has monster lizards and turtles too.5. Can spend pleasant part of an hour 6. Tickets are cheap (20/- per adult or camera)7. Generally not overwhelming crowd 8. Has a food court just across the road, though quality and pricing are not that pleasing9. Place is safe in all respects 10. Mini zoo (not Chennai Anna zoo) with children's play park (with separate tickets) right adjacent to snake park Cons:1. Losing more species every year2. No king cobra 3. Glass enclosures poorly maintained and only semi transparent at areas4. Concerned workers left a flock of live chicks within few snake enclosures. It is heart wrenching to see them cowering at a corner, mortally afraid of impending death at any moment, all the days that they live! Finally if you are a new visitor to Chennai, with not much experience of seeing snakes in real life, you will find it engaging "

Guindy_Snake_Park,WicklowEims,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Pleasantly surprised at how much there was to see here.,As the Zoo was closed after the Cyclone - we came here to look at reptiles as were pleasantly surprised. A very good central learning zone with video's and facts. A god mix of snakes and Crocodiles and turtles. There's a kids park next door with Deer so a very easy way to spend a few hours with kids. Also they dont have foreigner prices so for 6 of us it was only 90 INR (2 kids were free) Totally recommend it for an afternoon for adults and children.

Guindy_Snake_Park,Vineeth K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,"lots of snake & crocodile species, but doesnt look like its maintained well","There are lots of snakes & crocodile species. But lacks good maintenance, may be because of less staff or some other reason. Place is not smelly but the cages where snakes & croc's are kept seems to bit old & showing some damages/wear & tear which creates a fear in our mind. Even saw on cage where they have kept a big python is just having a small lock similar to one we use in our normal wardrobe & even doors are having pretty gaps in between which may be enough for snake to take tour of surrounding places ;)."
