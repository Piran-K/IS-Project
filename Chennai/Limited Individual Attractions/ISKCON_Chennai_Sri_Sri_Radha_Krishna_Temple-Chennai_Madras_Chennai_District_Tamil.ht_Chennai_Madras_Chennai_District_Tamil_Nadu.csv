It's on ECR and just before Akkarai if you are coming from Thiruvanmiyur/City, but if you are coming via OMR then you have to take left at Sholinganallur crossing, go through ECR link road and meet ECR at Akkarai, and then turn left. On ECR itself you will find the temple gate but the temple is far inside, almost nearly 1 km or little more. It has quite large parking space. The temple premise is large and the main temple itself can accommodate thousands of devotees. The good evening time is good as the temple is lit of different colored lights and also it is a fantastic experience to witness the evening prayer. Inside you will find Lord Krishna and Radha, along with Lord Jagannatha, Balarama and Subhadra. Also you will get to see Lord Gour Nitai.Inside temple while coming out a small section is there to purchase books, articles etc. The main temple and God idols are still first floor. The ground floor is also large and beside the temple you will find a small gift shop, and a newly built Radha Krishna veg dining hall. You will get a fantastic veg buffet menu items during lunch and dinner.Every year in the month of January the temple brings out the Chariot of Lord Jagannatha, Balarama and Subhadra and celebrates the Rathyatra - Chariot festival (which is basically in June-July in rest of India/world)."

We visited on Janmashtami and the place was very crowded with long queue. Still the place was neat, clean and vibrant. There is no entrance fees. The people were in a festive mood. There was a food court but price was a bit high. The temple was beautifully illuminated because of Janmashtami but there was lot of slush and mud outside because of rain. It will be better if the temple authorities make the area outside the temple cemented. The parking arrangement was chaotic and we had to park the car quite far whereas many cars as well as autos were allowed to park right in front of the temple."

ISKCON_Chennai_Sri_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Temple-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Tamil.ht,essaaren2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,An average temple,"What stuck me at my first visit was that it was not as grand as it was portrayed to be, by my friends, though it was nice. The statutes were looking beautiful. The free prasad they gave‌ (though I donated a small amount in hundi kept near prasad) is again average.  They have a restaurant in the premises and I ordered Dosa. But they said it will take time (time was about five) so I left it at that. I ordered a Coffee there, it was below average. But none of this matters really, what matters the most it that the vibes there were more of a picnic spot rather than of a temple. May be this is true of all ISKCONs. May be I'm so used to typical Dravidian style temples which we find all over Tamil Nadu and anything else feels synthetic. I next visited the sai Baba temple and I found it far more spiritual than this one."

Spread over an area of over 1.5 acres, the temple is constructed on five levels. There is a 7,000 sq ft temple hall on the first floor, an auditorium for cultural and spiritual programmes on the ground floor and a prasadam hall in the basement.In the temple hall, there are three teak-wood altars which house the deities. The deities have been sourced from Jaipur and Odisha.Designed under the guidance of Sri Bhanu Swami, the temple has imbibed various attributes from Vedic scripture and is inspired by the Pallava and Kalinga architecture. The entrance to the temple is marked by a representation of the universe or the bhu-mandala on marble floor. According to the cosmology of ancient Vedic puranas, the universe is described as series of circular islands surrounding a central pillar called Mount Meru. The design on the floor at the entrance depicts the same universal pattern. There is also a life-like statue of a cow feeding its calf at the portico.The primary purpose of the temple to transform the material self-centred identity into a spiritual identity of unconditional love is graphically represented by means of a magnificent chandelier that projects various colours on the walls and ceiling. The chandelier has 500 Himalayan quartz crystals supposedly meant to intensify the spiritual energy in the temple. The temple also visually displays various vastu shastra features. A booklet explaining all these features is available at the book shop, which is located near the portico."

Added bonus is that the location is great. It is a 15 minute leisurely walk away from the beach, a very clean stretch. The food at the temple premises is a bit of disappointment though. When I was there, breakfast was to start at 10.30 am, which is very late indeed. I had to walk about 10 minutes to get to a veg food place at the beginning of Bhakti Vedanta Street. Guest house needs some upkeep too- linen and sheets were clean, and fan was working. Washroom could have been cleaner, hot water was not available, AC in the room was not working at that time. I still enjoyed the stay given the proximity to the temple, the very friendly and hospitable staff who make me feel at home, and were very warm and welcoming. Will visit again for sure"
