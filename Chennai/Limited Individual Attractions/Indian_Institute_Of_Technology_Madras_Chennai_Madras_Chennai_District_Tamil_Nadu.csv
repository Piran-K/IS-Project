Indian_Institute_Of_Technology_Madras,vamshinallan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 ‚Ä¢ Business,Knowledge hub...!,"'Gnanam' which means knowledge is the main resource in this world class institute. Veteran professors along with younger brilliant professors and equally competent scholars make this hub more sought for. Greenery, though washed away due to natural calamities, exists enough, still as a paradise to our eyes. Deer is the awesome creatures which I have seen still. Food courts, periodic events, both cultural and technical make life exciting here.. Great Place..."

Indian_Institute_Of_Technology_Madras,Sapna I,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nostalgic trip back,I lived on the IIT Campus for 22 years.  It was a trip down memory lane.  Change is inevitable - but I was sad to see that the faculty housing was not in as good a shape as it used to be.  Also there were too many trees cut down and the serenity of the old campus is no longer present.
Indian_Institute_Of_Technology_Madras,singhrohan07,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Not a great place to visit on a free time,"First of all this is a College campus not a place of attraction, you''ll be permitted inside if you are required there.PROS: very quiet place, deers are beautiful if visible, cleaned naturally.Cons: NO tourist guides, roads not paved appropriately and deers are not visible,"

Indian_Institute_Of_Technology_Madras,Aravind A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Feels you are not in chennai,"Have visited IIT  chennai many times , the one striking thing which hits you as you cross the security checkpost after getting a entfy pass from them is greenery and more greenery.The temperature inside the campus will be about 2 to 3 degrees cooler than chennai temperature, which makes it a haven for walkers and joggers who are found in plenty during the earlymorning and evening hours. Well laid road with deers freely roaming about along with slithering wild life makes one feel we are not in chennai."
