Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,NatrajMali80,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,"Breathtaking views and a serene, meditation experience!","This temple is situated on the East Coast Road, just before the Mayajaal cineplex and right after the toll plaza. Constructed right on the beach front of the ECR, the sight from the temple is a breathtaking one - the temple literally overlooks the ocean, and evokes thoughts of Dwarka (as in the mythology of Lord Krishna)The temple houses a Batta Ganesh / Kanchi Ganesh at the front, with a Kasi Vishwanatha shrine facing Ganesha on the left hand side as soon as we enter. There is a temple tree where Priests perform homa or sacred rituals for devotees. On the left hand side, we have a unique Navagraha shrine, where instead of the usually squared placement of Navagrahas, they planets are lined up in a straight line. The dwaja stamba or temple pillar is an intricate carving of the Dasavatharam (ten avatars of Lord Vishnu), with the Kurma avatar (tortoise) holding the pillar on its back, just like the Lord held Mount Meru while Devas and Asuras churned the ocean. There is also a beautiful carving of Lord Krishna dancing on top of Kalinga snakeNow. coming to Lord Jagannath's shrine, the sanctum sanctorum houses Balaram, Krishna, and Subhadra. The idols are quite similar to the original ones in Puri, Orissa. The pooja time is one of great spiritual experience with the blowing of the conch shell and the arthi. The Lord is housed in a structure similar to Puri Jagannath, a huge chariot-like structure. The Lord is a beauty to behold and you can sit for a few mins of meditation right outside the sanctum sanctorumOn either side of Lord Jagannath, we have Goddess Vimala and Goddess Lakshmi, each with their own shrines. Right below the Lord Jagannath structure, there is also a smaller meditation hall with few other deities. There is also a Buddha statue in the lawn just outside the main templeThere are no hundies, but a donation center at the entrance, where we can contribute to educational donation done by the temple trust. The temple is neatly maintained and because this is a private trust, the house of the temple pundits are situated right within the premisesIf you are in the mood for a spiritual experience while driving down the ECR, I would recommend that you not miss this temple. It truly is a wonderful experience!"
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,roshu6682,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,An oasis of peace and devotion,"I am a person who loves to visit temples to imbibe the positive energy generated there but find it a futile exercise with the accompanying crowds, pushing, shoving, queues and taking tickets for so called express darshan! Except neighborhood temples and far flung temples of architectural value I hardly visit a temple as a place of worship anymore but on janmashtami I just had to go and wish Krishna but wanted to escape the crowds hence iskcon was ruled out. I just chanced upon the reviews of Jagannath temple on TripAdvisor and bypassed iskcon and went further down to find this unique temple to my great delight! Beware Google maps takes you on the wrong right turn in the last leg which leads one to a dead end but this issue has been reported and hopefully will be resolved soon. Despite being janmashtami there were just about a dozen devotees around. The temple premises were well maintained, spacious and the layout was thoughtfully done. Welcomed by a modern art deco version of the dwaja sthamba and up above a graceful flight of marble steps is the small sanctum sanctorum housing the decorated deities, Krishna, balaram & subhadra in the likeness of the puri temple. The pujas are done in typical Oriya style with minimal fuss. The ceiling is beautifully decked with colorful patachitras. Basement of the shrine houses the utsav muthi and the jhula for Krishna. The other deities housed around the main shrine are Ganesha, Kasi Vishwanath, Buddha amidst a well maintained lawn, Laxmi and vimala Devi. The pathways are laid out well and surrounded by the garden on all sides. It was a pleasure to be in this oasis of calm away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Only disappointment was that despite being janmashtami there was no prasad offered. A simple dish from the Lord's kitchen would have been the icing on the cake but then again maybe Jagannath in his mysterious ways, wants me to make another visit to see him which I would love to undertake soon! A highly recommended outing for the spiritually inclined. "

I reached there around 730 AM but the shrines were not open. Their website clearly states that the shrines are open from around 630 AM. So it was a big disappointment.

Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,BananaLu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Peaceful and interesting!,"This temple must be the most peaceful temple of Chennai. It might be because it is very recent (inaugurated in 2001), but in any case it is perfect if you want to pray peacefully or if you want to see the difference between typical Oriya and Tamil architectures. This temple has indeed been built based on old Oriya temples style (mainly Puri famous Jagannath temple). You can directly see it from the structure and the style of sculptures. Any person who has been to Orissa will appreciate the memory and any person who has not been there will get an idea of how temples are there.Do spend time to check the central pillar which depicts all Vishnu’s avatars (lower part) and the beautiful nagi / nagini (top part). There are several shrines around the main temple and a tree under which there are several gods’ and goddesses’ vehicles (including an owl that I had personally never seen or noticed before that should be one of Lakshmi’s vehicles). There is also a smiling Buddha on the left side. Half deities’ names are indicated, which can be quite helpful!Non Hindus are allowed inside and will hence get an idea of the Puri temple in which they are not allowed!If you have time, walk to the beach which is very near."

Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,SubbaramDanda,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,FOR A BLISSFUL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE,"Off the East Coast Road (ECR) in Chennai, between Toll Plaza and Mayajaal at Kanathur Reddy Kuppam almost on the sea shore, lies Dakshinakshetra that houses the primary temple of Jagannath and some other shrines.   As the visitors enter the premises, they are awe-struck by a soaring granite tower over the main sanctum in the Kalinga architectural style with a long flight of broad steps leading to it.  In the sanctum are the idols of Jagannath, Baladeva and Subhadra. On the walls and the ceiling there are spiritual paintings.   In the front on the ground stands a lofty Dwajasthambha with sculptures etched on it.  Consecrated in 2001, the temple is said to be similar to the Puri Jagannath shrine.  The entire Dakshinakshetra complex is in a beautifully landscaped space amidst emerald lawns, flower plants and green trees in a quiet environment.  It is said that only the flowers grown there are used for worship.  Seen in the compound are three trees intertwined with each other – neem, banyan and peepal.  This “union” of trees is likened to Kalpataru.  There is a colourful Buddha image installed in the open on the lawn.  A marble-floored meditation hall is also located in the complex. We visited the temple on Christmas Day.  Cars can be parked on the road in front of the temple."

Best to visit in the evening.

Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,Arnab R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Well maintained temple and very peaceful,The temple is very small but well maintained. The ambience is good. The temple is situated in the outskirt of the city and that's why I spent some good and peaceful time over there. Far from all the noises. It's worth visiting it.
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,Rajesh S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Solo,Good place for local oriyas.,The place is managed by some retired babus.. I find them frequenting the place. You can strike good conversation with them. The odia purohita is a decent man. Visiting the place during festival time is always a pleasure.
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,Sumithra R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014,Small temple but is quite well-maintained and is peaceful,"It's a little difficult to find and it's outside city limits. It actually works in my favor, because there are rarely any visitors (except on auspicious days). It's a very small temple but if you want some peace and quiet, it's worth visiting it. (There's some construction work going on right now which makes it difficult to take nice pictures, but I think it'd be over soon)"
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,muraliaryan62,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,Jagannath ki Jai,I had the feeling of Puri temple . well maintained temple. Pity of secular India if any Hindu temple maintained well and devotees coming is heavy it will be taken by the Govt .
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,KumarJUN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Family,Replica of Puri Jagannath temple in Chennai,Regularly visit Puri Jagannath temple..well maintained and is situated in a beautiful location close to the seashore. One can enjoy the evening breeze. i was fortunate to enjoy the dance performance of the Odysey dance ( classical dance of Orissa / Odisha now)More about Lord Krishna and his tales. expressive..The temple is clean and the grass lawns too is a visual treat to our eyesThe prasadam or anna danam is also a good practice here
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,ChinmayHota,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 • Solo,Far from the madding crowd,"Far from the hustle and bustle of the city, the temple complex dedicated to Lord Jagannath and his siblings Balabhadra and Subhadra, is an island of tranquility, and sheer bliss. Once upon a time there used to be only one Jagannath temple, located at the original kshetra, Puri in Odisha. Over centuries many princely states built temples for the revered deity at their capitals. Now that the royals are gone, the responsibility of building Jagannath temples at different locations have been assumed voluntarily by the common devotees. The Kanathur temple is one such attempt.The big compound is very well maintained with a mandap at the entrance, the sanctum sanctorum built in style of Puri original at the centre and lush green lawns and garden plants all around. The Garuda Pillar facing the deities is imposing and beautifully carved. There is a small structure dedicated to Kanchi Ganesh on the left of the complex, a statue of Buddha, also on left,  and a nice lotus design water tank at the back. Jagannath culture also assimilated the Buddhist philosophy, and it is said that the deity at Puri has the tooth of Buddha hidden in his naval.The priests are from Odisha and I found them to be very sincere in their worship. The temple can organize various types of pujas or rituals for you at different fees, which are displayed on a board.Not far from the temple complex is a quiet beach, which I found as peaceful as the temple with no visitors. It looked like a fishing beach with many small boats dotting the place.The place where you have to take a left turn from the ECRoad if you are coming from Chennai is easy to miss if you do not look for the traffic police signs and bikes there. The turning is near a fish market. Take flowers from here, beacuse they may not be available near the temple. The 150 metres road leading upto the next turn for the temple is crowded, rough and somewhat dirty. Ignore it and press ahead, because what awaits you will leave you cleansed internally."
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,Aaqarsh Aiyyar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Couples,South India’s own Puri,"This newly constructed temple, conceivably the cleanest temple of Chennai, is located at about 400 metres from Kanathur (ECR road) and is the new home of Puri Jagannath (of course along with Balabhadra and Subhadra). I had been to puri last year and had to wait for long hours in queue to meet my little friends. This temple is less explored and so getting Jagannath's appointment was much easier.The temple also houses Kasi Vishwanath (Lord Shiva), Kanchi Ganesha, Mother Basil (Tulsi or Tulasi) and navagrahas (surprisingly in human form). The atmosphere is serene and it would be nice to spend some time out in the green lawn and enjoy the sea breeze. My advice to travelers is to avoid the beach closer to the shrine (about 200 meters), for it is one of the filthiest I've witnessed and more over you stand a good chance of getting bitten by crabs."
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,ankur007,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Family,Good Replica of Original Temple,Its bit far off from the city on the famous ECR road on the sea shore of Bay of Bengal. The Jagannath followers have tried to make it an exact replica of Original temple in Odisha. 
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,Raj K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Family,A very small and very clean temple,"Not a usual south indian temple. Feels peaceful to be in this place. Don't specifically plan and come for this temple. If you are on a ride in ECR, you can visit here for a short period of time. You can spend a max of 20mins for this temple. Clean toilets too are there. A very clean and well maintained temple."

Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,Ashwinreghu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Simple yet Divine...,"An hours drive from Chennai city, situated close to Mayajaal complex.

Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,AdventuresSoul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Solo,Tranquil and Serene,"My first stint of outing after shifting from Bangalore to Chennai.I was indeed taken aback by the fact of my friend's horrifying tales about the coastal city Chennai. Minus the heat everything seems okay for me in the first place.But I must say the place I visited with my friends worth a visit for everybody staying in Chennai.It's just a 20 Mins drive from Thiruvanmiyur on the ECR Road towards Mahabalipuram.You can go by bike, Car & as well as in busses, there are frequent buses from Thiruvanmiyur Bus Depot.The drive itself was an enjoyable one on the ECR.It was Saturday when we visited the temple, expecting a little bit more crowd than the usual days but to our shear surprise it was not that crowded.That eventually went well for the beautiful n serene place.You can feel a sense of purity & calmness.They tried to keep it simple & make it as similar to The Jagannath Temple in Puri & they successed  in that also.I wish, it could only keep an eye on the road connecting from ECR to the Temple, as that was really filthy, thanks to the local people.Apart from that everything else was divine.And of course they do have an AnandBazar preparing the famous ""Abadha"" (the traditional prasad).One meal per person costs 70/-. Try to book prior. As they make food only call on service basis to avoid the wastage of Prasad.Visit once in a while & I bet you'll love it."
Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,Abhik_85,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Friends,A little abode in tranquility !!,Many people don't know about this place and probably that why this place so Calm and peaceful. I visited this temple by luck. I was on my way to Mahabalipuram and i was talking to my driver about the crowd in India. He only suggested to visit this place. The temple was built in resemblance Jagannath Temple of Puri. The Priest of the temple are mostly from Orissa. The place is less crowded and surrounded by a well-maintained garden.

Jagannath_Temple_Kanathur,Narayanan S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2012,very good and inspiring,"My wife and I were hunting for a house for a friend of ours - this was in June this year. The driver asked us if we would like to visit Puri Jagannath Temple. Ofcourse we were eager and he took us to the temple at Kanathur. It was near mid-day and the they were performing the pooja. It was just magnificient. Later one of the founders of the temple (Retired professor from IIT, Chennai) helped us with an archana and later explained how the temple was built and how they followed the example of the temple at Puri. It was just great. The temple was great, the deities were inspiring and the surrounding was spotlessly clean. It is a temple worth going frquently"

Right after the Kanathur sign board, on the left hand side og the road (if you are driving towards Mamallapuram)  there are directions drawn on a wall that led us to this place. What attracted me the most was the calm and peaceful environment. The temple is remarkably clean. The architecture is beautiful. The temple complex consists of a main shrine that houses Lord Jagannath, Balaram and Subhadra and several smaller shrines dedicated to deities Laxmi, Ganesha and Maa Vimala. There is a huge Yajna Mandap  as well with sitting arrangements. Gardens surround the temples. From the top of the stairs of the main shrine, the sea is visible. The priest performs puja for you if you bring along the offerings like flowers, coconut etc. There are arrangements for special pujas on payment-the different rates and charges are given on a board there. the temple officials are also present who may help you in this regard.Even if you are not spiritually inclined, you'll like the place because of its serenity and the marvelous temple architecture."
