Not much crowd. First we had the dharshan in the opposite vinayaka temple. and then we entered into the famous kalikaambal temple, the very same temple which Maharashtra Shivaji visited this temple during 19th century before he had war with Muslim leader Aurangzeb. today we could see the saraswathi avtar in white silk saree with beautiful veena at the fully decorated pandal. very enchanting view. then we moved in towards the main deity kalikaambal. since it was early morning say 7 am not much crowd. they were allowing 10- 12 devotees to sit have aarthi. we waited and as a second batch and had nice aarthi and the nice dharshan of kalikaambal. we could see the ambal in the natural light with full of flowers and lemon garlands. nice darshan and we got really fascinated and mesmerised to see her appearence. we did not feel like getting up and come off the place as we continue to have the divine connection with ambal. we feel fully linked to the Godess. Many years of supreme and divine blessings continue to pour. and we moved towards Lord Shiva. then we had tied red sacred thread. then we had dharshan of Muruga and came out. within the vicinity of Lord Siddhi vinayagar sannidhi and murugan sannidhi. Then after we could see the golu infront of Virat brhama. beautiful golu was arranged and ayyappa predominantly occupied the rows. we also saw the Kalikaambal urchavar. we also took the blessings of prityangira devi before we complete our rounds.  one has to visit this temple in their life time. but the street was narrow and very difficult to find the parking for cars of course two wheeler no issue. you will somehow find the space"
Kalikambal_Temple,Valavanur Natar... K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,A WRITE UP ON KALAKAMBAL TEMPLE GEORGE TOWN PARRYS CORNER CHENNAI,"The famous Kalikambal temple is located on Thambu Chetty street,  in george town now more known as Parry's corner. The name Parry's corner came about due to þthe presence of an old company called M/S EID Parry & Company established in 1787, by  Thomas Parry ,  a Welsh merchantThis multistorey building was the corporate headquarters  of this company . This building called ""Dare House"" stands in the the corner of NSC Bose Road and First line beach Road  abutting both the roads and is  opposite to Madras high court .The  Murugappa group now owns it .Now coming back to Kalikambal temple that is located in Thambu Chetty street that perhaps derived its name from Thambu Chetty,  a merchant who worked  with the British as a Dubash.The first Hindu temples of British Madras were built  during the period of 1640 to 1680 in this neighbourhood  The prominent  merchants of the city, mostly dubashes (middlemen) of British merchants and business establishments donated liberally for building these temples .In fact several of the streets in the neighbourhood also came to be  named after these dubashes.Apart from this famous temple this street is also the main retail market for Hardware, ceramic tiles and sanitary ware.The temple was originally located closer to the sea shore in the vicinity of Fort St George and  was relocated to the current site at 1640 AD. and was  re built  by MuthuMari Achari in True Tamilian  Architecture abd completed iIn  1678 .This temple is dedicated to Hindu goddess  Shri Kali Kambal (Lordess Sakthi ) and Lord Kamateshwarar (Shiva).The temple has separate sannadhis for Ganesha and Prathyankara .On the 1st May of every year since 1985 , Sri Kalikambal Kodai  summer  Abhishekam is performed from 10AM to 1PM  to the Goddess by Kodai Maha Abhisheham committee praying for enough rains during the year all over the country.History tells us that The great Maratta leader Shivaji Maharaj,   the founder of the Hindawi-Swarajya in the 17th century, had worshiped in this temple incognito on 3rd October 1667.Initially the idol of Kali the Godess was in  a very  fierce form  and for reasons unknown,   this fierce form was replaced with a calmer form like shanta swaroopi resembling the  Goddess Kamakshi.The Maha kumbabishekam of this Sri Kalikambal  took place on Wednesday, January 23. 2013 .with thoudands  of devotees gathered to witness the consecration of the Rajagopuram and the vimanam of the Moolavar by the head  priests belonging to the  The Sivacharyar Trust .The first phase of the consecration took place on January 17. Grandeur marked everything associated with the occasion and the  highlight of this kumbaabhisekham was flowers were  showered from a helicopter even as  abhisekham was being carried out to  the kalasams.About 25,000 people were fed free  after the kumbabishekam. Food was served to the inmates of orphanages and homes for destitutes in the city as well by the trust.The Sivacharyar Trust who runs the temple , in fact is also engaged in several social welfare activities such as distribution of clothes, text books, medicine, etc. The physically disabled are provided with appropriate vehicles and the poor are helped with marriage expenses."
