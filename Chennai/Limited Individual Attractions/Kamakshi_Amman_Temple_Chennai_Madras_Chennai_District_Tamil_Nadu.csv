Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,Valavanur Natar... K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,A write up on Mangadu Kamakshi Amman Temple,"The Mangadu Kamakshi Amman Temple in Chennai This hindu temple beileved to be more than 2000  old .It is built in  Chola  Architecture  and style is dedicated to Goddess Kamakshi and Sri Chakram that symbolizes her .I  have  a personal connect with this temple near Kundrathur in Mangadu village from late  60's ,when it was just a quaint dilapidated temple with one  Agraharam .There was hardly anyone visiting this temple in those days .Only a single kala  pooja was being performed  .The compound wall used to have vegetation  growing on it . I remember when I was young,  my family being  ardent followers of Guru Kanchi Mahaperiava , used to go to this temple on weekends, armed with broom, knife,  crowbar and spade to deweed the vegetations, sweep the temple main garbha graham and generally clean  the temple , under the supervision of the main gurukkal.Many in late  60's like my family, started to take cognizance of this temple,only after Kanchi Paramacharya camped in this temple and took great interest in trying to improve this ancient temple .It was due to his efforts that this temple has now become very popular .Devotees are  suggested  to pray for one day chosen by them for six weeks continously for grant of boon by Kamakshi ,for the marriage of their children , prosperity , promotion in their jobs  or for bearing of child .The goddess , it appears has granted their boon , if one were to go  by the rise in popularity of this temple , after  late 70's , which now sports a Rajagopuram with seven tiers filled  great sculptures .There was no Gopuram initially.Once the temple started earning revenue ,the HRCE of TNadu Govt moved in with an office ,to take management control to run it and  improve it in all respects .A family member of mine named  Mr Sunder,  a suptd in HRCE , was appointed as executive officer in later years and he worked hard to raise  this temple upkeep and maintenance by leaps and bounds , providing new facilities for public and soon came to be revognised as ""Mangadu Sundur""to many .Later as advised by Kanchi Maha Periava he worked untiringly to improve the livelyhood of many archakas and their families in many temples spread across tamil Nad , by getting their rightful pay and pensions from the HRCE .He informs that the first Jewelry and the vasthram for the goddess was gifted by Kanchi Maha periava .The term Mangadu means ""Mango Forests or Mango Grooves"" and this temple was built in its midst .This  temple is known as  ""Tapas Kamakshi"" for according to purana it is the place where the goddess performed her penance to re-unite in matrimony with Lord Shiva, performing all 32 types of dharmic rituals .The sthala purana mentions  that, when Lord Shiva and Parvati where in Mount Kailash ,Parvathi playfully closed the eyes of the Lord Shiva and that resulted in  the whole universe falling  into eternal darkness. So the Lord ordained Parvathi  to perform Tapasya.The Goddess came down to this mangrove in Mangadu   and performed penance amidst ""Panch agni"" or five agni kundams .She stood near the central agni kundam keeping her left leg toe in the fire while keeping her right  leg on her left thighs .She kept her left hand on her navel, while holding a japa mala in her right hand over her head.She undertook her deep penance with eyes closed to seek the hand of the  lord. Lord Shiva satisfied with her tapas, then instructs  her to go to Kanchipuram for concluding their marriage.Soon after the goddess leaves  this Mangadu  place, the heat of the agni  she created created ,became unbearable for everone living in the vicinity .Adi Sankarar who installed all the Sankara Madams in India ,seeing the plight of the people in his meditation , visited  this Mangadu and installed a ""Sri Ardhameru Chakram"" at the place where shakthi did her penance,  to quench the heat of the Agni and at the same time transform  the place to a soothing and sacred  one for all to pray.This Sri Chakra he installed  has 43 Thrikonas or triangles and is made up  of 8 herbals called Astagandams.The base is of koorma or tortoise design with 3 steps above .Over this base are 16 lotus petals and again over this there are 8 more petals . The top of this petal base is drawn the Sri Chakra , which is the largest among all in temples across tamil Nad . It is usually clad in 9 yards saree..Daily poojas are conducted to this ""Sri Chakram"" in the sanctum Sanctorum of the temple and this Chakra is considered to be a Tantric form of the Goddess herself ""This Ardhameru Sri Chakram""  is considered as the supreme divinity of this temple and only sandal or  Kumkum  archana is performed with no abhishekam  as it is  made up of herbs.On Vijayadasami day of Navarathiri it is provided with a gold kavacham and on other days it has silver kavachams The Shrine of ""Tapas Kamakshi"" in this temple  was installed at the behest of Kanchi Paramacharya in addition to  existing Sun god . The devotees to this temple offer worship to four Ambikas or goddess in four forms  - The Sri Chakra mentioned above - The Adhi kamakshi in panchalokha    holds a parrot in her right hand and     the moon crescent on her head -  Lordess kamakshi doing penance     among the five agni  kundams- The lamp near the Adhi Kamakshi    reverred as Ambhika or lordess    herself.The temple also has a shrine for Ganapati  to the left of the main entrance .I conclude my article, that after doing a pooja on fridays for six weeks ,in this temple in 1976 ,I got my first   senior corporate job in Pune ."
Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,Madhavi A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,The idol of Mangadu Amman has a green stone in her crown.,"I have been visiting Mangadu Kamakshi Amman temple since 1979. I go there on a Thursday, when I am in Chennai. Either using a hire car or Ola, it is an easy access and takes around 30 minutes to reach there from Adyar - early in the morning.it is a beautiful temple arranged in a traditional way - but I believe it gets crowded on special days with separate queues. I usually go there when it is quiet and am able to appreciate the inner sanctum sanctorum and the outer areas (to walk around). I am especially enamored by the Brass metal figurine of Amman standing on one leg and conducting penance. She signifies strength, perseverance and determination to me."
Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,Aarav K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Kamakshi,"My friend and me had reached this temple around 2 in the afternoon, so we had to wait here because the temple opens at noon after 4 pm. The people there said that the morning is open from 6 a.m. to 12 o'clock, but when we were late, we had to wait till 4:00. After waiting for a few hours, the beauty of this temple has forgotten the watches of waiting. We were happy to receive blessings here, this is a very unique temple."

Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,plpalani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Tuesday’s are crowded,Went on a Tuesday and it took more than 90 minutes with 50 rupees entry ticket.But the crowd was orderly and darshan was peaceful. People get married if they observe visits on particular number of days.Close to Kundrathur on the Kundrathur main road itself
Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,saranyaupendaran,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Wonderful temple but poorly managed,"Mangadu TempleMangadu Kamakshi amman temple is a 2000 year old temple located in Mangadu, about  24 kms from Chennai city close to Kundrathur.   It has a beautiful seven tiered gopuram and a divine idol of mother Kamakshi in the sanctum sanctorum along with a very rare Maha meru Chakra believed to have been installed by Adi Shankara himself.    The temple sees a constant inflow of devotees as the goddess is believed to bless unmarried people who visit her with a suitable partner at an early date.   The temple is also associated with the planet Venus and is therefore called a Sukra sthalam in tamil.  Open from 6am to 1.30pm and 3.30pm to 9.30pm thereafter, the temple remains open throughout the day on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.   It is a common sight to see wedding parties bring in the sacred wedding coconut and mangalsutra to be blessed by the goddess before having the mangalsutra tied around the bride’s neck by the groom  in the temple premises . The wedding group then partakes of lunch in a nearby hotel after this simple, cost-saving and effective ceremony before dispersing.  There are special tickets for entry, priced at Rs.50/- and Rs.20/- respectively, in addition to free darshan queues.   The narrow doorways are divided into three lanes using ropes for these three separate lines, and there seems to be no special entry offered to the elderly and disabled.  Avoid Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays, along with other auspicious muhurtham days when visiting the temple in order to avoid long lines.   Alternately, plan a visit very early in the morning around 6.30am if you need to visit on an auspicious day.The first impression one gets of the temple itself is that it needs better management and could be cleaner, particularly in view of the huge crowds that visit and the large hundi collections.   The temple tank is dry and rampantly overgrown with weeds, while the large platform abutting it is unkept and messy.  It could be a wonderful resting place for weary pilgrims with the right facilities, and scenic looking if the tank is maintained well with trees and plants around .  There are no proper seating areas for the elderly and disabled.   The area around the temple also could be better maintained, as parking is unruly and haphazard and vendors and litter are found everywhere.  Moreover stall vendors and the temple staff manning entry into the lines also collude to allow visitors entry on the payment of a small gratification outside the temple, denying the temple its just revenues.   As with most temples in India, there are plenty of favoured visitors who are ushered in by staff and priests, bypassing queues and walking confidently upto the sanctum sanctorum, while the rest of us curse under our breath while standing in line.Do look out for the niche Subramanya enroute to the sanctum sanctorum, the Adi Shankara idol and the tapasvi Kamakshi on your way out, along with the beautiful Kalabairavar and the idol of Lord Surya.  Mangadu was a mangrove forest originally, and hence the name, where  Goddess Parvathi undertook rigorous penance before marrying Lord Shiva in Kancheepuram, according to the temple legend.Mangadu temple can be visited along with other temples in the vicinity such as the Kundrathur Murugan temple, the Thiruverkadu Mariamman temple which is about 7 kms away, and the Vedapureeswarar temple, in about half a day.   The roads leading to these temples are pot-holed and traffic-ridden, and you need to factor in extra travel time when planning a visit.   Google maps are very helpful during navigation.  Carry water and snacks with you, as there are no proper eateries along the route.  A small vegetarian hotel on the Mangadu temple main street , Balaji Bhavan, serves tiffin and beverages ."
Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,yy m,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Old habits die hard,"Visited this temple for the first time last week with elderly parent and a small child.My experience : Poor guidance from temple employees about where to find the free darshan entrance.We were asked to go through the whole loop of queuing area even though there were hardly anybody ,approximately 10 people 2) When asked to accept the Saree and perform archana for the deity ,the priest were very rude asking me to Ho back and get the coconuts broken before entering the sanctum Santorum or moolavar.3) All the while the priest kept muttering abuse how people don't know the procedures....The Saree was finally taken and draped on the mahameru.As I said even though there were less than 10 devotees we were ushered out in seconds.I came round twice to get proper and satisfactory darshan of Ambal .If you are like me living in virtual reality it was a wake up call as to the prevalence of caste discrimination in front of parabrahmam ,in this day and age.I can see why Dravidian movement is still active in Tamilnadu and can also see how it took root.Nothing wrong with the god per se,but an unpleasant experience overall."

The results will be astounding."

Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,akhilchandu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Nice temple,"Kamakshi Amman Temple is linked to the story of Lord Shiva and Goddess Shakthi (Parvathi). Both of them were sitting in their garden on Mount Kailash when Devi playfully closed the eyes of Lord Shiva with her hands. Instantly, the whole of creation fell into eternal darkness. The goddess craved Shiva's pardon and he asked her to go down to earth to undertake a severe penance. She came to the mango grove, Maangadu and began her penance by standing with her left leg on Panchagni (five fires) and folding the right leg at the left knee. Her left hand can be seen raised above her head, holding a japamala (prayer beads). This image can be seen in Mangadu Kamakshi Amman Temple as Tapas Kamakshiamman. Shiva was pleased and asked her to go with him to Kanchi to celebrate their marriage. She left the place immediately without extinguishing the fire. As a result, the whole area suffered from unbearable heat for a long time. Sri Adi Sankara of Kaladi came here and installed the rare Sri Ardhameru Chakram (a spiritual geometrical patterned device) and extinguished the fire."

As we enter the Temple, we find the Ganapati Shrine to the left of the main entrance. We pay our respects and as we walk further enter the Main Hall of the Temple. We straight proceed to the Sanctum where we can see the "" Ardha Meru Maha Yantra "" and an idol of Goddess Kamakshi in the Main Shrine.The Ardhameru Sri Chakram is the chief divinity in this temple. Only Kumkuma archana is performed and no abhishekam is done for Sri Chakram, as it is made up of herbs. After this we proceed to walk back, we came across the Shrine of 'Tapas Kamakshi"" - This was installed at the behest of Kanchi Paramacharya. We can also see the various other deities like Lord Surya etc, in the outer courtyard.

Kamakshi_Amman_Temple,rbmani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,Kamakshi is seated in a majestic Padmasana,"The Kamakshi Temple (Tamil:அருள்மிகு காமாட்சி அம்மன் திருகோயில்) is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Kamakshi, one of the forms of the goddess Parvati. It is located in the historic city of Kanchipuram, near Chennai, India and is popularly associated with Sankaracharya, one of the greatest Hindu gurus. The Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, the Akilandeswari temple in Thiruvanaikaval near Tiruchirappalli and this Kamakshi are the important centers of worship of Parvati as the mother goddess, in the state of Tamil Nadu. The temple was most probably built by the Pallava kings, whose capital was Kanchipuram, around 6 C.E.The main deity, Kamakshi, is seated in a majestic Padmasana, an yogic posture signifying peace and prosperity, instead of the traditional standing pose. The goddess holds a sugarcane bow and bunch of flowers in the lower two of her arms and has a pasha (lasso), an ankusha (goad) in her upper two arms. There is also a parrot perched near the flower bunch. There are no other Parvati temples in the city of Kanchipuram, apart from this temple, which is unusual in a traditional city that has hundreds of traditional temples. There are various legends that account for this fact. One of them according to Kamakshivilasa is that the Goddess had to absorb all the other shakthi forms to give a boon to Kama, the Hindu god of love.[1] Another legend attributes it to the Raja Rajeswari pose of the deity that signifies an absolute control over the land under the deity's control.[2] Legend has it that Kamakshi offered worship to a Shivalingam made out of sand, under a mango tree and gained Shiva's hand in marriage.Adi Shankaracharya, the famous 8th-century CE scholar and saint, established the Sri Chakra in this Kamakshi Devi temple in the trough-like structure in that shrine. This Sri Chakra soon became the All India famous Kamakoti Peeta. The Acharya's Lalitha Trishati Bhashya comments Kamakoti Peetam as Sri Chakra."
