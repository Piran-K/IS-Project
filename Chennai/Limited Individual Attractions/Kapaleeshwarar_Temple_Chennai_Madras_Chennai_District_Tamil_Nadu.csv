Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,TSinParis,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The Temple to Visit in Chennai - But Only Part of It,"There is not much to visit in Chennai.  This temple is one thing to visit but be aware that you (as a western looking person) cannot enter the inside.   Only people who look Indian, whether they are real Hindus or not.   I find it very strange that people are barred from a place of worship based on how they look.   We encountered this unfortunately throughout TamilNadu."
Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,jillg232,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Business,Watch out for rip unpleasant ‚Äúguides‚Äù,"This was a last stop after a busy week on a business trip. So we popped in but straight away a ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù man advised us to put our shoes in a safe area to be paid for to keep them safe.  He then followed us and insisted on telling us things about the Temple.  He correctly named which hotel we were staying in ( I suspect he had seen our driver!) but I was by the end a bit concerned. He was acting as if he was a staff member but it was obvious he was not.  He then wanted money for blessings and our family names.  Realistically I could see that this money was really for him, which I didn‚Äôt mind.  So I gave him some cash.  He supposedly went into the temple to hand over the cash. I just can‚Äôt see that he did but I didn‚Äôt expect him to. But then he carried on and insisted on more money at the end. When I refused he became angry and abusive.  It was pretty unpleasant.  Sad to say it‚Äôs a beautiful place but just don‚Äôt engage with anyone."

Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,Krishnan R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,A place you must visit before you leave Chennai,"Every trip we take to Chennai, we always visit this temple. Very beautiful from the inside and out. Architecture is very historical. Lots of space and shrines and even in the inside-most shrine for Lord Shiva, they even implemented an A/C, something many temples in Kerala are lacking. Plus, no strict rules like Kerala has on taking your shirt off in certain parts or putting anything in a cloak room. Only one little pet peeve is that there are stray cats & dogs around the place. Overall, a must visit if you come to Chennai. Don't leave Chennai without doing this."

Inside it is buzzing with people worshipping, walking around, sitting in large groups chatting and generally having a great experience. There were three wedding parties when we were there, all with huge accompanying families. The biggest had set up a ‚Äúphotograph the Bride and Groom‚Äù session with an array of professional lamps and defusers - inviting everyone to join the party. There was also the serious bit of walking clockwise to pray at the numerous shrines. So many beautiful saris! The temple decoration with a seemingly infinite display of Hindu deities is wonderful. Leave your shoes outside, apparently there is a shoe store but we didn‚Äôt notice and simply left them at the gate with all the others. On leaving all the shoes were gone, but someone pointed to a large heap of shoes piled on the other side of the road, ours were deep within that pile. Photography is allowed inside the compound but not directly into the shrines themselves. You are not allowed to wear a hat inside."

Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,GRAM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Beware of Scammers,"I am Hindu from the USA. I was looking forward to going to this temple for darshan while in Chennai. As I walked in, I was approached by a ""guide"" who works for the temple; he has a noticeable scar under one of his eyes. He claims that he is is a ""student"" and works at the temple giving tours. Initially, he seemed legitimate. But then, he took us to the kitchen and asked for 3,000 rupees to feed devotees for one sitting. It was almost as if he was bargaining, with no guarantee of where the money would actually go. Disappointingly, the same guide informed me that I was not allowed to go into the actual temple because I did not speak Hindi (despite being Hindu). However, he did request a donation to take into the temple and make on my behalf. After a quick tour, he requested 20 USD (at minimum) for his services and would not budge otherwise. After spending a total of over 60 USD, I was not able to partake in darshan, as I hoped. I am presuming all of the money I ""donated"" went directly into this man's pocket. Beware; these practices have no place in a house of worship. Utterly disgusting."

Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,Marco B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Nice but pollution in Chennai....,"I visited Kapaleeshwarar temple several time before, my last visit was in November 2019. I always enjoy going there, sit in the shade of one of the temple and watch the world go bye. Nice place to meditate and relax. Unfortunately this time around pollution in Chennai was so bad that after just 30minutes I had to go back to my hotel room. I think on November 5-6-7-8 they had the worse pollution ever recoded in Chennai. Thanks God I had with me protective air pollution mask but I felt awkward to wear it inside the temple. Please don't go to India without a air filtering mask, the best I found and that it is made with natural fabric is the metamasks.com Be safe, enjoy India, great country but challenging if not properly equipped."

Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,S.E.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Scamming,"The temple is nice to see. When I wanted to go inside a men hold me back.I am not allowed to go inside as non hindu. There was no sign or so. I need him as guide to be allowed inside. In the inside he came with a story that I have to give money to the poor. He wanted 500! rupies. I gave 200 in the end after long discussions and he did go with this money inside the temple building. I do not have a good feeling, may have landed in his pocket. Also the guide fee. He did not let me go until I pay 20!‚Ç¨because others do pay the same. We arranged something else in the beginning. He did not let me go, even wanted to scam me more with the currency exchange rate. This was my fault as well, but I have this was the worst experience here so far. + he wanted to arrange a tuctuc and a good place to lunch. He still tried These Things, even if we were quite discussing about the Rest...I think you are allowed to go inside the area, just not in the actual temple building. But there will be a sign!"

Kapaleeshwarar_Temple,nessiemark,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Interesting temple ,This is an interesting temple with a great history and some good photo opportunities. However we did get a little hassle by a man who wanted to show us around. Yes he was knowledgeable and interesting but despite us paying him 1000 INR and having already donated 2000 INR to assist feeding the homeless he was still demanding more so beware. However I would recommend visiting this temple.
