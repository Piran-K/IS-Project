Dont go across for this type of. 
Kovalam_Beach,Talhas,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Needs lot of attention from Local Authority,Very crowded with hapazard parking of cars and trucks. Suggest to park your vehicle in private parking area (Rs. 30 per car) and walk few meters to the shore. local vendors litter the place and spoil the atmosphere.
Kovalam_Beach,kashif k,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,from main city a roadtrip rather than going to beach-still best beach of chennai,"this place is 56 kms from main city (anna nagar) city roads are full of traffic and ECR is good but it is only around 10 kms. there is an alternative way that was good through NH 32. you can not do anything there except swimming in a water full of filth.I liked:very low slopethats itI disliked:filth everywheresmell of fisha lot of people ruined my holiday, on holiday i want to be at peaceyou bring camera there, waterproof if possible, nice shots you can take while in the waterwe planned our visit at 03:30we left home at 04:30we reach there at 05:45we were finished at 05:50(includes swimming)and still i dont feel I missed anything thereso its rather a short visit, maximum stay there should be 2 hrs.so we spent almost 2hrs and 30 minutes at roadwe spent 1 hr at beachMY TITLE JUSTIFIES IT"

Kovalam_Beach,Samshell2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Stinky and average beach,"I would definitely not suggest this beach for a visit as it is mainly a fishing beach and stinks. There were lot of fishing boats parked along the shore hence to get a proper calm place to sit, you need to walk a bit along the beach shore. I visited this beach on a Saturday evening as this was very near to my house like around 8 km. If you are new to Chennai then there are better beaches to explore like breezy beach and Elliot's beach which are more cleaner. The crowd at the beach was less and you can easily get paid parking near the beach. The sea was rough and the waves get higher and higher as the sun sets so be aware if you are not a swimmer. You can find too many fortune teller's with a cute little parrot in a cage hanging on their arm and can definitely try your luck as they charge just rs. 30/- per person. I did try it and it was not so worthy. Beware of beggars around the beach as they curse you if you don't offer them money 😜😜. This is not the place for people who is looking to spend some peaceful and quality time with family. Worth a visit ?? definitely No. "
Kovalam_Beach,Rucha121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Couples,Isolate from City.. but a lovely beach on ECR,"Located on ECR away from bustling noise of city, it offers recreational trip and peaceful time with family or friends on the shores.. watching Bay of Bengal in all its pomp and glory, hitting Chennai coast and beautiful waves. You can spot few adventure activities taking place here, but it seasonal, depends on wave and weather. Very peaceful and isolated beach. Not advised for girls to go alone."
Kovalam_Beach,Lakshmi Narayanan S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Clean beach but little isolated,This beach is on the outskirts of Chennai. Beach is cleaner compared to the beaches inside the city. Also it is less crowded. It is not advisable to visit this beach in the late evening on weekdays as it is very deserted and not safe.

Kovalam_Beach,pushpanjalikumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Solo,hidden jewel of a beach,This beach is less heard of and is 40 kms from heart of chennai. However the beauty is worth the journey. The area is swamped with sea water and creates amazing scenery in itself. The stones on the beach provide good place to sit and enjoy.
Kovalam_Beach,Pawan G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,Sunrise photography trip,Awesome drive via OMR which is safer than ECR. Reach this beach before sunrise! The sunrise and the sea against the rocks on the beach is such a serene view to look at!! Must visit place for trying long exposure shots

I wondered in Chennai there are these types of adventures to do :) really surprised and impressed. for going inside sea, we were given life jackets which was of good quality, and we went in in a motor boat and at one place boat man said we can jump into water, the boat had a rope tied along with it, we all get down into water and its fun was immeasurable :D we spend almost 1 hour inside water playing floating :D it was a very good experience :) even old people, kids also came there just to go for a boat ride inside sea :) but the sea shore was so dirty, they can keep it clean and improve tourism. Chennai can bring more water sports game like this and attract tourists :)"
Kovalam_Beach,Shyamis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Family,Quieter and cleaner,If you are looking for something quieter and cleaner than the Marina and also don't mind the long drive on ECR then this beach is for you.

You will find shops selling fried fish for a cheap price all around.. I have seen few shops allowing people to drink liquor as well..They sell fresh fish which is just out of water on the shores for a very cheap price .."
Kovalam_Beach,Virendra Mishra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,A good beach with cleaned and less visitors ,I used to visit this place every weekend morning 6 to 8 am with my friends and used to walk without shoes between Taj Vivanta hotel to Kovlam fish market. The beach around the fish market is very dirty but after hotel Taj to toward VGP resort is very good with very few visitors.
Kovalam_Beach,Hari P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Overcrowded beach in sundays,I loved here to surf. Which is so thrilling. People here are enjoying with their family. nice clouds and waves are interesting.

Kovalam_Beach,ReviewsByAZ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,"skip, its not what it used to be years ago - its become rotten and dirty","years ago, this used to be the place to go,  for a good time at the beach, but on a recent trip kovalam heavily disappointed. the approach was hard, but the driver found it. the immediate vicinity of the beach was dirty, filthy strewn with plastic bags and plastic disposable water pouches, bused everywhere with loads of travellers from other states and overall felt very unsafe and unhealthy. the beaches were equally dirty - would not recommend at all. was not expecting western standard beaches, but even this was a bit much. we ended up going to another beach up the road towards the city"
Kovalam_Beach,SagarVS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Friends,Dirty beach,"I see no reason for you to visit this beach. Its dirty for sure and the same as any fishing hamlet down the coast from Chennai. If you go after 9 am you might see the fishermen come back from sea with their normally disappointing catch. But, that you can see in other places too. Also be careful when you swim, there are no guards, no warnings and people have drowned before. Skip."
Kovalam_Beach,Biplab Lenin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Friends,Wonderful Beach,"Nice beach, nice place, enjoyed a lot with fiends. love to visit again. one of the clean beach in India"
Kovalam_Beach,Nedungilli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,Good beach to visit,"I have at least visited this place 15 times in past 8 months. I usually start 6:00Am on saturdays using OMR. In OMR once you reach kelambakkam take left to reach Kovalam beach. THe main purpose I go there is to buy fresh fish. If you reach there by 6:00AM you can see 100s of boats returning with lot of fishes. If you want to buy fish directly got to fisher man and start negotiating. I wont say it would be cheap but surly fresh.For a fish worth of 300Rs . The price will start from 500. But you can ask your price. Do not hesitate to ask the lowest price. I usually ask for Rs100 for worth of Rs 300. SoI will end up paying RS 250. But its all based on your skiil to talk to them in local language.If you have the skill to identify fish name by just looking at it and familiar with its price, then you can make good buy.Those people will easily identify your knowledge on fishes. For example if you ask them , "" Is this fish good for frying? "" It simply shows your lack of knowledge in fish. If they find you dont know about fish then differently you will be cheated.You will also find small market and local women selling fishes there. Never buy from them. Instead you can buy spoiled fish from roadside shop at higher price. If you want to know more about this place, Please write to me."
Kovalam_Beach,vadivel77,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Family,Not good place to relax,The beach is not clean and it smell bad . If you want to get fish/prawns fresh this is the place. Nothing else you could do here.
Kovalam_Beach,Lavanash,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,Fishermans paradise,"Located alittle on the outskirts, best to go by car as a group and during the day. The beach can be reached by driving through a fishing hamlet. There was direct access through a Mosque, but now as the crowds are more we have to walk or drive around the mosque. Pleasant nice beach with lots of rocks and many fisher boats. There are fish shops selling fried fresh fish. Not a very safe location for visitors in the nights."
Kovalam_Beach,Shantanu Jalgaonkar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015,Kovalam Beach: A good beach to spend evening in Chennai,"I was here in month of June. Beach was in good condition and was properly maintained. Even in June, it was very hot here hence it was difficult to walk in day time due to hot sand.One can enjoy in evening. Sea Bathing is prohibited."
Kovalam_Beach,asp_smc,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Friends,Good and bad !,"This located on the way to mahabalipuram.. good thing about this beach is easy accessibility by road, shallow water areas to enjoy the sea.. but it's not that clean compared to other beaches in and around chennai, one should avoid rocky areas in the beach to avoid injury , also the local people. Can visit once."
Kovalam_Beach,Kaushal16,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Couples,terrible and dirty beach!!!,the beach is located at a fanatic location and has beautiful shape.. but it is mostly filthy and smells bad.. most of the places u will find fisherman boats and no place to really enjoy the beach..
Kovalam_Beach,lpkc,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Family,Pleasant Surprise,We planned to go to Kovalam Beach when we were out of options nearby. But we were quite surprised. the beach has lot of rocky formations where we could actually climb. The place that we approach the beach might be crowded with the fisherman boats and the fish market etc. But we can walk past this and walk further right the beach will be quieter and neater. The place is not commercialized yet. It is very less crowded than other beaches of Chennai. So don't expect coffee shops/ ice cream parlors next to the beach front. The beach is at a walkable distance from the bus stop.
Kovalam_Beach,wellsitekumaran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Family,Best beach in chennai in terms of safety and waves,"I am learning surfing in kovalam beach since last few months. Initially i have perception that this place is not so safe like other beaches in chennai, but everything changed in my first few visits itself. Kovalam is safe place due to its local fishermen community. Sea is more safe due to its coast shape line and rocks near south of the beach give very decent waves for surfers.Visit often kovalam beach then one can realise its beauty."
Kovalam_Beach,Sanjeev_Sharma,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Family,"Dirty , Not maintained - Can be Avoided",The place is dirty and full of vendors all around. you hardly get any space to walk around herenot a place where you can enjoy your time
Kovalam_Beach,Karthik R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Friends,Not a clean beach,"This beach has a great view and a little rocky beach with excellent views, however the approach roads and the beach are very untidy and less hygenic. The parking areas are very limited and not controlled. There are private parking slots which they rent out for Rs.30. Though they are comfortable, unsure about safety and the area is very limited.The beach is crowded on weekends and the approach is full of vendors and narrow approach.One can visit if in Chennai or pass by on ECR as a stop, other than that, a planned visit to this beach is not worth it."
Kovalam_Beach,VALLALAAR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Family,Time and Tides wait for none,"This is a natural beech where the young and old could enjoy. From Broadway and from Koyambad, Thambaram there are enormous buses are plying.   You can surf here enroute to Mahabalipuram andd Pondicherry route , what is called as ECR East Coast Road.   Through this way you can reach Pondycherry shores..Avoid Sundays and national holidays.    Somewhat unclean.   Visitors..pl.  don't spoil the natural environment.   This is not a suitable place in the odd hours...."

Kovalam_Beach,smartwanderer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Business,Nice clean and serene beach,Its away from the hustles of the city. Its quite clean and i liked the serenity of the place. there are some rocks also on the beach making it more beautiful. Its not commercialized yet. So there are no shops or market nearby. Overall a good place to visit on the ECR Road especially if you are travelling to Pondicherry from Chennai

Kovalam_Beach,Shanmuga Prakas... M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Family,If you are a Veg... Please don't visit,"Last month we decided to go on a evening to this beach, the place is full of bad smell and lots of shops blocking pedestrians and lot of encroachments. Not a place if you are a veggie since we are veggies too we couldn't stay beyond 5 minutes because of the bad smell. But the another most awkward thing is even the shore is occupied by lots of boats and there is not place to sit and spend time with you loved ones. unwanted parking charges too..."
Kovalam_Beach,Deepak Praveen,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2014 • Solo,"Kovalam Beach,Chennai","Kovalam beach  is a fishing hamlet about 50 Kms from Chennai , off East Coast Road a visit is recommended during morning hours between 6-8 if you like to watch the fishermen set out to the sea and return back with their catch , one could also pick up fresh fish from the nearby market.Not the cleanest of the beaches hence dont have much expectations."
Kovalam_Beach,Sanjukta R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,Best sunrise,With east coast you always want to visit the beaches in early morning. Rising sun looks awesome. But the heat in Chennai in too much to bear  after the sun rises so dn not plan to stay there for too long.To go the beach take a bus to Kelambakkam. From there take auto or 6 sitters or if you are in a big group you can even broad a small matador to reach Kovalam.

Kovalam_Beach,Dipsy1982,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013,Very  clean and safe,"It was pleasant experience very clean and safe.went with family in December 2013 it had mixed crowd (foreigners, Indians ). Water was clean and good for fun"
Kovalam_Beach,YasInai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Family,A nice place to relax,Its few kms away from Chennai....But it is very good to visit since it is very less crowded than other beaches....
Kovalam_Beach,Karthick_Madurai,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Family,A nice place to enjoy the nature,Kovalam beach is on the East coast road next to Muttukaadu. While driving from Chennai you need to take a left turn just a kilometer after the Muttukadu Bridge. The diversion would take you to the Kovalam village and to the beach. The beach is an crescent shaped one and the view from the beach is lovely. The beach is having a mixture of sand and rocks which is a nice one. It’s would be a great experience to sit on a rock and enjoy the bash by the waves. The neighborhood of the beach not seems to be much friends and safe.  So please be cautions and avoid visiting the place during odd hours.
Kovalam_Beach,oppraveen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2012 • Family,Chennai's Surfers paradise.,This is a great place just outside Chennai is also know as covelong beach. The Surf is very good for surfers and one can see many surfers riding the wave. The beach is reasonably clean. Stay away from the place after dusk. I hope the locals must take steps to make this place safe from drunkards. Fishermen are helpful. One can get a good view of the shore temple from here.
Kovalam_Beach,Nikhil Komath,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2012 • Solo,Good but Watch out,"This beach has lots of potential in terms of tourism but it has been misused like anything, You can see lots of alcohol bottles on the way left by drunkards who misuse the place. Beach was neat and we played football on the beach, It was real fun time. If you are going with family avoid the after 6pm time, you may be trapped by some antisocial elements."
Kovalam_Beach,Aaqarsh Aiyyar,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Friends,getting worse..,"I've been going to this beach for the past 20 years and it has gotten more dirtier, filthier and unsafe of late. Never land in this beach with your family in the dim light. Whilst there are some good spots to sit and relax, you will have to bear the stagnant stinky drainage, avoid the fisher folks' boats and more importantly the slippery fungus and corals. It is getting crowded, especially on weekends and holidays, because of its proximity to a dargah.The beach is now well-linked to all the parts of Chennai city. Its getting from bad to worse."
Kovalam_Beach,Neo123456,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Calm and Less crowded...good for surfing,"There are not many people around. You could just come here and relax...the beach is fine, not very dirty...fishermen around....lot of surfers I saw surfing....the beach had good surfing waves...not exactly towards the beach but at an angle,,,overall nice place to spend a couple of hours at..!"
