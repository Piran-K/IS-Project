Kumaran_Kundram,RajeeshRj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Couples,Nostalgic & Peaceful Place,"Very Nostalgic place where I grew up doing volunteering throught the school. The place has been maintained clean and always provided inner peace whenever I visit the temple.In 1956, Chandrashekarendra Saraswati Swamigal, a twentieth-century saint and seer of the Kanchi Mutt, visited Chromepet. On looking at the hill, he proposed that a temple be built for Murugan. The temple for Siddhi Vinayagar was built in the same year. Twenty years later, while clearing the hillside for a path, a lance, the prime weapon of Lord Muruga, was found. This inspired the devotees to speed up work. The consecration of the Sri Swaminathaswamy temple was performed in 1979. Slowly, more shrines were added for Shiva, Sarabeshwara, Ambal and the Navagrahas.A five tier Rajagopuram has been constructed recently. Though the spade work had commenced long ago, the actual construction work on the Rajagopuram commenced in 2011-12 and concluded in January 2014. Renovation and painting works have also been carried out in the temple in connection with the Mahakumbhabhishekam (consecration ceremony). A new Artha mandapam adjoining the Rajagopuram has been constructed. A few civil works remain to be completed(February 2014). A new Dwajasthambam (Flag Mast) has also been erected. Cultural and religious events like music, dance and discourses were held at the Arunagirinathar Hall inside the temple precincts every day for over a year in 2013-14 as a part of the Rajagopuram construction and temple renovation."

Do not miss the lakshmi narasimhar temple which is just opposite to this temple (at the foothill). That is also a very nice temple. There are small shops nearby for buying pooja /archana items.

That time it was really difficult to reach this place as there were no black roads, only mud paths. It was easy to climb this mountain comparatively to travel and reach this place from shanthi nagar of Chromepet. When you climb the steps there is Adi bhavan an--- Pillayar. Do ""thoppukaranam"" offerings and climb up.You will reach the peak within 5 minutes. Oh God... It is a similar scenic as Madhubala(Roja) experiences withAravindaswamy in Tamil movie ROJA when she reaches Kashmir. Only difference no Aravindaswamy and no snow...but with all greener is of Chromepet, pallavaram, Trisulam hills at far... and ultimately God is next to you. When you enter you see The Lord with attractive smile.God Murugan with his Wives... Feel this divine freshness at kumaran kind ram. You will not gasp after climbing here in Kumaran kundram..Try to visit this temple once if you are in south chennai. Now this hillock adopted multiple God statues.There is a site to park two wheelers and Bi cycles.No rest room near by."
