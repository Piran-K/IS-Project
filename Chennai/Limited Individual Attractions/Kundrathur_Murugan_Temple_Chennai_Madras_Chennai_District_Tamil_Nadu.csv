Kundrathur_Murugan_Temple,ABDESH,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Lord Subramaniar is standing in a north facing Direction/only temple in Tamilnadu,"It is Located in Kundrathur,Kanchipuram District around 15 kms from Tambaram.  Lord Subramaniar(Murugan) son of Lord Siva stayed on the hill during his travels from Thiruporur to Tiruttanigai.  This is the only Murugan temple in Tamil Nadu where the God is standing in a north facing direction.This temple was constructed by King Kulothunga Chola II.I think it has around 100 steps but which is easily climbable comparing other hill temples.Vehicles (cars, bikes, autos) can also be driven up the hill. It is located in beautiful surrounding. You can reach the Lord Murugan Temple from Kundrathur bus stand by autos quickly."

Kundrathur_Murugan_Temple,Venkataraman R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Family,Hillock temple of Lord Muruga in Chennai,"Lord Muruga temples in the hillocks are special, as Muruga is the God of Kurinji land classification ( hill and hill surrounding area). Kundrathur temple is very beautiful hillock temple of lord Muruga. Temple very big and the stairs to the temple are also very wide and less in numbers. One good thing about the temple is that people can travel by car to the hillock by a special road for travelling to the temple. so for elder people and for people for whom it is difficult to claim can easily go till the temple entrance."

Kundrathur_Murugan_Temple,SubashSL,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,"The ""cutest"" Murugan you can find!","Not an ""Arupadai Veedu"" but a very holy shrine for Murugan nevertheless, that you cannot afford to miss. The easiest way to go there is via the GST road via Pallavaram. Actually it is also located not far form the ""Thiruneermalai Perumal Temple"" which means you could visit the ""Neervanna Perumal/Ranganathar Perumal Temple (Divya Desam)"" also if you can figure out the closest route to this temple which on Google Maps looks pretty close. Went there on a Sunday and it was somewhat crowded. There is ample parking space for two-wheelers and four-wheelers. The flight of steps is not steep and not many in number either. The best tip is to avoid walking the lengthy empty ""snaking"" queue, particularly if there is no crowd. Lookout for an entrance near the columns located to the left of the main shrine, where you can enter the queue easily instead of going through piped long winding enclosure. Chances are that if other people find this entrance you end up even more behind  the rear of the queue. The ""Darshan"" is blissful. Your ""Archana"" coconuts will have to be given to a priest who breaks them before you reach the main deity. So do not forget this step as they will not allow you to break the coconuts before the deity . The route from Kundrathur back to GST via Pallavaram is traffic chocked and so if you could find another alternative that would be good too. "
Kundrathur_Murugan_Temple,Dilip Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,The beautiful lord with a beautiful smile on a beautiful small hill,I have been to the temple thrice. ONE of the few temples on a hill in chennai. The hill on which the temple sits is full of Neem trees. New structures seems to have added to the old temple. Most important feature is the Lord's idol. The small idol with a smiling face beholds in the devotte's mind forever. The God captivates the vision so much that one can hardly discover goddess valli and devasena standing besides.A must visit for devotees of Murugan (Lord Subramanya swamy) and also others for having a experience of small hill in chennai with beautiful temple. ONE can even drive upto the temple but the road is quiet steep..

Kundrathur_Murugan_Temple,amohandasblr,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018,A typical Murugan Hill temple,"The temple is on a small hillock. The short ascend is not a big deal even for a 60 year olds. Even otherwise, there is another road way to reach the top. The approach is not all that clean and hygienic but the temple is well maintained and the crowd is considerable. The  outer ring road that connects Nemilichery/Pattabiram and vandalur is closeby. One can come through this route too. Otherwise, the road to kunrathur from porur is traffic prone. Yes, kunrathur is now highly populated. The deity is with Valli and Deivanai and the darshan is divine. Would like to visit again. Wonderful place. "
