Light_House,magneaske,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,White man tax,I want to see the lighthouse but can‚Äôt due to racism. Wondering when they will remove the white man tax.
Light_House,Radhika Narasimhan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Jaw dropping lighthouse,"Seeing the lighthouse in Marina is not my first time visit. Being a Chennaite from childhood days I have been to the lighthouse many times. Still each time it appears new to me. History says to avoid crashing of ships near chennai, during British rule it was constructed. From 10am to 5pm tourist are allowed to climb the lighthouse. Views are great, sunset and sunrise are awesome while viewing the city on the other side is great. My all time favourite spot of chennai which I recently visited."
Light_House,Anand M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Top View of a Top Beach,"Marina Beach, Chennai is by far among the best beaches in India. But, if you have not experienced it atop the Light House, you missed its breathtaking beauty. There is a museum there too. A very inconspicuous tower that you could easily ignore as you pass the road. And yet, as you experience its view it leaves behind an eternal impression of Chennai's uniqueness, history and beauty."

Light_House,Prem Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Amazing view to from the top,I went to the light house with my friend it was really a great experience to view the city from the light house. The beauty of the marina and the road from that view was simply awesome. And the housing area view from the top as a treat to watch. And they have a charge of 20rs per person for viewing from the lighthouse. And i couldn't see the entire view since there was an issue with the honey bee in one section. The view of the chidambaram stadium and city centre was also the notable things to watch.

Light_House,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great Light house to view the longest coast line & ,Chennai light house is a wonderful construction located at the end of Mareena Beach towards Santhome. Most of the people think its of no use going on top and there is not much to see. But it is an amazing opportunity to see the sea and the Mareena beach road from the top of the light house. It's an awesome experience that everybody should try.I strongly recommend you take your young children and explain the purpose of it. So it will be more intresting for young kids.
Light_House,Wil Chung,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Great views,"There is a lift to the top to see some great views. You cannot walk around the whole of the top (3 and a bit sides), but you can get a full 360 view.Very cheap - 50rs for foreigners whilst only 20 for Indians. But for 75p that's worth it.Not really anything else to do at the top so you only really spend 10 minutes or so before going back down.Well worth a visit if you're visiting the beach of the Mahata Ghandi statue at the same time. "

The views from the gallery are breathtaking and if you're a photography enthusiast, this is a great opportunity to get some great wide angle and telephoto shots!

Light_House,Valavanur Natar... K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Write up of Chennai light house on the Marina,"If a visitor to Chennai or for that matter a local resident,  has never had a birds eye view or a Panaromic view of Chennai's east Coromandel coast line with  its vast beach (the 2nd longest in the world) it is best done from the watch  tower of the light house,  on Kamarajar Salai or Marina beach road as it is the closest tower nearer to the beach front .As for the purpose of the light house itself ,it may not hold great importance for providing  navigational  direction for modern ships as they  are  now equipped with  GPS, radar and other modern  electronic devises for finding directions at sea for heading to the port of Chennai .But Fishermen ,  venturing into deep  sea with trawlers with no GPS ,  would still depend on this light house beacon with unified set of  timing between two powerful beam of  revolving  light , to identify the land mark of Chennai port . Mahabalipuram  lighthouse to south of Chennai and 60 kms is the next nearest to this and has  a differential timing for light beacon.This would help Fishermen  living along the long coast to easily return to their hamlet using this beacons. It's interesting to trace  the history of light house in  Chennai. Chennai has had four light houses in the past.The history of the Madras Lighthouse dates back to 1795. In 1796, the roof of the Officers Mess in what is now known as Fort St George, was selected as the site for the first warning beacon. It was nothing more than a large lantern. To be more specific, the first Light House of Chennai functioned (1796 ‚Äì 1841) at the Building in the Fort St George where the Fort Museum is located.The second light house was erected between the 1838 and 1844 on the north side of Fort St George.Light House (Old), ChennaiThis lighthouse operated until 1894. Though its lantern room was removed long ago to fit in the third light house also located in the Madras High Court Complex, the Tower stands tall even today.The third light House was functioning from the tallest dome of the Madras High Court. It started functioning on June 1, 1894, with argand lamps and reflectors manufactured by Chance Bros, Birmingham which had originally been installed in the 160-ft-tall lighthouse tower.The present light House  is located opposite the office of the Director General of Police and was opened in January 1977. It is one of the few lighthouses in the world and the only one in India with an elevator.The Mahabalipuram  lighthouse near chennai was located in Mamallapuram and It was open to tourists since 2011. It was closed in 2001 following perceived LTTE threat. The first light was commissioned here in 1887. The lighthouse with a circular masonry tower made of natural stone became fully functional in 1904. India's oldest lighthouse, built around 640 AD by Pallava king Mahendra Pallava stands next to this modern structure. The Pallava era lighthouse is a protected monument, maintained by the Archaeological SurveyThe Chennai light house is open for tourists on all days except Mondays and the fee is very nominal Rs 10 for children Rs 20 for adults and Rs 50 for foreigners ( I wonder why this disparity) This includes a stroll through the museum in it .Camera will be charged extra at Rs 25 .It has adequate number of car parking and two wheelers parking space .I would caution visitors to gather avoid the South view as it would be a little depressing ."
Light_House,Gene R J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Easy access to a great overview of Chennai.,"After visiting the 1842 Ice House, we crossed the 1000' wide Marina Beach to see the wooden fishing boats. Looking south we could see the 150' Lighthouse built in 1977, just a short walk away.  After paying $3, we joined 6 locals and the elevator operator for the 3 minute lift to the 9th floor, then climbed another story to reach the viewing platform.  What a wonderful view. Quickly down, and walk to the back to see its small museum showing old lights from the previous lighthouses (1796 & 1894), where there are clean restrooms. This inexpensive activity is all good news."

Light_House,Saurabh Srivastav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Imposing & eyecatching structure,It is an iconic structure of town but the good part for tourists is that the entry fee is just Rs.20/- .The view from there is a treat.It's built about 42 year back and hence is modern in the sense that it has an elevator which takes you to the ninth floor - the maximum allowed for visitors.So one neednot sweat in climbing stairs all way up.It is said to be totally solar powered too.
Light_House,sathish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,One of a kind,Must visit as one of a kind in India. Views from the gallery are great. Collecting tickets and moving up to the viewing platform is hassle free. Older people may need some support for the stairs leading to the viewing platform

Light_House,TheWorldNut,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Very nice view,"You can't have a better view of Marina beach then one from the top of this light house. There is an elevator followed by fewflights of steps to reach to the top. Not much space on the top viewing platform, hence if crowded this can be not so much fun but given there were not many people on a Sunday afternoon, one can safely take a chance. Neverthless the views from the top is great and, you can see a great expanse of the sea, follwed by the sand and then a nicely urbanized stretch. Quite a good view I must say. The viewing platform is grilled but still be careful with very small kids. Just fyi - They don't allow bags inside, which has to be kept with the guard outside and cameras (even the big DSLRs) are allowed for a fee."
Light_House,Mukesh Asher,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Must visit,"A very good place to visit. The management is good. One has to buy a ticket of Rs 20/- to go up.

Some of these Indian tourist sites also have annoying rules about not taking photographs - this is one of those sites, but everyone up in the light house ignored this rule.  It is relatively inexpensive to take the elevator up, so by all means take 20 minutes, check out the lighthouse, then walk the beach."

There is no access to the light or the top of the structure but from the balcony you get a good view of the beach.I can only imagine it's true beauty as it was a grey blustery day when I was there yesterday. Notwithstanding, an interesting place to visit with ample parking at the side opposite the beach. "
Light_House,Nomad,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good view of the beach and ocean,"It was breezy and free of noise from ground level. We were able to have good elevated view of the beach, beach road and Tamil Nadu state's police headquarters. We were not allowed into the top most floor that housed the lamp and its associated mechanics. There wasn't a lot of space as it was more like an 'U' shaped narrow balcony. Clear sunny day is a must for good experience. There was a small museum on the ground floor which we peeked our heads into and found unappealing so skipped to the exit."

Light_House,Balasubramanian R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Chennai Light house,"Light House is situated on the sea shore of bay of bengal. It is in Mylapore and on the beach road. Light house is tall and you can reach top through lift. This helps ship and fishermen to identify chennai land area.

Light_House,YashiR25,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,NOT SO GOOD,"It is just a tall well-maintained building near to sea. You don't get the hang of a light house as the lift takes you directly to the top floor from where you could see the ball-structured Marine Department Building located at Parrys.SHALL be avoided if planning to/ or have been to Mahabalipuram Light house where you climb the circular stairs.Of course, there happens to be an entrance fee to cover the operational costs."
Light_House,Olivier R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Interesting view if sky is clear,"It doesn't cost much and takes half an hour at most, so I'd say to go if you want an overall view of Chennai and the Bay of Bengal. Unfortunately, when we went there, the sky wasn't clear due to a little smog so the view wasn't so great. Nonetheless it was an interesting sight."

Light_House,amohanro,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,LIGHTHOUSE,"This is again an iconic landmark of Chennai.  Anyone going to the beach glances at it at least once before they leave.  It's that iconic.  There was a time when people were allowed to climb right to the top, but a few suicides in the 1970-80s put paid to that and it's next to impossible now to get a view from the top unless until you are a crow."
