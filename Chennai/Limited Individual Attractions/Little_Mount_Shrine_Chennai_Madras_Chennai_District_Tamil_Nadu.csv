Little_Mount_Shrine,Tigerlove50,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 â€¢ Couples,A special place.,We visited this spot with our guide it was tucked away in busy Chennai. It was where St Thomas hid in the cave.  The gardens showed the stations of the cross but they had a very new meditation area with a magnificent modern depiction of Christ which I found very beautiful the light was perfect in there. They also were placing some lovely mosaics into the windows.They have a toilet there but I was shown to the special seated toilet in the main hall.

The place is awe inspiring for people who expect the unexpected. Quite spectacular was the collection of relics from saints and locations from across the world and spanning a few centuries, including the relics of St Thomas.

Little_Mount_Shrine,rotsen2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 â€¢ Solo,Visit to the Shrines of St Thomas the Apostle in Chennai,"Firstly, please be AWARE that there are three shrines to St Thomas in Chennai that have similar names. Firstly, ST THOMAS MOUNT where the saint was killed, and secondly, LITTLE MOUNT where the saint lived and spent time in prayer. Near SAN THOME CATHEDRAL is the place where the saint was initially buried before the body was exhumed and sent elsewhere.I visited only St Thomas Mount and the Little Mount shrines.Being a senior citizen I was tired climbing up the many steps of St Thomas Mount. Older people should take an autorickshaw up via a back road. Once up, apart from religious sentiments, one gets some panoramic views of certain parts of Chennai.Little Mount - known as CHINNAMALAI to the locals (important info for auto drivers) - has a few things connected to St Thomas as well as a miraculous spring, now contained in a room about 12 feet by six feet.Both shrines are very well maintained, are serene locations, and takes one away from the hustle and bustle of the city"
Little_Mount_Shrine,Michelle,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 â€¢ Family,Visit only if you absolutely have to!,"I lived around this place many years ago and used to visit the little mount every week. A fully functional circular-domed Catholic Church exists on the mount and you need to climb quite a few stairs to get to it. Towards the side of the church exists a cave which has been credited to the apostle, St. Thomas. The claim of a hand print of the apostle imprinted on the rock is another aspect to the cave. Other than this, there is really nothing much. However, if your curiosity does get the better of you, do visit! (Not sure about the timings though as the cave is not always open to the public, so be sure to check that before getting there).  "

I look for opportunities to visit St Thomas mount."

It also has a water pit, which is believed to be created by St. Thomas himself when the people of chennai faced a severe water crises for drinking water.. and it is still a miracle that the water is coming between the rocks non stop even after 21 centuries.. a definite miracle from the Apostle of Jesus.

The place looks dirty, shabby and badly needs some maintenance and general cleaning.  Even the gardens supposed to be maintained by the Bank of India badly needs some maintenance work.  It is a large Hall and a roof top hall for probably cultural and relegious activities.  The most impressive item here is the relica of an ancient Chariot.  Beautifully crafted with 2 bulls is worth a second look."

Little_Mount_Shrine,LeenaIM,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 â€¢ Solo,The hiding cave of st.thomas,"There seems some confusion in the reviews of the place. The place known as little mount is locally called chinnamalai and the church is named as 'our lady of health'. This is located at Saidapet and NOT near the airport. The church or shrine near the airport is st.thomas mount. Little mount is believed to be the place where St. Thomas was in hiding. You can see the cave as an underground place attached to the church. There is a rock with a huge palm impression and it is believed that this palm impression belongs to St.Thomas. There is a spring which again is believed to have been in existence from the time of St.Thomas and many devotees carry this water back along with them. This place therefore has historic and religious importance. Just around the church there is a small garden with the depiction of the stations of the cross. Though I wasn't here for any Good Friday service, I am told it is a beautiful and meaningful service."

Little_Mount_Shrine,paribrajika,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2011 â€¢ Solo,Pilgrims progress,"The shrine centers around the little underground basalt cave in which St thomas is said to have taken refuge to escape from his prosecutors and the perennial spring  said to have miraculously arisen to quench his thirst .The 14th century Portugese church that stands above is still in use and the local congregation gathers to celebrate mass on Sundays.It is not a touristy place but visited by streams of earnest pilgrims has an air of peace and sanctity about it.It is an amazing feeling to drink from the perrennial spring as a pilgrim pours out a tiny mugful into your cupped hands.The cave entrance is hidden by an adjacent chapel and once you have siddled inside there is hardly space to stand erect in the low basalt cave where St Thomas used to meditate. It is bare except for an altar that has been placed quite recently.you can also see the narrow (grilled) opening in the cave wall said to have opened up miraculously to allow the saint to escape from his pursuers.The entire shrine has a feeling of ascetic serenity and prayerfulnes about it along with a sense of historical drama and danger.It is highly recommended for devout Catholics as well as history buffs.Note: The locals call it Chinna malai (little mount) and is located in Saidapet. It should not be confused with the much higher and more famous Periya malai (big mount)/Firangi malai which is popularly called St thomas mount and overlooks the airport, and was the site of St thomas' Martyrdom.Several reviews on this page confuse the two, the photographs are of the little  mount shrine ."

Little_Mount_Shrine,indianesj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2012 â€¢ Family,History &,"Before you go to this church please read a few articles about this place. You will find it interesting to witness what you have read. Otherwise all you will see is an abandoned church & its untold history. The cave in which St. Thomas was hiding before he escaped to St. Thomas Mount where he was martyred, is still preserved here. A small rock bearing his foot prints still lay here, half preserved (or should I say had survived the authorities negligence). The eternal spring (source unknown)  on top of the hill, which had quenched the thirst of St. Thomas lies as a perennial source of water even during peak summers. You can also find a cross St. Thomas had carved in a single piece of rock."
Little_Mount_Shrine,Wolfsbane_12,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2012 â€¢ Family,Barely anything,Went there with a lot foe expectations. There was barely anything there. A church which looked abandoned. the place is poorly maintained. the only thing worth saying is that the view of the city from there is really good. nothing else. But Google earth gives a better view. Would avoid the place if i were you.

Little_Mount_Shrine,dhanyamarath,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2011 â€¢ Solo,A must visit church - I find peace here,"In 2008, when I was new in Chennai I happened to see a statue in little mount (chinnamalai, Saidapet) which attracted me. I followed it and reached this church and it was wow I found peace there! No one talked much about this church, though it is one of the tourist spots in chennai. I did not know the history, I was only in search of peace and I found it there, I would say. As mentioned in the other comment, there is a small cave (a very cool place to beat the heat of chennai) which is the attraction point in this church. I find lot of crowd in and around church, but when I get into the cave and sit there for a while I will feel as if I am meditating. It's a good feeling and it is worth visiting this place in chennai."
Little_Mount_Shrine,The_Pale_Ridah,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2010,St Thomas the Apostle was killed in India...this is no joke!,"St Thomas travelled the long road to India to spread Jesusâ€™ teachings & like many of these Apostles, died a violent death. Modern day Chennai aka Madras or Mylapore was the location of his martyrdom, making the Indian Church the 2nd oldest church community in the world, next to the Catholic Church, with a direct connection to Jesus.The holy site at Little Mount or locally known as Chinnamalai comprises the cave where St Thomas lived, a holy spring, a stone carved cross & a small circular chapel. Inside the cave is a stone boulder with an imprint of a hand on it, supposedly St Thomasâ€™s hand print or that of a large beast. Being alone in the cave I thought about this being the hand print of a bloke who hung out & drank wine with Jesus! Near the cave is a fresh water spring that miraculously appeared to quench the thirst of followers, a shame Hindus didnâ€™t drink wine, a mysterious wine spring would create some buzz id imagine. Inside the locked shed that protects the stream is an ancient stone cross that was uncovered recently & believed to have been carved by the saint himself & on which he hugged while he was violently stabbed to death by a hating Brahmin priest.Little Mount is located in Saidapet, Chennai near the Maraimalal Adigalar bridge. The chapel is open all day & is a cool blessing from Chennaiâ€™s heat. Many auto-rickshaw/taxi drivers might not know where it is but just tell them to go to Saidapet & ask around. There are no admission fees but the old man who holds the key to the natural spring & stone cross might appreciate a small â€˜donationâ€™ for unlocking the door to access the cross & spring, u can find him loitering around the place. A visit to Little Mount cannot be complete without a trip to the San Thome Basilica which is one of three places in the world where a church has been built over the tomb of an Apostle of Jesus, the others being the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain for St James & St Peterâ€™s Basilica at the Vatican in Rome."
