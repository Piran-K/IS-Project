MGR_Memorial,Subhashani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Couples,Discovering MGR the local way,"As a kid had heard a lot of stories about MGR from my father. Though I did not understand the language still saw some of his movies on television. A multifaceted man with loads of charisma and talent, he was looked upon by everyone and became an iconic figure in every stream of his life.At the cost of sounding ignorant I will accept that when I landed in Chennai and decided to visit the Marina Beach, I had no clue that there was a memorial in his name. So how could I miss it?There are no entry tickets and there is a museum in the same campus which we missed due to lack of time. According to available information the memorial has undergone a lot of renovations to look like what it looks today. It is best if you read a bit about the man and the memorial before visiting it, especially if you have no idea of his cult following.The place is well kept and neat but very crowded. People throng to it like a pilgrimage site. We were there on a weekday and were told that weekends are jam packed. Spent approximately 2 hours roaming around, watching people and just chatting.There is an ever burning lamp and people make sure to bow down to it. We noticed some people putting their ears and trying to listen to something. When we enquirer they said that there is a ticking sound coming from inside the black marble/granite structure. Some said it is MGR's heart and some more reasonable ones said that when the structure was built MGR's wrist watch was buried inside and one can still hear the ticking. When we tried we could not hear anything but believers are believers.So if you stay long enough you can gather enough stories for dinner :) Either way it is a good way to spend a few hours and chat with the locals and get to know more about how the public looks at MGR.There are finger foods and snacks available and then the beach is right next door with many eating options."
