M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Ravi K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,GREAT HIDEOUT,"I had been to M.A. Chidambaram stadium several times.   In fact most of the match days i was there, right from Ranji Trophy to Tests, ODIs, T20s, IPL.  A wonderful stadium with cool breeze from the Sea. Marina beach is also one of the attractions. I love to watch the games from galleries and enjoy the fun with spectators including dancing, whistling, mexican wave.  Since my boyhood days, i have been going to this stadium.   Those days we use to carry Curd rice, Tamarind rice, idly etc along with friends and enjoy home food.  I still cherish the great innings played by Gundappa Viswanath in 1975 against mighty West Indies.  He scored a magnificient 97 runs unbeaten. Sachin Tendulkar's century in 2008 chasing 387 runs was also special. IPL matches were delightful, colourful.  The TIE test in 1986 against Aussies."

M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,krazikams,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Home ground of CSK,"Ever since the IPL started, I try to watch atleast 1 match here featuring the local Chennai Super Kings team. The atmosphere is just electric and full of energy. Just that they need to improve facilities for public like hygienic toilets and drinking water. Also, in-house snacks are very expensive and we cannot carry food from outside. Also, big chaos and queue for parking. So, if they improve these things, it will become convenient for public and cricket lovers."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,kvramani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Grand Old Cricket Stadium of Chennai.,"1. Located in the center of Chennai, it is a historical place for the game of cricket in Chepauk.2. Many great giants and masters of Cricket have played here.3. This ground has seen some of the fine moments of the game, including clasiic Tie of a Test match.4. Green field with new modern stand can seat about 45000 spectators.5. It is a big disappointment that 3 of the new stands are not open to fans, due to illogical and unexplained reasons.6. This ground is famous for Test, one day and T20 Cricket.7. It is only 500 meters from the world famous Marina beach."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Muguncjb,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Not an attraction,"It is one of the oldest stadium to host International and domestic cricket matches in India.  People interested in watching Cricket directly can go to the stadium. Otherwise it can be seen in live in TV when matches are played.  It is located near to the top attraction Marina beach in Chennai. Triplicane, Sri Parthasarathy Temple is near by too. If you take Chennai beach-Velachery local train, it will pass near to the stadium."

M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Praveenop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017,The Hallowed spot of Indian cricket,This international cricket stadium has seen the greatest ( I mean the greatest test match) moments of history were made here. The present stadium looks truly beautiful but  it  has not been completed for a few years now. If this project is completed the stadium would be a marvel. MS Dhoni has taken active interest in designing the stadium so  that the bowlers and the batsmen could take advantage of the evening breeze. It was designed in such a way that the breeze from the Marina beach would breeze pass through the gaps in the stands to the gorund. It still has some issues with the authorities over civil permissions. In Spite of all this the stadium is one of the best looking stadium in India and internationally. 
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,ramchabi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Great iconic stadium, It is the oldest continuously used cricket stadium in the country. It is also the home of CSK. The place doesn’t have much parking and so it is best reached by public transport or by taxis.  The food available is okay and you can’t get alcohol at the stadium. The box is a comfortable place to watch the game but the best place is outside.

There was not much of food options for this match and a bit expensive as always with these kinds of places.
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,BalajiSubramanian86,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,A world class ground which needs little improvement,"The renovated MAC, Chennai is one of the best places to watch cricket. Beautiful lawns and chairs. The newly build tiered stands give it a MCG feel. Have watched T20, Test and ODIs. The chennai crowd is always sportive and give a standing ovation to all performers even if it is India or any other country. The mexican wave is a nice thing to experience here. Things to improve: food spread and a bit of cleanliness needs to be taken care of. The beach is close by. So the stadium might get windy at times."

M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Joji J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,"""Venue of several Cricket Matches""","It's something great that such a big stadium is maintained in the city but the effort is worth since a cricket match is announced here and the stadium becomes the talk of the world. The stadium is maintained properly with all facilities and built to accomodate about 50000 people to watch a cricket test or match. The stadium is a regular venue for cricket matches and have food outlets, proper entry, rooms for players and dignitaries etc. Though I have been to the stadium several times I have just seen only an IPL Match here."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Arun K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Cricket at its best !!,"My first visit here was an India-Australia test match and it was simply awesome. The match was headed for a nail biting finish on the 5th day (which sadly got washed out).Also been here for a few IPL matches.The stadium experience is simply different with crazy shouting and cheering.However, the seating is not entirely appropriate since there is literally no ventilation. You will be left sweating profusely."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Nchantedtraveller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Nice grounds in the middle of busy Chennai city,"A stadium with a lot of cricket history. Cricket fans will enjoy a visit here even if there is no game. I watched a Test cricket game between India and England last year from air-conditioned club house. Very pleasant but the seating could have been better. Plastic deck chairs were not comfortable. The snack and lunch vendors were not good, not very organized to sell to the crowd within the allotted lunch hour. Needs a lot of improvement to belong in the upper categories of sports facilities around the world."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,tafayyaz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Nice Place for tourist and sports lover.,One of the old and famous cricket stadium of India. The overall management for players and spectators are excellent.
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Bob R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,It could be so good but..,"This is  a very attractive ground but, unfortunately, legal rows mean half the stands are not used. Seating was comfortable, a miracle given that just a couple of days before it had been strewn all over the stadium by a cyclone. Entry is chaotic, not helped by our gate being next to the open sewer/polluted watercourse that runs along one side of the ground - its best to breathe through your mouth. Reasonable selection of food on offer but water only available in paper cups which the vendors handle insides of with hands they use for the money. You cannot bring bottled water in yourself.There were more security and ticket checks than I have ever had including boarding international flights."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Anand G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Hunting Ground for Indian Spinners,"The stadium is one of the best cricket stadiums in the country. Famous for the spinner friendly pitch, it had traditionally been a hunting ground for Indian spinners. A visit at any point of time evokes memories of great performances by heroes of cricket, Indian or otherwise."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Ra_Radha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,Cricketing zone,"Home to CSK, this ground has hosted many famous and historic cricket matches. Renovated few years back, it offers nice view of cricket action in middle even from top rows. Very near to Beach."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Rucha121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Couples,Awesome stadium,"Located within city, this cricket stadium offers best sporting entertainment during IPL and has hosted several International matches as well. Recently renovated, it looks majestic, however, due to stand-off with Corporation, few stands have been sealed off."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Snowyontour,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Iconic ground - shame half of it was shut due to dodgy planning permission!,"We were there for the fifth Test and were fortunate enough to see a good part of the ground. Sadly half of the stadium was shut due to the fact (we were told) that three stands had been built without planning permission.Would recommend a visit - maybe to a Chennai Super Kings game - if they ever return to the IPL - they were banned due to ""irregularities"" sadly something that seems to plague cricket in the sub continent."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,ErnieGodalming,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Basic stadium,"Not the greatest stadium that I have been to with half the ground out of commission due to planning and construction difficulties. seating comprised old plastic bucket seats with tie straps. The ground was having to cope with a recnet cyclone but was filthy and overwhelming stench from the Buckingham canal was at times overpowering and food should be avoided as one person from our hotel ate the doughnuts on offer and was hospitalised. The cricket did provide plenty of the right runs, however. "
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,oaksfield,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Indian Bureaucracy at its best!,"Went to see the text match cricket in December 2016.  They wouldn't sell tickets to anyone until the actual day.  People were coming out at 'tea' and not being let back in despite valid ticket.  Had to queue from 6am to get ticket for 1 day.  Three sections not uses as apparently they didn't have necessary permissions to build them so couldn't use them.  The bureaucracy was diabolical, the stadium was only half full (at best) but they still didn't want to sell tickets.  Seats near the river had an over powering 'odour' ..... try to get seats up wind of these!  Such a pity they couldn't get their act together, very bad publicity for the country. Sadly England didn't do well either - but it was great watching the match."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Elaine,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Attractive stadium but could be so much better,"First of all, congratulations to the ground staff who got this stadium ready to host a test match just days after the cyclone had caused such devastation.We were in the main pavilion area with views of the attractive individual stands. However three of these are not used due to a Supreme Court ruling about planning permission and therefore detracts from the overall experience of sight and atmosphere.Our seating was plastic chairs cable tied together. Quite comfortable but far to many in each row obstructing the steps and no clear path between sections and the stairs.Considering the ground was half empty there was no need for this.Leaving the stand in a hurry would be almost impossible as there's only one exit to channel through.There were plenty of food and drink stalls with good prices. But drinks were served in paper cups, no bottles allowed. I prefer a bottle so I can keep sipping rather than drinking it all in one go.Security was shambolic and inconsistent which was frustrating.A nice stadium (please open all the stands).I enjoyed my visit."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,shrinikethv,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Needs to be organized better,"Recently visited this stadium for 5th test, India vs England. Stadium has improved a lot, getting much better. But three stands are currently useless which is a pathetic sight. Something has to be done to ensure these 3 stands are in use. The pricing of food inside the staidum is nearly twice as the MRP, which is too much!"
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,blueandy1mac,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Much improved,Looks a great stadium but needs to pass local planning requirements before 3 of its stands can be used again. Strangely they were in use for thee WC in 2011.
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,APK24,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Enjoyed a day at the cricket!,I visited recently for the India v England test match that took place here. The ground was in good condition inspite of the cyclone that lashed the city earlier in the month. I had a great fun day at the cricket. However i strongly recommend taking public transport or a cab to the ground as parking is an issue
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,ChrisJS51,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Shambolic organisation and poor facilitiews,"We watched the Fifth Test Match between India and England. Some highlights (or lowlights):- Two huge new stands were completely empty. This apparently is because of a dispute between the owner (who believes he is a law unto himself) and the local planning authorities who want him to pull the stands down- We arrived with tickets telling us to enter at Gate 10. Stewards gate 120 told us to go to Gate 11. Stewards at gate 11 told us to go to gate 10. They eventually got this sorted out on the second day- Most days, prospective spectators were being turned away on the basis that the ground was full. In fact, not only were the stands mentioned above completely empty, but none of the others were much more than half-full either- The stadium appears to be staffed entirely by contractors who have never worked at the place before and don't know how it should be run- The TVs in our air-conditioned box were almost completely invisible as the box was south-facing and the screens were in front of us - so the glare was overpowering- Access to the box was via one lift which took 12 people, and two staircases which ran from the ground floor to the fourth. The fourth was one floor above us, and provided open seating and ad hoc catering facilities. Both staircases were almost permanently locked (except for exit at the end of the day), and lift access to the fourth floor was disabled. To support this, the lift contained an operator who sat on a stool all day (taking up two spaces in the lift) and did nothing but press the buttons, and two security guards who sat all day by the locked gates to the staircases doing nothing. This was apparently done to stop people without tickets for our air-conditioned floor gaining access to it. The consequences were that: (1) the only access during the day in or out of our box (which sat several hundred people) was via one lift which took ten people; (2) to get up one floor for the catering or for an outside view, we had to go down in the lift to the ground floor then walk up four flights; (3) there was a massive fire risk. When our tour group leader remonstrated with the authorities about the fire risk, they said it was OK because in the event of fire the man with the key would come and open the locked gates (if you believe that you'll believe anything). We suggested that the security guards on the staircases unlock the gates and actually check tickets - this would be better than having them sat down all day next to a locked gate doing nothing - but we were ignored. Our tour guide contemplated taking us all out of the box for safety reasons, but it would have been quite obvious that the authorities would have done nothing about it and we simply wouldn't have been able to watch the cricket."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,jaytara,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,Pompous staff,"Paid Rs 4000/- for a season ticket to watch the cricket Test in Dec 2016. Seats were fine, but the security was over the top, they wouldn't allow anything in, not even newspapers, and one had to buy overpriced and mediocre stuff inside. The bigwigs sat happily in the pavilion with nary a care. Chennai should not stage Test matches, the stadium is as bad as the airport."

Got a seat at the pavilion terrace right behind the sight screen. Hmmm! what a view one gets of the pitch, and the players with the match being played under flood lights. The ambience was electrifying what with all the cheer leaders, the music between each over and the game itself. The out field is lush green and if it is a full house then it will add to the atmosphere. Great place to watch a nice cricket match."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Prabhu P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Business,Lion's Den,Have been thrice to MAC for enjoying the Chennai Super Kings' roaring at the Den.

M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,Rajesh C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,Spectacular Stadium,"The MAC is a beautiful venue to watch cricket. The views are fantastic and the greens are worth the trip. It's easily one of the best stadiums to watch cricket in India. Scoreboards are well placed but there is only one big screen TV to watch the replays. Generally, snacks are served but they are not as hot/cold as you would prefer. The food court areas are always a mess and untidy and the toilets suck. Note that you would not be allowed to take any food items inside the stadium during matches - and that's just to make you buy the local fare available there at an exorbitant cost. Please be seated well in advance (30-60 mins) for the matches. In most cases, there are no seat numbers and you may end up standing for the entire duration of a match.Having said all this, there is no comparison to watching a match on TV and experiencing the match live on the grounds. It's an experience like no other. "

M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,ssiddhartha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Family,Great Stadium to witness cricket match,"Visited M A Chidambaram Stadium for the ICC Womens T20 World Cup and I was satisified with what was on offer. The security check at the gate was top class and inside the stadium, the atmosphere was wonderful (inspite of it being a women's match).The snacks counter had a decent variety of snacks and the service in the seating area pushed up the sales. A sore sight was that three stands in the stadium had to be empty due to an ongoing litigation with the corporation authorities.All said and done, one of the appreciated cricket stadiums in India to witness a cricket match."
M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,ivoryav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,"Clean, compact stadium, good security","The seating is great. Watch out for the sun during peak summer months, the lower stands are exposed. It is kept pretty clean and lots of nice promotion/cheering gear is sold outside just before you enter. The security is tight. Great experience to watch a match here. I hope they open all the stands as the last time i went they had blocked some stands due to no approval. "

M_A_Chidambaram_Stadium,AbhishekKalra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015,Great experience,Went to the stadium for an IPL match as part of team outing. The stadium is a gigantic structure and stands outs in its vicinity. A few pointers from my experiences1) Carefully designed stutcture with keen eye on the saftey (Multiple exits)2) Multi level Seating (With the VIP box on the lower floor)3) Well lit4) Beautifully curated field5) Multiple Exit gates6) Convenient Location (Right in the centre of the city)Despite all the ups as mentioned above the place does comes wiht its own flaws1) Disturbing Empty stands (caught up in some legal mess)2) Crowded surroundings (might hamper during emergency)Bottomline: Just go and enjoy the game (Surreal Experience (First game in a stadium))
