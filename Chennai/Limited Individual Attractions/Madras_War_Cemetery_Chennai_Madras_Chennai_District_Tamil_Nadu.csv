Madras_War_Cemetery,S_Venkatesh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,"Cool, Green, Reverence for the Brave Departed","Madras War Cemetry is an Oasis of Peace, right next to the Frenetic Pace of City life passing before it. It is easily accessed by City Bus, Share Auto, Call Taxi etc, located near Miot Hospital. The Cool, Green, Well-Tended Lawns provide a Serene setting for the All-Pervasive Calm & Quiet enveloping rows & rows of hundreds of tombstones of the Brave Fallen in World War II & other Battles of the British Indian Army. A Long, Low Sombre Wall boldly records the Names of soldiers of the British Indian Army who fell in World War I. Christians, Muslims & Others are all honoured here. A Visit to this War Cemetry is immensely Uplifting - for the Mind & the Soul & the Heart. This Vastly Silent, Timeless, Exquisite Honour of the Brave Dead is a Powerful Reminder that we stand & live today because the sea of men before us chose to die in the prime of their youth. God Bless."
Madras_War_Cemetery,Ravi D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Symmetry in a Cemetery,"Possibly the best maintained cemetery in Indi. The neat symmetrical rows, evenly spaced out with white headstones set on a green lawn reminds me of the similarity to the Arlington Cemetery, where US heroes are laid to rest. The uniformity and orderliness perhaps reflects the discipline of the older generations as represented by those world war veterans laid to rest here. generations "

Madras_War_Cemetery,Thangam M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,""" Love's last gift, remembrance""...","The Madras War Cemetery is a little known and even less visited attraction at Chennai (Madras) - which is indeed a great pity, since it is lovingly cared for and meticulously maintained.This war cemetery resembles a huge acreage of lawn but for the stark contrast between the verdant land and the orderly rows of gravestones that indelibly mark it. Walking through here one actually feels the emotions expressed in words poignant yet all too incomplete, by families that lost their loved ones to the great wars.Here the gravestones speak if one has ears to listen. Gravestones that speak of lives lost too young, of families torn asunder, of young widows and young ones who lost a parent, of the nobility of defending comrades and country, of supreme sacrifice to protect the highest human values.The Madras War Cemetery is located on Mount Poonamallee High Road, at Nandambakkam, about 6 kms from Chennai airport and just about a kilometre from St. Thomas Mount. It can be reached easily by road and by suburban rail - the closest railway station is St. Thomas Mount.Visiting hours at the cemetery are 8am through 6pm all days of the week.Established in 1952 in homage to the men and women who made the supreme sacrifice in World War II, this cemetery is maintained jointly by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) and the Government of India.The CWGC which was set up almost a century ago in 1917, has the noble mission of ensuring that the over 1.7 million who were killed in the two world wars are not forgotten - they do this by taking care of cemeteries housing the war dead in 154 countries!Apart from 856 casualties of World War II, this cemetery also lists and commemorates 1039 servicemen who died in various parts of India during World War I (1914-1918). The 1914-1918 memorial is located at the rear of the cemetery.After entering the cemetery through a cupola that marks the entrance, one's eyes are instantly drawn to the Stone of Remembrance that bears the immortal words from the Book of Ecclesiasticus: ""Their name liveth forevermore.""Behind and to both sides of the Stone of Remembrance are six plots of gravestones in rows set in neatly trimmed grass with flowering plants or green shrubs gracing the foot of each grave stone.Each granite or marble gravestone bears the insignia of the corps to which the service man or woman belonged, service rank followed by his/her name, the name of the corps/force served, the date of passing and his/her age when death on the battlefield abruptly cut short a brave life and left only tearful memories of a martyr gone much too soon. This is followed by the epitaph and in a few cases the the relationship of those dedicating it to the fallen soldier.Beyond this section is the Cross Of Sacrifice - a crucifix set on an octagonal base with a huge bronze sword on its shaft glinting in the harsh sunlight. Behind the Cross of Sacrifice are three more plots of gravestones. Bringing up the rear of the war cemetery is the Madras 1914-1918 memorial to those who lost their lives in World War I.Madras has a hot and humid climate - so a suggestion to all who would like to visit the Madras War Cemetery and spend some blessed time here is to carry enough drinking water and an umbrella to protect yourself from the merciless sun. Even better, make sure to start your visit by 8am itself which is when the war cemetery is possibly at its best - the grass freshly watered, the earth still damp and the flowers happily turn up their faces to greet the new born sun.Here is a selection of epitaphs that grace the gravestones at this war cemetery - beautifully worded, yet so inadequate to the task of narrating the stories of so many lives cut short too soon. Too far thy grave to see, but not too far to think of theeAmidst life's changes we love him yet, he is ours to remember when others forgetOne to the world, but all the world to usSo loved, so mourned, so missed time heals all wounds but time can be so longSweet memories will linger in our hearts forever Good night darling, not good byeTo the world he was just a part to me he was all the worldSay not good night, but in some brighter clime bid me good morningIn India alone, but in our hearts at homeA day to remember, sad to recallwithout farewell he left us allRemembrance is the only paradise from which we cannot be drivenA cheery smile, a heart of goldone of the best the world could holdWithout farewell he fell asleepleaving only a memory for us to keepThey shall not grow old, as we that are left grow oldGod will link the broken chain as one by one we meet againHis life a beautiful memory, his absence a silent griefSleep on dear son, as days go by no flowers can I place on the grave where you lieThree little words Forget-me-not, they don't seem much but they mean a lotGod's garden is most beautiful, he only picks the bestLove's last gift, remembranceThe futility of war is the one thought that lingers on as one leaves this final resting place for so many young lives."

Madras_War_Cemetery,Travelsoftanveer,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Foreign Buried Soldiers - RIP,"Most chennaites wont even know where this cemetery is! Located on the main thoroughfare, opposite the Chennai Trade Centre - this  place was once green and clean. I was sad to see lots of college boys inside almost ruining the green fabric when i saw last.Buried here are soldiers who fought in the World war"
Madras_War_Cemetery,kevinjohn1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Solo,Magnificent!!!,"This is one of the more beautiful attractions in Chennai, a place that is not frequented by the crowd nor is a place which most Chennai know about. Located on the outskirts of the Chennai city but very well maintained. *Must visit*"
Madras_War_Cemetery,Cebin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,Beautiful..,"Usually we won't say that cemetery is beautiful. But it is not applicable to this place. It's very beautiful and well maintained. I have seen this type of places only in Holly wood films. I was surprised to see a similar place in Chennai. Many people doesn't know about this place. I followed Google Maps. Its very neat and calm.     This place is built as tribute for the soldiers who died on the war. What I felt is none of the visitors are having any respect to this place. Every one just want to click some profile pic and cover pics. They will sit, stand, lie down in front of the burials for a pic. Walking through the lawns is not good as it will affect the beauty. Please don't litter. Pay respect to the place."

Madras_War_Cemetery,SureshWilliams,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Solo,Memorial for brave lives lost!,"I stopped by at the Cemetery on my way back from the Chennai Trade Center. I would have passed it by, if I had not been looking out for it. Built and maintained by the British War Graves Commission, it is a memorial of young lives lost during World War II. Row upon row of headstones tell stories of young British lads who fell on foreign soil. Almost all of them were between 20 and 30 years of age.It will be an emotional pilgrimage for those with a family connection; for others like me,  it is a grim reminder of the price that others may have paid for our peace."

Madras_War_Cemetery,sophizz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Friends,a place that tells silent tales,"My mom worked in the Govt Hospital close to this place and we lived in the doctors apartment close by. This is a calm place which tell me silent stories when I go sit there and watch those stones. There early in the morning I see people sitting and reading peacefully, some doing yoga, and few others walking.It is actually a restricted area. Tress passers are not allowed. One needs to get permission to step inside."

Madras_War_Cemetery,warmemorialjunkie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012,A Soldiers Daughter Never Cries,"Not every tourists cup of tea...this is the final resting place of  Britsish,Canadian,Australian,Nigerian..Officers and rank & file who've lost their lives in WWII....also is a memorial to some of those who died in WWI..                                   A quick walk around the place shows, the headstones are set up date wise and as many as a dozen or more soldiers have died on the same dates in various combat situations.                 The headstones are remarkable with the amount of detail on them esp. with regards to the elaborate engraving of the emblem of the respective Corps of the fallen Officer/Soldier...Coldstream Guards,The Kings Regt.,R.E.M.E., Royal Airforce,Royal Signals,Dragoons/Armoured Corps.,Royal Artillery,Rifle Corps.,Wiltshire Regt.,York & Lancaster Regt.,Worcestershire Regt., East Yorkshire Regt.,The Gordon Highlanders,Royal Scots,Medical Corps. ...                         Soldiers as young as 19 have headstones here.. Details on the headstones are very revealing..give the age,name,rank,corps,hometown[sometimes],qualifications[of the military surgeons] and the names of the family members who've buried them...along with gut wrenching messages from bereaved finacees/wives/parents/siblings and daughters.                      Some tombs have inscriptions by the bereaved family in Welsh...and one 19 yr old soldiers headstone says ""A foreign grave is a painful thing to a mother's aching heart.""                  A glimpse into the past..of people born more than a 100 years ago in Victorian and Edwardian England and lost their lives in a India.                 A must see for people who're World war junkies/historians...probably a bore for ignoramuses."
