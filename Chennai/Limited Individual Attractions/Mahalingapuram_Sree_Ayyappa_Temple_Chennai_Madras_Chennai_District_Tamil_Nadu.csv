Mahalingapuram_Sree_Ayyappa_Temple,Valavanur Natar... K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,"A REVIEW OF MY NEIGHBOURHOOD AYYAPAN TEMPLE IN MAHALINGAPURAM , CHENNAI","I present this review with devotion &  pride about my  neighbourhood  Mahalingapuram  Ayyappan temple .This  is a land mark temple for Lord Ayyappa although,  there are now temples dedicated to him in Anna Nagar ,R A puram and Nanganallur in chennai .In the late  60's and early 70's , there were no temple in  Chennai Metropolis  dedicated exclusively to Lord Ayyappa. Over generations  devotees to be estimated anywhere between 20 to 50 million each year , specially keralites , settled all over India and abroad  undertake an annual pilgrimage  to the Main Ayyapa  temple   in Sabarimala ,  situated on a hilltop amidst eighteen hills at an altitude of 480 m above sea level, surrounded by mountains and dense forests called Periyar Tiger hills reserve,  in pathanthitta district of KeralaState , South of India.The famous festival is Makara Villakku festival .This main temple is dedicated to the hindu celibate  diety, Lord  Ayyappan also known as Dharma Sastha.According to hindu mythology he isthe son of Lord Shiva and Mohini ,the feminine incarnation of Lord VishnuIts a rare temple due to the fact  that the traditions of this Sabarimala temple  is a confluence of Shaivism, Shakthism& Vaishnavism with other Sramana traditions .People before undertaking this pilgrimage, normally go through a period of strict penance and prayers meetings for 41 days abd  start the pulgrimage with an Irumudi or offering to the lord carried on their head  wearing  black clothes .During this period of prayers they maintain strict  abstinance from non veg food & alcohol.Devotees undertaking this pilgrimage  to Sabarimala Mandalam- Makaravilakku  seasons in Chennai  had to fend for themselves in the absence of any institutionalized service in chennai in those days of 60's & 70's .These Ayyappan Vilakku rituals,  associated with this pilgrimage  used to be conducted in several areas of the city as an annual feature and homes of devotees themselves  and in our neighbourhood it used to be conducted in the premises of a small  temple on Melpadi Muthu Naicken Street or in the precincts of Asalathamman Koil,  on North Mada Street in NungambakkamOf which Mahalingapuram forms a part.In 1967 a few  organizers, realising the need to have an institution to overcome the problems encountered by the devotees undertaking pilgrimage to this  Holy Hills, decided  to provide minimum facilities to them. Notable among them  being  Sarvasri P.B.Nair, R.S.Kaimal, K.V.Thankappan Nair, K.Bhaskaran, C.P.G.Nambiar, T.M.G.Kurup, V.S.Mani Iyer.Formation of a trust by them led to the realisation of the Mahalingapuram Bhaktha Samajam & the famous Ayyappan Temple built  in traditional kerala style architecture , as you see today standing tall.Now the temple also has sannadhis for Guruvayur krishnan ,Ganapathy, shiva & Parvathi , Murugan with his consorts Valli & Devasenai and Lordess Saraswathi.This temple is known for its very good upkeep & maintenance following strictly the rituals to specified in our Vedas and scriptures & while maintaining  perfect Timings forcall poojas and visting hours .  Annual poojas notable among them being the Vallakku pooja every year around Karthigai month Iis noteworthy .Traditionally this begins in the late evening , from the Shiva temple nearby on the main Road with  ladies standing in two rows carrying a lamp & begin a procession in front of Lord Ayyappa riding a chariot accompanied  by famous and loud Ketala Chanda music And fire works and it ends at the Ayyppa temple .I strongly reccommend visitors to Chennai to look up this  temple during their next visit to Chennai ."

Mahalingapuram_Sree_Ayyappa_Temple,Ravi D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Miniature Kerala,"The Mahalingapuram Sree Ayyappa Temple is run by a trust and I have been fortunate to have been associated with this temple from inception  in the late seventies. Lord Ayyappa, according to folk lore, was brought up by a Royal couple, who found him on the banks of a river - a gift from heavenly abodes, in answer to the childless couple's  prayers to God. The story line then follows a typical palace intrigue, when after the birth of a baby boy a few years later, jealousy, treachery of a Minister throws in ingredients of an action thriller; suspense and action. The plot ends in miraculous  anticlimax when Sree Ayyappa forays in to the forest to fetch milk of a tigress, the only supposed cure for his mother's feigned illness - a ploy meant to eliminate him. The mythological tale then transforms in to a spiritual one when after many trials and challenges in the forests, new friendships and alliances formed, he returns riding atop a tigress. Pictures depicting Lord Ayyappa in this form are traditionally not displayed to mounted inside homes, except those of bachelors observing strict abstinence. The spiritual aspects commence with his revelation of true identity-for no human can ride a tiger. Forgiving all those who plotted against him  he returns to heavenly abode. The spot of his ascension is marked by a temple, the plan of which is attributed to the divine architect Lord Parsurama. The original hill top temple Is located in Kerala State. Every year, from mid-November to first week of January, is the period when devotees after observing a strict 41-days abstinence, undertake a pilgrimage to Sabarimala or the mountain of Lord Sabari.The temple in Mahalingapuram is not a replica- that is forbidden. The architecture is typically of Kerala and the sanctum follows all the tenets of temple architecture and divine rules. It is kept exceptionally clean and follows strict timings - opening, closing and observing all the poojas in correct manner at correct timings. Later a Sree Guruvayurappan Temple for Lord Krishna was added alongside and over the years new buildings, constructions and renovations have taken place. Sree Ayyappan Temple also has smaller abodes for Lord Ganesha - the elephant headed  God, Goddess Mallikapura, and Lord Muruga (Karthik, son of Lord Shiva and Godess Parvathy, as known to North India)"

Mahalingapuram_Sree_Ayyappa_Temple,DeeptiIngle,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,Serene and Peaceful,"The Ayyappa temple is really fascinating. It is located in a peaceful residential locality. The temple is not as big as the Kapaleshwar temple, but pretty huge for normal temples. Parking is generally not an issue. I travelled on a Sunday morning, around 1030 am and was easily able to find parking in one of the nearby by lanes. There are two approach roads: one is tiny single lane road (Not advisable at all ) and other one is through the residential colony. Right opposite the temple is a lady who takes care of your footwear at a meagre cost of Rs. 5. You feel at peace, the moment you enter the temple. It is a beautiful sight to the eyes as well. The contrast of black stone and golden temple top is very pleasing and adds a different dimension altogether. Like many Kerela temples, there is a vessel filled with red and black beads, for the kids to play with (It’s a good omen). The temple is clean like most Ayyappan temples. I would surely recommend atleast one visit to this temple if you are even slightly religious."
