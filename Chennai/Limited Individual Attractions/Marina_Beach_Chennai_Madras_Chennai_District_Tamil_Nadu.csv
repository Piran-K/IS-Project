Marina_Beach,TSinParis,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Dirty and you can’t swim,This beach is filthy and you can’t swim.  Not that you would want to.  I don’t believe the water is clean.  Such a shame as it is adjacent to the city.   Skip this if you have ever been to a real beach.
Marina_Beach,Wandering Tales Travel Dreams,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,A nice place to experience Chennai beaches,"Surprisingly, it is one of the cleaner beaches in Chennai.  There is a lot of patrolling that happens by police on horses and by foot... mainly to discourage swimming as the waters are not very safe.  A nice beach to get your fill of the sea side and walking in the  sand if you normally live in a place nowhere close to beaches.  Sunset time is the best time to visit."
Marina_Beach,Mudit Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Visit,"Marina Beach is a primarily sandy beach, with an average width of 300 m (980 ft) and the width at the widest stretch is 437 m (1,434 ft). Bathing and swimming at the Marina are legally prohibited because of the dangers, as the undercurrent is very turbulent. It is one of the most crowded beaches in the country.The beach promenade in 1913Before the 16th century, there were frequent incident of inundation of land near the coast due to rise in sea level. When the sea withdrew, several ridges and lagoons were left behind. On the southern side of Fort St. George, one such sand ridge ran from the mouth of the Cooum River to the present site of the Presidency College. On the rear side of the ridge was a huge depression on which the college grounds were later developed. The ridge is the site of the present-day beach. When Fort St. George was built in 1640, the sea was too close to the fort. The building of the harbor near the fort resulted in sand accretion to the south of the fort and the harbor and the sea, which was washing the ramparts of the fort, moved afar at about 2.5 km away from the fort creating a wide beach between the land and the sea.Before the Madras harbor was built, the beach was just a strip of mud, teeming with mudskippers. The beach washed up close to the present day road for a long time until the harbor was built in 1881.Ever since the harbor was built, the area south of the port has accreted significantly, forming the present day's beach mainly due to the presence of wave breakers laid for the construction of the harbor, although the coast in the northern region has undergone severe erosion. Eventually, the north-drifting current widened the beach to its present extent. The beach was formed as a result of arresting the littoral drift by the port's breakwater. The area of the beach is increasing 40 sq m every year. "
Marina_Beach,Raguram R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,"Great landmark, Spoiled by Administrative Apathy.","Great Landmark beach, Could have been maintained better.  we went to the beach on a working day at 4:00 PM, Just to enjoy time at the beach. Let me outline my experience,a) Beach sand had a lot of garbage mixed, including broken bottles, plastic caps, plastic overb) There was a lot of garbage thrown back by the sea on the beach, nothing was cleared. There was barely any place right by the beach where you could sit down and enjoy. Too much of rotten stuff. I was surprised to see a mattress also thrown back by the seac) there was a mechanized sand combing machine that is supposed to collect garbage from the beach sand. It was just wasting time and money. It was doing nothing. d) We saw a couple pull out the diaper of their child and dump it on the beach. There is no toilet or any infrastructure where children can be taken care of.We just squatted there for some time and decided to bail out. Highly dissatisfied."
Marina_Beach,Andrew D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Don't visit during the daytime,"Maybe I made a mistake of visiting it during daytime, because there is nothing at all here. The beach itself is average with nothing to write home about, while the avenue with the statues are undergoing public transport renovation so you can't really see the statues right now. On top of that, the sun is too glaring with nothing else to do and see. Skip, or maybe try during evening?"
Marina_Beach,Shakir,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Black Beach,This beach is definitely LONG. But that's it. It isn't pretty like the beautiful blue beaches we see around the world.

Marina_Beach,Siddhartha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Longest beach,"The second longest beach in the world which is Marina Beach. This is the main tourist attraction. Huge tourist visit here regularly. A large no of food stalls offers you variety of food. Mouthwatering juice, pokora, fish fry, corn or fruit chat can't ignorable. You can come here during sunrise or sunset. Horse ride is another attraction. The beach police is continuously patrolling. This Beach should be clean regularly. One drawback is there don't have any sitting arrangement seperaly in the beach. you have to get back 400 meter to sit.  A must visit place."
Marina_Beach,gaurav4321,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Beach with Samadhi’s of leaders….,This is large beach with very big sand filled area. Need to walk for 5 minutes to reach beach part.  This place has 2 structures for homage to MGR and Jayalalithaji. Cleaner area now. Having food-stall and rides installed on beach. Can plan this trip if at Chennai.
Marina_Beach,Anmol Katiyar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Friends,Nor worth the hype.,"Beach is highly commercialized. Your nose will be oversaturated with the smell of fish. However, if you will ride along the beach side road early morning then it will be a good experience."

Marina_Beach,SashSo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Just for a stroll,Not a great beach. The shores are still in need of more cleaning. Definitely will not swim but we dipped our feet. Cleanliness will only be obtained if there is some fine applied for the guests throwing rubbish everywhere

Marina_Beach,Vinay,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Unfriendly Police & Local Public,A very crowded and a deep beach. Its full of either couples sitting on the parapet walls or stags ogling at the teen or single girls. The police and local public are not at all helpful towards people of other states studying or staying in Chennai. The food stalls are permitted on the beach generating wet and dry waste littered on the beach. If not for the above it is a huge and beautiful beach.
Marina_Beach,OMO,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Solo,Best at night,This place comes alive at night! Lots of food stalls line the promenade. Locals and tourists enjoying the cool breeze off the sea. The light house is at the very southern end. There is also a Chennai Beach photo spot.

Marina_Beach,niluanu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Long Sandy Beach,Marina Beach is India's longest beach and one of Chennai's prime tourist attractions.  It is a huge expanse of sand and you need to walk quite a bit to reach the sea. The sand can get quite hot during the day. The place can get quite crowded during evenings when many of the food stalls also open. The place is easily accessible by public transport. Parking is also available. Do carry water if you visit during daytime
Marina_Beach,Eileen108,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Hardly Anyone There till After Dark,"I went at 10:30am and was surprised to see the beach was empty. Even at 5:30pm, the snack sellers were just starting to come and getting out vegetables to cook. Policemen on horses were telling people not to go in the water as the waves were too high."
Marina_Beach,Ria1104,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Had a Really Bad Experience,"I visited the beach on our long layover in Chennai. Mostly this beach is visited by locals and so the vendors can easily distinguish between a local and an outsider and hence the price difference and everything clearly comes into picture.The beach itself is really huge with a huge expanse of sand....you could literally get exhausted from walking all the way from the road to the sea. We made a mistake here instead of going through the designated route of the shops, God knows why we chose a way which appeared a bit quieter. It was in the middle of the day and hence safety was not much of a concern for us (that is what we thought) . But soon we realized why this way was secluded and the other one was so crowded. The entire way till the sea (the secluded one) was full of poop (both of human and animals) and was super smelly. I have never seen such a smelly beach in my life. Now people might counter me saying the smell might be from the local vendors selling fish....but being a Bengali I clearly can differentiate the smell of fish and poop.And to make things worse two transgenders caught my boyfriend for money and when he denied started abusing. When we gave them Rs 10 just to shut their mouth they demanded Rs 50 and threatened to throw sand at us if we did not pay. At this I  got paranoid for a while....luckily my boyfriend grabbed my hand and got mingled in the midst of a local group who were relaxing in the beach.Not only that even fish shops overcharged us for the fish we bought for snacks. Now I might not be a local but most Bengalis can clearly distinguish which fish is what. So when he promised me pomfret and offered some other fish I understood in my first bite that I am getting conned. So my first experience in this beach was not at all good. I feel that you would enjoy this place more if you knew about the nooks and corners of this place....you should know what to try and what to avoid....what kind of cons are existing and all. If you can crack all this then you might enjoy here. Also try to go through the crowded ways which go through the shops till you reach the waters to avoid toxic smell as well as toxic people."
Marina_Beach,Mano,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Long Beach with Pleasant view,"We went for a long walk on this beach. It offered an amazing view of the sunset and beach waves :). It was peaceful and relaxing to the mind.As we've been there during COVID items, we were able to witness the marina beach without the crowd.I appreciate that people were not throwing away the waste into the ocean or on the sand. I should say this the marina cleaning team are doing a great job and trying to keep the beach clean. "

You can watch the Sunrise and Sunset. STUNNING!4. You can count stars in the night (Go before 11pm, after which you're not allowed to be there for ""safety"" reasons).5. Shoot a balloon, ride a merry-go-round (You feel too mature? Do it. Will make you feel like a little kid again)6. Ride a horse. Yeah, you can actually do that.7. Buy fish. Towards the right of the Tower."

Marina_Beach,Swati S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Family,Beautiful Sandy Beach,"It is  the longest natural urban beach in the country.The Marina is primarily sandy. History of the beach dates back to  late 1870, when the governor of Madras  Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, who was captivated by the beach on an earlier visit , conceived and built the promenade along the beach in 1884 by extensively modifying and layering it with soft sand. He also gave it the name Madras Marina in the same year. Since the early 19th century, a number of public buildings were constructed fronting the beach.Since ,we were pressed for time, we visited the beach in the late afternoon...the sand of course was burning but the moment waves washed our feet, we felt refreshed ...It is definitely a place to visit."

Plenty of Indians were walking about and I’m sure in the evening it is may be busy. We asked about Indians swimming and not many can so they avoid the use of it.

The entire area has a good parking facility(of course a bit hard to get place sometimes) with a lot of food stalls that once can enjoy while walking along the shore. This is a place one MUST visit if you are a tourist to Chennai. Coming to the waters, the shore is little inclined so have to be careful. Police patrolling(on horses) happens throughout(they watch us) the day which was the things I liked the most. They care and ensure every visitor goes back safe & sound. Good place!!"
Marina_Beach,Deadman17,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Good vibes, crowded",the beach is one of the longest in the world and offers great views of sunrise and the calm sea.  there are various monuments of historical importance opposite the Marina Beach.

Marina_Beach,Jolly Traveller,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Marina Beach - I tried to love it,"Marina Beach is a Chennai must see destination but after visiting the north end of the beach I felt deflated.I didn't get to the lighthouse which I do think would be worth visiting so maybe start therr.I started my wanders st Madras University grounds (stunning architecture), then took the pedestrian underpass to the north end of the beach. I strolled through the monument grounds (worth a look but it would be best with a guide), up to the bridge (with its unique stink of backwater and sewerage) and cut through the quiet memorial park to the beach. From there a walk across the grass flats to the sand.As with Elliot's Beach, there is plenty to see but the plentiful garbage and for me the poor condition of some horses (possibly retired beach ponies) up the back made it a joyless visit. Have a look at my pics.I tried to love this beach for it's uniqueness but couldn't. My review doesn't include the south part of Marina Beach near the Gandhi statue - maybe there is more joy to be found there."

Marina_Beach,Anubhab Arko Dey,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,"Good Place, But Needs Cleanup","the beach the main attraction of Chennai, indeed yes to some,I have certain different opinion regarding this,  authorities work on few points then its it could be.the cleanliness of this beach is Above average,The southern part ia comparatively cleaner everything than to the northern parts,so does the areas near the Promenade, The street vendors sells goods which are cheap and offer a wide choice. The sea is not so rough here, overall a good place to hangout with family and spend some time "
Marina_Beach,AURELIO L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,not so bad,if you have so many time you can go to see the beaches but remember they are not so so nice and the most of them are so crowded
Marina_Beach,Madan Gopal M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Great escape.,"I never missed this iconic beach whenever I visited Chennai. Though overcrowded in the evenings, the energy,vibrant atmosphere,beach market is not to be missed. My favourite is quite sunrise and sip hot cup of coffee."
Marina_Beach,Mikan999,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Fish market and fishing boats area is most interesting,"We preferred the southern end of the beach, past the lighthouse and along Foreshore Estate Promenade. This is where fishermen bring their boats onto the beach and their wives line the edge of the beach preparing and selling the catch from small stalls shielded from the sun by parasols. More kinds of  fish than we could identify. Everyone seems friendly and happy to allow photos and engage in hand-sign talk with non Tamil speakers like us. This is a working beach - covered in brightly coloured fishing boats, nets, fishing gear and assorted fishing related debris. We went late morning, we are told early morning is the really busy time. If you are visiting St Tome Cathedral then it’s a short walk to this area."
Marina_Beach,Dwightcr,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Chennai beach with mostly fisherman,"This beach isn't really for swimming.  It's a fisherman's beach for fresh catch.  A bit dirty, but does offer some sea views."
Marina_Beach,nozzlering,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Much cleaner now,"I was surprised to find it much cleaner, with decent public amenities. Must visit.Government has put in all efforts to maintain cleanliness. Although you could see some tourists littering the place."

Marina_Beach,Gaby,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Marina Beach 🏖,"A really wide beach with plenty of space for a good family time. Evening time, dotted with a number of vendors selling sea food, pakoras and snacks. The beach is not a swimming beach."
Marina_Beach,Jaykann,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Worth a walk,Second largest beach in the world. Beach is huge stretch and really worth a walk. Great place for morning walkers.It's too crowded in the evening and I would advise avoid evenings specially weekends. Lots of shops around the beach which makes it hard to maintain it. Somewhat clean but need more attention. Not advisable for swimming.
Marina_Beach,scs-953,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Interesting place to go for morning walk. ,"If you are keen to go for a morning walk in Chennai , then marina beach is the best place. The beach has so many interesting things to offer in the morning. You will find serious muting walkers walking on the beach , children playing , youngsters doing their exercises, and pop up vans selling special fruit juices. The sun rise is a wonderful sight. If you are lucky , you watch a fishing boat returning after a trip. Worth the effort "
Marina_Beach,Traveller G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Bit dirty but a good walk,"Marina Beach in the Bay of Bengal. Longest beach in India, was a lot of building work going on when we were there. Sadly it’s pretty dirty with rubbish everywhere but still a fascinating sight to see and nice long walk. Be aware you’ll get hassled constantly by people trying to sell you horse rides, plastic jewellery etc..."
Marina_Beach,Mrudula,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Urban Beach,"This is a very big beach in area and the second largest beach. it has all the varities to enjoy like horse ride, Fishes to eat, man made beads for ladies so many"
Marina_Beach,Ashwini1234,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Nice evening spot,Its a vast beach . There is a light house which closes by 5 so we could not make it. but good place for a nice evening walk along the beach with friends /family.
Marina_Beach,arnold ahmed,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Boring,If you are local you might like it. Beach is quite dirty and very few activities available. On the positive side its long and big. No cycling available. 
Marina_Beach,Isabella,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Review of Marina Beach,It was a beautiful beach.It is a nice place to come and relax.But the only thing i think is unfair is how long u have to walk to get to the shore.overall i would recommend it to all those summer people out there.
Marina_Beach,devan2599,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,An evening at the marina beach,Lot more can be done to this natural treasure. Its advisable not to go swimming in the beach. If you are from overseas its advisable to take with you titbits and water.
Marina_Beach,1777NT,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"This beach seems to go on for miles, even excersise your horse on it","As the Bay of Bengal appears to have little tidal change, this beach is very wide, with little or no change due to high or low tide.  It goes on for ever, nice clean sand and it appears to be kept clean by machinery.  Lots of fish stalls at the Fort End and at the Lighthouse End, with plenty of working fishing boats moored around the Lighthouse end of the beach. Unfortunately, the usual Indian problem of plastic litter around these stalls/boats. No point the rest of the world trying to ban plastics...….."
Marina_Beach,laxman_iyer,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Beach,Too crowded..dirty.. not well maintained..garbage all over...does not have the beach vibe..waste of time and effort 
Marina_Beach,Milind Kshirsagar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Ordinary beach,Just another beach. Nothing great. Very far from main road. Rough sea waves. Go to Mahabalipuram instead.
Marina_Beach,George G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,A somewhat dirty beach but it does come alive at night. ,"A long, unexciting beach. It is dirty in many places and not a place to swim due to rip-tides and dirt. The rubbish is more near the areas used by the fishermen where the dogs run free. At night don't stray from the well lit areas near the stalls which come alive but as rows of predictable offerings with little originality. Old fashioned fair ground rides are quaint but not the same ones time and again. "
Marina_Beach,QWERTY098,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Long long beach,Sand is grainy. Long stretch before one reaches the sea. Food joints and others add to the experience but thr vastness is brilliant.PDA is common here and largely unavoidable if one goes in late evenings.
