A good safe place, calm and away from the mad crowd, when compared to  other places of worship."

We visited on a sunday but it was not too crowded maybe because it is not in the city centre and not during a festival. Nevertheless we had a peaceful and good darshan. Beautiful ancient structure and sivalingam, rich in history as many have offered prayers here before. You can feel a certain calming presence once entering the temple. A must visit temple for all devotees. "

Marundeeswarar_Temple,Swami1939,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015,THE DIVINE EXPERIENCE,The Marundeeswarar Temple in Tiruvanmiyur is one of the ancient Siva temples in Chennai City. The Main Daitee - MARUNDEESWARAR is considered to be the God of healing. The Divine atmosphere is well suited for a worry free meditation. The GOSALA ( Place where cows are maintained) is worth mentioning. The THIRUPURA SUNDARI AMMAN in side the main temple is very famous which attract large number of devotees every day. The Temple has a gate open on the East Coast Road for easy entry of those commuting of this busy road.
Marundeeswarar_Temple,Chuck012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,The oldest temple in chennai,"This temple was built in the 7th century still is a place where the Shaivaites get together in large number and make the place reverberatingly energetic across seasons.

Marundeeswarar_Temple,Myo M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,Two front gates! :),"What sets this temple apart from all other Hindu temples in the city is its two successive (as in a ""column"" going into the temple grounds if you view from outside) front gates, whereas there's only one front gate at all the other temples I got to.  And I don't know if the reason for the two front gates is because of the two tomb (shrine) buildings on the temple grounds inside, maybe there are two deities of ""equal significance"" here (with a tomb building for each of the two) and therefore two front gates (one for each of the two), but as a non-Hindu that's only my ""thought"" as to the reason for the two front gates.  The passageway between the two gates is also fairly wide (not a narrow passageway) with paintings on the ceiling and carvings on the pillars, so I figured it was the Marriage Hall since all big Hindu temples seem to have got one of those (I'm quite sure a Marriage Hall is an essential part of a Hindu temple).  Also, on the right side of the back area of the temple grounds is a tree with a little fence around it, and I saw some people circling around it likely for some religious reason.There's no admission fee here, but similar to Kapaleeswarar (Chennai's most famous temple) further north, there's a ""photo fee"" here as well; I paid 50 rupees for it.By public transportation, the nearest bus depot is Thiruvanmiyur (1A & A1 buses get there that I know of, but I'm sure there are many others too since it's a fairly big station), and it's a short walk south from there to the Temple."

Marundeeswarar_Temple,RamGanesan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Couples,An age old temple,"If I were to suggest two Shiva temples in the southern side of Chennai it would be Kabali temple at Mylapore and this temple.  This place has been work shipped by several saints and the presiding deity is know for showering blessing for those suffering from disease and hence the name.  Over the years the maintenance of the temple has seen great improvement. Being a local of that area, I have always been fascinated by the last pooja (Arthajama Pooja) at the temple.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a peaceful darshan."

Marundeeswarar_Temple,Sivaram S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,Very beautiful and calm,"This temple is just at the beginning of the east coast road, the entertainment hub of Chennai. The entrance from the ECR road may looks simple, however the other entrance is so beautiful and pious. However busy the external surroundings, immediately after entering the temple, you will feel the calmness in your heart and the blessings of Lord Shiva. Within the city reach, less of modernization, pious atmosphere would definitely brings you peace and calm one needs in life. Visit there and get good health with Lord Shiva's blessings."
