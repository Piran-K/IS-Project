Matsya_Narayana_Temple,Vijay S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Excellent location of the temple.,"Located right by the beach, this temple gives us the relaxing feelings with sound of sea waves. There is also a kids temple in the same premise which can be enjoyed by children. There are places to sit and meditate if one wishes to. It is better to go early before the scorching sun is out. Importantly photography is prohibited inside. The beach is right behind and is fairly less crowded. 2 streets away there is also a very good Puri Jagannath temple which has a beautiful architecture."

Matsya_Narayana_Temple,Venkataraman R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021,"Unique temple with pillars. Visit the temple, before visiting the beach, as asked by temple authorities","Very different temple with pillars. Pillars are having lots of good sayings, which is a very positive message to devotees. Open temple makes us to feel with nature with sea shore by the side. Lord Narayana is huge and blesses devotees. The temple authorities are asking not to visit temple after visiting nearby beach. So, it is better to visit temple first and then the beach."

Matsya_Narayana_Temple,RamGanesan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,A peaceful Meditation Center right on the Beach,"This peaceful temple dedicated to Matsya Narayana is on the East Cost Road near a place called Uthandi.  It is a relatively newly constructed temple right on the beach.  The temple has been constructed by Donors and supported by Chinmaya Mission.  The structure of the temple itself has been carefully designed in a oval shape and a raised circular structure.  The large life size idol of Lord Narayana in the form of a Matsya (fish) is in the middle of the elevated circular platform.  People who know the avatars described in Hindu tradition will understand the significance of the Matsya Avatar, the avatar that saved the world from floods.  The area around the idol is meant for meditation and visitors are asked to remain silent in that designated spot.  The entire temple sits on the shores of the sea and a gusty wind always breezes past us.  It is therefore a serene atmosphere for meditation and prayer.  The unique aspect of this place is that it is open air with a lot of beautiful pillar structures with inscriptions about several things that the temple stands for.  When the lights come out in the evening after dark it is a real treat to watch the place.  The lighting has also been carefully chosen to maintain a calm and serene atmosphere.  The floor around the temple has also been carefully laid with small marble stones that create an accu pressure on the foot.  This helps in blood circulation when one comes around the temple.  The lawn and the garden with a lot of flowers add beauty to the whole place.  There are also three other shrines inside the complex, Siva, Hanuman, Ganapthy and of course Narayana and his concert.   The book shop sells religious books.  Separate toilet and shoe keep area are maintained well.   Vehicle parking is not a problem right now as not many people are aware of this place.  I hope by this review people will get to know the place.  Do refer my photos to see the beautiful temple.  This is a Must see place if you are in the southern parts of Chennai"
