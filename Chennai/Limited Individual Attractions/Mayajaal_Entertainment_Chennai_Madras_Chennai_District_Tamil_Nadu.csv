Mayajaal_Entertainment,Vineeth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Multiplex for Entertainments,My visit to the Mayajaal was for FROZEN 2. The theatre gave such a wonderful experience. Seating and sound effects were perfect. Eatables are little but expensive. the ground floor is exclusively for gaming and kids. An awesome day I had with my friends.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Arogya Raj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Long lasting multiplex in Chennai,"Great theater experience and the ticket prices are also reasonable.Really worth watching a movie at this theater and worth buying Snacks & eatables which is moderate in prices.Mayajaal has a gaming center and a couple of food ventures, a sixteen screen multiplex, a sports complex and a resort and many more.One of the best place to visit with childrens if they love games.Parking charges is comparatively very low then other malls."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,mageshkumar712,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,nice place to visit,"a good place to visit your whole holidays...and a nice place to shop,dine,watch movies etc.Childrens will love the place very much"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Kavita Vinod,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Great Place for Movie Buffs!,"Shopping malls like Mayajaal are making waves in the lives of Chennai People.  It is a good place for stop-over en route to Pondicherry. It's a great place to be in on weekends as it has everything for a family and movie lovers. A parking facility is available.  It has a very beautiful interior done and has good paintings. It is a good place to take selfies with loved ones!Mayajaal is the only Mall having 16 movies Screen. A lot of fun games and electronic rides for small kids including bike, car, and roller ride. A lot of gaming options for kids to enjoy but prices are a little high. One can spend a lovely time watching movies, play games and eat good food.  It is one time to visit this place if you are not accustomed to shopping malls having gaming zones and food court. People staying in metros may not appreciate this on bigger scale. Since it is the only mall available in ECR so people hop on to this place very frequently on weekends."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Ahamed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,Good for kids,"I visit maayajaal with my family (including my 3 year old nephew). We went for a movie first and the theatre and the seat looks pretty good and comfortable. Once the movie is done, we came down to ground floor and it is filled with full of games and kind of electric bike ride for kids. They are charging rs 100 for 4 minutes of bike ride. Though it sounds bit high, it's worth as my nephew enjoyed the ride a lot. In addition to theatres and games, there we have a food court too to satisfy our hunger"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Amarchand.S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Theatre,Theatre facility is good and food also good. It was spacious in terms of parking and theatre. Overall theatre was good
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Hari K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Visiting,"Very calm and isolated mall. good parking facilities, gaming, food court and movie experience. still price is little bit not acceptable for gaming "
Mayajaal_Entertainment,niki dee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Only Mall in ECR,Lot of memories associated with this mall since was close to my college. From a tourists perspective a good place to stopover on the highway en route to Pondicherry. Offers to opt for a movie in the theatre. Lot of eat outs as well. Game zone is decent as well. 
Mayajaal_Entertainment,ramakrishnabanoth3,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Flagship theaters.,Good mall with only theaters  of 16 screens and play area for kids.Well designed interior for the look to capture pictures.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,ganapathyex,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Pattai Movie at Mayajaal,"We were group of nine people went for Rajani's pattai movie at Mayajaal multiplex. The screen, screen 7 was really big (compared to other screen in Mayajaal) and the audio quality was above average. The cost of food and beverages were expensive. The place also charge you an hefty amount on parking. Not to forget ECR toll that has to be paid en-route."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Abdul wahaab,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Good place for couples ,Good location to visit with loveable ones. Very long ride on the seashore to reach the place. Having lot of coffee shops and restaurants on the way ..
Mayajaal_Entertainment,akhyali4,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,Movie,"There is not much about Mayajaal, large screening theater in Chennai. The washrooms and seating qualities are not to the level what we are expecting. Average good to visit with girlfriend"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Swathy U,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Good Activities in a Clumsy Place,"I do not recommend this since this is a clumsy place. Poor Maintenance. Went for a movie and hanged out for rest of the day. Food Court is too bad. Not much choices. The activities like Scary World, Jungle Walk are good."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,sathish k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Good multiplex,Mayajaal is very good multiplex in the outskirts of Chennai. The food court and theatre is the main attraction for the couple's and family members. Lot of games are there for the childrens. It is a nice weekend spot for the whole family.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Pradeep Raja,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Movie,"Fares have increased too much.driving all the way with tolls , parking etc not at all worth and value for money. Maintenance improved recently but still lot of scope for improvement .If priced properly reasonably good place for outing with family ."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Prasad B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Nice place to hangout with !!!,The place is highly well maintained and provided all-around entertainment at the reasonable costs.It can add few more themes like Amoeba.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Abdul wahaab,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Gud place for movie ,It's a good place for movie with lovable ones as it is situated in ECR.. on can plan a whole day for this attraction .movie kids playing area mall then on the beach... If one needs to tickets for any movie it's a apt place as it has 16screens 
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Surya Katakam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Nice to enjoy at this with family,This is Cine multiplex with good restaurant and kids playing area. Very good scenery is available inside the Mayajaal. I have very much impressed with the building construction type specially with the doom of colorful atmosphere.Total 8 screens are there and mostly all South Indian language movies will showcase here with Hindi and English Movies.Restaurant also good here. Parking is available on chargeable basis
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Shankar_Kamath,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Average mall,It's good option if you want to get tickets for movies. As it has 16 screens it's easier to get it. And you have options for shopping and other gaming activities. Have a handful of eatery options too including Punjabi restaurant bhangra. Ample space is available for parking. Overall a decent outing site and traffic on the way will.be less as it is situated outside city.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,nishkalav,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Not worthwhile,"We went with family to watch a movie. Seats are narrow, making it very uncomfortable. We were allowed to enter the hall just few minutes after the previous show crowd came out. This clearly indicated that no cleaning would have been done. Above all 220 rupees is just not worth for driving all the way to ecr, might as well watch a movie within city."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,ilovefood,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,not the best but spoil you with too many options,"If you want to watch any new movie and the ticket is not available in city, this is the place to go as they have so many screens and so many shows"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,dinesh_j84,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Known for Multiplex Cinemas,This is once upon a time one of the biggest multiplexes in Chennai. It is located along the ECR and it is about 25 kms from the centre of the city. Movies of all languages are screened here. It has some eateries and some stores for shopping.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,YatriForever,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Only if you have no other choice !,"For us, driving up here is almost a punishment, given the notorious traffic habits  on ECR. The complex is do dull, boring and insipid that it doesn't leave with a good mood if you exit the place, particularly if the movie is bad. The outdated system of some sort of prepaid card for purchase of food is a big put off. Men's room is almost never well maintained. Parking is a challenge, and the cost of parking is a top off, in addition to the toll you pay. Yet, people throng this place as there are limited options for movie goers in Thiruvanmiyur and beyond on ECR."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Arun,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,Once a big cineplex,"It was once a best theatre in Chennai but now due to poor maintenance, the place has become old, dirty and unclean. They have to renovate and change the seats and toilets. They have become old and I would not suggest this theatre for anyone. You won’t like it after visiting Sathyam, PVR and other good theatres in malls."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,pradeep n,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Good place but too far from city,No need to worry about tickets if youchoose mayajal to b ur destination for ur movie.ewith upgraded sound system and screens now its turning better but only concern is to reach it bit outside of city
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Niche N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Best place to watch in ECR,Its best place for travel from city for a long ride. watching movies in mayajaal and have a walk along the shore. Its better for week end trip who are planning for short trip.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,SRIKAKOLAPU,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,Decent place with small theatres,This multiplex has pretty small theaters but they allow outside food and don't stop which is a nice thing.Huge parking is available and this place is quite old and the gaming zone is also empty most of the time
Mayajaal_Entertainment,339sangeethab,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,movie experience at Mayajal,"It's the exterior that is Ok. And that is where it ends.Parking fee Rs 90 for one hour or one day 😳.The place is dilapidated. The inside of the theatre has not been cleaned for some time. Seats are dirty. Left overs of last run show on the seats and bottle holders. I had to remind myself that I came to see the movie and not the theatre The Air conditioning in the waiting area isn't effective, though once inside it did work.Thankfully we were watching a good movie , so some of the stress went away:Be watchful of the choice you make. "
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Sunny Wilson W,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Ordinary ,A very ordinary place to watch a movie. It's so small. I prefer AGS and Luxe over mayajal. Visit only when you dont have seats left on Ags or Luxe.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Joji J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,"""nice multiplex and food court""","I have been to Mayajaal several times and though there are other new movie halls in the town, I like the ambiance of Mayajaal. Earlier it was very crowded but the crowd is less now and it's convenient to have a nice dinner from the food court and watch our favorite movie from the numerous halls. I like the drive to Mayajal and after the movie back to the town. The halls are good with comfortable seats and good sound system. The last time I visited Mayajaal was in April and the tickets are comparatively cheap compared to other miltiplexes."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,SrivatsanNarayanan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Movie,Movie theatre the volume is too loud and not being controlled properlySeats are broken and not fixedSnacks is too expensive for a place like Mayajaal. Quality is average
Mayajaal_Entertainment,hari k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Movie Druva,We went for movie druva and it looks old screen and seating chairs too. Here cost of two wheeler parking is too high but it is best theater especially for Telugu movies.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Dhanush D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,A Hangout place I'd call it.,I've gone to Mayajaal with my friends for watching movie. There are 16 screens and the tickets are cheap. The picture clarity is fair enough and the sound is good. There is a food court and gaming center and scary House for more entertainment. It is a good place if all you have to do is while away your time.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,TV Sinha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Good concept but in need of repair ,"This Multiplex has a very large number of screens, but for some reason it seems to be under a perpetual state of repair. Thankfully, the halls themselves are good, but walking up to the hall is not a good experience because of the continuous repair. The eateries in the place also look quite run down. The ushers seen lifeless. The redeeming feature is that the hall itself, the music system, the screens, are good. "
Mayajaal_Entertainment,united87,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Lost its charm,Used to place such a happening place but now it's a very average place to visit.. the food court standard has gone down.. even the theatre is not upto modern standards..would recommend this place only if you don't get tickets in other theatres..
Mayajaal_Entertainment,SIVA S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Movie and Entertainment,"We saw a movie over there,Multiplex also old compared to cites.only thing you can enjoy over there is snow bowl and 3D selfie spot, food items Is too costly and also not worth for price.parking also too much that too for open parking."

Fabulous
Mayajaal_Entertainment,vngpls,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Horrible experience,After hearing so much about this place we were curious to visit and watch a movie. But the decision turned out to be a disaster. The whole place stank like anything. Food counters were unhygienic and staff maintaining it were rude and impolite. The worst experience awaited us inside hall. There was a strange smell all the while and seats and floor were unclean. The screen was very small and sound system is nothing to write home about. The eatables were also exorbitantly priced. Many of the floors were unlit and looked like sets from horror movies. Don't go unless you've nothing to do.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,aritradasm,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,My excuse to travel out of Chennai city...,"If you want to travel outside chennai city accompanied with some driving on the scenic ECR hghway + sea beach + Movies/ entertainments like bowling, pool, video games(decade old only for kids), this is the place you want to go.Multiple screens are available, best thing about this place is ticket availability. If I want to see a movie on Sat/ Sunn in chennai within the main city, i have to book max by Friday to get a good seat.Bhangra, a Pujabi restaurant is there in the backside which has a very fine dining ambience serving authentic punjabi/ north indian food at affordable rate compared to the experiece it provides. To summarise, Weekend: Travel + entertainment + North/ Punjabi food = Mayajaal. Have fun this weekend ;)"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Akashdx,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Solo,Almost Okk......,"Good if you want to watch movies at reasonable rate. However theatres are not that good.Food court lacks Famous Brands like Kfc,Dominos, PizzahutNilgris Is there which the only impressing thing here"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Arun K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,Decent place to watch movies,"One of the most happenings places when it was launched, it has declined in quality over the years.This is still a decent place to watch movies and people come in huge numbers - since tickets are easily available here & slightly less available in the main parts of Chennai.However, the food here is average and the other facilities are also average at the best.You can visit this place for easy access to movies alone."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,kirannaren,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Nice Place for Movie Goers with Some Decent Dining Options,"Nice Place for Movie Goers with Some Decent Dining Options , Too many Screens and Movie options - Good Dining options inside the Complex , decently maintained - Ample car parking charges thought the parking charge is high."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,gangadharankaruppan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Movie lovers' place,"Almost on any day, for any movie, you can get tickets. There are nearly 20 screens and are maintained good. It is kinda away from the city but that makes it a good spot."

Mayajaal_Entertainment,JumboMumbai,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,Lackadaisacal,The location is awesome... but unfortunately not built to max potential.  It is non the less very crowed esp on hlidays.  The cine plex is average but other than that there is hardly anything worth the mention.  Food is awful whatever little you can manage and the games are ancient to say the least.  Parking is ill organised butquite large so does not matter.  Not worth the drive from Chennai city
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Hari K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,Nice location ,Not cleaned Maintenances required Not maintaining properly Nice crowd Many screen options Many food options  Big parking area

Mayajaal_Entertainment,Suranjan D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Hail Mayajaal !!!,Though of being far and having many negative points to talk about yet this place is nice to watch for a movie .Multiple screens and value for money tickets make it always possible for any audience to quench his expectations. Not so crowded and idle to hangout with friends. People like us from Mahabalipuram always like to make it during a new release.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Ajith k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Good but not the best,This cinema having very large number of screens but not great like sathyam cinemas and foods are very costly
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Lakshmi Narayanan S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,A place where you will get cinema tickets for sure,"I always visit this place to watch movies. If you are not getting tickets anywhere else in the city, you will get tickets here. This place is on the outskirts of the city, hence not advisable to visit in the night if you are going by two wheeler. There are other entertainment which includes bowling, mehandi, billiards, ghost house. there is also a small food court which you should definitely AVOID! The theater is also average and visited by many slum people."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Madhan Raj J,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,"Place for movie, if you do not get tickets anywhere else","Located on the outskirts and the ECR,  you get fresh air when you drive there. But the fund ends there. Parking is expensive and still in the open on just muddy surface, insufficient parking assistants to help.The interiors in the movie hall include A/C was below average and food is expensive compared to other movie complex like Satyam or AGS."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,AMMUKARTHIK2308,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,"Only for movies - ""Better skip if possible""",It is located in ECR ; Far away from chennai city;Looking from outside this mall looks great but need to improve a lotApart from 16 Movie screens in single mall nothing is thereYou couldn't get even a better snacks too in interval.Actually this is first time i seen escalator without crowd in a mall.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Compulsive Traveler,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Slowly going to seed..,"Mayajaal entertainment shows signs of age  and is probably facing accelerated deterioration. The broken down, lone escalator is a sad reminder of what must have been. Today the Centre is a mere ghost of its past. The Nilgiris shopping plaza has given way to a less glamorous shop selling all types of gift articles and cheap clothing. Only the multiplex is functioning well but is now in need of a renovation. A little more attention to cleanliness and upkeep could have helped maintain this place which has many positives, including a large central atrium that can host live music and other performances "
Mayajaal_Entertainment,piyu1969,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,Very far ,I went to see a movie yesterday & in return I could not get a cab. It is worth if you own a car otherwise you will spend more in travel than movie ticket 
Mayajaal_Entertainment,satnam2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,Good for movies,"This mall has 16 movie screens at one place which is an achievement in itself. Otherwise, its not well-maintained as its unkempt, dirty and untidy mostly. The food joints here aren't upto the mark at all. The only good thing is that you can watch movies here in budget considering its location."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Sajin P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Easy availability of Tickets..,"Easy availability of tickets, other than this, this place doesn't have much for people.

As this is located out of the city, it is not very crowded. Tickets for newly released movies are easier to get here, compared to the multiplexes in the city"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,iamarunrajan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,"Old, but not Gold","Mayajaal multiplex boasts of housing 16 screens along with shopping mall and play arena.

Mayajaal_Entertainment,tnbalaji90,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Nice experience :),Nearly there are 25 screen in this multiplex and all the new movies will be released here for sure. If you not getting tickets in any other theatre then come to this theatre and this will be and best option to choose. Seats and the environments are very good. Nice experience.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,AnilKumarPorwal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Go only if you wish to watch a movie,"My family is a regular visitor to Maayajaal. We drive down from Pondicherry quite frequently to catch up with the latest Bollywood and Hollywood movies.Maayajaal as it proclaims to have 16 Screens, is Aisa's largest Multiplex. All the screens are excellent in terms of Picture quality and sound effects. The airconditioning inside the screens is awesome. The seats are reasonably comfortable and the theatres are quite clean.However Maayajaal fails miserably in terms of other attractions. The food court is pathetic. The airconditioning is very bad. The ticketing on site is horrible. The escalators are not so well maintained. The parking is overflowing and no shade available in the parking despite being charged.The shopping arcade on the ground floor does not run the airconditioning at all and that is unprofessional.The car spa & Nilgris superstore save the grace."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Vignesh Pandian,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Better have no expectations,"Have gone to this place for a movie. There is little pungent smell all over the place.

Mayajaal_Entertainment,travalingyogi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Good to watch movie but now not the happening place it used to be..,When I came to Chennai it was a happening place but now this became a place to watch movies only...that too lil separated from City....now City has so many options to watch movies...but still it has it's own attraction...1 thing is near to coast...next is on ECR so one can enjoy long drive also...apart from movies young kids can enjoy the small game parlor also.. all in all its worth watching movies here....They don't have Audi or screen numbers display on doors...bit confusing..
Mayajaal_Entertainment,kprasadnarayanan2015,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Very very ordinary !,"What was once one of the best entertainment spots in Chennai is now pathetic. Been there to watch a movie since it was screened only there. Utterly disappointed when I entered the premises. The entire mall was dimly lit, no proper identification, screens and theatres were not modernized, the place looked as if it was not visited for months by anyone. Has the management forgotten to facelift this place?"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,selvam21,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016,Customized entertainment hub,"Very amble parking spaces, hindrance free check in procedure, centralized access to all screens, child play areas, but snacks are costly, billing method is with smart card which pulls extra money"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,MKGurucharan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Family,Not up to the mark!!  :/,Mayajaal.... 30 odd kilometers from chennai.. On the 'fast growing'  East coast road.. The 'so called' mall has deteriorated a lot  in the recent years maybe due to the growing number of malls in Chennai... 16 screen multiplex.. All the screens are small.. Parking space is good.. Not much to do over here... You can come here once or twice.. After that it wouldn't seem an intresting place... Overall to sum up.. It is an ok-ok place to visit and spend a good evening.. 
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Srinivasan R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Movies ,Too far for people in central chennai. But still like to travel and have a time to spend on beach after a movie this is a perfect spot.

Mayajaal_Entertainment,Priyaniveriya,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Terrible. Not at all Recommended,I recently visited this place with husband & friends. Worst place so far i visited in Chennai.Feels like you are visiting a haunted house.Complete dark as soon as you enter the Zone.Toilets are worst than public toilets.Cheap crowd. very small screen (if you go with an idea of Multiplex i swear u will be disappointed) . will never ever  visit this place again.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Ghiri T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Friends,Largest multiplex of Asia,"This multiplex is located at East Cost Road,Chennai.Here there are movies games shopping etc.It is a sixteen screen multiplex.it is a best place in Chennai to spend the whole day with your loved ones"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Ganesh S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,Weekend Movie,Visiting it Maayajal after a very long period and it hass definitely lost it's charm. Had to go there since I couldn't find movie tickets for a movie that release over the weekend. Place is dull inside compared to the malls that are brightly lit. Lacks air conditioning and what one expects from such a place. Theater needs attentions with modern amenities with which the theaters in the cities attracts people. Had to go round and round to locate the screen we booked(may be since I was going there after a really long time). The ECR road which is itself an attraction now is being expanded and hence it's difficult to enjoy the ride.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,meghna4409,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,Okay-ish,"It's an average theatre where the staff doesn't mind you much. You could buy the ticket for one film, get in, and then watch three films and nobody would find out. There's no cloak room, so you're allowed to take your bags inside the theatre. So feel free to get cheap food to snack on inside the theatre rather than buying from inside which is x100 times priced."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Sakthivelu Raja,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,Just ok ,"Average quslity theatre. If you are desperate to watch a specific movie and difficult to get tickets in city halls, head here."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,bikumsra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Friends,Good but not best theater,This is a low budget theater. The service was not good and the quality is also worst. There are 16 screens but not a good one. Did not enjoy the movie.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Anupam_Singh26,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,An average place!,"Its on the East Coast Road in Chennai, food joints are fine but I did not like the theatre much as the seats were not comfortable."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,pvijaykumar80,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,QUALITY GOING DOWN DAY BY DAY,"I visited Mayajaal last week to watch a movie. This theater is located in a very good location, however, the maintenance inside the complex is really very bad. The only advantage is that it has many screens and show timings."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,K K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,APPALLING. I will never go there again!!,"went to this place to watch a movie... absolutely APPALLING. it was raining heavily outside, understandable that the roads leading to this attractions was flooded, but the cinema hall that we went to watch the movie had puddles of water INSIDE!!!! the seat that was allocated to us was soaking wet. when we checked for the reason, the roof was leaking.. when we complained to an employee from this attraction, he gave us a plastic chair and made us sit in the walkway! poorly maintained toilets, very high priced, LOW quality food. In an nutshell, THIS IS NOT AN ATTRACTION... i would avoid it like plague. The owners should visit other similar facilities such as the ones in Express Avenue. Shame on Mayajaal to take customer's money and not providing a clean and tidy environment to relax and enjoy."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Sachin0408,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Friends,All Pomp and NO Show,"In the years between 2009 and 2013 that I stayed in Chennai I heard a lot about Mayajaal as an entertainment center with too much to offer for all age groups. It has 16 cine- screens for movies, gaming center, huge food court and other entertainment options. Situated on the ECR Road I visited the place only once out of excitement and once there all my excitement died. The establishment was poorly lit, AC was not working in its full capacity, food court had some awful items to eat and the overall maintenance of the property was in shambles. Washrooms were pathetic, parking was chaotic and security was near zero. If I have to opine that Mayajaal is the last place in Chennai to visit for watching movies I would rather stop watching movies all my life than visit here again."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Sooraj N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,Ok ok place ,Was their for a movie .. Decent place .. Can't complain.. Small screens.. But quite a few of them. Seats are average in terms of comfort levels.   
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Ramkumar R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Good If you are looking for less crowded Mall in Chennai,"Its seems nowadays Mayajaal is being considered as last choice for the city people. It could be due to the long distance. But if you want to go on for a little travel in ECR , then this is the perfect spot to have some time spent on the way. The plus point is you can always get tickets for the movies as there are many screens, you can randomly go to the mall and watch your choice of movies. Overall i would say its a good place though not as fancy as other malls in the city."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Jitendra Khandelwal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,So many Theatre running under one roof..,"Nice place to visit with your family for cine entertainment, Gaming zone, Food, relaxation etc..I have not seen Multiplex having more than 15 theatre running under one roof.Lot of movie option Tamil, Hindi, English in one roof.Gaming zone like Bowling, Pool, 5D show, CAR for Kids are there to have fun.Cons :Gaming zone looks to be quite old. Property seems to be old.."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,DIPPYSATAN05,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Friends,Last option ! !,"Only reason I  visit Mayajal because, it only place where I can see hindi movie running whole day whole week. I can see that this place build with great dreams but now it maintain very poorly. Bathroom, wall, lighting, parking areas are in worst condition. Need big maintenance work to do.  Food Drinks Parking  all are expensive , people don't mind to pay as well, but guys please maintain your property and make this place welcoming !"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,VaibhavOza,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015,King of Old times,"Multiplex started showing its age. But the only multiplex in South Chennai where you will get confirmed Hindi movie running throughout (except when Thalaiva's movie is released). Poor lighting and facility management deteriorating the multiplex further. If you just want to watch the movie, and dont care about fun and food, just go there. Avoid Sunday afternoon to evening, otherwise you will get stuck in returning traffic from Mahabalipuram and Pondicherry."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Reka_786,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,Overall review,"Maintenance in toilets , food court area is very pathetic,, looks very unhygienic , would attract more if its hygiene plus welcome area could more interior designed to the latest trend but overall a average atmosphere but has lots of theatres"
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Maddy4Love,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,Cinema with Fun places,Cinema with Fun places for family. Having entertainment shows and games for children and all. Best Entertainment place in ECR
Mayajaal_Entertainment,ramayana2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Solo,MAINTENANCE POOR BUT NICE PLACE TO ENJOY,"This far off from chennai at kannathur on e c r road. This is one of the biggest multiplex complex.it has 30,000 s.ft big shopping mall and a sports complex.mayajaal has 16 screens biggest at chennai.there is a resort with 40 rooms. the maintenance need improvement."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Sushmita B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015,LESS THAN AVERAGE,the total complex has become old. but the cost of all amenities alone is increasing. no proper maintenance is being done there. the resorts also are not maintained.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Sankar44,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,Worst screen ever seen,We went to bahubali telugu movie on screen 6. The screen has got spots and couldn't feel the quality of the  movie due to worst screen. Suggest don't visit this place for movies
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Skumar2005,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Couples,Pathetic,First of all washrooms were pathetic. Not clean at all. In movie theatre they do not have any system for entry exit. When I got in then got to know that previous show is running. You will have multiple people entering during the show. If it rains you will have lots of Mud in parking. Better visit beaches around. Will not recommend to visit there.
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Vimprash,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Tickets nowhere? Try Mayajaal,"Recently visited Mayajaal to watch Jurassic World movie. Overall: Very bad experience and a must AVOID place. Only go when you have to watch a movie and there are no seats available anywhere else. Also you might have to watch the movie again in some other good screens :)AC--was ON initially, then it was switched off3D experience: One of the worst. The glasses given was full of scratches and when asked for replacement all the glasses i checked was full of scratches and added to that the glasses made the screen too dark whereas it shouldn'tSnacks: worst, bad quality with too much rates.  Parking: Open and when we came back (noon show), although our car is White due to weather it was like a super heated oven. Seating: OkayScreen: OkayOnly good thing is you will get tickets in most of occasions as the place is in outskirts and have lots of screens."
Mayajaal_Entertainment,Gunasekaran T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Fun filled day,"we went with families to spend a day out in Mayajaal resortsresort was clean and tidy. swimming pool was too good. limited food varieties, but good to spend a day, we went for cinema alsowe had evening break at food court, no worries about parking"
