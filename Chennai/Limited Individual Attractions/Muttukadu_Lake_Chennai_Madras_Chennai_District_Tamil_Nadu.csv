Muttukadu_Lake,vivek a,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Dirty ride,"Would start off by saying that I am ashamed that people in my state have damaged a pleasurable boating experience in the backwaters. There are residential places, I guess even an industrial building bordering the edges and it's obvious that they have made the backwaters a mini-dumping yard. Bottles,covers floating in the water ; garbage mounds visible within minutes of starting the ride don't really make it an enjoyable affair. I assume that the place had a sprawling fauna because even now after all the contamination I could see quite a few birds which actually is sad. Needs an overhaul badly to save this place and experience."
Muttukadu_Lake,dinesh_j84,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,'Excellent Place to Relax',This is an excellent place to relax amidst the hectic work schedule. It is on the ECR towards Mahabalipuram. The beach water is very clean and it takes around 15 mins to travel by boat to this place.
Muttukadu_Lake,amohanro,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,BOATING AMONGST FLYING FISHES.....OR SO THEY SEEMED TO BE,"A lovely place with memories stretching back far into childhood. The boats are big and you have to wait until nearly all the seats are filled before the boat ride. It's nice. I love the sea, I love boats, and all this neatly fits in. My son loves boat rides too. The way the fishes jump out of the water make you think whether it's Barracuda hunting grounds. Pity no BRracuda has leapt out yet, ever. If you visit the restaurant, stay away from the kitchen or risk losing your appetite. Brave that and risk loosing your bowels. The kitchen area, though strictly vegetarian, is not for the faint hearted, just the fleet footed. Overall, a great way to spend a lazy Sunday evening with family."

Muttukadu_Lake,nellu r,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Muthukade ecr boating,"I have been here many times. The muthukadu is part of ECR and the area looks so beautiful, especially if you are traveling in early morning's or evening ,georgious. You have option of sharing boat or the jet ..nice, but the water in lake is pathetic.looks like all seewage water is cumulating over here. If you are looking any option for food within 800 meter taj fisherman's cove with variety restaurants or ECR daba. Over all area is super."

Muttukadu_Lake,MRuzal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Family,Go for Boating......,It takes a nice drive from Chennai through ECR to reach Muttukadu. Boating is a decent one at Rs.80/- for 20mins. You can watch pelicans and other seabirds occasionally. Snacks are available in nearby cafe. Ample carparking space also is there. Watch out your head while boating under ECR bridge. Calm place to spend an evening. You can also visit nearby beaches like Kovalam...
Muttukadu_Lake,Anupam W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Couples,Decent Place For Boating..,"This place is good for 1-2 hrs hangout. This place has food court, sitting area, washroom and parking. Boating cost is little bit expensive (One round takes around 15 to 20 min). Be aware that the boat driver will ask for a tip of Rs 100 for extra round. I feel crossing the ECR bridge little risky as there is very less space when the boat goes under the bridge. Overall average place for 1-2 hrs hangout."
Muttukadu_Lake,AMRaja,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 • Family,Muttukadu Boating_Needs improvement,"Muttukadu lake located on the ECR needs more improvement. The lake was not clean. Not well maintained. Though the cost of boating is little bit higher, the cleanliness and the comfortableness was not upto the mark. One can go for Muttukadu boating  as a last option!"
Muttukadu_Lake,shyam v,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Family,"Boating in OMR, Chennai","My rating will be Average. Its a calm and nice place just outside Chennai. You can spend max 1 to 2 hrs here. there is a food court, washroom and parking available. Boat takes 8 people and per head costs around 75 rupees. One round takes around 15 to 20 min. Ok but i found its quite little time and I feel the lagoon should be bigger for real experience of boating."

The location is very close to Dakshin Chitra and MGM on the East Coast Road. There is no enterance fees. But one can go for boating by paying the ticket amount.

Muttukadu_Lake,AbidSuhail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Couples,Scenic boat ride and bird watching,45 mins drive from Chennai and you get to spend some quality time in a lake that is still not spoilt. Gud for  a family picnic or a romantic getaway.
Muttukadu_Lake,mikiatnet,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2013 • Family,Good but a lot more to improve,"This is a nice place to kill time with your family, still few things to remember. They do/follow things only for process sake including safety. Staffs are irresponsible. The boating staffs demanding money apart from the boat hiring charge. These things have to be addressed immediately...."
Muttukadu_Lake,MJRVJ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 • Family,For a Change,"For a change, escape from the normal ruckus and visit Muthukadu for a pleasant evening boat ride. There are lot many type of boats to choose from...from a motor boat to a paddle boat. Explore it to experience it..."
Muttukadu_Lake,poornima r,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2012,good range of boats,there are not much of sight seeing spots around chennai. this one is worth visiting especially in the evening before 5pm. speed boats and waterscooters are terrific
Muttukadu_Lake,Karthick_Madurai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Friends,Nice experience in the back waters,"Muttukadu is actually an back water situated on the East coast road (ECR). Its famous for its boating. The boat house there was maintained by Tamil Nadu tourism and offer pedal boat, Row boat and Motor boat facilities.

Muttukadu_Lake,Bhramanti-Pune,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Family,Beautiful backwater lake with birds and boating,"On the way to fisherman Cove, this is really nice stop. The place has a boating dock, with full service boating, decent restaurant and nice people. The boating is good. The lake offers beautiful colonies of the birds- mostly pelican and storks. Definitely worth a visit."
Muttukadu_Lake,Narayanan S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2012,Go Boating at your own risk,The hired boat with a person to take us round wouldnt care less about safety. The back water was reasonably dirty

Muttukadu_Lake,Vansid,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2012,A bird sanctuary used as public toilet,"My apartment overlooks the lake so I know a thing or two about this place. Through the months of winter (or whatever November is called in Chennai) we wake to the sight ot beatiful birds on and along the lake, a sight spolt by people defecating in the open alongside the lake"
Muttukadu_Lake,arul_nambi2000,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2011 • Friends,Unique place at least for TN,"The kind of ambience you get here, back water and silent , only few places in TN are worth visiting due to the facility available. Here you need to reach before late evening to enjoy the facilities. Boat ride is the main attraction other than watching the water front sipping your cup of tea."
