National_Art_Gallery,gupreen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Raja Ravi Varma and many originals,"For the art lovers, this place is a must go! There are several wonderful paintings, all original pieces! You can keep admiring at your peaceful length of time! Unfortunately the sculpted masterpieces are totally out of bounds for public. You have to admire them from the gallery above. But the paintings make up for this. The original British era paintings, modern art and above all - the original Raja Ravi Varma paintings!BTW, the entrance itself is passed by a structure so lovely and majestic with a beautiful door! Although, it is only the side building where the beautiful art pieces are located. There is a small collectibles shop. Also worth a visit if you are looking out for some steals. Overpriced though :)"
National_Art_Gallery,AURELIO L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,it s a must,"i have no idea about how much rooms of this museum you will be able to see,the main problem is that so much rooms are closed and it s not possible to see them ,but this is an interesting museum where you will be able to see indian art "
National_Art_Gallery,MarkfromtheIsland,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Review of the bronze gallery - main museum is closed,"So the main museum here is closed because nobody noticed the roof was leaking till all the art was damaged.  That pretty much sets the stage for why I rated this poorly.The bronze gallery has some beautiful work in it but it's marred by a total lack of care.The ground are all dug up for some renovation work.  That's understandable.  But dumping loads of gravel across the walking paths isn't.  Having a gallery with the air conditioning out and not expected to be working for 60 days isn't.  Allowing a large group of elementary school children to roar around screaming while other visitors are trying to see the sights isn't.  The display and display cabinets being full of dust both inside and outside isn'tGet it together here.  These are historical artifacts, not the contents of your aunt Karen't garage."
National_Art_Gallery,Karpagavalli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Has to improve the maintenance,The building was built by the British during their period here but now is a museum. The place is so vast with 6or7 building s each exhibits the old era products and sculptures and all.
National_Art_Gallery,KANewYork,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Local art,"Entry tickets can be bought adjacent to the main gate from where you enter. Different rates for Indians and foreigners. If you want to take pictures you can pay extra. The complex contains many buildings. Many were closed or in the process of renovation. The anthropology section was open partially.. just a couple of rooms on the ground floor displaying weapons. The highlight was clearly the Bronze gallery with some pieces dating back to the 9th century AD. Most are forms of gods and goddesses. The large nataraja or dancing shiva statue from Tanjore is the the one whose copies are sold everywhere in India from small trinket sized to large show pieces. No photography was allowed in here.The complex has lots of shade from a large number of trees, so it’s relatively pleasant walking in here as compared to the city streets."
National_Art_Gallery,Nigel G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Nice Selection of Art,"The National Art Gallery is within the National Museum compound. I was thoroughly confused here when I arrived regarding the ticketing and by the advice given by my driver. You buy your ticket at the ticket office. There is NO ticket for the National Art Gallery - it is only a National Museum ticket which covers all six houses of the complex. That's the first mystery solved. Second - why do I need to go to Gallery 1 - Mogul Architecture if I want to see the art - that's because you need to activate your ticket there and if you want to buy a camera pass that's where you get it from for R250. Now you are free to go anywhere and in any order. Did unit 1 as I was there then moved the the Art Museum in building 6. It's very messy as there is much renovation going on. You are told to disregard the no photography signs if you have purchased the camera pass.Arrived at building 6 and the lower floor was all about handicraft and models etc. True art on the two upper levels. I had heard this Museum has an excellent presentation on holograms which is on the 2nd floor but unfortunately this was closed. So the art collection - as you enter some examples of officials of the British Colonial Administration. Not of much interest to me. Moving on nice ethnic art of all sorts. You can see the influence of Picasso for example in works by Narasimma Murthy - very impressive. Excellent portrait of Gandhi by KV Vaidayanathan - Father of the nation - a great tribute. Some mogul art paintings . Excellent collection but less than excellent lighting. As it goes, not too many attendants in the museum so I chose to alter the lighting if I wanted to take photos - of course returning it to the original position afterwards. Excellent collection. - disappointed upper floor was closed but I guess it was being renovated. Book shop in buildings 1 and 6. Parking - anywhere you can find. "
National_Art_Gallery,Travelbug291,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,Well Worth a Visit,"A somewhat confusing place if you didn't have a guide to direct you. Several galleries, the most fascinating of which was the Bronze Statue Gallery. Interesting to see the same deities interpreted from different ages. Photography is limited in some areas which is disappointing."
National_Art_Gallery,Amjith S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Many titles should be given to the different buildings which house different things for different ages too,I reached there by an ola cab the driver was very interactive when i told him my drop in spot he asked me there  is nothing much to see over there. But i didn't lose my hope i took a pass and actually I was unaware of where to go I wandered there finally I spot a sign board showing direction I entered the first building and I thought its over but it wasn't there are many such buildings I feel hard to find those its better to go with our friends because we get bored watching all those stuffs which should be understood. there photography is prohibited but I managed to take some.
National_Art_Gallery,Partha C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Must see place in Chennai,"It is within Government Museum, separate building.   Huge collection of paintings, Art work, Sculptures. It is a must see place in Chennai."
National_Art_Gallery,Nuno V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Wonderfull Surprise,In a very large city with not so many cultural and art interests the National Art Gallery is a wonderful surprise (even if many of the collections awere closed). Bronze sculpture gallery is fantastic!
National_Art_Gallery,Ramkumar R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Relaxing and Peaceful ,"Very good collection of paintings and sculptures. If you are interested in art, this is a must visit for you in Chennai."
National_Art_Gallery,Shyamis,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Family,Not to miss for art lovers,"One of the oldest in India, the building itself is absolutely beautiful. It has works from mughal era, Ravi Varma, etc."
National_Art_Gallery,ScoopTraveler,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Couples,Some great examples of Indian bronze sculptures and paintings poorly displayed,"I have rarely ever seen such a neglected and impoverished museum. Its exhibits need decent lighting and display. But for the dedicated who love art, there is plenty to be seen from Deccan to contemporary Indian paintings and wonderful bronzes from all epochs. "
National_Art_Gallery,kevinjohn1991,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Solo,Art lover's world!!!,"I would recommend this place only for real art and craft lovers who appreciate art. There are quite a few items on display like ancient books, manuscripts, stone carvings etc to name a few. This place is badly in need of repairs and maintenance * Art Lover = Must Visit *"
National_Art_Gallery,chinmayee_sahu4,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014,National Art Gallery :),A must go place for any one who appreciates art and craft and wants to dig into history. Loved my tour to Chennai :D 
National_Art_Gallery,fjp4564,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Solo,India's recent and past History,"Tourists are encouraged to visit this place that has several buildings housing inportant items like books, manuscripts, bronzes, stone carvings, coins, paintings etc.  There are some fantastic items to view in you are interested in the past History.  The many beautiful buildings looks like the way the British left them in 1948.  Badly needing some maintenance and repair work, and cleaning of the gardens etc.  it would be a national tragedy if these places are left to crumble and disappear."
National_Art_Gallery,John S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Solo,Outstanding Bronzes,"The museum complex has exhibits scattered theough several old Raj era buildings.  The surrounding grounds are run down, with dry fountains, broken fencing, a few pie dogs, etc., but I like that kind of atmosphere.  I only went in the Chola bronze museum and the contemporary art exhibit.  The later can be missed, it's more like a craft show, but if you're into folk art, then give it a look.  The bronzes, on the other hand, are spectacular.  These objects date mostly from the 9th to 11th centuries, are displayed well in glass cases, and have not been cleaned up, so the patina of centuries of incense and smoke remain on the surfaces.  The artistic talent that went into the crafting of these works of religious devotion is amazing.  There is a large sampling of Siva Natraj images, each one with subtle variations, and a large one at the far end of the hall that is displayed against a backdrop of a galaxy of stars, very fitting for the symbolism of the figure.  Budhist and Jain figures are also included, along with well written wall monographs on topics such as the iconography of the figures, and the various methods used to fashion the images.  Also, the room is fairly cool, always welcome in Chennai's perpetual heat.  If you are foreign, you will pay more that a native to get in, but I am glad to help support such a fine collection.  You will not find such a collection anywhere elso in the world."
National_Art_Gallery,RooRu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Couples,Interesting museum but rather shabby,"There are some fantastic things to see in the National Art Gallery. The Chola bronzes are a must. I also liked the massive colonial portraits and the antique furniture. The museum is very run-down, unfortunately, but still worth a visit."
National_Art_Gallery,Siva M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Solo,Feeling Very sorry. It has got 41st place in attractive list.,One of a finest collections this museum has. Well kept and displayed. must visit museum in tamilnad. Non Indian can learn a lot from this site about Indian's art and culture. A perfect introduction at gate way of South.
National_Art_Gallery,Aroundtheworldser,2.0 of 5 bubbles,,felt sorry for the art and nature which deserve much better,"on a rainy day, the first in Chennai, visiting the museum was enlightening. However, the art gallery is closed for maintainance and the entire compound needs much more care. Art is beautiful, the botanical and zoological exhibits are poorly lit and the description barely lisible. Groups of school children are noisy but they do not stay long in the room anyway... Good to have seen it but do not expect much."
National_Art_Gallery,Aline D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Couples,Very good,The Chola art must be seen to be appreciated.  I have said it in just a few words.....go and see south Indian art and respect the antiquity thereof!
National_Art_Gallery,kmntgm,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Couples,Worth seeing...but in need of care,"A strange mix of art and science exhibits, in fairly poor display.  Giant dinosaurs though...The bronzes are extensive and impressive."
National_Art_Gallery,srinivasan369,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2012 • Solo,Government Museum not to be missed,"It is what is called elsewhere ""National Gallery"", Pantheon Road, Egmore.This museum was established in 1857 and it is one of the finest museums in India.According to me, its ""best"" is the sculpture/bronze gallery which contains very nice carvings of the different Indian faiths, and, especially, a very famous Nataraja (the Lord of Dance) dancing on the demon of ignorance and surrounded by flames. There is also a nice set showing SriRama with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana and his devotee Hanuman, the monkey-god. There is also a fine collection of south-Indian musical instruments as well as jewellery. Timing : every day from 8am to 5pm, closed on Fridays and National holydays."
National_Art_Gallery,becky-camille,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2013 • Friends,good art gallery: worth visiting,"This was an interesting visit to quite a good, varied and large art gallery.The gallery houses several different sections displaying art ranging from statues, bronze, contemporary, needle work, traditional and abstract. It also had random displays of plastic and details on how plastic is moulded.....:pthere are some incredibly beautiful intricate ivory works on display such as 2 jewellery boxes and a few other ornaments.worth visiting but you wont be there for more than a few hours"
National_Art_Gallery,Narayanan S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2012,A good arts gallery,The selection of and display is very good. It is comparable some of the best in the country. It is kept clean. The lighting effect is also good 
National_Art_Gallery,Jackinbama,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2011 • Solo,How long will you be in town?,We are going to be here for three years and we went here fairly early in the expatriation.  If I were just visiting I would skip this as it is depressing to see the poorly maintained property.  Some of the exhibits are interesting but overall it was disappointing.  If you're here for a long stay then I suggest waiting for cool weather.  Very few air conditioned areas in this museum.
National_Art_Gallery,Anthony F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2012 • Solo,Some wonderful exhibits,"There are some very interesting exhibits here in these rather run-down victorian buildings.  The exhibits are well displayed along with interesting descriptions of most pieces.The museum was quite crowded and there seemed to be a lot of school parties, but the children looked smart in their uniforms and were well behaved and supervised.Well worth visiting for a couple of hours.Their website is quite interesting and will give you a flavour of what you will find there, including a map.  http://www.chennaimuseum.org"
National_Art_Gallery,carol643,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,bronze excellence,I went here to see the wonderful collection of Chola bronzes - they range from 10th century to 14th century and the quality has never been bettered.  They are created using the 'cire perdue' technique - lost wax.  If you have any interest in Indian culture do go - its an amazing museum
