Now I had intuition to visit this temple and we, family of 3 adults and 2 children went to this temple on 15.01.2018 Monday. It was morning around10.00 am and the temple was fairly crowded and many devotees are praying and paying their abeyance to Lord Thiruvalleswarar and Goddess Jagadambigai. Goddess  is very kind to HER devotees and take care of their well beings, it is believed here.Another important aspect in this temple is a separate Guru Bhagwan sanctum, Guru Bhagwan facing West, it is unique. Hence on Thursdays, devotees offer yellow vasthram to Lord Guru Bhagwan and pray. During Guru Peyarchi, special poojas were offered. This is Guru sthalam in Thondamandalam area, like Aalangudi in Tanjore district and cholamandalam area.On inner praharam, we can see Lord Vishnu, Sri Anjaneyar praying Siva Lingam and Lord Vinayagar in married pose. Those whose marriages are delayed,pray this Lord Vinayagar who bless them for early marriage. Vishnu Durga is another attraction here and on Tuesdays and other days during ragukalam, special poojas are performed. A must visit temple for those living near Chennai."
