Parry_s_Corner,Ravi D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016,Foreign travel?,"When I first arrived in Chennai as a student in 1967 the local accent lingo made me wonder how we could have a ""Paris Corner"" in then erstwhile Madras (now Chennai). It took me a while to figure out that the presence of Dare House, the Headquarters of Parry & Company. Factually, I was aware of Parry's because those days when I was only 5 years old the Mathrubhumi Weekly had a comic strip on the back inside cover, sponsored by this Corporate - Baban & Molly (transliterated from Malayalam spelling). Often the last strip would have an advertorial where the bus is not moving and to a query ""where is the driver? ""the stock answer was, ""He has gone to buy Parry's mittai"". That said, the presence of the Burma Bazaar nearby offers a wide range of 'foreign' goods, from perfumes to 2-in one tape recorders, travel bags and torches to variety items. Broadway stretch offers the middle class and poor an excellent opportunity to buy fruits and vegetables and flowers, though the wholesale markets have been progressively shifted out to Koyambedu. Once the iron and steel and other traders are also vacated this will become an old world charm of residences with a few temples dotting the locality. The lighthouse atop the High court is the oldest dating back to Madarasapatnam with the court buildings with its Indo-Sarscenic architecture in red brick being a sight to cherish in itself. One kilometre away is the Goddess temple(Kalikambal Kamadeswarar) Temple reportedly visited by Chatrapathy Shivaji during his Southern conquests. His picture still hang inside."

Parry_s_Corner,Shan D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,From goody bags to jewellery,"This place is a haven for whole sale items. It is the place for great bargains but unless you know where to look, it can get really tiresome looking for the shops. But when you chance upon something there, it is surely worth the buy!! If you have the stamina and the time, you should spend a whole day there! But remember most shops close on Sunday and only some are open on Saturday - Most people reserve the shopping for sundays only to be disappointed. Also it is a hassle for vehicles to park in the vicinity so you have to get off and go on foot. This is a surely MUST for the die hard shopaholics!!!"

Parry_s_Corner,anjanapoo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016,Shopaholic's paradise,"There are few occasions where you do not need huge spends to give happiness. If you are in one such mood, please do head to Parry's corner. This is exactly what you will do - you will get more items for less money and indeed you can find utility for all that you buy. I got a nice frame for my Rayban (a bounty dished out from my rummaging of my shelves after a long time). I could not get the frame in any formal shops. But in the platform, for Rs 200, i could get the frame and two years now, it is still intact. I have just given an example.Please make sure to get the ver kadalai (groundnuts) as you are walking or else you will not get into the spirit of shopping. You have every type of shop to address your various needs, not to miss out the umpteen eateries. Every hotel there has few good items to savour - samosas at Cosmo, Snacks at Ramakrishna, full meals at Saravana, With the Sea just a kilometer away, you will always have the sea breeze caressing your face and hair (if you are lucky to have some left - this punt only for guys). It is a wonderful 2 to 3 hours of time pass. If you get a chance to be here, please do not miss out and of course you will Sweat. No sweat no sweet (pardon me for my humble nonsense attempt at English punts)ENJOY and CHEERS - Ramesh"
