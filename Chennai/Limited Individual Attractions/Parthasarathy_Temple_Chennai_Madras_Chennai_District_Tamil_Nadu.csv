I wouldn't go expecting to get great photos, or any photos; just go for the experience, especially at times of ceremony, which can be moving, even if you are of another faith.

Wear suitable attire (no shorts or sleeveless tops)."

Parthasarathy_Temple,rasa006,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,This Perumal temple in Triplicane in Chennai is famous for many reasons.,"We, family members of 4 adults and 2 children, visited Parthasarathy Temple in Triplicane,Chennai during Navarathri festival. Laksharchana was going on for Rukmani thayar, (Vedavalli Thayar) many families participated, with Rs.200.00 as charges.When we went there to darshan of main diety, Swamy PARTHASARATHY PERUMAL, long queues were seen. Special quick darshan tickets of Rs.200 and another ticket for Rs.50.00 are offered for quick darshan. We had good darshan with aarthi to Perumal. As I said earlier, this temple is famous for many reasons:1. Main deity's majestic standing posture of more than 9 feet height.2. Main sanctum is facing East and  the temple is very near to Marina Beach, one of the famous beaches in the world.3. This Temple prasadam - Puliyotharai - it is called Parthasarathy Koil Puliyotharai. Rice item made with tamarind extract, red chilli,etc. If you try puliyotharai somewhere else, like restaurant, you tent to ask "" will it be like Parthasarathy Koil Puliyotharai. Its unique smell and taste made this one famous- like Laddu in Tirupathhi.4. Just opposite to western gate of this temple,ls an iconic house,maintained by Tamil Nadu Government. Yes, in this house Poet Mahakavi Bharathi lived and died. I visited this temple many times earlier, but after a gap of 4 years, I visited now and to my dismay, this temple's famous puliyotharai last its charm. I wondered what went wrong and why it went wrong. This time, this prasadam was a let- down for us.Any how, we had good darshan of Yoga Narasimhar, Andal, and other upaa dieties,"
Parthasarathy_Temple,KVG55,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Religious Pilgrimage,"Visited thrice over 3 days.Turned back from the entrance due to siesta on the first attempt.Second visit was spiritually satisfying, at this ancient Vishnu Temple.Several avatars of Lord Vishnu, including Lord Ram, were revealing to me.Northern Lord Ram temples , always have Lord Hanuman at this feet. This was a first for me.Returned 3rd day determined to pay obeisance at Vishnujis feet.Queued up with the general public, for 45 minutes, of exposure to the interiors. Fortunately, the vedic chanting of shlokas commenced. The serenity and spiritual power of the temple, and the hymns took over my entire being.There is a 50 rupees fast lane, but in my view, beats the purpose of temple visit.Life and time is running away and us mortals are forever in a hurry chasing the elusive mirage.Temple time should be devoted to focusing on the spiritual aspect and not scoring tick marks.Would I visit again... Definitely..Wish the temple premises outside the main area were cleaner as barefoot walking becomes a challenge under existing conditions."
Parthasarathy_Temple,sharathr23,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Historical landmark in Chennai,"This temple dates back to 8th century and one of the oldest structures in Chennai.While the temple itself has been revered as a holy place and houses quite a few deities, it needs some bit of maintenance and upkeep.Mainly with animals dirtying the outside (near temple entrance) and a few stray cats in the open spaces of the temple.Nevertheless, not everyday you get to visit a landmark that belongs to the 8th century! I recommend visiting this temple if you are in the nearby vicinity.Do note, parking of cars can get quite difficult as there is only limited parking space near the temple (about 12 cars). One can park on the road but there are no parking signs everywhere. Be cautious."

The sanctum  houses idols of Rugmini, Satyaki, Pradyumna and Aniruddha (son and grandson of Krishna). Krishna here also has a mustache!!

Parthasarathy_Temple,Somaseshu Gutala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,"About my visit to Parthasarathy Temple, Triplicane, Chennai","Most of the tourists visiting Chennai do not miss seeing this oldest temple located in the heart of the city at Singarachari Street, Triplicane. This temple called “Parthasarathy temple” is one of the most beautiful temples with many special features. Apart from being the sixty-first Vaishnavite  Divya Pradesam, it has the unique idol of Lord Krishna as Parthsarathy with a silver moustache in standing posture with a conch in his right hand and showing varada mudra in his left hand. As the Lord promised that he would not directly participate in Mahabharata War, we do not see Sudarshan Chakra in his hand. In the main sanctum along with Parthasarathy (also called Venkatakrishnan), we can also see his whole family present, a rare feature nowhere found in any other temple. Hence this place is called Southern Brindavana. Rukmini and Lord Balarama are seen on the right side of the main deity and Satyaki to his left along with Pradhyumna (Krishna’s son) and Aniruddha( Krishna’s grandson). On the face of the main deity a mark seen which said to be the mark left by Bhishma’s arrows during the Mahabharata war. In this temple we can see five forms of Vishnu – Lord Narasimha, Lord Sri Rama, Lord Gajendra Varada Raja, Lord Ranganatha and Lord Sri Krishna at one and same place. In this temple there are two entrance towers (Raja Gopurams) : one in front of Lord Parthasarathy’s shrine facing east; another one just behind this temple in front of Lord Narasimha’s shrine f acing west. Lord Narasimha called Yoga Narasimha is seen in sitting posture.  Besides these two Raja Gopurams, there are five vimanams or temple towers – over the shrines of Lord Parthasarathy, Ranganatha,Rama, Narasimha and Andal respectively. On the right side parallel to Parthasarathy shrine, the shrine of Goddess Vedavalli is seen facing east. There is a shrine for Ranganatha and for Sri Rama seen in the passage to the main shrine. Lord Ranganatha is seen facing east in reclining posture on the holy serpent bed of Adi Sesha with His two consorts sitting near his feet. In the shrine of Sri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna are seen on sides. A small shrine for Hanuman is seen just in front of this shrine. There is a separate shrine for Andal. This temple was constructed first by the Pallava King Narsimha Varma I in eighth century and later was expanded and developed by Pandya, Chola and Vijayanagara kings. There are many stone inscriptions in Telugu and Tamil referring to Pallava King Nandi Varman,Chola kings Raja Raja and Kulottunga III, Pandya king Maravarman  and Vijayanagara kings like Sadasiva raya, Sri Rangaraya and Venkatapathi raya II.  In 1564 the temple was renovated with new shrines. According to legends a king called Sumathi did penance and prayed to Lord Vishnu to appear before him in the form of Lord Parthasarathy. The Lord directed him to go to Tiruvallikkeni (now called Triplicane) to see the idol of Parthsarathy installed by sage Atreya Rishi. The king went there and built a shrine there after meeting the sage Atreya. The temple is open from 5.30 a.m. to 12.00 noon and from 4.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. every day.  Here worship is done according to Vaikhasana Agama in accordance with Thenkalai tradition. Many special poojas and celebrations are performed here on festival days like Sri Krishna Jayanti, Sri Vaikunta Ekadasi, Ratha sapatami, Sri Rama Navami and Nava Rathri. Brahmosthsavams are celebrated for  Lord Parthsarathy during Chittirai month (April and May) and for Lord Narasimha during Ani month (June and July).  Theppostsavam (float festival) is grandly celebrated here for one week during the month of Masi (February) every year."

Parthasarathy_Temple,Suresh C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Beautiful Century AD Temple - God with a Mustache,"Very near to the Chennai Sea shore at Marina is this beautiful 8th century AD temple built by Pallavas.   With good access, temple has a limited parking lot and to use the side roads as needed.  Partha Sarathy means Chariot rider for Arjuna in the epic Mahabharata.  Main God is the Krishna in Partha Sarathy form with a prominent Mustache.  Narasimha (Krishna's avatar with Lion head) is also an important and prominent Vikraha or idol at this place.   Vedavalli or Rukmani Thayar is the female diety and is very beautiful.    It was a story or history that there is a small face of Krishna idol in the side of Moolavar has his face armor pierced to indicate He being hit during the Mahabharata war.   Lovely and Peaceful place to visit overall.   Take time to visit the small house nearby where Mahakavi Subramania Bharathiyar lived."

Parthasarathy_Temple,Gowrish P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,"Historic Krishna temple, grand deity, must visit","Located in Triplicane within a couple of kilometers of Marina Beach, Sri Parthsarathy Temple is one of the oldest structures in Chennai, dating back to 8th Century AD, of the Chola rule.Dedicated to Lord Krishna and Goddess Rukmini, this temple built in Drividian style has other sanctums for Vishnu - Rama and Ranganatha included.The complex is large and has a rather round-about route to inner sanctum. If you enter from the main gate near the temple tank, you have to go all the way around, circumnavigate 3/4ths of the ground before getting in. This is likely for crowd management, but might be unnecessary during non busy hours.The main deity, Parthasarathy is an gorgeous stunning idol, larger than life and adormed with precious gems.The large stone construction keeps the insides cool but also humid. They have, as seen in other large temples like the Kapaleeswarar Temple, ACs inside to manage the ambient temperature.Parking is limited and surrounding roads are narrow. *Photography* is prohibited once inside. The outer corridor (see picture) has high pillars, with deities carved into the lower halves. This is a must visit beautiful temple."
