Patalathri_Narasimhar_Temple,KRAMA200,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,An Ancient Abimana Sthalam-Narasimhar Temple,"Pataladri, commonly known as Singaperumal Koil is a very famous Narasimha Kshetra situated in Chengalpattu District, Tamilnadu.This place houses a beautiful rock-cut Narasimha temple, which is situated on a small hill. The name of the place, ‘PatalAdri’ also gives a similar expression, as in Sanskrit “Patal” means red and “adri” means hill.This Narasimha Swamy temple is constructed on the hill; rather it appears as if the hill by itself is the temple. It was originally a cave temple, which was later extended by Gopuras and Mandapams. It is considered as one of the Abimana Sthalams of Lord Vishnu.The Garbhagriha of this temple is a cave. The Moolavar  of this Temple is Ugra Narasimha Swamy (gigantic deity) in a sitting posture with Abhaya Hastha, holding the Paanchajanya and Sudharsana Chakra .A unique feature here is that, in this temple devotees can worship the third eye of Ugra Narasimha Swamy. It is a very thrilling experience to witness the priest lifting the Naamam on the forehead of the Lord, beneath which the third eye is seen. It is said that if one gets to worship the third eye of the Lord, all miseries get destroyed.The Garbhagriha is a cave and the Moolavar is part of the hillock itself. Hence, devotees who want to do Pradakshina , have to go around the entire small hillock. Hence, Giri Pradhakshinam is very popular hereWhile walking around the temple, one can spot an Azhinjal tree. This tree is considered most sacred and is said to have been mentioned in the ‘Naachiyaar Thirumozhi’ composed by Aandaal. Devotees praying for marriage or children tie a small piece of thread from their clothes on the branches of this tree. By doing this with a wish, it is believed that their wishes are granted."

Patalathri Narasimhar & his consort Sri Ahobilawalli thayar amma is a great sight to see. Sthala vrichatam is Parijatham tree.

Patalathri_Narasimhar_Temple,rasa006,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,"Patalathri Narasimhar or Ugra Narasimghar temple in Singaperumal koil, near Chennai. wonderful cave temple.","I am really ashamed to note that I visited this temple only today-25.12.2016, even though I reside in Chennai for the past 41 years. This beautiful cave cut temple (in tamil- kudavarai koil: meaning a temple made in hillock cutting the stone). This temple dates back to around 1400 years old. Speciality of this temple is, sun rays fall on the feet of Lord Narasimha during Dec-Jan period (in Tamil month Margazi), since we visited  during this period, we were lucky enough to watch this spectre. This Ugra Narasimghar has third Eye, like Lord Siva and while making aarthi, the priest showed us the third Eye of Lord Narasimgha, by lifting the jewelled Thiruman of Lord. Oh, we felt Lord Narasimgha's blessing from His abhaya mudra hands. Another important aspect of this temple is Pradhakshanam - circumventing the Lord's  sanctum. Since the Lord's sanctum is inside the rock cut cave, we have to go around the small hillock- with convenient steps to climb and descend , making pradhakshanam easier for all. There is a Parijatham tree at the hillock, and anyone's wish is fullfilled if you tie a knot with yellow thread in the tree.Ambal, Ahibila thayar in near by separate sanctum who blesses all Her devotees. We had a wonderful darshan."
