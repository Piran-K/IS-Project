Pondy_Bazaar,Ravikesh P- Fiji,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Good shopping experience,"It was very ideally located as we stayed at the Grand Chennai by GRT. As the place is well known for its shopping it was a great experience as the whole street, Sir Thayagarya Road, T Nagar is full of shops.  Apart from main streets, there are smaller streets that also has shops. As it is a famous place for shopping, shop owners take full advantage and things are very expensive. Prices are same or more expensive than the shopping malls like express mall. Communication can be a problem as salespeople do not speak fluent english. Hindi too can be a problem.  Another drawback is the constant negging by the street dwellers who are either begging or selling things which they insist you to buy. Not many clean eateries except for some big restaurants like A2B and Balaji. KFC is also available."

Pondy_Bazaar,Debasmitaghosh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Shop to your heart's content,"Recently went to Chennai with my husband after 10 years. We had started our married life in Chennai 10 years ago so there was a lot of nostalgia attached to this trip. Hubby had work so I stepped out solo for a walk down Pondy Bazaar, one of my favourite places to shop in Chennai. It was around 12 in the afternoon, the February sun was pleasant, and I instantly felt at home under the canopy of trees that Pondy Bazaar is known for. I started off by buying a gajra for myself for 20 bucks from a street-side shop selling flowers and garlands. Got into the Chennai feel once I put the gajra on my hair. Walked a bit and stopped by this shop called Choices selling cut pieces for garments. The collection was huge, and an array of colours mesmerised me. I bought a few blouse pieces to gift my mother and mom-in-law. The prices were pretty reasonable, and I was in fact amazed that I got such a good deal. I came out of the shop happy and started walking again. There were shops lined up selling every pretty thing from copper-goldplated jewellery starting from Rs 800 to kurtas and bags priced Rs 200 onwards. I'm between there were small joints selling corn and coconut pudding. I stopped by one Amma selling fresh coconut water. At Rs 40 it was worth the price. The water was sweet and I felt satiated after a long walk in the sun. My next stop was Rathna Stores that sells everything, right from utensils to furniture. One tends to get lost inside this shop, the variety is so much. I felt excited walking in here after 10 years! Bought a few steel bowls and a couple of copper-bottom steel saucepans. Felt like buying the entire shop though. If you happen to come to Chennai, a visit to Pondy Bazaar, and most importantly Rathna Stores is a must! I walked down the entire street till I felt totally happy and done. Pondy Bazaar gives you that typical Chennai vibe, and it's always pleasant to come back here."
