Pothys_Hyper,Prasanth Paul,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Don't ever go there, as Pothys doesn't value the customer. They only claim false propaganda in media advertisements.","Worst customer service. Security guards are rude, cunning and pass foul comments. Does Pothys expect customers to come in shambles.  Wearing a decent dress becomes a property of Pothys."

Pothys_Hyper,AKTHAKUR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"pothys shopping bags with people everywhere in chennai roads , airport , railway stations - Oh God what popularity",We visited all stores of Pothys - They have 4 stores - one hypermart one textiles one for boutique collection and one for womens imitation jewellery what a collection .the women are there in dozens looking at necklace bracelets earrings bangles and all sorts of jewellery excellent in design and reasonably priced. their shopping bags are of very good quality and you will see with people everywhere. the name pothys reminds me of retro comedian actor Mehmood pronouncing in a very comic manner to girls eh pothyyyyyy. in one of hs famous retro movie.What to buy - Pothys Hyper market in usman road - several floors you name it you get everything reasonable price from kitchen items to mens clothes womens clothes sarees and huge huge variety . we spent 2 days in pothys all the 4 stores.you need lot of time to shop as there is huge variety.The second store - Pothys womens collection is on the same road and offers womens jewellery and cosmetics. the jewellery is not to be missed . imitation trendy and artificial gold plating but really beautiful and worth the price excellent value for money. ladies spend atleast an hour to look at necklaces bangles bracelets earrings and sets.The third store is just opposite to the womens collection store and mainly for textiles sarees . Kerala peacock embroidered sarees are very popular and complete sell out with beautiful embroideries. kanjeevaram and banarasi are the next favourites. the staff is very polite and friendly.The fourth store is on gn chetty road and prices are little on the higher side as they keep exclusive items . May be the rentals are high so the prices are kept high. Parking is available for all the stores.there is a food court on top of the stores.Donot forget to redeem your reward coupon after your purchases.Times have changed.Earlier saree was synonymous with nalli. Now pothys have taken over.their popularity is such that you will see their shopping bags with people everywhere at stations on road airport restaurants.if you donot believe me just walk on usman road t nagar and you will see pothys bag everywhere.Not to be missed.Best shopping at reasonable prices and rewards to redeem.
Pothys_Hyper,Kathleen P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,So Much More!,What a great place to shop! I came here looking for some casual typical Indian clothing. I left with anything but typical. The only thing I would suggest is that you might have to go up a size as many Indian women are tiny. The selection was just outstanding. The shop girls were more than happy to help me find matching leggings and scarves so that I looked awesome on my tour of southern India. I‚Äôll be back for more great clothes!

Pothys_Hyper,dupeyabu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,easy shopping,"If like me, you don't particularly like shopping and can't be bothered to haggle, then Pothys is the perfect place for a whirlwind scoot around, where you can gather up a few souvenirs and gifts with ease, and if you are lucky, even get a 'personal shopper' thrown in gratis!We had one day in Chennai before flying out and asked at our hotel for a recommendation fitting the above bill. We took a motorized rickshaw, which was fun, even though a few hair raising moments - which took about 20 minutes from the Raintree, St Mary's Road. When we went in, there were several lovely ladies to help customers, and one of them kindly took us to the floors which contained the goods we were after. All was painless and a nice experience - and we were satisfied we were not being ripped off. It seems particularly good for reasonably priced saris (cotton silk), and material in general. We didn't want ready to wear clothing, but on a quick glance, that floor looked as if there were bargains to be had. We had a quick look at the household section, but couldn't find exactly the copper bowls I had wanted, but settled on a couple of small copper and steel cooking pots. Very cheap.We wanted some silver jewellery, but on the jewellery floor, they only have 'imitation' - were directed to OKJ, 2 minutes up the road, and again we were satisfied and got what we wanted at a pretty good price.Definitely my way of shopping - and all done in less than an hour!"
