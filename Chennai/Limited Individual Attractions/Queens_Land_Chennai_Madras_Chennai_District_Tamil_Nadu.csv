Queens_Land,Abhishek Gaurav,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,An amazing Park - Must Visit,Queens land is perfect destination for kids and family for 1 day complete enjoyment.Pros - (a) All kind of rides offered for all age groups(b) Economical(c) Just located 3 kms from Poonamalle junction
Queens_Land,Sherline,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worst experience with crazy horses - Queensland Chennai,"I fell down from the crazy horses game. Please don't go for this because1. No footrest is available to place your leg 2. A Handle on each side of horse's face is the only support to hold on. The seat is a flat and lengthy one. When it lifts up from 180 to 100 degrees, the only thing you can hold on is the handle. If you are an adult/women, your weight keeps pulling you down. Now, it starts rotating when you are still hanging at the same 100 degree angle position. My experience here, My hands were already tired holding onto the handle. I couldn't balance when it started rotating fast. My legs started flying in one direction.I literally came out of the seat. I was holding onto the side of the horse. My left leg now is on the top of the seat. My right leg somewhere underneath the horse's neck.  People outside started shouting to stop the ride. But no one stopped. The controller guy said the ride is about to end so he can't stop now. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't hold on there for long. Gradually when it started slowing down, i let go and fell down. Guys, If you are obese, please please don't go for this. It seems like that particular horse on which I sat was a defective one. Also, Same thing happened for another girl on that same horse.  If it is a defective one, they should have sealed it, right? And people above 40 felt a bit of dizziness. My husband got a headache too.To sum up, Queensland is a budget friendly amusement park. But some rides are dangerous because of poor maintenance and no guidance."
Queens_Land,Mrudula,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,park,this is the best place for children to enjoy water and manual rides and food courts all over and a green area for park and play area
Queens_Land,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Amazing joyful visit to Queens land,It was an amazing visit to Queen's Land in ECR Road Chennai. The first thing was the route was awesome. Later once we entered queen's Land kids started enjoying the rides. There were crazy rides that even made elders to forget their age and enjoy the surprises of falling from the heights almost (Just kidding) not really. It feels almost we fell. But later we find we are still alive. Crazy horse üê¥ was nice for kids it's just a horse but keeps changing its direction very often and turns around. So the rider has to sit carefully. Bumping cars will be a nice.Note: some of the rides are free and some you may need to pay extra. Exclusive attraction that I found was Ropeway inside the amusement park. Jaint wheel üé° and Columbus are common anywhere. Toy train ride allowed us to have a look around the amusement park. Artificial waterfalls are very attractive for kids. There is one more ride that looks like a round tyre with seats arranged and will be pushed into the streaming water. That takes us in crazy directions. It's a must try ride. It hits the walls and rotates and changes its direction. So it is so interesting. You must try it definitely. 
Queens_Land,eeebvr,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worthspending a day,Price for the visit is good. They allow outside food also. One or two rides is under maintenance but the water rides and waves are very good. Can spend a day very easily. Do not miss the cable car and train.
Queens_Land,Galaxian,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Queensland Rope Car is not safe while getting in,"I had a terrible experience at Queensland while getting into the rope car with my family, there is no safety measurement while getting-in, if we skip to get-in then we will be finished by dropping from top of the tower into the lake (land) (water will not save you). How the newly travelling members know that Rope car will not stop while getting-in? There is sign board, people will have to know only from the members instructions, if they skipped to tell you, then rope car will push you into the lake and you will be finished. For my case they skipped to put the shutter and finally came and pushed the shutter at the near end. I escaped narrowly."
Queens_Land,bharathi,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worst and waste of money,"before i go.. im so excited , but when i reached, Very very bad experience, worst maintenance of water... don't spend your money here, water rides and swimming pool will be girls boys separated. and waiting for long time. pls don't go queensland, i  suggest kishkintha its 100 times better than queensland.5/5/2019 worst day ever..... thpuuuuuu"
Queens_Land,Jay,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Visited yesterday,Doesn't really worth Rs.550 most of the raids have closed stating gone for lunch and most are not been allowed for children. No rope car functions nor booting available. VGP itself far better than Queensland. Don't spend huge money in Queensland rather VGP just cost you Rs.330 with more rides offered that that of QL
Queens_Land,Parthasarathy,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worst Experience,"Not upto the mark. No limitations in allowing people. Not able to complete 15 rides for the whole day. Very huge crowd, some rides are faulty. Need to wait for more than 30min for each ride. Not even a single penny worth if you go with family. Called to Manager to have a word about the experience, he doesn't care about that."
Queens_Land,Natarajan K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,A good place for summer vacation visit,This amusement park is located in Bangalore highway after Poonamallee. Its having lots of different rides for both kids and adults. Swimming pool and wave pool is good but Water rides are very less. An average price to enjoy the complete day in vacation.
Queens_Land,Yabeth Pournercase,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Purpose to visit,Wil this open monday during summer holidays???? We eagerly want to go on monday so plz let me know if anyone know about it surely
Queens_Land,sujeejkums,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,good,really good to see this place to spent whole day with amusement park lovely and enjoyed a lot but water is not clear they should maintained to change water day by day

Queens_Land,Mohammed Fazil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Wonderful theme park but lacks maintanence,"We went as a group of 10 members on Republic Day which was an all day event. What went good ?1. We had received a nice welcome with music and dance since its republic day. 2. All rides are good.3. Everyone will enjoy himalayan water ride. Better change your dresses before you go for this. Since those who are very conscious to remain dry will get wet at the end of ride.4. Food is good in the restaurants inside, which was very well developed when compared to older days.5. Rest rooms are quite descent.What went bad ?1.  First ride is Free Fall but it had a lot of crowd so we moved on and went for small rides. And roller coaster again had a huge crowd so we skipped again. Till then everything was good. Then we stood in queue for Pirate Ship , where a group of 20 members overtook us and went to front of queue and entered without any manners. To our disappointment there was even a security personnel. But he kept his mouth quite. 2. So Queensland needs Maintenance !  3. Queensland need to improve dressing room and shower room which is a mandatory after you soak yourself in that chlorine water.4. Niagara falls will be started in timely manner. But when you wait for it and take a bath you will feel the total Chlorine.So its not worth the wait !"
Queens_Land,vijmail99,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Crowded theme park which needs a lot of maintenance,This is one of the crowded theme park which needs a lot of maintenance. Some of the attractions wee closed. There is a long queue for most of the rides. It takes almost 1.5 hrs to get to it. Needs a lot of renovation
Queens_Land,Thanu HaRi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Awesome Experince,"We had a wonderfull day at this place and we spend more than 8 hours inside the park.a lot of games and activities to do in the park and its a worth of money for that.the speciality is, you have to pay only once to get into the park and you can play any games and activities one time for free ! they will give you a tag to weare in your wrist (its waterproof)."
Queens_Land,Mohi_India,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worth to spend time,Nice place to spend your time.All the rides are good.Take additional dresses if you are planning to spend your time in Artificial water falls and other water sports.
Queens_Land,neeharika b,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worth Visiting!!,We went to Queensland with 5 year old kid.. he enjoyed all the rides especially the cable car..The landscape and greenery are well maintained..All the rides are included with entry ticket.
Queens_Land,NiranjanKumar G,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Dirty Land not Queens land,There‚Äôs a lot difference between Queensland in 2015 and 2018. Very worst experience. Water quality is very worst. Majority of the rides don‚Äôt have proper maintenance. Felt unsafe during rides. Crapy food. Operated the water rides only for half an hour in a day.There is no wave in the wave pool. Swimming pool is green in color. I won‚Äôt recommend it to anyone. Try something else.
Queens_Land,k2velocity,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worst theme park i have seen,"1. Allows only one turn per ride, no paid rides2. Crappy food3. Very bad support staff4. Limited time for those few water rides5. Fake wave pool no waves at all5. Unclean water. The water was green with alge6.  Unclean toilets7. Bad stench all around"
Queens_Land,Ayushi R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Friend's outing,It is a nice place to hangout with friends but only one think I don't like that is girls boys cannot go in the wave pool together
Queens_Land,Ajay Rawat,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Overall good experience for affordable tickets,"Roller Coaster, Centrox and Niagra Falls are amazing. Free Fall Tower and Cable Car are joke. Need to wait a hell lot for Go Kart."
Queens_Land,Muguncjb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Business,Niagara at Chennai,"First of all, dont consider the negative feedbacks posted about Queensland in TripAdvisor.  It could be easily a 5 star rated attraction/theme park at Chennai. The entrance fee is Rs.550 and the ticket is a arm-paper-band with numbers printed on it tied on the visitors right hand. Its a good idea. The very first attraction welcomes is the free fall. A open area lift coming down freely at good speed. After this two or three routes takes you for different excitements. There are roller coaster, centrox, etc etc rides for all ages. Most interesting is the Niagara falls. Its an artificially created hill for about 150-200 ft, from the top of which water is made to fall. They start at 2:00pm and end at 2:30pm.  For ladies separate entry and area under the falls is provided at which the falls height may be around 75-100ft. Next is the Wavepool. This is an artificially created sea wave like water pool. It starts at 2:30pm for 30 minutes. Next is the Swimming pool which seems opened from morning itself. And then Himalayan ride. The theme park also has a cable car which takes you above the park at good height. To add to this is the theme park is full of trees. No separate tickets need to be bought for any ride or activity. Food is allowed. Lot of small eateries and two or three restaurants are there. If it is not sunny, a full day can be spent here. "

Queens_Land,Haridhan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Nice place for a family day out...,"Queensland is a nice choice for a family day trip or group of friends.Dry rides is huge compared to water rides .

Separate areas for male/female.. felt the need for a dedicated kids pool /area for families with kids. Went on a Sunday and water cleanliness is not up to the mark also lot of crowd in pool during 2nd half.Lockers are meant for small luggage to keep valuables(2) Himalayan ride - family can enjoy(3) Niagara falls( worth spending time-consuming separate area for ladies)(4) American wave pool - can enjoy with family- demarcation for gents/ladies.Canteen/food:outside food not allowed, but they never check youüòÄRestaurant/food menu not so great for the taste/price but OK OK.Not much options for veggies.Tickets: 550 for adults/450 for kids (above 2.5fts)Note: Each ride is allowed only once, they put a tick on the arm band after you enter the ride."
Queens_Land,elluru u,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Enjoyment n fun n games ,This is the one of the best place 2 enjoy everyone. So many water games is there 2 enjoy.. Even water falls also there.. It's very  superb superb.. Car games n free fall n mirror house.. It's very worth for 550... We went with office mates n enjoyed well in Queens land. 
Queens_Land,Premsha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,A complete entertainer for any type of groupies!!!,"Queensland is rich in its own way, the count of dry rides is huge and each is some unique characteristics. Specific mention rides are Free Fall, Roller Coster, Centrox...Water rides are minimal but worthy, you have to wait a bit for Himalayan ride but other water rides are easily accessable and gives you a good experience too, especially the Niagara falls(Exactly like a natural one)...Most of the rides are not for children, but they allow!!!They say that no outside food allowed, but they never check you!!!Food is good only at the restaurant which is right at the centre and the only above average food is chicken biryani, sorry vegans no better options for you!!!Its a long journey which gives a good cardio exercise if you try to finish all the rides on time. Only problem is the cleanliness, could have been better!!!"
Queens_Land,drpraj18,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Pathetic,"Though its an amusement park for family and kids, there are hardly 2 or 3 rides where you can go with your family as most of the rids say 'CHILDREN NOT ALLOWED "".Map which was provided at the entrance was useless   .Major problem was language barrier, rude staff.Each ride was allowed only once which was ridiculous. Park is clean with few restaurants which serve simple tasty food at reasonable price.In pool you can not enjoy with your family as it has ladies/ gents section.My 5 year old daughter was refused to accompany with her father due these sections , in absence of life guard near ladies section it was totally unacceptable."
Queens_Land,Abdul wahaab,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Amazing day with kids ,The best theme park in Chennai located in Bangalore highway . The entry ticket has been raised to 550/person. We can enjoy the whole day for that price .lot of rides .lunch is available inside the theme park both veg and non veg . We take our own food.  Kids area and adults area were seperated for convenience
Queens_Land,Priyanka S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Nice place to hang out,"Place is really Gud.... Full of greenery... U enjoy and at the same time,  feel close to the nature... Cable car is really Gud.... Himalayan ride also worth going... The only thing they can improve is to include more rides for children.... Overall nice place to hang out with friends and families"
Queens_Land,Rucha121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good Amusement Park,"Located on outskirts of Chennai, Queens Land is a relatively better theme park as compared to the others present in Chennai. Safety and hygiene standards are heavily compromised in theme parks in India, so we have to exercise extra attention and caution. Although, here, we mainly enjoyed swimming pool and water rides as compared to high-speed or other such snazzy rides. Far off from city, you need to go in own car or hire cab. Entry fees are higher on weekends. Best enjoyment is in groups of more than 5"
Queens_Land,Lilian J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Family fun,Lovely place to chill out with the family. Youngsters have a lot of things to do while the older people have time to relax in a comfortable setting.
Queens_Land,akhilpaleti,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Awesome,The best place to have fun with friends as well as with family also.  Lot of rides to ride and there is rope way which is the second largest way in south india.
Queens_Land,tyag_1984,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Good place for family adventure,"Good activity, cool location, but need to walk a lot for each and every activity. Carry caps. avoid on a sunny day"
Queens_Land,KALKI,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Queensland,Queensland is a no:1 theme park in chennai.In Queensland the entry fees for kids Rs 450 and for adults Rs 550.Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods are available in the food stalls at the Queensland theme park. The food is good and spicy.Snacks and cool drinks are a bit expensive there. You can also take your own food if you want to avoid buying there. Vehicle parking is free.
Queens_Land,tnbalaji90,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Business,Just loved it,We went as a gang of 8 people last March '17. Despite good experience could've been better in terms of water games. Only 2 water games were available with 2-3 slides and jumpers. May be the park was bit exaggerated which made our expectation levels set high. Land games was peerless. On the whole we just loved it.
Queens_Land,Madhavan Sundarraj,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,One day trip with family ,Good place in chennai to have one day outing. But it's too far away (27kms) from city and you need to go with your own transportation. Don't expect any rental services nearby. Some Rides are time based which is frustrating one since the crowd is loaded due to fixed timings.  Veg and non-veg Resturant's are available but not much varieties. 
Queens_Land,dinesh_j84,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Nice Theme Park to enjoy,This is one of the biggest theme parks in Chennai city. The theme park offers variety of land and water games. There are many rides for the kids. Even elders can also while away their time with some of the activities. Eateries are available.
Queens_Land,Praveen S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Crowdless place,"Outside of city, cost is effective compared to VGP and MGM, but only less water games and dry games, entrance is good"
Queens_Land,ravikantpandey,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good pkace,It is located in the outskirts of chennai.. a well maintained and worth visiting place.. the rides are good and the safety is ascertained.. only issue is of the water theme section segregate male and female very rudely .. now family wants to stay together and enjoy it's not possible..  also the water are is small to accommodate the number of people visiting.. this area definitely requires thought to bring up.. overall sat place
Queens_Land,Ansar B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Maintenance not good and can't enter games more than once,"Maintenance is very bad, many rides are under maintenance, you don't feel enjoyment, also you can enter a ride only once, staff are very aggressive. you have to pay for lunch by your self, quality of food is not good."
Queens_Land,Abdul wahaab,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Gud and well known theme park,It's gud and will known theme park situated in Chennai- Bangalore Highway. Gud place to enjoy all kinds of rides. It is compatible for children's and adults frnds couples family and everyone .Lotof rides and fun and gaming zone too ..Cable car is the very interesting ride ... Maintained poorly s the only drawback
Queens_Land,Swetha P,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Poorly maintained ,Think twice before entering into the water games cause it's really dirty also the slide in the women section is so old that ur clothes as well as skin will get scratched and u ll end up getting hurt ... the numbers of rides are less and the duration is poor.U are allowed to sit in one ride only once .. which is so ridiculous.No new rides since ages .
Queens_Land,Gaurav,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Queensland is a worst amusement park in world,This is very wrost park. Why a Couple will visit a amusement park? They visited for fun with their kids. But where in swimming pool or any watershower Female and male are not allowed together. IF they want to go together in Gents pool. They not allowed.. I think A couple should not visited this park if they want to enjoy in swimming pool  etc.... many ride are not operated. One Fun house is family ride but they not allowed for gents in their .

Queens_Land,Afrin S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,theme park,Very good theme park. Lot of rides and water themes are good.Awesome place to go with your group friends.Proper arrangement for girls and boys for water games.
Queens_Land,aiman_zakir,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Horrible water in the water park, pools are divided foren and women","We went to Queensland as the ratings were the highest. We went just for the water park. It was summer and we walked under the scorching sun to reach the water park. Upon reaching there we were instantly disappointed with the smell of chlorine hitting our nose and the filthy water. Since we already reached we went to the changing room which was full of water and hardly any place to keep your stuff to change. THE WATER POOL WAS DIVIDED FOR MEN AND WOMEN SO IT WAS A WASTE TO GO WITH THE FAMILY. ALL THE GOOD SLIDES WERE WITH THE MEN AND WE LADIES WERE STUCK WITH CHILDREN SLIDES AND KNEE DEEP WATER.Our relief came when we went to the American wave pool which had a better quality of water. The Niagara Falls besides, which only work for half an hour is the best part of the whole amusement park. "
Queens_Land,Arun Kumar N,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Not fit for kids,"There were a lot of rides where kids weren't allowed. Out of the 7 hours the theme park was open, the most of the kids rides were shut for close to 3 hours for lunch. Every time we had to walk in hot sun so that we can check if the rides were open yet. Kids were allowed in the water pool only with women. It's ridiculous for kids who come with male members of their family. On top of everything, the water was very very dirty. There were blades/sharp objects in the pool that a kid in my group got his foot cut. The only good thing, the food was not a rip off and good. If this is the best theme park in Chennai, I wonder how bad the other ones are."
Queens_Land,Arun K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good theme park,A good theme park near Chennai. Most of the rides are awesome - especially the artificial waterfalls / water waves area.The rate is also nominal with good parking spaces as well.

Queens_Land,Arun,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Budget friendly and nice amusement park,Queensland is cheapest and best amusement park in Chennai. You get to try a lot of rides. There is no extra charges for the rides unlike other amusement parks. Though you have to start early at eleven when they open and you need an entire day to go around all the rides. There is a big lake and usually in summer it is dry. They allow boating in the lake and you also can enjoy the winch ride which passes above the lake. I have been to Queensland a lot of times and enjoyed every single time.
Queens_Land,deepika d,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Had great time,The entry for adult is now raised to 550.  But reasonable since the rides are more and has many children rides too.  The cable car and himalayan water ride is the must go here.  Water rides are less too good for adventurous people and nature lovers.

Queens_Land,Ranga E,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,Old and tired,I visited this place almost after 10 years. Good thing is almost all the rides are still there. But the place took a beating in the recent cyclone resulting in major loss of greenery. Plus there is no new addition and the rides are all old and tired stuff. Most of them are well worn out despite being functional and mechanically sound. But this is the best theme park in Chennai for kids. There are at least 20 rides for kids below 6 years age and that made it worthwhile.
Queens_Land,Deepak_S_1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Ride Along,i have visited this place twice. No need to worry about the different types of rides. Water rides are also good. Food inside wont be that much good.

Queens_Land,chandurao015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good place to spend time!,It was a good experience. If you are a bit scared of rides then this can a good place for you as it doesnt have that scary rides.
Queens_Land,panicker100,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Amazing experience!!!!!,All of a sudden we came out with a plan of visiting this place and we were not disappointed at all.A very well maintained amusement park.Some exhilarating stuff like the cable car ride(suppose to be the longest in the country) and the thrilling Himalayan water ride is never to be missed.Good rides for small kids too.Wave pool and water slides are good but are open only by 2pm. Hygenic food court serving meals at reasonable cost is an added plus.Only one recommendation please start early and go in groups if you have small kids so that you can take turns to look after the lil ones and enjoy some high adrenaline  pumping  rides for which children's are not allowed
Queens_Land,khan25kareena,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Wonderful Amusement Park,"Go crazy on a roller-coaster,capture the paranomic view on a cable car,splash at the Himalayan water ride or get puzzled at the mirror house.This amusement park has nearly 50 rides.This park is must go with childrens and teenagers."

Queens_Land,Priyanka S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Great Amusement Park,"Queens Land is the Great Amusement Park which is located at Chennai-Bangalore Trunk Road between Sriperumpudhur and Poonamalle.

All buses going to Sriperumpudhur from Chennai stop at Queensland.I have went with my family members and enjoyed a lot.There are some water rides, which operate only from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm and Food and drink are available within the park."

Queens_Land,1143guy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great place to spend a day,"Another Amusement Park nearby Chennai. Queens Land has some good rides. Worth a visit.Requires a lot of travelling, before you reach the place."
Queens_Land,Senthamizh Aras... G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Nice Theme park,One of the nice theme parks in Chennai. Nearby to porur and ponnamelle. Don't expect too much but this theme park will not disappoint u. The rides are interesting. Water sports are too cool. Please start early so that u can enjoy a lot.

Queens_Land,kutyfencer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Chennai Theme Park,"whata place to spend a whole day with friends, family and kids. It was an lovely experience with full of fun in water games."
Queens_Land,whosanenator,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Average at best and ambiguous pricing- verdict poor !!!,"Well it was one of the regular spots for people in early days, now it seems on the decline.Too many cost cutting measures, and the waterfeatures are also timed, so one has to go as per the management's convenience.Some of the rides were rickety and felt dodgy. It has room for improvement and a lot can be expected to go well (if managed properly).They charged child price for a kid less than child age and said her height is more, so we will charge (then why mention an age limit on website)."
Queens_Land,Pathik Shah,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Business,Its' Ok type Experience..!!,"Have visited this place in group. During visit, it was afternoon time on weekdays and most of the rides are not opened. Only One ride was good which is Himalaya. Food in restaurant was good enough.  "
Queens_Land,Oindrila h,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Amusement park with entry fee,"there are categories for the entry free... Lots of rides, for everyone in the family,Toy train is the must ride to cover the full park,crowded always, kids enjoyed"
Queens_Land,SyedIqbal123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Good Place, One day is not enough to cover all","I have visited Queens land in Chennai two times.  It is good amusement park, have lot of rides and games.  Good place to spend with family and friends.  Suitable for all ages from kids to Senior citizens.The rides like 'Himalaya water ride', 'winch' 'Bumper car' and other water rides must never be missed.  They will give a map at start which is also useful.There are some eat outs there for afternoon, but should get there earlier before 1 pm, other wise the food stuff will get over.  We can take home food also.The problem I faced in Queens land both the times is that they have lot of rides and one cannot complete all in a whole day, But we will pay the whole amount.  Eg: You will get queue for most of the famous rides, standing in queue will grab 2-3 hours in one day in total, and rides like Himalayan water ride, winch may take long time, so you will not have time to complete all the rides, even if you want.Swimming pool not good, with lot of dirt.The evening train for exit is also not to be missed, but the problem is, it is once in 45 minutes, and a whole bunch of people will be waiting for it, so one thing you will leave your time to stand in queue OR you will leave that train and walk for about 1 km for exit."
Queens_Land,Medagam Praveen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Value for money,"This one, you will never forget when you visit.one of the best amusement park that you never visited,worth for money,almost 42 rides all were free,himalayan water ride, rope way is main attraction for this park.food available here is good.make an early start i.e, 10:00 AM such that each and every ride is availabe, make sure to complete rides from backwards i.e, 40th ride to 1st ride.make rope way ride between 4:00 PM - 5:00PM such that sunset view of external chennai city is just AWESOME.make himalayan water ride as early as possible other you have to wait for two stairs of quee.everything is just awesome CENTROX, ROLLER COASTER, FREE FALL, STIMULATION THEATRE."

Queens_Land,Varun V,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"QUEENS LAND the worst ever i visited, GENDER BIAS",I HAVE VISITED MANY OF THE AMUSEMENT PARKS WHOLE OVER INDIA BUT DID NOT EVER SEE GENDER BIAS IN THE POOLS. Names are as American wave pool and no one is allowed to enjoy with their female friends and wife's. The worst experience is there are only 2 water rides in that whole park.lose of money and worst experience with the staff.

Queens_Land,Mythreyi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 ‚Ä¢ Business,Adventure seekers - Keep note of!,I've been there multiple times with friends and I've never been bored of it yet. It's a must visit in the summer - to beat the heat thanks to the water rides. The entry fee is worth the rides inside.
Queens_Land,Madanmohan B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,Just Average ! and Very Bad management !,"1.what would have been an average satisfying experience was ruined by bad crowd management, for families it will be a hard time waiting in lines, also i could not  found even a single security person for crowd management for hindering mischief mongers, Girls and Ladies Must be cautious. There is not even a single Contact No displayed for reporting to the management, the operators are busy with operating the rides and turn a deaf ear to peoples complaints.  2.rides like alpine blitz, ship, free fall are good ,each ride time will be 5 mins max but waiting will be atleast 40 mins to 1 hr, if there is more crowd, also for rollercoaster waiting can be upto more than 1.5 hr,3. small kids can have some fun,4. Didnt bother to enter the pool as there was too much crowd."
Queens_Land,Thamim,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Excellent,.friends if u visit Chennai don't miss it... Queensland... its a very big theme park... my family and my self enjoyed a lot.... many rides are there... water rides also is there... but we don't have time to go all the rides... tickets only at rs350.. no extra cost for other rides..
Queens_Land,Arogya Raj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Queen of water rides .,"Visit early morning possible to enjoy each and every rides. Most and fun filled are water rides . Don't miss any rides . Each rides have different time , so before entering take a note of 'Riding Time'. Can be enjoyed by all type of people . And guys don't waste too much time swimming pool like us ,you will miss other rides. if you visited for time passing means take Cable Car because its take more time to end ,but you will surely love the aerial view of that location . Before entering make sure to put your mobile and other stuffs in locker (When u don't have anything in your hand means lot of fun without tension to enjoy all the rides ). Reasonable rates ,thrilling rides . lot of fun . Enjoyable place ."

Queens_Land,SACHINPARMAAR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,ENJOYING TRIP WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS,Nice place to cheer and enjoy. Economical it is. Available for full day and can enjoy until late evening. Good rides and clean water too. Food has to be better. young kids below 5 don't get a chance to enjoy rides as they are ticketless as tickets are not issued for them and they cannot accompany the elders in big rides. They can surely enjoy in the pools.
Queens_Land,Rasal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Fun time,Have been there with my team. And we enjoyed every single ride and started dancing on the stages which were more entertained. Even one TV have interviewed and broadcasted it. Go for it.
