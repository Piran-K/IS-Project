On paying a entrance fee of Rs.10 per person, you can get lost in the life of the two great teachers. The circular meditation room, where Swami Vivekananda stayed for a few days has a beautiful aura. The small book shop is well stocked and all the staff are very friendly."

My mind was not in calm state. Knowing well about her destiny within few days, how do I live calm. But, then, I decided to go to Ramakrishna Mutt, Mylapore on each sundays and sit quiet doing Pranayama.It gave me strength and will power to proceed with my duty. Wonderful place, rather I would say the best place to learn meditation and come out of your worries"
Ramakrishna_Temple,RamGanesan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Couples,The listing confuses people,"Let me start by telling that the Photo on this site is not of Ramakrishna temple but that of Vivekanandha house or the Ice house referred locally.  Please refer back to Vivekanandha house for details on that attraction.  However the Ramakrishna temple is situated in Mylapore, on the RK Mutt road inside the RK Mutt.  This place has a Ramakrishna and a Sharadha devi temple.  An awesome meditation center, a book store and spiritual discourses are the main attractions here."
Ramakrishna_Temple,AyonTalukdar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015,"For one’s own salvation, and for the welfare of the world.","We reached the Mission at around 10.20 am. It was very quiet and peaceful at the mission.A complete contrast to the streets we walked through on the way there. We first visited the temple/prayer hall. It was very peaceful inside. Then we went to meet the founder of the Mission who gave us his blessings and also gave us a copy of the book Karma Yoga. We then had tea  in the dinning hall.After that we were told about the history of the mission in Chengelpet and shown a tour of the garden/farm where we saw a variety of trees including orange, lemon, chicku, coconut and even a nagalingam tree. We were told that the earnings from the farm provided for the mission’s activities of providing schooling to underprivileged children and other activities."
