Ranganatha_Temple,Narayanan V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Thiruneelamalai--A Great Tetra Avathar,"The village of Thiruneermalai near Pallavaram is important to Vishnu devotees as ancient temples of this deity are located here.. It is also called as Nadu Naatu Srirangam and is one of the 108 divyadesam.At the base of Thiruneermalai hill is a temple for  Neervanna Perumal who is in a standing posture. The temple atop the hill which can be reached by climbing about 250 steps, and many elders also climb with spirits easilyThe main one is for Lord Ranganatha, reclining on the serpent Adisesha and facing South with  Sridevi and Bhudevi  Thayaars near the feet. The other deities on the hill-top are  Trivikrama (seen in the walking pose), Narasimha (in the seated posture) and Goddess Lakshmi, enshrined as Ranaganayaki Thayar, the consort of Ranganatha.In the base temple there is a slogan "" Narayanan ingu ninraan irunthaan nadanthaan kidanthaan"" implies Lord vishnu lives here in four poses.An important feature of Thiruneermalai is that Vishnu is seen here in four poses — standing (as Neervanna Perumal), seated (as Narasimha), reclining (as Ranganatha) and walking (as Trivikrama or Ulagalanda Perumal). While the procession deity (utsava murti) in most Vishnu temples is generally worshipped in front of the main idol, in the hill-top shrine, only the large central deity is seen and His processional idol Azhagia Manavalar is inside the temple at the foothills.Moolavar (Nadandhaan) – Thrivikraman ( Vamana) seen in standing posture facing east.Reminding the Vamanavathara (Dwarf incarnation), the Lord is in the walking order asking where to place his third step after measuring all the worlds in two steps . The left leg is lifted up to shoulder level unlike in Kanchipuram and Tirukoilur where it is the right leg lifted to 90 degrees .Moolavar (Irundhaan) - Saantha Narasimhan seen in seated posture facing east.Considering the appeal of boy Prahlada who was afraid of his fury, the Lord appears in a calm and pleasant mood as Shantanarasimha and also as Balanarasimha. (There is a small moolavar with prahaladha kept in front of the main lord about 1 foot tall) The lord is welcoming bhaktas with the left hand and the right hand shows abayam Yesterday when I visited the temple there was chariot pulling of Neervannaperumaal along the neighbouring streets.People celebrate this event welcoming Neervannaperumal by decorating their house front side with Rangoli along the streets.The local residents celebrate the event with light music and giant speakers renting the air.This temple is a divyadesam and also a swayambhu kshetram.I noted this event in my calendar with a hope to visit the temple again next year on the same day. You can also see lot of flights flying very close to the hills."
Ranganatha_Temple,Karthik R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Divya Desam temple,"Shri Rangantha Temple at Thiruneermalai is on the 108 Divya Desam temples. The temple has 4 sanctums of Lord Vishnu as Perumal. One in the base of the hill and 3 over the hill in 3 different postures - Standing, sitting and reclining positions. It takes around 1 to 1:30 hours for relaxed visiting of all these sanctums, climbing up the hill and down. The steps are not so steep and elders can climb with patience.Parking area is available without parking fee. Small shops are available all around."
Ranganatha_Temple,SubashSL,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,A Divyadesam you cannot miss,"At the outset let me inform that you need to visit the temple at the bottom of the hill (Neer Vanna Perumal, Nindran (standing pose) before climbing the hill to visit the ""Svayambu Shrine"" (reclining pose) where you'll also see the lord in Irundan (sitting), Nadanthan (walking) and Kadandan (crossing) poses. The temple is easily accessible from the GST Road near Pallavaram. Actually in Google Maps it looks very close to the Kundrathur Murugan temple too and so you can plan to visit both these temples in one go. The steps aren't many or very steep but do carry water as they can run you out of breath, particularly in hot summer. Watch out for monkeys though they aren't much of a bother here at this temple. On Sundays the temple is open for longer durations than other days. "
