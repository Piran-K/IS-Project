San_Thome_Church,TSinParis,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Interesting Enough,"Coming from Europe where there are so many beautiful churches and cathedrals, this one seems a bit ordinary.   However, in a city that does not really have too many stellar tourist attractions, this church is on the must-see list.   Moreover, it is interesting to note that Indian Catholics seem much more devout than European ones."
San_Thome_Church,TwinMamaNYC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Beautiful and interesting Church,"Come to see the Church, where you will see Jesus on the cross robed in a distinctly Indian way.

San_Thome_Church,SingaporeGirl,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Historical church, home of the St. Thomas Christians","Much larger than one might expect with exhibition halls and venues, including a small snack shop, in addition to the main church. The underground 'crypt' with a relic of St. Thomas had a lovely very quiet atmosphere where many travellers and visitors stopped for a silent prayer. The apostle Thomas is not buried here, however, as the Portuguese apparently sent his body back to Portugal, but a small relic was kept. St. Francis visited the site in 1541 adding to its historicity. Plan a 30-minute visit. When we were there, we found a wedding in process--a real bonus!"

San_Thome_Church,Mikan999,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Attractive Basilica,"This church is dedicated to Saint Thomas (the doubting Thomas of Jesus’ disciples) and has a beautiful tranquil ambience. The outside is painted pure white and is a fantastic contrast with the deep blue of a sunny Chennai day. Inside the decor is quite plain but also spiritual. Signs say no photography inside but most Indian visitors were happily taking photos. Look closely at the framed paintings of the disciples on the walls - they are portrayed as if they were Bollywood stars. You have to go behind the church to enter the tomb of Thomas, even quieter and more spiritual. There is a small museum there too. We visited This Catholic church and Kapaleeshwarar Hindu temple in the same morning - it is fascinating to contrast and compare how the two religions have built and use their places of worship just 500m apart."

San_Thome_Church,Ronan P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"Very beautiful, surprisingly moving","I hadn't intended to visit the church, but I had hired a driver who insisted on taking me there on the way to a Hindu Temple. I am very glad he did. This church is one of only three in the world to hold the remains of one of the original disciples, the others being St Peters in Rome, and Santiago de Compostela.St Thomas, he who doubted, was martyred in India, and his remains are held here. They have the lance heaad which killed him. Oh, I know the cynics will say ""I thought they only came in packs of twelve"", but it is very moving to explore the little museum, the basement chapel where the tomb is, and the church itself, a cool, beautiful oasis of peace in the middle of the bustle of Chennai. The original church was builtby Persian Christians in the 10th Century, but this fell into disrepair five hundred years later, so the Portugese built a church on the current site to hold the tomb in 1522. This building is from 1896, but the feeling of such long continuity remains. I loved visiting it, and found it very moving, more so than I had imagined."
San_Thome_Church,Richard,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Good visit to this Church,"I didn't know until recently that Thomas, He who has been given sainthood by the Catholic church and an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, had visited India. I was pleased to visit and see genuine worshipers upholding their faith in Christ.  I did wonder what was in the safe in the wall and why it was open and highlighted.  I saws a group of people doing morning exercises in the yard. that was interesting to see at a church.  What was also interesting was the presence of a moderately large police contingent at the site. Hmmm.. "

It's first of all situated in one of the nicest area in Chennai, Mylapore. The Church is built on the grave of St.Thomas, a disciple of Jesus Christ. There arr only three churches in the world built on the grave of the disciples of Jesus and Santhome is one among them. A relic of St.Thomas is kept in the underground and a musuem is also there which depicts the old and traditional stories and the things. The Church has a great history behind. There is also a pole of St.Thomas behind the Church which was made thanking God for saving Santhome from the tsunami,2004."
San_Thome_Church,kurien2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,Three Cathedrals in the world supposedly built over the tomb of apostles St.Peter's St.James  and Santhome,Legend has it that among the 12 disciples st.Thomas landed up in India and lived in St.Thomas Mount and buried in Santhome the Portugese quarter in Madras. The three disciples over whose tombs Cathedrals have been built are St.Peter at Rome St.James in Spain and Santhome for St.Thomas. The fact that there is a 400 year gap between the time Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross to the time St.Thomas landed up at Santhome. However the interesting feature is this is one cross with Christ fully clothed standing in a lotus with two peacocks on either side

It is worth attending a Sunday morning service and planning a short drive along the Marina beach and to a nice restaurant for lunch."
San_Thome_Church,Ganesh K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Spoiled the nature,Famous church located on the sea shore.

Dust and garbage are dumped in around the church.small shops are occupying the entrance and it's very tough to enter. Because of this traffics are jammed. Raw fish vendor's are selling their products very nearby area's so stinky smell. Police corporation and the church management should take action to keep the decorum of the dividend place in peaceful.

It was Sunday morning and it was delightful to find ourselves at the back of the congregation singing hymns and saying prayers.  Just like home except for the wonderful mix of nationalities here.

The church is nearing the end of some restoration work and very very pretty."
San_Thome_Church,hurricanekatrinarule,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,On a tour,This was very busy.  You are required to remove your shoes and leave them in a cupboard.  You have to walk down stairs into a basement section.  Photos are not allowed.  When you get to the tomb a lady tells you a few words about it.  You are then free to collect shoes and look in the museum.  This is probably of more interest to people who are religious.

San_Thome_Church,Rasputin21,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,A Roman Catholic church honoring St Thomas,"San Thome as it is known, is a pristine white church among the decaying Madras surroundings.  Unfortunately, it is currently being renovated and is covered in scaffolding making photography difficult.  On the left as you enter the grounds is a very realistic and well maintained grotto with luxurious foliage.  There is limited parking available.The current church was built in the 16th Century by the Portuguese.  It was built to contain the martyred remains of St Thomas the Apostle.  It must have been quite a feat for him to have travelled so far  in AD 52.  He was martyred on St Thomas' Mount and a diorama of the martyrdom is displayed in the crypt.The Church was rebuilt by the British in 1893.  The spire reaches a height of 155ft.The Portuguese influence is confirmed by the brass panels identifying the various priests of the church.  Even if they had English names, they were prefixed by ""Dom"".One enters the church through the side entrance and is immediately entranced by the beautiful gold chandeliers.  On the right is the simple choir accessed from the entrance.  To the left is the main altar with large statues of various saints.  What is unusual is that there are pews in the altar area as well.   To the right is the chapel of the Virgin of Mylapore where the Virgin is dressed in a blue sari.On the left is the Holy Sacrament Chapel.  Behind the church is a building that contains a museum and the crypt.  One has to remove one's shoes and climb down the stairs to the crypt.  No photography is allowed in the crypt.  Although the museum is on the ground floor one has to remove one's shoes to enter there too!Do visit and give a donation to the upkeep of this wonderful church."

The church is built over the burial site of St Thomas. The crypt holds a plastic model of St Thomas and on the wall to the right of it is a glass case with a slither of his finger bone is in the middle. A cool and quiet place to pray or contemplate.

His offices of the east India company nearby. Plaques on the walls to soldiers and their families who died young so far from home.well kept and worth a visit. We saw so many impressive buildings in Chennai and New Delhi that the British built before independence.
