Saravana_Stores,Muguncjb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,for all home needs,"Visited this Saravana Stores branch once few months back. Saravana stores has several branches from the same family group but under different ownership. This particular store is located on a narrow Purasawalkam High road but buses run through the road and stop in front of the stores on one direction. Saravana stores is different from malls. Here one can buy each and every items for home needs at affordable or even cheap prices. In a mall as the shops are run by different owners or branded companies, one may not get all home needs or may not get at affordable price. This is where Saravana stores differs and pulls the crowd. All their stores are multistoryed up to 7-9 levels with each level offering different products."

Saravana_Stores,Jivi_Jebaraj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Price is not that cheap as before,Those the prices were very competitive but now due to overheads and other expansion prices are not that cheap. But it is easy to get most of the stuff under one roof. Buy vegetables in the morning to avoid rush. The canteen is very cheap. 
Saravana_Stores,AKTHAKUR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,NOT AS  GOOD AS POTHYS FOR VARIETY BUT DO NOT MISS THE KITCHEN SECTION FOR LARGE VARIETY OF UTENSILS,"They have branches all over chennai but the usman road t nagar branch is big and worth a visit.Not as big as pothys hypermarket in terms of variety but  their kitchen section is recommended for utensils and kitchen items.The variety is very good at affordable prices.Local Staff is not well versed with english as they speak only tamil language.you may contact nepali staff working there as they are conversant in tamil and english and can translate to help you.Other than english speaking issue the staff is helpful and attentive, Beware of the ladies sales staff at saree section.They are a bunch of lazy staff not interested in showing .They have very bad attitude of buy take or leave whatever is there.the men sales staff in saree section are helpful .There is only one lift so waiting time for lift is very high with crowds going there in dozens to buy groceries vegetables and kitchen items these floors are heavily crowded at all times.Still recommend a visit especially for the kitchen section.Prices are reasonable .Recommend atleast 1-2 hrs to cover all the floors."
Saravana_Stores,bgonner,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Wide variety of items,"Our tour group visited this store a few days before we headed back to the U. S.  The store has a lot to choose from with what seemed to me to be reasonable prices.  We recognized some of the items as being the same or similar to what we found at outside vendors, but in a more organized and tidy environment.  The elevator options are a bit confusing, with one side going to odd numbered floors and the other going to even numbered floors.  We ended up using the stairs as the elevators were often crowded and the wait time seemed long.My husband and I purchased a few hair items for our daughter, along with some earrings and bracelets.  I purchased a stainless steel masala dabba which seemed of nice quality and weight.  It included a spoon and seven containers; a cover with a clear plastic piece was nice, to be able to see the spices once they are placed in the dabba.  The checkout process was interesting.  You start at one end where someone enters all the purchases into a register, and then go to another person who seemingly checks everything and then gives you a receipt, which you hand to the next person, who seems to check everything once again, and then put the items in a bag.  I'm not clear why they employ such a labor intensive process; I guess they have their reasons.  When we arrived at a different floor with the bag containing the dabba, we were motioned over to an area where they sealed our bag shut.  Also interesting was that at a point where we were about to get our receipt, a young lady came by with a tray, some metal cups, and tea.  The check-out staff were served tea.  We knew tea time in India is very important, but had never seen it at a shopping center.  Even for people at work, everything seems to stop for tea.  The British influence is very obvious!Although our tour guide cautioned us to watch our bags, for men to put their wallet in a front pocket, and for anyone with a backpack to carry it in front of them, I didn't feel threatened in the store."
Saravana_Stores,Goutham Mannuru,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,"Shopping Experience A+, Delivery Experience F","Shopping at this Store is great, Warm Welcoming Staff and great Support . Was very happy to shop some furniture, But was not delivered on time it has already been 2 days past the delivery time , and the numbers they provide on the Bills is a joke they would randomly direct you to someone else who does not attend the phone. Cheap to buy but the waiting time is too much, I don't think  I will ever go there again. "
Saravana_Stores,Vinod500,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Great Shopping,"This is an amazing retail chain with several stores in Chennai and other towns in Tamil Nadu. We regularly visit their T' Nagar store on Ranganathan Street. Each store has 5 or more floors, with additional mezzanine floors.  They cover textiles, garments, household items, electronics, luggage, etc. They have a  wide range of goods and prices are usually below MRP. We go at 9.30 am when the store opens, as it gets quite crowded later. They have branded and unbranded items. Many of the sales persons are from North and East India. Speaking to them in their language or in Hindi, will illicit a better response from them. Ready made garments can be altered for free, by their tailors in the basement. They are very fast.There is a fruit section on the 5th floor with an inexpensive cafeteria too. Patience and perseverance are required if one is looking for a specific item, as there is such a variety."
Saravana_Stores,Kathleen P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,So Many Floors So Little Time!,"Oh what a place it is! I was looking for jewelry for a friend to dress up formally. This was the place I was brought to. Did I find what I was looking for? I sure did, plus I walked out with a couple more things that I didn’t know I needed. The store was also giving out Christmas gifts to shoppers so we waited in line and I ended up with a 2019 calendar and a mental covered pot. All for shopping there, plus a great reusable bag that will advertise for them. Unfortunately I live in Belarus so it is a distance to get there."
Saravana_Stores,Arjun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Branded items at low price,Saravana stores has a wide range of branded items at lower rate than the mrp rate.there is huge collection of product's
Saravana_Stores,Georgio Valentino Rayala,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Terrible crowds and horrible collection,I was staying in a Air bnb flat for seven days. I decided to go grocery shopping and asked my host for suggestion. He suggested this place and I visited this place along with a friend at 6 pm.It looked huge from outside with many floors and only when we entered its gate did we realize the mistake we made. Every inch of the mall is filled with crazy crowds and there is no space even to walk. We saw their collection of clothes which are cheap and old style.There is a huge queue near the grocery section and we decided to skip shopping as it would have taken at least 30 minutes for us to get billing done. There is also a huge queue to get on to the lift and we decided to take stairs to rush out of this mall. It is one of my most terrible shopping mall experiences.
Saravana_Stores,Safari48327071874,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,We are not going to the shop forever,The worst stores I ever saw. Worst customer service they don't have anything proper. Worst worst ever
Saravana_Stores,Srinatha Malalasekera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Must Visit Shop If You are Going for Shopping to Chennai,"An amazing place with 8 floors. you can buy everything in this shop. The staff are very friendly. I have to mention Miss Sarala who was with us during our entire shopping time, briefing us what to buy and providing all the information necessary. I wish the management of the stores would recognize Sarala for her outstanding customer service. You can buy any product form this store without rustifying outside at a cheaper price. A must visit for any shopper if you are visiting Chenaai. Only issue I observed was that the Restaurant area was smaller and cannot accomodate the large crowds that flock the area during the lunch time. Also kindly improve the standards of washrooms as they are in a bad status."
Saravana_Stores,Genie G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,Great place to shop and eat but big crowd on weekends,"The restaurant on the top floor has got good food and this place has everything, clothes, groceries, home goods, you name it!

Saravana_Stores,BimalDavid,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Common Man's Shopping Mall,"Only one word ""Super Cheap"". In each and every product, be it priced at Rs 2 as MRP, Saravana will give you some discount. Some products are even cheaper than for what it is sold in streets. Range of products? Just go and see once! You are buying most affordable product in a comfortable A/c mart. You get hungry while shopping, cafeteria is also super cheap and they serve you quality food. The choice of food is wide, like from Biryanis, fried rices, chats, snacks, ice creams, sweets, tea coffee, fresh fruit juices. You get nature's call? They have well maintained restrooms. What else do you want?"

Saravana_Stores,mdkhaleel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,Shopping with a difference ,"       The newly opened Saravana store at Sholinganallur is a boon to the residents of OMR & ECR. It is on the main Rajiv Gandhi Salai and easily accessible. It gives a great shopping experience. There are six floors for shopping whatever you need. Ground Floor has gold show room. There is also a separate vegetable & Fruit Shop. In the first floor is a ladies saree and chuddidhar section. In the second floor is ladies ready made section. The third floor is earmarked for Branded cosmetics, hand bags, travel bags, school bags, gents shoes & chappals, ladies chappals & shoes etc. Fourth floor consists of all Home appliances, vessels & plastic items. Fifth floor has Gents ready made items & cloth material and lastly the sixth floor has Home appliances & furniture. There are escalators & lifts for moving to different floors. Some sections are still under construction and the shop is not fully functional. It will take some time to go for it. The items vary from budget to high end. It will definitely suit all pockets. There is shortage of staff and billing takes much time particularly during peak hour in the evenings & on holidays. Good place to shop with family & children and no doubt caters to them all. Better to avoid peak time for hassle free shipping."

Sales people are much more knowledgeable than reliance digital or tata croma store, only catch is you need to know the local language.There will be lot of crowd and it may seem chaotic, but they are organized in their own way and do a brisk business.We dont buy dress materials here, as its way to crowded for my taste. Try it once you might like it."
Saravana_Stores,Sangeetha Vikram,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,"Famous shopping maal at Chennai, but with poor maintenance","I have been to Saravana Stores at T.Nagar, Pondy Bazaar, Chrompet etc., many times for Shopping. We can purchase commodities at any rate. Separate floors were available for various sections like Clothing, Dresses for Kids, Pro-visionaries, Food Items etc., But it will be extremely crowded always, we have to rush along with the crowd to do Shopping.Billing is another tedious task. Maintenance should be improved."
Saravana_Stores,Radhu K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Worst place for shopping,"Worst place for shopping. Extermely rude staff. Rudeness to the core. They cant speak any other language other than tamil. Dont expect any sort of professionallism , be it staffs dressing, language, behaviour....Food court worst.This stores is typically suitable for people who want cheaper, non brand products "
Saravana_Stores,Michelle,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,Enter this shopping mall at your own risk!,"A shopping mall with inexpensive rates: Saravana Stores is a huge mall on purasawakkam road, known for its inexpensive rates and vast range of items. There are about nine floors or more and have a variety of things ranging from appliances, groceries, furniture etc. Our Experience as a family: We visited Saravana Stores (Purasawakkam branch) as a family of four with one child after much hesitation on account of the mixed reviews we had heard - some loved the rates and recommended it and others warned us to stay away from the place.  However, we were definitely not prepared for the shopping experience. It is a known fact that the place is very crowded so we picked the afternoon so it was fairly crowded. The first thing that greets you is the absolute rudeness of the staff (imagine people herding cattle) at every point. Ignore that and there is a price to pay as we found out. The basement is where we chose to go first simply because we did not have to stand for the elevator as there were about 25 people waiting to get it. The girls and ladies in blue and white order you around telling you what to do. At one narrow passage, there was a young girl (Chandramati) who took a crumpled packed and asked that I put my bag/purse (about 6 x 4 n inches) there. This puzzled me as I could not understand why I would have to give my money and original documents (which was in the bag) to be put into a crumpled bag. No one explained but the staff opposite told her to let me go. She did and I went on only to turn back and see her venting her rage by throwing the packet on the floor in disgust. What she did not realize was that my whole family was following behind and was witness to the unprovoked rage and they objected to the display of anger for no sensible reason. It was very unsettling and quite a traumatic experience given that we come from a suburb where customers are treated with some basic dignity. A passing shopper then told me that this was the way the staff usually behaved and the attitude they displayed was as though they owned all the things in there (quite a consolation indeed!!)  We spoke to the manager, who was very polite and understanding and he called for her and spoke/reprimanded her (in private) but nevertheless, with our traumatic personal experience, it will mean that the first time we walked in there would also become our very last time. Should you shop here? If you are a person/family who is fine/comfortable with crowds, the heat (no air conditioning seemed to be on when we went) and is prepared for experiences like this, this place would be good to go to as it has all things at a lesser rate all under one roof. However, I am not sure of the quality of the items as I have never had the opportunity to enter in peace and make a purchase."
