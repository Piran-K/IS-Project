Sathyam_Cinemas,Dr Javed Rasheed,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Sheer Nostalgia ,"Though I don‚Äôt go the movies much now and when I do it‚Äôs occasionally but this theatre brings back a lot of old memories of my medical student days.I first visited this theatre in August 1975 when the iconic blockbuster movie ‚Äú Sholay ‚Äú was released and coincidentally I joined my MBBS  in Madras Medical College in the same month and have seen a lot of blockbuster movies in that theatre in my student days.Going back there was sheer nostalgia though it had three theatres then with Sathyam as the main complex.These days are days of Multiplex and complexes with a lot of focus on eatables & snacks and it‚Äôs a costly affair especially in some theatres that offer you gold class but going down the memory lane those days the ticket then seemed like pittance when compared to the present trends and changing times of availability,affordability and luxury.Those were days when home theatres were not there neither Netflix or Amazon Prime ! It was booking ( not on line ) no movie apps on cell phones ( there were no cell phones then almost 45 years ago when one went with friends or the family to enjoy a movie with ones loved ones in a movie theatre which was a sheer delightful experience especially if the movie was good as one enjoyed the ambience experience,company... it was indeed sheer delight !Dr.Javed Rasheed"

Sathyam_Cinemas,DSKTraveller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,For a comfortable movie watching experience,"Sathyam Cinemas are meant for those looking forward to a comfortable movie watching experience. The movie halls are well maintained and the eating options are of high quality. Sathyam Cinemas in Royapettah is the parent theatre of the Sathyam group (now purchased by PVR) in Chennai. Unlike its other cinema halls located in the Express Avenue and Forum Vijaya Mall, this is located in a slightly congested locality. However, the movie halls are clean and offer a good experience for the movie goer. The food sold in the canteen is of good quality. Some of the favourite items include the cream doughnut, vegetable puffs and chat items. For those who love popcorn, their varieties are the best. Only thing is you have to buy those big tubs of popcorn unlike the earlier days when they would serve in smaller quantities. The ID restaurant is also located inside the complex. Parking of vehicles, especially cars, is quite a task though. It is generally recommended that you reach there early if you want a parking space."

Sathyam_Cinemas,Aparna R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,The best place for a movie watching experience in the heart of Chennai,"Being not much of a movie goer, if I need to watch a movie, then  I would watch one , only if there are shows either  in Sathyam cinemas or at Escape. right from entering the car park, until you find your seat, one is always welcomed by courteous staff.  As for this particular visit, since the show had begun with the screening of advertisements, due to whihc the lights had already dimmed out, we struggled our way to our seats as there was no, numbering. Luckily we could locate our rows easily. However, one had to quickly count and check if we were going towards are reserved seats only. I wish the seats had numbers displayed and glowing in the dark.We had  in the past had  the snacks &  beverages delivered to our seats, but I dont seem to see that practice anymore, I wonder why? "

Sathyam_Cinemas,umang p,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Weekend program,"One of the best in Chennai. The parking is cheap as well probably because it‚Äôs their own place and they aren‚Äôt renting the place out but it‚Äôs a huge plus for people who head to the theatre a lot. The seating is good and the popcorn is the best I‚Äôve had (especially the topping flavors).The parking lot is huge which is a plus but the token system for the parking is not a good one, especially when you are heading out after the movie.There is a cafe as well within the same premise including a video arcade. Overall a very good experience, this place."

There have been good improvements. The walkway into the hall is broad; the steps are broad and well lit. The seats are comfortable. The acoustics were excellent. Only the snacks like popcorn have become expensive.  The row car park is functional but if after the movie, one car gets delayed or if a car owner wants to leave in the middle of the movie, it becomes impossible to leave."

Sathyam_Cinemas,Vishal Balwani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A nice place to unwind after a day‚Äôs work,Cinemas in Chennai are not a thing to be taken lightly because the local crowd will always be thronging over to cinema halls and you won‚Äôt find vacant seats unless you book tickets in advance. Also to be noted here is that the pricing of tickets in Chennai theatres is done by the government and the prices are moderate. So this gives another reason for the theatres to be completely booked most of the time. This one is a good theatre. The seats are comfortable and there is parking space available too.

This was not expected of a high class theatre. A word about lighting.  In the dim light before the start of the film, people especially elders, found it difficult to go to their seats.

Sathyam_Cinemas,Sindhuja N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Is there a better cinemas in town?! ,"Satyam has created its own benchmark in this city. The sound quality, screen clarity, service, ambience.. What not, satyam brings you everything. The best part is they provide you a home feeling giving out blankets when needed, whatspp-ing them if any group or individual is creating disturbance and also have installed sanitary napkins dispenser which i would say the best move any cinemas can provide. A big thumbs up to the best cinemas! "
Sathyam_Cinemas,jasjas867,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Too crowded,"Though the management is trying its best, the crowd seems too overwhelming. Pushing and jumping queues is a common sight. Not much of security measures. The crowd seems a bunch of unruly college kids who do not even bother to throw the popcorn tubs or coke cups in the bin.the sign boards for different screens seem confusing. All in all, not worth for a family outing."
Sathyam_Cinemas,Girija Muralidharan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Enjoyed the Hindi film Hitchki.,"Sathyam Theatres took over the old dilapidated Thyagaraja cinema theatre in LB road Adyar some years back. Since then the theatre is well maintened , there are only two screens one in  down floor and one in 1st floor. The food counter has many delicious items to choose from. The only problem in this complex is, the washroom for ladies is upstairs. Hope the authorities do something about this.  As we live in Adyar we find this the most convenient theatre to go and watch movies at a short notice. I certainly need to mention about the efficiency and the helpful nature of the  staff who regulate the traffic inside the theatre compound. They guide you to park the car very well.  After the show the cars glide out of the compound effortlessly."
Sathyam_Cinemas,Lavanya J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Keeping up with Times,"Sathyam theatre has ensured they upkeep with customers demands. Have been in existence for more than two decades and ever since I remember this place has only gone up in standards. The food across all their chain of theaters has been excellent and they ensure cleanliness and hygiene. Recently their parking rates have come down too. There are restaurants, gaming and bowling besides cinema under one roof. Hope they continue to maintain their high standards "
Sathyam_Cinemas,vasuprofiles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Satyam Cinemas - a lovely place to watch a movie,I had been to Satyam many times. I have been going there since more than a decade. Back then the parking was different than what it is now. Anyways that is not the point of discussion now. We'll a cool place to watch a movie. There are many screens and is in the heart of the city. The seating and arrangement are good. The food and beverages are expensive but it is the same in every mall. That wouldnt be a bad idea to watch a movie there.

Sathyam_Cinemas,Free@will,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Watched 15.17 to Paris. ,"Had been here to watch an English movie, 3.30 pm show. At the booking counter one doesn't get the option to choose the seats. The girl at the counter couldn't speak or understand much English. Once inside the screening hall the ambience was nice. The sound effects were outstanding. Surprisingly, for an afternoon show English movie each ticket cost 190 bucks approx. Barely 10 people were in. "
