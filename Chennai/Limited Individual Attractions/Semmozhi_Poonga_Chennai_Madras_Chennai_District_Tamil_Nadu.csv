There is no proper response from anyone who is working there especially Chettan in ticket counter. He is very roude to public and he doesn't know how to behave others.

Totally waste of money and time. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

Semmozhi_Poonga,iolo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Couples,A little oasis,"Such beautiful green planting in the middle of noisy polluting traffic it a welcoming vision from our hotel, we thought weâ€™d walk there but let me warn you you take your life in your hands with the speeding traffic as the pavements are blocked off in most parts and when you see the park there is no indication where the entrance is ! Inside it is beautifully laid out with  large healthy plants, getting around using a wheelchair is quite tricky as the paving is not laid well, lunch was good in the food area and very inexpensive.This is a place thatâ€™s very popular with photographers so be prepared to be told to get out of the way ! Some people donâ€™t know please and thank you ... There were a lot of police people there too lounging around everywhere  which seemed odd ?I would have liked to have seen a gift shop if only to buy a map or read about the garden. We would love to visit in a different season to see how it looks."

At that time, it was highly praised by one and all - for its scenic beauty and new varieties of plants and shrubs, specifically selected for this Poonga (park). Now after many years, we visited this park again on 09.02.2018 Saturday evening.I personally remember during late 1980s and 1990s, we used to hang out in this place- at that it was Woodlands Hotel's Drive-in- restaurant - only one of its kind on those days. I think even now, no such drive-in restaurant available in Chennai. We can enjoy food just relaxing in our car/bike. Many celebrates can be seen during evening . Many changes happened now and Govt is trying to revive it's original beauty. Lot of renovation and maintenance work going on now. Good parking facility for two wheelers and few cars. Good crowd when we visited there, being weekend. Small canteen with Aavin parlour, chat items and coffee-tea, next to children play area. Parking rates - 2 wheeler Rs.15.00 and for car Rs.40.00. Poonga is open from 10.00 am to 9.00 pm, but ticket counter closes by 7.00 pm. Nominal entrance fee is collected.For those who prefer regular morning walk, park is open from 6.00 am to 8.00 am and one has to get monthly entry pass on payment of fees.

Semmozhi_Poonga,Jaffathecat1,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 â€¢ Couples,Too small to call a Botanical garden,Whilst pleasant enough to walk around this place is very small and cannot be regarded as a Botanical garden really. It's surrounded on 3 sides by busy roads so lacks any peace & tranquillity. If you want beautiful gardens you're better off visiting the Theosophical Society in Adyar
Semmozhi_Poonga,Jane S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 â€¢ Family,Quiet place inside city,"we went there because it was quite near the hotel we were staying. You need to take ticket to enter the park.The greenery is impressive and its a quite place to spend time away from the hot city. For the Chennaites, its a getaway place and a nice park to walk. Not advised for those who wish to tour Chennai.The maintenance was also very poor.  The fountains and ponds were dry. So, it looked nothing like how it was in the photos."

The entrance especially is awesome and artistically designed, but the interiors do not keep up that tempo. A lot of ferns and crotons, but could do with more flowering plants. Not much enhancements or additions since its inauguration a few years back."
Semmozhi_Poonga,BharatGupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Family,Greenery between concrete jungle,This park is next to US consulate. You need to purchase a ticket to enter it.There are swings for the kids and benches spread across the park.Provides some calmness in midst of the city life.

The place is best for taking photo and for artists to sit and draw. There is a also small canteen inside. It has good shade so that one can visit even during afternoon hours. A small pond is at the end of the park but its not for playing."

Semmozhi_Poonga,mardev1,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 â€¢ Couples,"Park near Gemini bridge, Mt. Road","Nice place in the heart of Chennai city for a stroll in the morning or to spend your leisure time in the evening simply sitting on the benches. Good ambience & well maintained. Suited for families with kids, couples & elderly. Ideal time to visit would be from Sep to Mar, when the ponds are full and there is greenery around."
Semmozhi_Poonga,RamGanesan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,A calm place right in the middle of the city,"This place used to house the Legendary Drive in Woodlands hotel.  After the lease contract was over the Government of Tamil Nadu took over the land and build this park.  Just next to the US Consulate, the ever busy Cathedral and Anna Flyover it provides a break from the noise and pollution.  One can definitely spend 2 to 3 hours at peace in this place which is full of trees and shade.  Though designed to be a wonderful garden, it lacks maintenance and upkeep thanks to successive changing governments.  A nominal entry fee of INR 15 is charged at the entrance.  Enough parking space is a welcome thing, which is charged separately.  For those who want to visit the place, I suggest going there on weekdays and no-holidays to enjoy the peaceful set up.  Of course if someone is near the cathedral road and does not want to spend time in the scotching heat, this is the place to go."
Semmozhi_Poonga,PriyaV1,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 â€¢ Family,Quite park in the middle of the hubbub,"Very quiet place. Lots of exotic plants and trees. The entry fee is very low. The park benches are occupied by young couples mostly. The Saravana Bhavan inside the park is an unnecessary addition, in my humble opinion. It creates a lot of plastic and paper waste which just litters the park and ruins the ambiance.I visited over 2 years ago but I hear that the plight of the park is worse now."
Semmozhi_Poonga,ChinCho,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 â€¢ Couples,Strictly ok..,"Visited this place as it was close to the hotel in which we were staying. The place is supposed to be a botanical garden but not many species of flora and fauna are present. We visited this place on a Sunday evening and therefore it was very crowded.It is full of greenery and can provide you many location for some great photographs. The place has a paid parking and also has entrance fee of Rs.15/- per person and also a small fee for camera.Though it is a nice garden amidst concrete jungle it can be visited only if you have some spare time at hand,"
Semmozhi_Poonga,shwetado,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,Not good for solo trip,"Was here alone reading the google reivews that this place is good for nature lovers and all.

Food court is ok. Shades are to be icnreased with more trees. Maintenance is ok. I can say this is much better than Natesan , Panagal kind of parks. What we missed is the drive in unique hotel which was earlier here."
Semmozhi_Poonga,Pradeep K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 â€¢ Family,Very nice park @ the heart of the city,Excellent park opposite to American Consulate. Turning to be a lovers paradise (we find it bit uncomfortable to take my kid now-a-days). Park is also loosing its charm.

Semmozhi_Poonga,Reno D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 â€¢ Family,Greenery in a concrete jungle - with lover Couples as a menace,"To find a lush green patch in the middle of Chennai is something that Chennaites would crave for, and that's what you would find with Semmozhi poonga. Located bang in the heart of chennai near the american consulate, this 20 acre park is such a soothing site for the eyes and mind. It's literally green all over, with trees, a lush green lawn, more trees and some architectural ideas thrown in. If you want to relax in the midst of nature, this is one of the few  places to go. It has a small park for kids with a couple of slides, roundabouts and swings - enough to keep your toddler happy. There is also a small pond with some ducks in it.The only black spot of this entire park are the couples that use it as spot to romance. It's ok to see them sitting together having a chat - but what is disgusting is to see them in compromising positions doing compromising things - try explaining that to your kid when they ask you what those couples are doing! The management should do something about this menace - but since this is a govt park, nothing's gonna happen.All in all it is a wonderful, peaceful place in the heart of the city and is a must visit place if you want a chill out doing nothing."
Semmozhi_Poonga,WVR7933,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 â€¢ Family,Nice place to visit with family and children,"This Poonga (Park) is located at Dr. Radhakrishnan Salai.

Semmozhi_Poonga,sreekanth1810,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 â€¢ Family,Extremely beautiful place to visit!,It's an excellent place to be in with absolutely beautiful trees and plants and lawns. The parking charge is a little high though. The premises are maintained very well and is really neat. Only concern was the low level of water in the water bodies within. There is also a small food counter though the food was only average. You can sit there for a long time without getting bored if you love nature.
Semmozhi_Poonga,SubbaramDanda,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 â€¢ Family,Nice Park in a busy area,"This is a neat, lush park that has come up where the famous Woodlands Drive-in Hotel stood not long ago.  It is located on Cathedral Road roughly opposite to the American Consulate in Chennai.  Semmozhi Poonga means a park named after the classical Tamil language.

It has beautifully laid-out walkways, tall trees that provide good greenery, ponds where ducks glide along, water fountains, children's play area, a variety of  flower plants, lawns, bowers and benches for people to sit and relax.  It is not very big and at the same time it is not small either.   Its greatness stems from the fact that it is in a busy locality in the heart of Chennai.  It is well patronized by the people.  Not only city residents go there for relaxation but visitors treat it as a tourist destination.   It is a beautiful place for photo enthusiasts.  There is ample space for car parking."

It is a nice green place in the middle of the city. This place is a good option for morning walkers/joggers who live nearby. The park is open for morning walk between 6 to 8 am and for visitors between 10 am and 7.30 pm on all days except Tuesdays. There is lot of parking space. There is a fee for entry and parking. We went around 3 pm and it was not very crowded. Though the place looked very nice and suitable for family picnics, when we were there it was full of young couples only. People who enjoy nature will like this place."
