Shirdi_Sai_Baba_Temple,Chinmai Gupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,Plan your taxi carefully.,"I went to Shirdi, from Delhi with my 70+ parents and 2 kids, aged 13 and 7, thinki g that it is a safe destination to travel to, for ladies.We had planned a 5 days trip, starting from Shirdi, to trimbakeshwar, then Nashik and then back to The hotel - Marigold Regency was wonderful- neat, clean, staff helpful , free pick and drop service to the Sai Temple.The only problem we faced in the whole trip was the taxi that had been arranged through a travel agent.We arranged it before travelling to avoid last minute confusions but it did not turn out to be so.The taxi driver was apathetic, had no desire to show us  nearby attractions even on repeated requests.Did not tie the luggage on the luggage carrier, so in effect we travelled in cramped seats despite it being a 7 seater.He took us to specific shops in shani shignapur and shirdi and compelled us to buy stuff from there, and had no consideration for my elderly parents parking very far away- saving his petrol and creating difficulties for us, which were avoidable.Even when requested to drive further he refused.On the third day of the trip, he started harrassing us for extra money- refused to follow the earlier agreed upon  itinery and created a lot of stress for me and my parents.To the extent that eventually we had to change out taxi.But this experience left a bad taste and made me to feel that even now, single females with/ without kids are not safe to travel."

Shirdi_Sai_Baba_Temple,Arun Aggarwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Shirdi wale baba: a divine opportunity availed,"We availed this divine opportunity in March 2019 and we feel obliged to Shirdi wale Sai Baba for calling us to His temple suddenly.We had stayed in Sterling hotel who were having free shuttle service to the temple. Though temple distance was not so far. Bit this was a great facility.We used to pay our obeisance there twice a day to reap to the maximum. The temple is located in a huge area and one can see big rush always. But we were lucky to avail the facility of senior pass and pay our respects easily always.People visiting to this holy city and sacred temple should note that cab charges Rs 600 from airport to city. This rate is very high and fixed by the union. Airport to city distance is approximately 15-16kms only. The Shirdi airport is small but nice.At the temple, it is advised to bargain much for flowers, garlands and bouquets. They ask for almost 4 times high rates. They sell guavas add pomegranates also at exorbitant rates though fresh so you need to bargain.In Prasad, there is no binding and one can offer anything. Opposite to gate is the shop selling any type of Prasad. So but according to your trust and ability. No phones etc are allowed inside. So put them in locker at Rs 5 only. Keep the slip carefully with mobile number which is verified when you take phone.You can enjoy divine taste of tea at Baba's tea shop inside. This is small and always crowded because tea here is for Rs 2 only and coffee for Rs 3. Mineral water for Rs 10 only.If you are fast and quick then you can come out of the temple in just half hour. Rest depends on you.From Shirdi, one can go to Shani Shignapur also in non AC tempo traveller at Rs 150 only that leaves you back at Shirdi temple in the evening.Likewise you've chance to visit Triambkeshwar temple also. But you should plan it early in a cab. Travel agencies charge Rs 3000 or so for going and coming to Shirdi but a good bargain can fetch you at Rs 2100 only which we paid. One has to go via Nashik and is about 80kms away.Bon voyage!!🙏🙏🙏"

Shirdi_Sai_Baba_Temple,Valavanur Natar... K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Write up on  Shiridi Saibaba temple at Injambakkam,"begin this post with my eyes closed and  complete reverence in silence  recalling the words of Baba :I Quote""No one goes anywhere without a connection or relationship.Never drive away People or creatures  who approach you  receive them well and treat them with due respect. GOD will certainly be pleased if you give water to the thirsty and bread to those in hunger and attire to naked poor and a place in your home sitout for resting if they are tired .If  anyone demands money and if  you dont feel like giving it's okay .But do not bark at him.or her like a dog""  I have lived in Maharashtra Pune for close to 10 years but I did not have his grace to visit his last known abode Shiridhi until recently .But before I was  given a call to go there  a doctor  friend of ours ,  domiciled in UK celebrated their daughter's wedding at Shirdhi Saibaba temple at Injambakkam , a few years back .Its a sprawaling campus with huge car park And the temple itself is a grandiose .The statue of Baba in soarkling white marble is awe  inspiring to say the least. I was fortunate to pray here in peace abd witness the maha Aarthi .To appeal to the mind of all kinds of devotees specially Hindus many VigrahamsOf all gods and that of Navagrahas with sannidhis have been added here in this baba temple. The whole premises generates peace and harmonybif body and mind with abundant trees breathing oxygen for one's benefit.But while sitting in meditation at this temple I refected upon the simplicity and the life and times of  Baba.Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian spiritual master regarded by his devotees as a saint, a fakir, a satguru and an incarnation of Lord Shiva and Dattatreya. He was  revered by both Hindus and Muslims alike during  his lifetime and even After he left this world on 15 October 1918 in Shirdi, then known as Bombay Presidency during British India and now  Maharashtra.A Samadhi and a wonderful Mandir has been constructed  here and attracts millions of devotees round the year .My being an ardent devotee of KanchiShri Chandrasekhara Maya Swami , in whoseLotus feet , I am in perpetual surrender .My spiritual inward travel began in 79 when he gave me a unique dhiksha on a full moon night while he was doing his atma pooja at a  pooja  in Bhavani temple at Satara and I consider him reincarnation of Lordess Kanchi Kamakshi .He has guided me since then and all my grahastha and spiritual life and  experiences that followed .Visits  to holy places and meeting many Sat Gurus till date is all his grace. As a true seeker I realise what Baba preached about  the importance of  realization of the self and to abhor  love for perishable things,  while following  a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace and devotion to the God and guru. Sai Baba did not have a  distinction based on religion or caste. But one thing that elludes me today  is :when Baba through out his life lived a life in simplicity and mingled with the poor why now his statue now  adorned in temples with such great pomp and grandeur when that money can be channelled for poor and needy that includes imparting knowledge to them to become self sufficient. I ask of all readers of this post this :When you visit a temple, mosque or church Of great importance and while  you stand in front of the diety and start praying the physical body responds to spirituality with both your hand coming to gather and eyes automatically closing .The truth of the matter is when you join hands you realise the fact that you and he have become one .You seek him inside of you and not on the outside of you .So grandeur of the statue or place of worship is of no importance. It is just a starting point in your spiritual journey ..I conclude with an ideal mantra            ""OM SAI RAM ""Om Being the universal Bhjikshara mantra Sai denoting the diety Ram  equates Sai of Shiridhi to Shri Rama of Ayodhya"
