Skywalk_ampa_Mall,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Fantastic mall in the four roads junction,"It is one of the the best malls in Chennai that is inside the city.

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Bhalaji N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Evolving to meet demand,"This mall had stood for 7+ years and its continuing to renovate and improvise its space. The place is not busy all times, except weekends or holidays. I visited very recently and could see a lot of shops are under renovation now or new shops are moving in. Food court needs to improve, i didnt remember the place stink when i visited a 6 months back, situation is different now. If you are going for PVR better be early we had many times stuck in long queue and movie started before we crossed PVR security. New promotion is going on for parking fee waiver ( Oct - dec), 2 hrs fee waiver for purchase above 500INR ( any purchase including food). Place is clean for sure. "

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Amit K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A medium sized mall,"The mall was not that big as expected, and is between egmore and chetpet, so a bus is preferred to reach there. You can watch cinema in PVR cinemas. Although, some brand store are there, it is good to visit, if you are in Chennai."
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Rucha121,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Decent mall .. Avg PVR theatre,"Located bang in Poonamalle High Road on Nelson Manickam Road Junction (Nungambakam), this mall is a good hang-out place to catch up with friends. There is also PVR multiplex inside, but, rates are very high .. and even the move experience is not so great.. seating and cooling is not that great for high prices... decent food-court in the mall. parking is difficult here.."
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Prasad B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Good architecture followed by nice places for hang out !!,"Food court and many other places to be appreciated at.However, SKYWALK name should be used as a theme, not as a literal or epitome !!"

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,anto b,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Good mall in the heart of city,"Skywalk is one of the dominant malls in Chennai and it is situated in Nelson Manickam road, Nungambakkam which is easily accessible by bus, train and own vehicles.  Many prefers this mall to watch movies in PVR cinemas followed by lunch/dinner.  Food outlets like KFC, McDonalds, Dominoes, PizzaHut are present across floors but clothing outlets are very few.  The mall is not maintained well compared to forum mall, phoenix mall or EA.  Air conditioning is very low and escalators are mostly under maintenance. Car parking is charged Rs.30 for each hour on weekends, which is acceptable.  Majority of the crowd just roam  around the mall without doing any shopping, the management has to look into this.  Overall i would recommend this mall for watching movies in PVR.  For purchase of apparels it is better to visit Forum mall or EA or phoenix."

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Dinkar P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Compact mall,I've been visiting this mall for many years now. Initially it was among the 4 major malls in chennai however there are many more now.While you have most affordable brands available here but the choice of very limited considering the strata of people or caters too.They have a food court as well with a lot of variety. However there is scope for the cleanliness to be improved. The mall is good for a small break and some limited shopping .During festivals they organise events in the mall which is a good attraction to go for especially kids.
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Rufus V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Mall,Mall is bit old now.. Shops feel congested.. And poor. Cooling systems... Overall experience was ok.. Movie experience at pvr was good.. Food court is also good..

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Score G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Very Average place,This Mall is not one of the greatest malls in Chennai. Yo you will see that many shops are closed as the business is not very great you don't have a good choice when it comes to shopping as well everything is pretty average so I wouldn't really recommend this place as a must visit place in Chennai.
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Parthiban V,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,average and quite expensive mall,"Games is too expensive compared to other malls...food outlets are very less but cost is high, parking cost is more due to more time taking while parking and taking out our vehicle..."

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Reeveenesh J,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Bad,Very bad mall. No toilets and most of the shops are closed down. The mall looks so dull. Only shop which serves you good cloth is Prapthi. Very good clothes for good prices.
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Ramprasad b,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,COMPACT MALL WITH ALL TYPES OF SHOPS,"Ampa mall is one of the oldest new generation malls in Chennai.  This mall is located in heart of Chennai surrounded by many residential areas like Anna Nagar, Kilpauk, Arumbakkam, Choolaimedu, Nungambakkam, Aminijikarai to name a few.This mall is compact in size as compared to Vijaya Forum Mall at Vadapalani, Express Mall at Royapetha, Phoenix Mall at Velachery.  But it has all the facilities like good parking area, good shops of all varieties, PVR movie theaters, a large food court, McDonalds, KFC, etc.  Now the Spencer Hyper market i also active (previously, TATA's Star Bazaar was present, and they vacated couple of years back.)  I liked the Star Bazaar than the Spencer as the new rack arrangements to roof level make me feel claustrophobic.  Also, varieties of Items at Spencer appears to be on lower side than Star Bazaar.The main advantage of this mall is its location, and one need not walk a lot as compared to other malls.  One can drop in to buy single items also and move on without spending lot of time."
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,ppnpower,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,good place for timepass,"shopping, movies & fun, location is easily approachable just on main road. PVR theaters are good but cramped at the entrance especially at screen-1,2,3."

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,vignesh d,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,A mall - thats it,Its a typical mall can do decent shopping and for movies its good. If you are going to spend more than an hour park your vehicle in the Parking sheds in front of the mall(In Nelson manikkam road). Its very economical and less time consuming.
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,dashfaqd,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Shopping Arcade,The skywalk mall is small compared to the Express Avenue Mall. Still it has all the popular brand in fashion and dining. Thus one can have a good shopping and have a great time visiting the mall.
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,48aravindh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Real skywalk....!!!!,"Recently we visited ampa skywalk to shop and watch a movie, the mall is really big than I thought, it has many stores, clustered over four floors, it has a huge multiplex, where we watched a movie, after watching we had some snacks in the food court, which has numerous number of franchise, and they have a good underground parking, which is fully automated one, without any hassle you can park your car, since it is located in the heart of the city, it is easily approachable...!!! I really enjoyed in climbing the crisscrossing escalators, overall we spent a wonderful time here...!!!"
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,SubbaramDanda,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,A good mall and a nice place to hang aound,"We visited the Ampa Skywalk Mall in Aminjikarai, Chennai, recently when we wanted to see a film in the top floor of the mall.  From the moment we passed through the security in the ground floor till we reached the cine complex we could see hordes of people everywhere.  They thronged shops, eateries, entertainment hubs and a variety of other enclosures.  Escalators and elevators were operating to move people from one floor to another.  The corridors and walkways were clean and the air-conditioning was pleasant.  Of course, there were no benches for seniors to sit and relax for a while.  They had to essentially step into an eatery for the purpose. The Ampa mall has been there for quite long and it should be said to its credit that it is  maintaining standards of good house-keeping."
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,anupam b,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Nothing special,As we visited better mall in kolkata and other part so we didn't find anything special.

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Arun,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Small yet cool mall,"I went to Skywalk last month to purchase some clothes and there was many brand stores. The mall was small when compared to other malls in Chennai but it is worth visit. You also have PVR theatres in the third floor. They have a big food court where you can find North Indian food, south Indian food,Burgers, Pizzas and Chaat items. The parking is a little extra on weekends and it is quite reasonable."
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,venkatesh k,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,Not worth the hype,"Have visited this mall post a lot of hype from friends who are residents of this mall's locality.  Compared to the other city malls this is not having enough shops or features.  Jam packed roads leading upto the mall adds to our misery. If you have booked any movie tickets on the theater in the mall complex, you can visit the mall.  Else, it is not good enough compared to spencer, express avenue, phoenix mall, etc."
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Wilson J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Need more improvision,"This is a good mall located near the most posh area Anna Nagar , yet this is small in size. Unlike other featured malls , this mall has only less number of Shops & the food mall seems okayish :)"

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Sudhir,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good Mall,"This is a small mall when compared to other malls in the city.It has got cinemas, children play area, shops and also ample parking.When i visited recently, all the food shops were closed as reason was cited that they haven't obtained license for the restaurants. So I wont recommend it to fellow travellers if food is not available."
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,JumboMumbai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Godd but crowded,This part of tow got a mall and also a good one.  But the result is a nightmare on weekends with parking full and no place to peae fully walk inside the mall.  There is maximum no of shops with electronics topping and then there is the cineplex with PVR on the 4th floor if you get tred of shopping. Hot and happening Chennai mall.
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Ajith Setty,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015,Just another Mall ..Nothing Great to mention.,"Visited this mall when i was on a business trip to Chennai.Just another mall like any other mall, nothing great specifically to mention.Can visit for some shopping and time pass."
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,06Adam,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,Average mall on the West side of the City,"Whilst there are number of malls coming up in the centre of City from the Spencer plaza of those days to the Express Avenue of today, this place has a history of various hotels operated during its lifetime. Now this has been a new mall which is accessible for people of the Anna nagar and surrounding area.I have seen some people claiming this is dirty because it is situated on the banks of coovum an ester year river which has turned now to be a disposal river for all toxic waste. Well the mall and there are millions of houses on the banks and the cleanliness comes from withing. If you haven't dropped a litter on road in your lifetime you can call this place as dirty however it is the cleanliness inside that matters.CONS:High parking charges similar to most mallsHeavy traffic generated as there is no control of in and out flowing trafficPROS:Mix of Food and entertainment catering to most age groupsAverage cleanliness maintained.Good collection of stores to keep you busy if you are visiting this place."
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,DeepakSam72,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Bad!,"Maintenance has always been an issue in this place. Today, I the food court was closed and even McDonalds and KFC were closed. Not sure if they are permanently shut down. Surprised to see Swenson's open an outlet here - BTW this closed too today.  "
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Kushagra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,PVR @ Ampa Skywalk,"OK, first things first...I am not writing this review to tell you how great PVR is...its your normal PVR with normal screens and normal seats. Just what you would find everywhere else. This review is specifically for the MOMOS you get at this PVR. Dudddeeee, the chicken momos are so damn tasty here. I am from Delhi and I long for the street food and the momos cause you cannot find it here. But the only reason I prefer ampa skywalk over other cinemas is the momos here. Well as many of you will know momos are nothing if not for the chutney you get with them, cause lets be realistic, momos in themselves are nothing but just all-flour and boiled chicken...tasteless! What makes momos great is that awesome sweet, tangy, spicy chutney which should always come with KFC's tagline ""IT'S FINGER LICKING GOOD"". Well long story short...do go and try that awesome momos !!"
Skywalk_ampa_Mall,GautamPrashar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016,Poor maintenance,This mall is the worst mall i have ever seen. no maintenance. even couple of escalators wee also out of order. lack of air-conditioning too.

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,Skribbles,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good HyperMall,"Though Spencer Plaza and Chennai City centre was available for shopping and mostly food court, chain of restaurants for weekend and holidays, AMPA SKYWALK was the first Hyper Mall in Chennai with all the facilities. For the locals from Annanagar, Mogappair, Ambattur and Avadi this is an easy access from shopping. eateries and esp. movie at PVR cinema. The atrium most of the time is lively and has a theme according to the season and festivals. For families, after a movie, taking the kids to games zone, lunch at food food court/restaurants and complete the shopping at boutiques was an ideal option including the groceries, veggies-fruits at StarBazar like the Big Bazar at Express Avenue..Don't know why it does not exist now, closed last year i think. I am seeing the Spencer's Hyper ""To be opened shortly"" banner every time i visit from last year.Two wheeler parking fees at Ampa Skywalk mall as in April 2016:Managed by CPS parking system.Wkday - 20 rs per hour & Wkend/Holidays - 25 per hourSame applies for every additional hour.*Loss of ticket - 150 Rs,"

Skywalk_ampa_Mall,shishirALD77,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Average mall,There is nothing very exciting about this mall as the facilities provided are below average and the service as usual is poor. Even the McDonalds in the mall does not have good service as they boast off.
