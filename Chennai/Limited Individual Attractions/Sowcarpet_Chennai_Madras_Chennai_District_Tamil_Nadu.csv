Sowcarpet,Sankar M K Samy,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Bad experience at Rattan Bazaar,"As I saw it: The streets were full of rubbish. Shop keepers as well and shoppers just dump their rubbish on the street. There is practically no civic consciousness, people spitting all over the place with some even blowing their nose in the street. It was disgusting. The roads were narrow and crowded,  hardly wide enough for one vehicle yet vehicles were travelling in both direction. And they just plow their way through blowing their horns. Yes, you can find all sorts of items here at a reasonable price but you still have to compare prices and bargain as you can easily be taken for a ride. Most of these items can be found at other places in Chennai for a little more. I personally would prefer the later option."
Sowcarpet,Satish N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Over crowded bazaar area,"A very crowded place...not suitable to take your kids or senior citizens . Walking is the best transportation mode here. If you want to go for bulk purchase, go here. Otherwise it's not sensible going there."

Sowcarpet,SJKVT,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Shopping,"The worst place to go. Even autorikshaws cannot enter certain lanes. Its so disorganised, air is very polluted & horribly crowded. One shop is onion garlic shop, next will be a plumbing supply shop, next will be building supply shop and extras....Many many shops later, you might get to see a low budget clothing shop. After rounding in Sowcarpet abt 40 mins in auto, finally we saw few saree shops in a row. Since it was super duper crowded, we didnt get down and after more than an hr, we went to T Nagar for our usual shopping. Highly dont recommend this place and dont waste your time going here. The pictures displayed here all misleading! When I spoke at night at a dinner party, even the locals advised me not to go to these place. As a matter of fact, even the auto drivers advised me not to patronise these areas!! "

Sowcarpet,Raxcor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,If you are snack lover then never miss this place,"This place is good for so many things right from shopping to food. I would concentrate more on food as a food lover. We wanted to visit this place for a very long time, we had plan A, B and C but everything failed, but just like that we made it to this place and we were not disappointed. We went as a team of 15 and we did a food walk in the late evening.The roads are narrow, so I would advice you to go by foot. This is place will make you feel good and it is not trademark Chennai, it may look like a different place altogether. Majority of them north Indian and this place is paradise for them. We started with Vada Pav, it would bring back memories if you are a Mumbaian. Next we moved on to Lassi part, where you got lassi in huge glasses. Next we moved to a street sandwich vendor, who made sandwich in style. Amazing taste!Next we moved to Place called Ajnabi, and do not miss the Kaakadi Sandwich and mix snacks. And we almost tried everything in that place. Jallabi is another main attraction and taste it to fulfill the trip.Next we went to Kakada Ramparasath, there we had Aalu Tikki, they made it fresh and it was nice. Next we moved to Seena Bhai, this is very different you would get idly and Doasa but very different. They soak the idili in podi and Ghee. The dosa are not typically dosa it is a mini oothappam with onions. He made it in style and it is a good visual to see and taste. I am sure you will love it.Right opposite to Senna Bhai we had sweet beda which you should not miss that is the finishing touch to the whole trip.So this place is filled with people and if you are a foodie and I am pretty sure your stomach will also be full and it wont cost you so much. Worth a Try!"

Sowcarpet,Yesha M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,Amazing shopping,"Wow.. Feels heavenly coming to this place. You just need to forget everything and keep walking amidst the narrow space.

Sowcarpet,SagarVS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Solo,"Congested, filthy and interesting","This place is not for someone visiting chennai. Not unless he has a specific purpose to visit this area. This is an older part of town and the inhabitants are mostly from the Northern states of India. There are specialty stores, restaurants and small shopping centers in this over crowded place with narrow streets. Its filthy but interesting in some ways even for locals since the culture of this place and its people is quite distinct. Not recommended."

Sowcarpet,kevinjohn1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Solo,North in the South!!!,Northern India down south in the hear of Chennai is what I would call this place. The railway station and the bus terminus are very close from here. The streets are very narrow and you get all kind of north Indian snacks here. A very crowded place during the day. Good place for roadside shopping as well
Sowcarpet,Gupta_Rahul_Dev,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Solo,A North Indian enclave in the heart of Chennai,"Sowcarpet falls on what is generally referred to as North Chennai. It is an old neighbourhood and not designed for cars so has traffic congestion. If you don't want to walk, its better you take a cycle rickshaw (yes, these do run here).If you know Hindi, you will feel quite at home here to converse in that language.Why should you go here? Some reasons that come to mind are (not necessarily in order of priority) -- (i) to see a slice of old Madras (ii) to buy various household goods at cheaper prices (iii) to have some good cheap North Indian food.As in most other outdoor places in Chennai, it is better one goes there during the coolest (or rather, least hot!!) part of the Chennai weather cycle; say 01 December to 15th January). This is not to say that a trip at other times cannot be worthwhile -- like in most things in life, it depends purely upon your frame of mind. For example, I went there on the 21st of April and still thought it was OK."
Sowcarpet,micronixcorp,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Family,Sowcarpet...the heart of Chennai,"As mentioned in the title, sowcarpet is the heart of chennai with the railway station and the  bus stand very close by. Where ever you stay in chennai you will have to visit sowcarpet to complete your list of purchase.  It is a business hub. North Indians dominate this place. You get mouth watering food of all varieties but only for vegetarians. Yes the streets are narrow but are now being relaid with cement  roadsAnand Mangal"
Sowcarpet,Selva P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,shopping for fun,this is a over crowded area of chennai with a lot and lot of shops. you can get anything for less in this area. but have to be make your bargain. its fun going around the place and definitely has some good food. the authentic north indian cusine can be here. tasted food in a small mess and the food was delicious. really not a very neat and tidy area. A number of street food stalls available along the road if you like to taste the food of india. we get shocked to see how many are living in this building here. if you are a good bargainer and like shopping this is the place to go
Sowcarpet,RamyaKrishna,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Friends,Pay less for lesser quality,"I have been wanting to visit here for more than a degade. Visited for shopping this diwali.Narrow streets - old madras. So typical old madras. If u like to imagine how old madras and historically u will like it.It still has manual tricycle trishaw which fascinatedme.Lots of shops textile primarily. Chats were amazing. I travelled with someone who is good in textiles, guided me helped buy cloths, its cheaper than in malls, however the finish will not be great or lasting. U should use public transport for a typical travel experience. If on ur own then hire a driver for ur car, u may not find parking space."

Sowcarpet,Deepali Shah Sarrof,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 • Friends,Crowded,Have Been to Sowcarpet Nearly 100 times but Its my regret to say that it isn't safe for girls if they aren't conscious while walking the overly crowded narrow street people will just touch and walk of as nothing happened. And as far as shopping is concerned for Dress like salwars and kurti and western outfits its better not to buy from here bcoz quality of clothes isnt as good and they dont have variety and charge you the price of malls. So i stopped shopping from here and started shopping from max at express avenue.Food is tasty Like the one you cant resist

Sowcarpet,Aaqarsh Aiyyar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2012 • Business,Wholesale trading hub,"Being a predominant North-Indian settlement in Chennai, it is only natural that sowcarpet is the wholesale trading hub of the city. You really need to be a smart buyer to shop (if you would want to realise the value for your money) in this locality which is dominated by Marwaris, Jain, Gujaratis, Sindhis and other North-Indian businessmen. Only a patient individual can surf the locality as it is too crowded and lousy. This is the place to be if you would like to taste cost-effective delicious North-Indian cuisine."
