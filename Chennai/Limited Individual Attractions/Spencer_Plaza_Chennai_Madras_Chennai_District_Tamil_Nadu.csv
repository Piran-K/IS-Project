Spencer_Plaza,Emma W,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Just weird,"Terribly run-down mall with half the shops shut down or empty. A strange smell all over the place and the shopkeepers kept nagging us to come inside. Had to back away from using the bathrooms as they were the worst so far in India. Creepy place, not worth visiting"
Spencer_Plaza,Ajino Singh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 ‚Ä¢ Business,Sponsor Spencer Plaza! a little bit fasta people! ,"Spencer Plaza- used to be Chennai's most famous shopping mall- It was the first one in that smart city to host millions of lovers, events, families- still it's open to host many such precious moments in people's life. The livelihood of the shop owners entirely depends upon the young customers, they have unique products and the shopping experience entirely, was new to me. All pocket friendly products- except the Jammu & Kashmir shops- despite their price, I loved their product, they are fancy, unique and alluring. I think they need our support. Show some love!"
Spencer_Plaza,Hooray H,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Simple Mall,Apparently the first Mall in Chennai. We only went in because it was near the Hotel & we were looking for some sports shoes.Lots of cheap clothes etec available but nothing decent.A very nice coffee place though- Kaffi. Mind the pavements etc can easily fall over.
Spencer_Plaza,Michael Anbumani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Oldest Plazain India,"Amazing Old Architecture. I was told that Spencer Plaza is one of the first Mall in India, especially in Chennai. There is an extension to this Mall. Very convenient to us as we were staying in La Woods Hotel just opposite of this Mall. You can do a good shopping here though some of the items are a bit expensive. There is many restaurants inside, especially Saravana restaurant (Veg.) very popular with tourists."

Spencer_Plaza,Rajeshwari,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Interesting thing is there is a Virtual Gaming now,"I recently had a look at the mall but it now almost looks with the office structure setup. Most of the shops have gems, clothing, mobile cover shops. But interestingly, by mistake, I stepped into Phase 1 and found a corner shop which has Virtual Reality Gaming setup(VR Gaming Hub). Was shocked to see, the setup is nice and you can try once you go in there."

Spencer_Plaza,Existdarrus,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Modern Ruins,"Probably one the oldest large malls in South India - it is a shadow of its former glory. No more Landmark, Westside etc. Barely a couple of restaurants. Just an office block and few small eateries and cheap clothes stores. But still an iconic place nonetheless."

Spencer_Plaza,Dr Javed Rasheed,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Renovated and Refurnished ,"There were two landmarks in Madras that I would love to visit as a kid and they were the :More Market The Spencer Plaza Having being born 10 years after India attained its Independence, I have been fascinated by the British architecture and the colonial structures that still exist in some places in our country like clubs,bungalows and buildings and this red building has always fascinated me when I was a kid.The history of this building is :Spencer Plaza was built in 1863‚Äì1864, established by Charles Durant and J. W. Spencer in Anna Salai, then known as Mount Road, in the Madras Presidency. The property originally belonged to Spencer & Co Ltd. Spencer & Co opened the first department store in the Indian subcontinent in 1895. It had over 80 individual departments. After a few years, Eugene Oakshott, owner of Spencer's, shifted the department store to a new building, which was an example of Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. The building was designed by W. N. Pogson. In 1983, the original building was destroyed in a fire.The present Spencer Plaza was constructed on the same site, measuring about 10 acres, and was opened in 1991.Spread across a million square feet built in three phases with parking space for 800 cars, the plaza is a major hangout for the people of Chennai. The mall was developed by Mangal Tirth Estate Limited in January 1993.It is said that the work started in 1985.One of the most sought after properties once about 38 years ago where all the main shops and showrooms were located and slowly there was a gradual deterioration in maintaining this place and then it became deserted and had a gloomy look and I was very disappointed to see this place with pigeons flying all around and I was wondering what happened to this place that I once used to visit and had such fond memories ?? Slowly it has been renovated and it‚Äôs trying to regain its past glory !!Dr.Javed Rasheed"
Spencer_Plaza,rradice123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A throwback mall that's worth the visit,"I've come to Spencer's for years and it has held onto it's character as a mall of secret byways on each floor.  You can fins almost anything here at best prices.  Merchants will haggle the first price offered, but don't insult them by trying to get something for too low a price.  They need to make a profit and remember they will not agree to a price unless they are making some profit.  Clothing, artifacts and art pieces (if you hunt and know what you are hunting for), furniture, food, +++ can be found here.  I don't enjoy the modern malls in India as much as Spencer's  and I hope it continues for a long time to come."
Spencer_Plaza,Gopi T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Dream mall,"One of the oldest mall in India and dream mall from my childhood ,good place to buy cheap and best only thing is management can focus of cleaning and need attractive offer to bring more crowd ."
Spencer_Plaza,beckyjake123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"New facelift, new look","When  I visited Spencer Plaza a couple years ago, it was dark, gloomy, and tired. With all the new malls in town, it appeared Spencer‚Äôs Plaza was a ‚Äúhas been‚Äù place. All I can say is this visit was a big ‚ÄúWow‚Äù! Many of the same businesses are there; but it‚Äôs like a fresh coat of paint made it look new. It still doesn‚Äôt have the glam of the Forum Mall, but this is the best place to find Indian crafts & souvenirs for a reasonable price. We had a bite to eat at Three Mithai,  & even found Mysore Pak, a favorite sweet to carry back to the USA.  Next time I need souvenirs to bring home, I‚Äôll make sure to stop at Spencer Plaza. "
Spencer_Plaza,Michael Anbumani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nice Mall,"This Mall is quite old and still very popular. Good location at the main road itself. Transportation is very easy and near to the La Woods hotel. However not many people patronize the mall. You can buy many things from here. Very nice, cool and comfortable to walk about."
Spencer_Plaza,Praveenop,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,A great Mall which has fallen into hard times due to trouble from its own tenants,"Not many know this fact. Spencer Plaza is India's first ever mall. During its hey days during the 1990s and 2000 it was a place to be seen in. It has the best shops, book stores, restaurants etc and was a haven for Indian handicrafts and products. The tourists simply loved this place for the variety it offered. During those times life in Chennai revolved around the Mall but slowly things started to decline. I would blame the shop keepers and tenants who slowly started to keep their wares outside their shops and showrooms, my friend has a shop there and he says that many of the tenants would not pay their maintenance. Due to lack of regular maintenance and acrimony among shop owners the Mall could not keep up their quality of maintenance and now hardly anyone goes to the mall. All the good anchor stores moved out and left the bad apples behind. Sad that such a great place has to die a sad. slow and painful death."
Spencer_Plaza,Hari Shankar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good Old mall,"It is one of the oldest shopping mall in Chennai. Branded clothing shop are less compare to the other malls, still it's worth giving a try and buy clothes for affordable price.

Spencer_Plaza,niki dee,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Mall not worth a visit,"One of the earliest malls in Chennai and now has lost its charm. Has a few eat outs and money exchangers and carpet stores. However, there is proper food court. It is more of a place where there are few enterprises and offices. Not worthy enough for shopping when there are much better options in the vicinity."
Spencer_Plaza,Rathikaprashanna,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Horrible condition and extreme hassling,"From what we‚Äôve been told, this was the first plaza/mall built in Chennai approximately 50 years ago.  Like many structures in Chennai, this place has not been up-kept and so it‚Äôs outdated, and the the stores in there don‚Äôt have any new fashion trends.  The most annoying part is the hassling.  You can‚Äôt walk by a store without the owners continuously hassling you to come into their store.  The quality of products is poor and outdated.  Don‚Äôt waste your time.  You would rather visit Phoenix mall."

Spencer_Plaza,TrailBlazer581787,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Practice your negotiation skills,"This is the oldest 'mall' in Chennai. Lots of traditional (old style) Indian shops with a not so modern touch, but the structure of the mall is worth a visit in itself. You can spend hours in there, both shopping and eating. Be prepared for all the  'barker's who tell you they have the best pashmina's (don't expect real ones) and anything else you may need. Once you're in a shop, it is expected you will buy, so don't enter just to have a look.. We found some beautiful jewelry, including antique rings. But as a general rule : don't pay too much (that beautiful ruby ring, is probably not a real one) have some tea and enjoy the bartering, which you absolutely have to do to get a good price."

Didn't do any shopping in Chennai this time so don't know much but this place must be the place to buy fake ""branded"" t shirts and track pants in chennai.didn't find anything else to buy here, nor even interesting food outlets here.give this place a skip."
Spencer_Plaza,Tejinder S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Deteriorated,"I had first been here in early 1990s. The place was an attraction. However, over the years, it has deteriorated in terms of shops, crowd and most importantly maintenance. Dark dingy areas, humid with no whitewash. Needs urgent attention. May be better to walk a mile for the Express Avenue."

Though there are numerous Malls in Chennai city this oldest mall offers everything from branded wears to local wears in a most moderate cost. Food, salon, mobile accessories, clothes, üï∂ sunglasse, shoes. A complete place with lots to shop and eat. This mall does not have a cinema hall.  But it's got all that you need in a cheaper price.

Right from the construction periods, I used to visit this famous Mall. But now it lost its value... That is because so many new malls with latest facilities to the customers had come in..

The environment is ok, remember to bargain every thing. Good deals and nice things. If you came as us to Oneness University mostly of the clothes you'll need you could find it here"
Spencer_Plaza,VIVEK V,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,An Old School Mall,Most of the shops were small and during my visit the big outlets like Westside weren't open. There were food outlets spread out and the carnival food court wasn't that large as they said with only a handful of outlets.

Spencer_Plaza,Krishna G K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The first mall in Chennai,"As far I can remember my childhood days, Spencer Plaza is the predecessor of all big malls in ChennaiNot just that, the shopping mall is huge, bigger than most of today's malls and is a shopper's destination for various goods - clothes, arts and collections, sports items, video and gaming accessories, you name it you get it hereNow that other malls have gained popularity, this  one has faded, but, I still like going to the mall and taking a stroll around to explore the areaI like this mall the most, actually :-)"

Spencer_Plaza,fivestarholidays,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Lost Glory,"Amongst the earliest malls in Chennai but bad maintenance coupled with opening of swanky new malls led to its downfall.Has a very run down feel and but for a few stores selling kashmir carpets, shawls etc there is nothing much that would draw crowds to the mall."
Spencer_Plaza,Mohan2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,First mall of Chennai city,"I am a permanent resident of chennai so I know the transformations that preceded the present spencer plaza. After the launch of several malls especially the Express avenue in the vicinity of this place, the visitors have dwindled here. When I visited here recently to buy some cell phone cases, I could not restrain by my flashback about the glorious past of this mall. It's heartening to note that the property developers built a replica of the facade of the original mall inside the mall. Many of the shops and retail chains shifted to the Express avenue. By modernising the building with good facilities and addition of multiplexes, the management can attract customers again."
Spencer_Plaza,Sanath K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Very old mall but it is very good,"Big mall, we can feel a very good environment once we enter into the mall. Mall has more small shops were we can purchase many items at reasonable cost."

Spencer_Plaza,Sudhir,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Old Mall,"This is the oldest & vast mail in the chennai city. This mall has been there for almost 20 years now.While most of the malls have all sort of branded shops only, this is an exception. Even a low budget shopper can shop here.No movie theater is available here. But restaurants and shops are available for shopping."
Spencer_Plaza,JumboMumbai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Place ahead of time..,..is what I feel.  Such a large mall in almost the year 2000 was ahead of time.  And the crowds it did pull for some years but it wnet wrong in not beeing an exclusive mall like outlets and mistake to allow mundane shop keppers to ope up shop.  NOt so many large brands meant it got treated like another 200 shop arcade. And foot falls begun to fall.  But it still attracts quite a lot of people. A nd of course the office spaces above are wondeful.
Spencer_Plaza,kittyban,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,shopping mall since 90's! ,"Spencer plaza has 3 phases for shopping . If you want to buy nice cashmere silk, carpets, lucknowi dresses, rajasthani, kashmiri, jaipuri styled clothing, this is the perfect place , with quite a good deal for the price ! This also has a few restaurants , where you can dine easily with your budget. Unfortunately, many stores have been closed, after the opening of express avenue mall. In my opinion, this is one of the best places for buying indian traditional attire, handicrafts, leather goods. Walk in and see by yourself !!"
Spencer_Plaza,JoshlineC,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Air-Conditioned Flea Market,"After a long day, ask your driver to drop you there to eat, because there is a good food court BUT the journey to your destination is filled with shops squeezed together to not waste space, displaying everything and anything; from leather jackets and pashmina scarfs to a brand new phone cases and handicrafts. People do try and persuade you to enter their shop if you so much as look in that direction, the goods itself are quite cheap compared to the shops some tuk tuk  drivers take you too, but you have to be careful in the scarf section since everything is pashmina even if you can swear its mixed polyester. The shops are all over the place and it's quite hard sometimes to locate where exactly you are since they are no maps around just names of shops as you go up each floor.Don't worry the shop vendors are quite helpful.But it you are looking for a good bargain, this is a good and cool place to start, just have a bit of patience and don't run on an empty stomach and this plaza will be enjoyable."

Also, I found it very congested"
Spencer_Plaza,Teresamea,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,The oldest mall in Chennai is still worth a visit,"This mall was packed on my first visit to India but it now has many empty shops...however, don't over look this as a shopping destination.  First the Jewel Mine (Phase I ground floor) has wonderful jewelry and with a little bargaining you can get awesome prices.  The staff is wonderfully friendly and they will also custom make jewelry for you.  In an annex to the jewelry store you can find other great items of good quality like pashmina or cashmere scarves and wraps, traditional carvings, and replicas of items like the old mogul knives.  Plan to be in this shop for a good while as there is plenty to see and they will want to show you everything lol...but in the nicest of manners.I also like Nuts N Spices to stock up on any hard to find items like premade spices for Masala Chai which I love.  If you live in a city where Indian ingredients are hard to find this is a great destination as they carry everything you might need to create that favorite Indian dish.  There are still additional nice shops for clothing and other goods at Spencer too.  Many of the newer malls gouge you on parking...but not this one.  Do check it out."

Spencer_Plaza,George J,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 ‚Ä¢ Business,"Old, Decrepit and somewhat scary",We went to this mall as we were told it had the most authentic indian shops in Chennai.
