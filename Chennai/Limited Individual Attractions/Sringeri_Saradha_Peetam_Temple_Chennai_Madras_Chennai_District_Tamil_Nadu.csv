Sringeri, a simple non-descript town whose economy runs on temple tourism is usually an important stop over for pilgrims on a religious south Indian tour. The temple is managed by the Sharadha Peetham of the Shankaracharya fame. The temple got a huge gopuram in 2014 and its campus is well kept. Lunch and Dinner in the form of prasadam meals is served free to pilgrims. Huge hygienic kitchens prepare piping hot rice served with rasam and sambar to thousands of pilgrims each day. Having the meal itself is an experience not to be missed. Kids will also love the huge fish that line the banks of river Tunga who flows nearby. Tourists can feed the fish biscuits, puffed rice and rice grains thought swimming is prohibited.One can spend a good 2 days to savour Sringeri.
