St_Mary_s_Church,SingaporeGirl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Like a good book, ignore the cover and look inside","You will want to walk slowly throughout this church and read the eulogies and memorial plaques to understand why you should not miss visiting this historic colonial church in Chennai. Regardless of your background or faith, you can not help but be touched by the fickleness of history in who survived and thrived and those who died, whether in battle or of disease, whether in their 20s or 60s. It is an extremely moving experience that anyone who is interested in the colonial history of India and for that manner, all of Southeast Asia for many fell in service in Burma, Malaysia and other lands, should not miss."

St_Mary_s_Church,Valavanur Natar... K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,A DETAILED WRITE UP ON ST MARY'S CHURCH IN FORT ST GEORGE CHENNAI,"St Mary's in Fort St George, Madras - An  Oldest Anglican Church If one is a visitor to Chennai from any part of the world or India,  it surely will be worth their while to visit this historical Anglican Church built inside fort St George,  the Seat of Power fir  the Government of Tamil Nad,  even today.St Mary's in Fort St George, Madras was consecrated in the year 1680 which makes it one of  the oldest Anglican church in Asia ,with very important historic significance in the evolution of Chennai or Madras .Sadly history tells us that  during the 3-year occupation of Fort St George by the French 1746 - 1749 , it was put to use as a water storage .The church is within Fort St George , a fort built by the British  as a  secure trading post and  completed in  1653 and then gradually kept expanding  to its present size and then went  on to become and remain the seat of the state government even today .. The church was built with private contributions, with  East India Company,  who developed the  fort , and on its own had no part in its Construction actually.  Streynsham Master 1640 - 1724,  was appointed governor  in 1678 after spending number of years with the Company based in Surat on the west coast of India .Soon after taking up the appointment in January 1678 he determined, entirely on his own initiative and without reference to London Office ,  that the settlement needed a proper church. Until then divine services had been held in the largest room in the fort, the  common room, which served as a chapel besides being put to other uses. Master and his colleagues in council contributed about half of the 800 odd Pagodas raised that is  about 400 sterling pounds in those  days and  Elihu Yale, a Merchant on the Company's rolls contributing  15 Pagodas. Rest came mostly from other Merchants in the Company's service. William Dixon was the  Chief Gunner of the East India Company's Madras Establishment and also an  Engineer  to the Army .The Governor instructed him to build the church. East India Compaany later did contribute to its  construction .The church was 80 feet by 56 feet when  originally built with  the separate tower added  sometime later and conjoined to the old church built by Dixon . The church resembles a  fortified structure to meet the security needs of those days and  St Mary's church almost finished as a bomb proof structure with over 5 ft thick walls having a  vaulted roof of 4 ft thick maximum and 2 ft minimum.Its  window shutters are about two foot wide ang more than 6 ft height .When the French bombarded   Madras in 1746, the church was  one building in the fort,  to come through unscathed. The French did manage to damage the steeple though , when they attacked again in 1758 but that was not built by Dixon, since the tower was added only around  1701 and a spire in 1710.Dixon, first  castellated the parapet and  never  used wood in the structure  to render it fire proof in the event of bombing.The interior looks beautiful although the exterior is  squat looking as a fortress should ..It has a nave with two aisles and a gallery at the far end from the altar. The roof  is vaulted with rose ornaments in relief on the curved ceiling with classical touches .The church itself derived its name Since construction commenced on 25th March 1678, My Lady Day, so it came to be christened as  the church of St Marys and consecrated on its completion on  Thursday, the 28th of October 1680. The Fort had had a Chaplain on its establishment since 1676 and the incumbent in 1680 was Richard Portman. He obtained  a special licence from the Bishop of London to consecrate the church with Streynsham Master assusting him .Being the oldest Anglican place of worship in whole of  Asia and it is  therefore associated with a number of events  in British Indian history .This  is what makes this church so special, in addition to its construction and its charming interior.The church now maintained by ASI of India still maintains a register, which is continuous since its 1680 inception, well  preserved and the volumes from 1680 to 1819 are loaned to the Fort St George Museum, a stone's throw away from the church and certainly worth a visit. A copy in thick vellum of the original register, copied in the 18th century, is on display inside the church and all original records from 1819 onwards are also available in the church for inspection, .which I did nor personally see.The credit of first entry goes to the marriage of Elihu Yale to Catherine Hynmers, on 4th November 1680,  and within a week of the original consecration with the Governor, Streynsham Master, giving away the bride. The lady was the widow of Joseph Hynmers, a Member in Council and friend of Yale, who had died in April of that year and David Yale, the son of Eli and Catherine Yale, is buried in the original churchyard, having died in 1688. Yale went on to become Governor of Madras between 1687 - 92   later endowed a building after his name in the college which later came to be called Yale University,  from his personal earning as a trader.The most famous marriage recorded in the church register is, of course ,that of Robert Clive to Margaret Maskelyne, 18t February 1753. The painting in the  alter is  by George Willison 1741 - 97 , a Scottish artist, who came out to Madras in 1774  with  the patronage of Muhammad Ali, Nawab of the Carnatic, who  himself  ane to be based in Madras by this time. St Mary's church in thii  Fort  deseves to be presented to the world for its rich heritage and history of British in India .Its heattening to lnow  it is under the very good care of the Church of South India and the maintenance is being taken care of by ASI ,India This church in my view takes its place of  pride in the historu  of Chennai."

St_Mary_s_Church,scud56,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Historic old church with a really nice ambiance,"To find St Mary's church (and the Fort George museum) you now need to get through the significant security around the Chennai administration complex that has taken over this whole area of the old fort. Hence, there may be a large queue to navigate - the police may help you queue jump if its obvious that you are a tourist rather than someone seeking to go into the administrative buildings.Once at the church the shift in ambiance is palpable and its worth spending some quiet reflective time just wandering around and taking in the history of the place and the many lives are referenced there in the plaques and gravestones."

St_Mary_s_Church,Somil A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,Church only for CATHOLIC community,"i visited this church on 25/12/17 with my wife. It was nicely decorated with LED's, flower and toys. Very neat and clean church. it was around 8 PM  father started evening prayer and after finishing prayer he came down and start giving 'PRASADAM' to people . All who so ever present in church stood up in a single line and wait for his turn.to my surprise father is not giving prasadam to everybody. i noticed the same from long distance however don't know what is happening exactly. when me and wife reached to father he asked prasadam (sweet, holy water or whatever) is only for catholic so he cant give to us. this happened with many people there and everybody was shocked how come a priest can do this kind of behavior with the children.otherwise good place for prayer."
St_Mary_s_Church,Peter S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Wonderful relic - worth visiting,"St Mary's church's origins date back to the very beginnings of English rule in Madras - the gravestones that cover the ground inside its gates testify to that. The fabric of the church's interior is later, but is still evocative of the British period, not least in the many memorials on the walls.But the most impressive thing about the church is that it is not just an historical monument - I was there on a Wednesday lunchtime, and there were easily a dozen people using it, for prayer, Bible-reading or (possibly) having a quiet snooze. Most were members of various Indian uniformed services or government servants employed nearby in the huge and busy fort.There was an interesting-looking booklet on sale 'A Walk around St Mary's' which I would have bought but there was no one around to take my money. Still, it was a most enjoyable and interesting visit: highly recommended."

It’s a real find and you should insist on a visit if you have a few hours in Chennai. Would recommend using a guide but it’s not necessary for you to really enjoy. After traveling through the city it’s great to find an oasis of calm and contemplation in the city. The historical references through memorials in the church offer considerable insight into the early period of British engagement in India. It’s a great location to relax, soak in some history and respect for religious locations. Absolutely add to your Chennai agenda. "

The church is in Fort St.George and the church building has two aisles and a nave and west end of the nave has a spacious gallery resting on carved Burma teak pillars and a tower to the west of the nave. We can find several tomb stones inscribed in Latin and Portuguese and the list of notable persons buried can also be found in the church.

Every Tuesday of the week is considered to be a special day to visit this church and every first Tuesday of the month is considered to be very special and lots of people come in to worship to St.Anthony. The faith on this church has no religious difference, not only Christians also Hindus, Muslims and people from other religion come here. People from different parts of the Chennai city as well as people from other parts of the country and even foreigners come here to worship. Adjacent to it is St.Mary's Higher Secondary School where I did my schooling, so I was lucky enought to do my prayers daily till I was studying in that school. Now I go and worship every Tuesday on my way home and pay my devotion to Mother Mary and St.Anthony.

St_Mary_s_Church,nishkalav,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014,Must visit,It's divine.. am not a christian but would encourage every one to visit this place. It's very old church with a beautiful organ that is in working condition.  There are about 18 organs in chennai and only few of them work. This church is the only Anglican Chris outside Europe.  Building will look old and majestic.

St_Mary_s_Church,greg j,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Solo,A beautiful and historic space,St Marys in a beautiful building with a feeling of great history. As with many old churches one can feel the past that seeps out of the stones and the silence that hangs in the air. If you are into old churches it is well worth a visit
St_Mary_s_Church,CyrilGubbi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Business,Old but very good,This is a lovely church near fort. This was built by the British but very well maintained. Must be more than 100 years old.
St_Mary_s_Church,Bill H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Friends,St Mary's in the fort,This little gem appears to be missed by most visitors to Chennai. If you're visiting the fort and/or the museum then search it out. It's walls are filled with history from the centuries of the British Raj. It's also a quiet corner of the administrative centre of Chennai - a reason why you'll be stopped from taking cameras in to the fort area.
St_Mary_s_Church,ASocial N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Couples,"Beautiful, peaceful oasis","If you've come to the Fort for the museum,then you should most definitely head on over to the church.  You'll need to walk towards the back of the museum, past the Army Parade ground and then reverse your steps to exit the location.The oldest Anglican church in India is reasonably well maintained and a delight to visit.  (there is no visiting on Sundays) It's open to visitors from 9-5pm, there is a service at 0915.  Here you'll find the register of marriages referencing the founder of Yale in the USA, you'll find memorial plaques to individuals of years gone by and a peaceful oasis.  The small garden is quite lovely and well worth a short wander."
St_Mary_s_Church,James G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Couples,Worth a visit ,Certainly worth it if you have time it is full of history. The place is cool and quite in the hustle and bustle of a working location.  
St_Mary_s_Church,janardhanan n,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Couples,First Anglican Church East of Suez,St.Mary's church is inside the Fort st. george compound in chennai. This was the first anglican Church to be built east of Suez!! The Fort St. george is being used as the Government secretariate and hence all the security checks to get into the compound to visit the church. Once you enter there you see a beautiful old church with a lot of memorials for all those British soldiers and traders who died in India building the empire. It is very nicely maintained. Old artefacts are carefully preserved includind the old stone baptism tray.
St_Mary_s_Church,Zinzan6,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2012 • Friends,Tranquil in the end,I visited with my 3 children.  The fort itself is very busy and it took us a while to locate the church. Once there we spent about an hour exploring. Outside we checked out the headstones with the 'pirate' headstone getting the most attention. Inside we explored the various memorials and spent some time sitting inside.  It was coming up for sunset and that added to the atmosphere. Would recommend braving the crowd for some special tranquility.
