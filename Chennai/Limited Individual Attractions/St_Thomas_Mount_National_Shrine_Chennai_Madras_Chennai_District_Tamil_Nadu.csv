St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,Dcruz10,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A National Shrine For Christians,"This place holds special religious significance for Christians in India. St.Thomas was the first Christian Evangelist to have visited a predominantly Hindu India in the first century AD.Thomas being one among the original 12 Apostles of Christ means that this is of special significance for Indian Christians considering the fact that this place holds a direct connection to the person of Christ. Pope John Paul-II came to this place on his Indian visit. But somehow, I found the place not being given its due importance unlike a place like Velankanni, for instance. The surroundings are serene and holds great viewing experience. It is a hilltop destination with a relative calm around. This is a place of Pilgrimage. A general visitor can experience  a couple of hours calm & great viewing atop the hill. Plenty of parking available at the base."

But the church was just the beautiful icing on the cake.  A statue of Mother Theresa, and another of the Pope stood in the grounds.Attached to the church is a Baby Home which houses orphaned babies and small children from the age of 3 months to 5 years.  My friend and I visited and saw how well run it was and how clean, but they can always do with some donations.We walked down the steps to the street level where we took an auto rickshaw to the train station.  A great visit and one not to be missed"

St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,Vinod500,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful Historic View Point,"I was surprised to know that there are many long time residents of Chennai who have never visited this hill top shrine. This is definitely a place worth seeing. While there are steps on the Butt Road side, we drove up the motorable road from the GST road side. We had to inquire at a couple of points to make sure we were taking the correct fork in the road. There was sufficient parking available at the top of the hill, just below the shrine.At the top is the historic shrine of St Thomas. We get a beautiful view of the city below including Metro trains. The Chennai international airport and its runways too are nice sight to view from this height, especially when planes take off and pass just above St Thomas Mount. Google maps shows the road route up, but at some places we found our mobile could not access the maps (poor signal possibly being blocked by the hill mass), and we had to ask the locals for the right way up."

Whatever your views are about this Catholic concept, once you get to the top of the (steep) hill the view is worth it. The shrine is kept nicely, and a good stop for contemplation and prayer.

St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,Sangeetha Vikram,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,St.Thomas Cathedral Basilica - Holy place of International Prominence,"On a fine Friday evening (24th Nov'17), myself along with my Bestie Disha Mary got to visit St.Thomas Cathedral Basilica. It was a beautiful Roman Catholic church located at the top of the small hillock St. Thomas Mount, near the neighborhood of Guindy. A shrine dedicated to ""Our Lady of Expectation"" (Mother Mary) was built in 1523 on top of the mount. The altar of this shrine was built on the spot where St. Thomas' death traditionally believed to have been occurred. A beautiful prayer hall was available and a separate room for doing meditation. Also, we got to see the elevated view over the city of Chennai. Offered our prayers and had wonderful blissful evening at St.Thomas Mount National Shrine."
St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,Jeannie2207,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Two reasons to visit ,"The first reason is the elevated view over the city of Chennai and surrounding countryside. The second reason is to visit the shrine where St Thomas was murdered. It‚Äôs a short climb from where you get dropped by a car, but it‚Äôs worth visiting, although without a guide you‚Äôd need to read up a bit because there‚Äôs not a lot of information at the sight. "

St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,StephenThomas7,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,DIVINE PLACE. BLESSED..!,"This is a historical place. The church is very well maintained and the place is kept clean. There is also a painting of Mother Mary which was painted by St.Luke. The painting was bought to India by St,Thomas. Really love going here. The bleeding cross of St.Thomas is also preserved and the Altar is built on that spot. Feels blessed  each and every time I go there. St.Thomas Mount Church is truly a divine place to visit."

A peaceful place to meditate and worship God and to honour St. Thomas. Please do not treat this place as a tourist attraction. It's holiness should be preserved.

It was an uphill task to climb the top where shrine was located. But after reaching the top, it was spectacular and offers a very good view of Chennai City. There is also a small souvenir shop. "
St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,Jrdominic S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Patron Saint of India and the only apostle reached the East !!!,One of the smallest and culturally rich and historically very famous Syrian style  church in Chennai. Those who believe in Jesus Christ or not or even an atheist should visit this place to admire the beauty of Our Lady of Expectation shine built on the top of the mount. If you a Catholic Christian I am sure you will get goosebumps when you enter the arch which leads to the spot where St. Thomas was martyred. Don't miss to do the WAY OF THE CROSS at this church.

St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,WilliamAllb,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Historic place,"Long established as built on the place where St Thomas was killed, this small church is a place of pilgrimage; it contains many relics, and a painting of Mary and Jesus, said to have been done by St Luke. Great panoramic views of Chennai. Open every day; long opening hours, and no entrance fee or even any expectation for a donation. There are several food stalls and a nice cafe room in the convent.Easy to reach from Alandur Metro station - but don't take an auto which charged me 170 rupees from the station to the car park at the top - summon an Ola cab: I did this and it came up within 5 minutes and charged 58 rupees!"

A revered site for Christians it is beautifully decked up during the period leading up to Christmas. One can either walk up by the stairs or use the road which winds up to the top. Visitors will get a fabulous 360 Degree view of Chennai from the top."

St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,MissCPix,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017,Learned Something New!,I had no idea the Apostle Thomas was buried here or that he was made a Saint. I enjoyed the rich history of the area and walking where someone who walked with the Messiah walked!
St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,Jim L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Peace and Tranquility - if you time it right,"Get on your walking shoes - it's only a 400 metre walk to the top, but with Chennai's heat and humidity it's a bit of a workout. (so, apparently you can also drive up, but where's the fun in that?) The walk to the top is partly lined with trees and the goats and birds are a nice distraction to the climb.There are great views of the City when the haze isn't too bad. On a less busy day, this is a place of meditation and tranquility - a perfect escape from the City below you. The primary attraction is for those interested in the Catholic/Christian faith. The site is related to the tradition that St. Thomas, one of the disciples of Jesus Christ, was martyred in India. There's a modest chapel, relics, statues and monuments.  If you're not interested in the religious aspect, just respect it and enjoy the great views."
St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,vh0920,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Incredible Visit,"This area of Chennai offers breath-taking views of Chennai, and is such a tranquil place to visit for prayer and reflection. Made 2 visits there during my stay in Chennai. Had a chance to attend the one English mass on Sunday, and met the priest after the service who blessed more than 30 rosaries I purchased to bring back to children. Just seeing the relics and the history is breath-taking. There are some wonderful hosts there to assist with any questions you have about the chapel or relics or history."

St_Thomas_Mount_National_Shrine,Andrew S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,A Let Down,"If you do not know who St Thomas is, you will not appreciate this place. It would just be another shrine on a mountain. When I came to this spot in 1993, it had a board that told a story of how Thomas, one of the disciples of Jesus Christ came to India, and was eventually speared. Today, there is no information about the place or about Thomas. What you will see is a small church, a statue of the late Pope John Paul II and the late Mother Theresa.So, unless you are on some religious pilgrimage, give this place a miss."
