We really got some good quality products across a large shopping list at good prices and the colors and smells and of course, the warmth of the people touches the soul. And the thing which got to me was that there were so many people jostling together in such a cramped place. The thing which I did not appreciate was that there was garbage piled up too in the middle of the road and nobody seemed to mind. I do think the place needs a practical transformation while keeping its soul intact since it is crowded beyond what most humans should experience and should live with else it will deteriorate and most well-heeled travellers will simply avoid it and that will not be good for the city."

T_Nagar_Ranganathan_Street,Valavanur Natar... K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,My views on Ranganathan street T Nagar,"In today's world where materialism is growing at break neck speed commercial marketing takes on different hues to meet the aspiration of every citizen of this state not just those living in the city but from villages around the metro to shop for what they want at a price they can afford. Ramanathan street trading houses and shops might just fullfill that need .But I must caution the new shoppers that they must be aware that most building don't conform to  safety norms specially the multi storey ones as they are built on violations of laid down rules and regulations. There have been fire accidents and fire department has had issues of navigating  the fire tenders in that narrow . Proximity to the important Mambalam Railway staton is  boon and a bane specially for those living in suburbs .For most middle and lower middle class people it sure is a best place to shop what ever they need at very affordable and baragainable price .Every consumer product including textiles ,toys ,furnuture cooking items stationary, spices, coffee powder ,Rain water, school.uniform and bags you name it and one could get it here A  vegetable market adds to the facilities and  people travelling by train to suburbs can easily pick up fresh veggies too before boarding the train for home .But new visitors to this street specially during festival season has to beware of Chain snatchers and pick pocketeters , which has been reported as common . Police do their best to keep.things under control but it does happen .For motorist Using the fly over that ends at the junction of Ranganathan  street it's sure will be a long wait ,due to heavy pedestrian crossing . A sub way at this point for pedestrian crossing could have gone a long way. Ranganathan street may be a paradise for many shoppers but to residents off the Area it's a big woe for their life has changed for ever ."

T_Nagar_Ranganathan_Street,srk1968,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,"Plenty of shops, crammed street, big shops encroach the street, municipality watches quietly","The street is a great place to buy most things you want for clothing, groceries, plants, seeds, household items, etc. On most days (except days like the Pongal or Diwali holiday) between 8.30 am to 8.30 pm you will have to squeeze yourself through the mass of people throbbing through the street. The bigger shops brazenly encroach the street by putting out platforms outside their stores displaying their wares. This reduces the space for people to walk. Forget trying to drive on anything even a bicycle though you may be able to push a bicycle through by walking alongside it."

T_Nagar_Ranganathan_Street,vairav2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Bargain shopping at its best!,"Whether you are new to Chennai or not, being in Chennai is incomplete without a visit into Ranganathan Street in T Nagar.Ranganathan street is bang in the middle of the city and is a shopping heaven for bargain shoppers.  There are numerous platform shops and also chain of stores that are located in this street.  In here, you will be able to purchase goods of very low value to expensive ones.If you are into clothing and fashion accessories, your visit to this street is a must!Now, the most famous shopping district of Chennai is not all bed of roses.  It has its own thorns as well.First, car/bike parking - you will never be able to park your vehicles near this street.  So, it is strongly advised that you come in a taxi or any other form of public transport (the local railway station called ""Mambalam"" is conveniently situated).Second, climate control - apart from a few chain of stores, you have to literally sweat it out here, especially in the summer.Third, safety - you have to be really careful with your belongings.Fourth, toilet facilities - unfortunately, there are no proper toilets around this shopping locale and that is a huge downside.With all the above challenges, this has always remained a favourite shopping space for me and I'm sure you would like it too.BTW, there are a lot of eateries nearby - that should keep you going throughout the day!"

You name the style and it is here, from traditional wear to fashionable wear. I visited during Navratri and the place had a festive look.All shops were decorated, one of them even had coluring activity to keep the kids busy, while you shop. A must visit place. I would highly recommend Sundari silks which has a parking area, otherwise it is difficult to park in this crowded place.Also RMKV,Paciappa,Nalli are some of the best shops with excellent staff."

T_Nagar_Ranganathan_Street,babuvis51,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Shopping delight,"Anyone who visits Chennai and wishes to enjoy the variety of goods on display, he/she should pass through Ranganathan street. From small textile shops, mobile vendors to big and famous Jayachandran textiles, Saravana stores selling textiles, vessels and other household goods, the entire street is for delightful shopping. There are other shops selling vegetables, books, pooja items, readymade garments, chudithar materials etc. A little bit of bargaining skills will fetch good returns. But whatever textile material a person wants to buy it should be checked thoroughly for damages or uneven colouring. Weight and number of pieces should also be ensured. The street will be crowned during evenings and holidays and people have to be careful with their purses and other valuables.  While shopping it is advisable to keep all belonging close or a member of the family to take care of them. Happy and delightful shopping."

People are very good they will reduce the money if u really want them to buy. U can see Saravanan stores on both left and right side of the street , good among them is the last Saravanan which is close to shop GANI.

T_Nagar_Ranganathan_Street,preggyn2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,T Nagar shopping Chennai,Chennai is a place where locals and tourists do lots of shopping. Transport is cheap and readily available. Just be careful not to get ripped off by the local Autos(Tuc Tuc). Either get a local to help the conversation or use the OLA app which is quick to download. We paid like 120INR to the Belstead and 6km away and didn’t mind to pay a little more than the drivers asked as it is very cheap coming from another country. We did this to support the local people. There are lots of cheap stuff everywhere. Don’t leave stuff to come back to as you probably never will. If you want something rather take it while you can. A day is not enough to shop at T Nagar. Remember the quality might not be the best but I suppose you get what you pay for. Enjoy the experience🙏
T_Nagar_Ranganathan_Street,pradrao60,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Business,Famous icon of Theagaraya Nagar!!,"Shop from a variety of stores at Ranganathan Street, in Theagaraya Nagar, widely regarded as one of the most crowded areas in Chennai. Tightly packed with visitors, the street features mostly jewellery and clothing stores, which range from inexpensive to high end. One will find bargains even in the costly establishments. It was the usual practice those days to name the streets after the first resident, irrespective of their class, caste or contribution to the community. Ranganathan Street ought to have been named Rangaswamy Iyengar Street after the first resident of that street. However, T. Rangaswamy Iyengar, a retired Civil Servant of the erstwhile Madras Presidency, who built his house in this street in the early 1920s, when approached by civil authorities for his formal approval, requested it be named after Lord Ranganatha of Srirangam temple. Usman Road is on one end of the street and at the other end is the Mambalam (local electric) train station. On the street, we can find many commercial establishments, ranging from street hawkers selling safety pins to big stores selling gold jewellery. Many vegetable vendors also sell their wares on Ranganathan Street. Throughout the year, the street is full of people. Traditionally, it is busiest during Deepavali festival, as this street offers consumers the opportunity to purchase a variety of commodities. The most famous among the establishments on Ranganathan Street is the Saravana Stores. Ranganathan Street is a famous icon of T. Nagar and due to its proximity to Mambalam railway station, people from all parts of Chennai and Tamil Nadu flock to the Street for shopping, especially during festive seasons.We visited this street recently to purchase various items for the ensuing festive season and found the crowd so over-whelming that we got out of there immediately after our shopping!Put Theagaraya Nagar, Ranganathan Street on your schedule. But a serious warning to all visitors to this place: crowded places attract pickpockets; so kindly stay aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings during your stroll along this busy thoroughfare."
