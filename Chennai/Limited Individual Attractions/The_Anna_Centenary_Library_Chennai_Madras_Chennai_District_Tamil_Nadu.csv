The_Anna_Centenary_Library,Vinod500,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 â€¢ Solo,Huge Library Mismanaged,"My recent visit to this library was disappointing and saddening. I visited the Periodicals section on the 1st floor. The daily newspapers were current. However, I was shocked to find only June and July issues of India Today, Time etc. Magazines like Business India, Business Today, Forbes India, Open, Economist etc were nowhere to be seen. Most shelves were totally empty. I had gone to the same library a year ago, when the current issues of all these magazines were available for reading in the library. So I inquired with the staff why the deterioration in the last one year. They were apologetic, and said subscription to periodicals like India Today, Forbes India, Open etc have been renewed recently and December issues will be on the shelves. It took them 6 months to renew subscriptions! It smacks of mismanagement of this public resource at the top levels."

We visited the library during summer vacation and could make it only the Children's section and not to all the 9 floors due to paucity of time. The children's section had a good collection of books along with reading area for kids. Kids can read the books there itself and children's books are not rented to be taken out. The children can read as many books as they want and can spend almost the whole day there as there is a huge collection of books. School children volunteer on weekends / holidays to sort out, categorize and arrange the books properly.There is a canteen in the library campus, though it is little far behind the library building. The library is maintained better compared to other government establishments. However, the canteen needs better maintenance and air conditioning, as it gets very hotter during the summer.The overall campus is very good with very little to complain about. Since it was a long weekend on summer holidays, many of the services like Aavin parlour, ATMs, snacks & soft drinks delivery kiosks inside the library building were not working."

The_Anna_Centenary_Library,Sagar M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 â€¢ Friends,Not worth a visit,"The library is in dire need of attention. The structure itself is new and spacious, however the collection of books is more suited for regional literature lovers (even there, I cant vouch for the collection). Those wanting to do some research, there are no plug points for you to plug in your laptops. Stick to pen and paper. Refreshments are not available, staff is least bothered and not friendly.Even the courts have criticised the management of this library. Such a shame."

It has almost all the English magazines both Indian and Foreign magazines like Time, The Economist, Forbes to name a few. it's sad that even those nearby are not aware of this and all these magazines remain idle on the shelves. They have a good collection of History books of all countries on the 7th floor. I even saw Nandan Nilkeni's Imagining India. I am yet to explore the other sections. These books are much better than the rubbish optimized results that Google give us. After my first visit, I have now planned to visit the Library regularly. Moreover all the sections are air conditioned."

The_Anna_Centenary_Library,Tamilian S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 â€¢ Solo,Great place.,"Just love it. Frequent it at least once a week. Great books in psychology and film are here. I love how they've managed to keep things consistently quiet here. But, I wish they'd put in a little more effort arranging the books. Also, a database on the internet with all of its books would be wonderful. I could look it up online and then decide whether to pay the library a visit. Very comfortable though, and I feel lucky living pretty close by."
