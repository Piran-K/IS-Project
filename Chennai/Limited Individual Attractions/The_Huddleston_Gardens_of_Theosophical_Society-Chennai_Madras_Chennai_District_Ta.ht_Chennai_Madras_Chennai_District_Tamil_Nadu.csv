The_Huddleston_Gardens_of_Theosophical_Society-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Ta.ht,bjerkseth,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo,Oasis in urban jungle,"Had to travel nearly 40 minutes in this humongous city to reach, and came in by a back gate. The weather nice, and the garden sort of wild, with plenty of trees, a real oasis. The pride is an old Banian tree, measuring 70 x 100 meters, but it’s difficult to get a sense of it, as the Banyan is sending DOWN air roots, which will take root, and it looks like a forest by itself. However, I take them on their word. It was nearly empty, a work day - so I had the garden almost for myself. Beautiful magenta water lilies, some other lilies among the grass, and at least two tall trees full of mega bats, which I think are Flying Dogs, sort of. They made bird like sounds. It was also a loud choir of bird song.Along one of the roads were temples, and churches for different religions - a liberal Catholic Church (whatever that might be), a Hindu temple, a Singh shrine. All in all, I made the round in an hour or so, and was back in ChennI reality coming out of the main gate. Thousands of cars, scooters, tuktuks, fumes and exhaust, noise and serious pollution. Glad I went there, will I go again? Don’t think so. And I had a serious feeling that the Theosophical Society is a dying breed. "
The_Huddleston_Gardens_of_Theosophical_Society-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Ta.ht,roshu6682,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,A calm and peaceful place for a good stroll. ,"Despite being a resident of Chennai for nearly 12 years now and staying for some time close to the locality yet it took me a long while to visit the theosophical society gardens, the reason is simply due to the inconvenient timings when visitors are allowed. This place has free entry but only on weekdays from 8:30am to 10:30am and then again from 2pm to 4pm which happens to be the least favored timing for any Chennai resident to venture outdoors due to the heat. Early morning and evening walks are hence not a possibility and that is a shame because the canopy of trees and pathways are delightful and an early morning or evening walk accompanied by bird song would have been the best way to experience the place. I happened to be there in the vicinity and had 1 hour to kill as i was waiting for someone to turn up and hence decided to drop in as it was a hot but not so sunny day. A stroll of 1.2 kms was comfortable and there is good tree cover and foliage to delight the walker. Trees were named with little boards displayed but there were no proper gardens to linger on. Benches to relax were also very few. No drinking water facility hence do bring your own water if you set out to walk. The banyan tree is more like a complex of trees now and is mind-blowing to behold. The place is clean and dust bins are set up hence pls do not litter. Recommended for nature lovers. Kids would get bored. One star less due to unreasonable visiting hours and lots of scope to develop the place into a blooming garden attraction which Chennai lacks. "

The book store is well-stocked with many books by several authors.  Anyone of the 60s would have a nice time here.  Check for when flowers are blooming.  Double Check for dates closed, i.e., Christmas day is closed.  When you get dropped at one of 2 gates, just follow the road for about 20-30 minutes to get to the other gate."

The Banyan tree is one of the largest in the country and worth a visit just for that. Since it is a garden the place is ideal for walks in the morning or evening if the chennai weather permits.

The_Huddleston_Gardens_of_Theosophical_Society-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Ta.ht,rradice123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017,A quiet place in a busy Chennai,"I fully enjoyed the opportunity to visit and spend some time walking in this garden where many Theosophical primaries have walked before.  I would have liked to see more, but we had to leave for another adventure that day.  The Banyan trees here are just amazing.  There is also a museum of sorts and a library that are worth visiting.  Go if you have the chance."

The_Huddleston_Gardens_of_Theosophical_Society-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Ta.ht,jensings2,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Peaceful stroll,What a lovely oasis in the middle of Chennai! I would recommend going with someone who can explain things about the vegetation and to take the time to go into the library and see if someone will let you into the room on the 1st floor (it is locked) to see the precious books. Loved the experience! Make sure you get permission to use your camera. You may need to go to the main office to get it and you may need to pay some guards to get the permission. Bring low denominations of money to pay (like 20 rupee bills).

It is akin to a Botanical Garden given the variety of flora it showcases. The place is not maintained very well but it was great to see the temple/church/mosque, etc. in one space. There are good libraries on Theology too. Great place if you are interested in the subject or in simple greenery."
The_Huddleston_Gardens_of_Theosophical_Society-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Ta.ht,Di-walker,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Forest like Environment in middle of the Metro,"Extremely good place.  Perfect location for self-introspection, meditation, positive vibrations and for (an internal) spiritual journey.   Stayed for 3 memorable days, enjoyed every minute of association with the nature (though walking around after Sun-set calls for extreme caution and alertness).  In case you have some little understanding of the Mahatmas associated with this Society, you will be thrilled to roam around the place, which was blessed by all time Great personalities like Jiddu Krishna Murthy, Madam Blavatsky, Annie Besant, to name a few.  Good Luck - God Bless."

The_Huddleston_Gardens_of_Theosophical_Society-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Ta.ht,Shyam C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Where you are one with nature.,"Formally known as Theosophical Society Of India and situated on the banks of the Adyar river where the river meets the Bay of Bengal. An institution which is well over a century old and has been visited by legends from across the world.Even today the place stands out for its tranquility and greenery. Testimony is a Banyan tree over a century old and spread over almost 2 square kilometres.A library which boasts of a magnificent collection of books. A multi faith organisation housing Hindu, Buddhist temples and a Church as well . You could well spend a whole day watching the sunset into the sea in the evening."

For others it is not worth while a visit. The personality cult of the founders, especially of Madam Blavatsky is outright annoying."

Besides, at least once in a year I make it my destination to get away from the feeling that I live in a bustling,  noisy metro.Nothing comes close unless I hit the Western Ghats or the Forests there. Closest thin to heaven on earth in Chennai."
The_Huddleston_Gardens_of_Theosophical_Society-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Ta.ht,Jaffathecat1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,This has to be the most peaceful place in Chennai ,"Whilst the opening times are somewhat restrictive, the gardens & main building are magnificent. If you ask, you might even be allowed to look inside the main building which has a beautiful marble dinning area with interesting wall adornments. The gardens are extensive, although they would benefit from maybe a layout plan at the each of the entrances. Be sure to seek out several old Banyan trees which are quite a sight"

I visited this place several times as a part of CTC cleanup activities. The thick woods inside the place and the great Banyan tree with small pond and Buddha temple makes it a great place to send early mornings.There are visiting hours too and makes up a good place to visit in Chennai for a relaxed day."
The_Huddleston_Gardens_of_Theosophical_Society-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Ta.ht,Bala Iyer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016,Amazing Experience.. Peace!,"Get in either through the gate opposite to Malar Hospital or through Besant Avenue road. SLRs are not allowed without prior approvals, phone cams are allowed. Give a letter in writing to the managing officer if in case you need to use SLRs, if lucky you can get approvals on the same day or you would be given a different date. Banyan tree is the speciality here, spread across 1 acre, more than 400 years old, mother tree is no more. "

And they are closed on all public holidays. Its a total silence zone, so be aware if you are taking kids along. The campus is totally covered in green and you wont hear a sound of the busy traffic outside the campus."
