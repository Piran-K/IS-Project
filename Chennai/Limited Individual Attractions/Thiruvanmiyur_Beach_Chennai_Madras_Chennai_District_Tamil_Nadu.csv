Jain_Temple,Karpagavalli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Divine,"The place is well maintained and has to be appreciated for the cleanliness and calmness. The buildings were mesmerising, garden was beautiful. "
Jain_Temple,rashmi k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Pious and beautiful,"The architecture is beautiful. One must visit this for the beauty. God statues inside are also so real and beautiful. The place was windy and hence felt relaxed and peaceful. If informed earlier, can plan for prasadam lunch there itself. Plenty of space for parking. Follow the google maps and make sure you to take a u turn as suggested. If travelling with children, carry water and eatables as nothing is available at a close vicinity. But worth visiting. This temple is in Nemmeli, near Mahabalipuram, ECR. It is open between 7 AM to 7 PM"
Jain_Temple,harleen_sethi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Peaceful Jain Temple,One very famous and beautiful Jain temple is in GN Chetty Road. There are many others in Chennai. It’s a very calm and serene place to spend some time during your visit. One gets to feel the almighty’s presence on visiting this temple. God bless!
Jain_Temple,Anand G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Great ambiance and good architecture,"This is a lovely temple (Shanthinath Jain Temple) located in G N Chetty Road. The  main entrance is unpretentious but once you enter the courtyard you are welcomed by the statues of a pair of life sized elephants. That alone would bowl you over. Beyond that the flight of steps lead to the sanctum. As is popular with Jain temples, it is marbles all the way. The architecture is attractive. The atmosphere is  great. The silene is not deafening but pleasant and invigorating. Excellent place to visit to control stress and recharge bang within the city. Its popularity among the devotees is indicated by the number of high end cars arriving and departing the gates throughout the day."

Jain_Temple,shanks123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Good place in between the rush,"I have always wanted to visit this place, but alas I never got to visit it for a very long time, This place used to come in my evening walks when I was placed in chennai , still never managed to enter and check out what is in store, one day I just entered and was pleasently surprised by the temple .It is built in a white marble and is surrounded by lots of greenery , as it is very difficult to fathom a such a place in middle of city in T nagar , GN chetty road . I found it very clean and noise free and a good place to visit apart from the asthetic sense ."
