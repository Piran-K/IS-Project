Thiruverkadu_Devi_Karumariamman_Temple-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Tamil_Nad.ht,Dr. Senthil Kumar. D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,"ARULMIGU DEVI KARUMARIAMMAN TEMPLE, THIRUVERKADU","One of the sportive arts of Devikarumari. One day Devikarumari took the image of old nomadic lady and went to Sun to forecast his future. Without realising her as Devikarumari, He simply neglected her. Devikarumari immediately vanished. Sun has lost it's brightness and its glory started declining. Realising his mistake He begged Devikarumari to forgive and excuse him. Sun also requested Devikarumari to celebrate Sunday as the day of Devikarumari. Devikarumari also accepted it.He also got permission from Her to pour on her sun rays twice in a year in the month of Panguni and Purattasi. So Sunday is celebrated as the day of Karumari . We can happily witness the scene of sun rays falling on the head of Devikarumari twice in a year. Devikarumari made Narayanan Seat there.Once upon a time Lord Thirumal came to Thiruverkadu to witness the grace rule of Umadevi. When Thirumal personally met his sister Karumari, she requested him ""to seat there as Srinivasan of Thirumurai and assist Her and bless the devotees who worship Navagraham and stand towards southern direction"". He was happy and promised Her, that He would sit by her side and protect the position of Nine planets. Veda Viyasar was extremely happy to see Annai Parasakthi and Lord Venkatesan together."

Thiruverkadu_Devi_Karumariamman_Temple-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Tamil_Nad.ht,plpalani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Powerful Devi,This temple is well known for the powerful Devi Karumariamman. On Tuesday’s it is crowded... hence go with Rs50 entry ticket or Rs20 .Free darshan takes time.
Thiruverkadu_Devi_Karumariamman_Temple-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Tamil_Nad.ht,saranyaupendaran,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,An oasis of peace in the midst of chaos,"This is one of the most famous devi temples in Chennai, and as a result, is very crowded on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.  The sanctum sanctorum houses a beautifully decorated bust of the goddess Karumariamman, and devotees are allowed to worship in small groups of 15-20 people in order to avoid congestion in the very narrow space.The streets around the temple are very crowded and traffic moves in a chaotic manner.   Better traffic regulation is definitely required.  There is no chappal stand, and footwear is left in a haphazard manner all around the entrance to the temple.   The highway leading to the temple is also in bad condition, potholed and narrow.  The temple is open on all days from 5am in the morning and closes only at 9.30pm.  On Sundays which are especially auspicious to visit the goddess, the temple opens and closes an hour earlier and later.   There are special entry tickets for Rs.50/- and Rs.20/- in addition to the free darshan queue.  The 50/- rupee entry tickets allows you a closer look at the goddess.The temple has a legend associated with the sun god.  Parvathi Devi is believed to have visited Surya in the guise of an old woman, ostensibly to forecast his future, but was not received with respect.  Furious, she cursed Surya to lose his divine radiance, and the penitent sun god is believed to have undertaken severe penance in order to have his radiance restored.   The rays of the sun also fall directly on the idol of the goddess twice in a year, during the Tamil months of Purattasi and Panguni.The temple can be covered in half a day along with the Vedapureeswarar temple, also at Thiruverkadu, and the Kamakshi amman temple at Mangadu.  The ambience would be even better if the temple was kept clean."

Thiruverkadu_Devi_Karumariamman_Temple-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Tamil_Nad.ht,RamGanesan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Powerful Devi Temple,I have been in Chennai for decades but did not get the opportunity to visit this place till last week.  Though the Adi celebrations were over the streets were still crowded. The access to the temple is really congested from all sides.  Though there is a parking for vehicles getting to the parking is the biggest challenge.  The devi is in a small form and one can feel her presence the moment we near the sanctum.  Commercialization is evident and long q and paid darshan seem to have become the norm.  That is the sad part.  If one can ignore these aspects then the darshan could be peaceful.  A very famous temple that draws crowds from all over south india.  Best to avoid going on Fridays holidays and the tamil month of Aadi.

Thiruverkadu_Devi_Karumariamman_Temple-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Tamil_Nad.ht,Karthik R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Divine experience,Divine experience guaranteed. The temple is located 5 minutes walk from the Thiruverkadu bus stand in quite narrow lanes. The parking space is very limited near the temple and even the streets around are very narrow and difficult to park. Mind it.The temple has free dharshan and paid dharshan - for Rs.20 and Rs.50. The temple is normally crowded in weekend and public holidays. It takes around 1 hour if you go on normal dharshan on weekends.
Thiruverkadu_Devi_Karumariamman_Temple-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Tamil_Nad.ht,segar s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,My calling to this temple again.,"Its my second visit to this temple. Starting from outside, there are rows of flower shops but the sales persons of all the shops will call out to buy from them, which can put anyone in stress to choose. This is an old temple with interesting carvings, like many huge temples it need to be taken care of. Strong vibration felt here especially at the main sanctums. Forget everything even yourself and concentrate on the deity and ou will know what I mean.If you don't like the pushing and being sandwiched by the crowd avoid Fridays, important events and festivals.There is also a small shrine outside the main temple, inside is giant puthu ( snake pit ). "
Thiruverkadu_Devi_Karumariamman_Temple-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Tamil_Nad.ht,Prabhakaran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,One of the best Sakthi Sthala near Chennai,This temple gives me nostalgic memories. My mother is very emotionally connected to the goddess here and have been visiting this place for 30+ years now. The temple is in tiruverkadu and you need to take a right turn after you pass underneath the outer ring road in the koyambedu poonamallee high road. The temple is crowded during holidays and if you are travelling by car then parking might be a challenge. There is a parking facility about 500metres from the temple. You can approach the parking from a parallel road if the temple street is crowded. The look of goddess fills you with lots of eternal energy. There is a special darshan tickets to be bought at the main entrance. There is a huge ant hill that is believed to be presided by the snake god. People offer egg and milk here and yes the place is low on cleanliness due to excessive egg/milk spills but beliefs are on a high!!. Visit early morning during weekdays for a good experience.

In case one needs to have peaceful darshan and want to meditate in the premises they have to choose the days with no festival or week-ends or Tuesday or Friday. During festival days thousands of devotees throng to have a glimpse of the Goddess."

Over all we had good dharshan on Wednesday. During Friday,Sunday and other festive days, devotees throng the temple and generally one has to wait around 50 minutes even in paid queue. There 2 paid queues-one is Rs.20/- per head and another one is Rs.50/- per head. In Rs.50/- entrance, they allow only 10-15 people at a time for dharshan. There is also free dhardhan available."
