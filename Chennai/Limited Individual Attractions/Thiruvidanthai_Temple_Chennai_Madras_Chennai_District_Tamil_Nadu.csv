K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,An interesting place to visit The Nithyakalayana Perumal temple in Thiruvadanthai Chennai,"A marriage in my family gave me an opportunity to visit this unique temple with my wife where marriage is conducted for perumal daily .This Nithyakalayana Perumal temple with huge temple pond is  built  in dravidian  architecture anddates back to 2000 years and is situated  in Thiruvidandai  village in Chennai, off the scenic  coast of ECR , near KovalamBeach in Chengalpattu district of Tamil Nadu.It was built by the  Pallavas during the 7th century CE, with later additions being  made by the  Cholas during the 11th century.It is dedicated to Varaha, the boar avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu and  glorifies  the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Nithyakalayana Perumal (Varaha) and his consort  Lakshmi as Komalavalli Thayar.This temple follows  Tenkalai tradition of worship with four daily rituals including his wedding.The Hindu sage Kalava,  wanted Vishnu to marry his 360 daughters.Lord Vishnu in Varaha firm marries  the 360 daughters one per day during the course of the whole year. Since he is believed to marry maidens daily, he came to be known as Nithyakalyana Perumal (meaning the deity who marries for eternity).Indeed an interesting temple to visit !"
