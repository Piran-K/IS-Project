University_of_Madras,GuelphTraveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Solo,Important Architecture in Chennai,You can walk onto Oxford University and Harvard and virtually any university in the world as a tourist and take pictures but not the University of Madras. You can photograph from the street but the trees make it difficult. This restriction on photography is a serious obstacle for tourists and researchers in India. However the Senate building is an important Indo-Sarcenic building which is a Victorian picturesque style with blended Italian and Sarcenic designs. It is the masdterpiece of architect Robert Chisholm and was completed in 1873. In addition the Presidency College which gave photo permission is also on site and is another good example of the style. There are other interesting buildings in the area including the crumbling remains of the Chepauk Palace (1768) once the home of the Nawab of Arcot.

University_of_Madras,dksud,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2013 • Solo,"Senate Hall - Marvelous architect, fantastic history","Madras University, established in 1857, must be one of the oldest Universities of India. I just happened to view the dome of Madras University's Senate Hall from across the MGR Samadhi at Marina Beach and was immediately attracted by beautiful domes painted with vibrant colors. I am glad that I walked through the subway to this great monument.The architect from outside is so captivating that I took numerous rounds of the Hall to capture it in my camera from various angles. From the outside the architect dominated by domes appears Islamic. But from inside, there is a complete transformation in style. With its tainted glasses, curved walls, long pillars, painted ceiling and a podium, it can pass as a beautiful Catholic church. Carvings of Hindu gods and godesses  on the columns at the entrance compliment the architect blend.Architect alone is not the only attraction. There is a permanent exhibition of documents, photographs and  paintings depicting not only the history of Madras University but also history of education institutes starting from 11th Century.Some of most important documents display the curriculum, salary paid to teachers and allowance paid to students during height of Chola dynasty in South.Building and its surroundings can do with some improvement is house keeping. I would rate it the best toursit attraction of Chennai after Mahabalipuram."
University_of_Madras,Aaqarsh Aiyyar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2012 • Solo,Artificially natural!,The East India Company (and the British Government) should be attributed to the grand architecture that stands tall for more than a century. The University is diagonally opposite to the world-famous Marina beach. But my favourite area is the library which I've been visiting regularly for the past two decades. You can enjoy the melodious music of humming birds if you get an opportunity to sit on the corridor of the library around six in the evening. The sound of waves is also heard at times. Highly recommended for nature lovers!
