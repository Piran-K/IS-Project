VGP_Golden_Beach,Anil,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,"Pathetic , avoid visiting","i had visited there on 13th of Dec , please do not go otherwise you will end up wasting your money and will feel very unsafe . Out of 12 rides for which they charges 500 , only 10 is available that also all of them looks rusty and dirty . No one wearing mash including operators , cafe service person or counter person even not wearing mask . The sanitizer bottles are filled with blue water . The beach is very dirty , no maintenance at all . Local authority should seal this place as it can become a hub for new cluster . Please do not visit ..."
VGP_Golden_Beach,RoSè,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2020 • Friends,Best to worst,"VGP golden beach is the best place.it will be almost busy on weekends.it is a decent place but the problem is that someone once complained about some issue regarding couple there..the one who complained don't have guts to ask them question! Straightly calls the cops and complains because of him our day got ruined we came to work out and play games. They told us not to play any games like volley ball,bad minton etc.., if once again complain arises they said they will Put case on us seriously!!If these so called ip doesn't wants local ppl like us to chill there 🙄🙄i don't understand! you have rights to ask one who does wrong not the one doing nothing just spending quality time there. Ppl should be aware of not throwing plastic here and there because they are Dustbins (4) while you leave the beach...let the water creature live free without plastic!☺that's our responsibility."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Mrudula,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Cleanest beach,This beach is located at the outskirts of the chennai city and it is the cleanest and vast beach and good to go with family or friends
VGP_Golden_Beach,Balasubramanian R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,VGP golden Beach,VGP Golden Beach is one of the attractions and beach is little outskirt of chennai city. One can enjoy sea water and cool breeze. We enjoyed this place during evening and climate was pleasant. Entrance can be from Golden resort and VGP Universal Kingdom. Beach is clean.

Kids really enjoyed taking bath in the sea and the rides and many more to see inside the beach. It's a wonderful experience. We found many places where many movies were shot. It was nice identify the locations are from VGP Golden Beach. It's a must visit place. Taking about the food.. We like only tiffens and snacks in Chennai. Overall its a must visit place for a family or friends. 
VGP_Golden_Beach,Abhishek Rai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo,Well maintained beach,It’s a private beach of VGP universal kingdom.Super clean beach but didn’t have any beach chaise lounge.It will be better if equipped with necessary equipments
VGP_Golden_Beach,rjsumanth,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,"Good one, better maintenance would be required","First things first, you cant go to the beach only. You have to buy a ticket to the Theme park and it includes beach too. Going to beach only (without the Theme park) is NOT allowed. -- Beach is good and is better than public beaches as its a private beach-- Theme park has got many dry rides and wet rides(water based rides)-- I thought Food is little bit expensive, considering that Theme park ticket is high. Tip: Go to the Theme park early in the morning, cover the dry rides before afternoon, have lunch and relax in the shade and in the evening after 4 pm you can go for water rides.-- For water rides you need to wear their uniform/water clothes. I heard that they won't allow your own Nylon/Lycra clothes."

It is not that there are visiting hours of this statue, this statue is actually a living human statue whose name is Mr. Abdul Haziz.Abdul wears an Indian attire and holds a stick in his hands, dresses traditionally with a turban on his head stands here for six hours from morning till evening Non-stop without even blinking his eyes."

VGP_Golden_Beach,ArchitaRoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Thrill rides with serene sunset,"Vgp Golden beach surely has the best of both the worlds. One can spend the day enjoying the rides, have a nice lunch at the in house restaurant and in the evening can go to the beach to watch the serene sunset.The only drawback I felt was the water rides were not at par with the dry rides."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Ra_Radha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Poor Maintenance and High Ticket price,"It used to be the top item on every tourist in Chennai. But, oflate, these people have started charging high entry fees, but, no value or worth. Eateries inside charge 3x normal price for food items and no proper maintenance or hygiene. Rides are dangerous or not working or out of order. "
VGP_Golden_Beach,vikasmardia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,golden beach,the oldest and landmark amusement park located on bay of Bengal just on outskirts of Chennai city on mahabalipuram road is a must visit tourist attraction

VGP_Golden_Beach,Rucha121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Theme Park with many rides not functional,"You pay nearly 400/- for entry tickets for all rides, however, majority of rides will be closed or under maintenance. The very few rides that are open, will have big queues. Then what is use of charging such high entry fees. Food and water is very expensive inside. No longer VGP is attractive, just looting tourists."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Rahul D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Not very Golden,"The golden beach was one of the beaches which used to be clean but nowadays it has changed a lot and become dirty like many other beaches, the smell of fishes is so bad that I felt like vomiting at times. This beach also has an amusement park, which I didn't visit but from the outside, it looked just an average park. Overall, this is OK type beach and I won't say that it's a must visit, you can skip this."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Amit Rit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,Good going towards bad,Half of the rides do not work compared to the entry fees charged. Beach is clean. Overall maintenance and stuff quality can be improved. Good for Kids over 5 years.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Sb R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Dirty beach. Money trap,"I have visited this beach last week with my and friend's family. It charges handsome amount as entry fee and again collects huge charges for all important rides inside the park. The mandatory costume for water world is also chargable @ Rs 150, probably more than the amount it was purchased. The food vendors inside the park  are of the quality of footpath stalls and have no concern about hygiene. We were chosen the place mainly to introduce our kids to a friendly and clean beach. But, it was opposite. The beach was dirty like hell. It doesnot have swimming facility. There is no change room to change clothes also."
VGP_Golden_Beach,rahulgautam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,the golden beach,more than the beach the amusement park takes all the credit if this place. water slides are amazing. although a bit expensive it deserves a visit from the children. lots of swings and slides. if you go there make sure you have 4 to 6 hours of time to enjoy this place.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Priyanka T,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Very bad experince,Not a good place no management. I will suggest not to visit this place. Total waste of money. They don't deliver what the promise. No stars for this resort

A total must visit.. very unique and the painter Mr. Shrethar a very humble gentleman was kind enough to offer us i for on his future exhibitions also. They also have a person to help you take your photos correctly. A must for kids for sure 
VGP_Golden_Beach,ReetaKarki,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Sun and water,Had a good time going to the beach with friends. But water is not that clean and extreme hot weather of chennai makes it a little difficult to enjoy.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Stevens Manuel,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Think twice,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 days and there were quite few nice things about the resort.1. Most staff were friendly2. Rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable3. The bathroom, though the Jacussi does not work is one of the best. Really big and  open to sky and 24hrs hot waterNow to negatives1. WiFi does not work at all. I had to miss two key meetings because of this. Now to their credit they did try to fix it even in rain but it just did not work.2. Over the phone I was told that my check out time of 12 can be considered and extended. But on the departure date they stood their ground and made me and my pregnant wife to depart by 12. In spite of only about 30%occupancy. They say it is because I booked through make my trip. Possibly because I got a decent offer online. I would have expected a hardly occupied resort to try and win mire customers.3. Rooms smell damp and fungal. Very little scope for air to come in.Bottom line: think twice before booking here. Not worth it"

VGP_Golden_Beach,sushil arora,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Avg. Park  with carelessness,"It has three parks in one , if any one haS to visit they have purchase 2 of them avg. Price 600 first is amusement park which includes beach second is water park and last snow park. The best one was snow park.the park authority must take care of hygiene and safety of visitor."
VGP_Golden_Beach,fhanifdeen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Golden Beach environment is excellent.,Refresh the mind and healing and inspiration to give consistent environment philosophy. The garden has been designed more beautiful beaches and interrelated manner. South Indian films are also available images that I have heard. Biodiversity and its artistic design environment is excellent.
VGP_Golden_Beach,VishwasCR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Cheap and best amusement park,"This is an awesome amusement park, may be one of the oldest of it's kind. I remember visiting here as a kid and now I took my kid here. Many things remained same, made me feel nostalgic. A total entertainer for the entire family. You can easily spend a day for a family hangout. Trust me, you will love it!"
VGP_Golden_Beach,krazikams,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,No free entry,"To access only beach, there is no free entry. You have to compulsorily take 250/- ticket. They have lots of combo package of Amusement rides in Universal Kingdom, Aqua World, Snow Kingdom.. all there to loot money, but many rides will be closed and not working. So ask clearly and spend money wisely. Young kids will enjoy the place."
VGP_Golden_Beach,kumarjayamalla,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,good palce to kill a weekend,gang is needed to enjoy all the rides and near by beach view is cool food is availble inside and bit expensive.

VGP_Golden_Beach,krishseshadri,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,VGP - Very Glitched Place :(,"For heaven sake, don't ever visit this place. “Horrible” is the one word to sum it up!!Entire world has caught up with services ""oriented"" towards customers but sadly the VGP management is taking the other direction and critically lacks customer service or has any process in place :((Those who enjoy mediocre entertainment, basic rides and get thrilled with sloppy 80s or 90s style infrastructure, who don't care for personal hygiene, may like this resort.  These are the issues faced by my family within few hours of time spent in this resort:•	Some 3-4 people inside the ticketing counter are talking to themselves and they seem to not bother that the customers are standing in the line and they need to be helped with the tickets..huh?? •	Most of the rides are under repair or under maintenance. There is no board or sign, we have to walk-up to the nearby ride operator to enquire/find about the status of the rides.•	As it rained the night before, the operator or the management didn't even care to clean the roads or seats in the rides. The operators were telling us it’s not their job and their attitude towards the customers speaks in volume about how they are being treated by the management. Poor souls they need some time-off or some change in shifts.•	When in the middle of the ride, the power was shut-off and we were sitting in a balloon ride for about 20 minutes and when asked to start the generator, operator told us that it will take 30 minutes to resume the operations. He said that he can’t speak to his supervisor and he doesn’t have his number. Thank God, we were not in the Ferris wheel when this happened ;)•	We were instructed that we can go to the water park, apparently those rides also need power for the operation. After about 30 minutes, the power got resumed, one of the ride operator told us that he is going for lunch and someone will come and operate it. Already the people were going bonkers that the power was shut-down, on top of it, the operator was now walking-out for lunch. Who in the world to question them?•	Worst experience is, there is no co-ordination in the water park to collect and distribute the tube floaters. When my daughter went to collect the tube near drop-off point, she slipped, fell on her back and severely injuring her hip and also got a big bump in her head.  She was suffering with headache, dizziness due to the trauma from the fall. To our surprise, there were no staff in the vicinity to assist or there is any first-aid kit available.  One has to walk to the ticket counter and took us somewhere far-off to get us some ice in a paper napkin. He is neither first-aid trained or has any experience. Surprised, why they can’t afford a Doctor in the premises? God only has to save us if any such untoward incident happens. •	It’s a pure negligence of the management as the stagnant rain water wasn’t cleaned properly especially in the places where young children/teens walk-by. The algae formed in that busy junction has never been cleaned•	When went to the Veg restaurant near by the Horror House, the guy serving the food on an uncleansed plate (soap scum was still there). When we pointed out, he just removed the soap scum asked us to adjust as the food has been served? Who want to compromise for this? Is anyone in this place care for food hygiene?? •	People who come to eat in this restaurant feed the crows and dogs and these animals come nearby to the table and also attempt to pick the left-overs from the plate. Yuck !!Of all the bad things happened, one good thing is their Snow Kingdom, they maintain sub-zero temperature where you can see some snow. Please keep in mind, the jackets they give really stinks How many ever new rides they may introduce in future, without fixing their customer service and basic process, there is a big question mark in getting repeat customers."
VGP_Golden_Beach,marenamicable,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,WORST AMUSEMENT PARK IN EVER VISITED,"Last week visited VGP with family  amusement park which was bad experience in my life time .I have been visting too many places this is terrible.

VGP_Golden_Beach,AshokMela,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,A sought after destination for the last 3 decades !!,VGP Golden Beach is a entertainment place or picnic spot for locals of Chennai not just in the last few years but for the last 3 decades. The theme park inside has been added a decade before. But the property and the beaches and the park and the gardens are very commonly noticed in the south indian movies of late 80s and early 90s.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Namrata S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015,First Beach Visit Ever,"This was my first ever beach visit and my first trip to South India. On a local's recommendation we went to Golden Beach and it was totally worth it. The waves are rocking, the beach is pristine and well-maintained and the premises are beautifully preserved and maintained. Absolutely love the architecture and the wonderful side-activities that are available, like palm readers, swings for both children and adults, horror house, etc. The washrooms are hygienic and well-maintained and the staff is courteous. Not a lot of variety when it comes to food but definitely enough to satisfy the post-swim hunger pangs. "
VGP_Golden_Beach,cool1960,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Family,Full of FUN,"Maintained by a Private party. This Beach was very first of its kind in Chennai.To entertain people lots of fun filled dramas, music, skit are being conducted. You can find Tamil culture is bieng played and Portrayed there. Lots of eateries are there which will make to keep eating.Lots of trees are there which makes us to really relax. Beach is superb.We need to walk a lot so we have to plan the route and walk slowly."
VGP_Golden_Beach,wanderlast_13,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,"STAY AT GOLDEN BEACH RESORT, HAVLOCK, ANDAMANS","Conveniently located, about 3 kms from jetty.Well maintained resort with a private beach.Accommodations are very spacious and well maintained"
VGP_Golden_Beach,Bhalaji N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015,Out dated,"Been to this place after a decade and was so disappointing in the 90s it used to be weekend leisure spot for my family and we used to stay as well. It used to be so good, now i see an aging, under maintained place with bad shape. The food has gone bad, entertainment is literally not jelling well. Its high time they renovate. Lots of space and the animals that stayed within has been lost to the divided cottage space. Inter this has shrunk the overall space for the park. The beach is the only good thing that still exists. The beach is clean, tidy and good for kids to play."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Janak S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015,It's essentially dead,Came with family on the 24rd Dec 2015. Paid 300 per head only to find the entire park is like s graveyard. All the rides are empty and out of repair. The food place is like a road side outlet with two items (fast food) on the menu. We simply walked out of the park and into the hotel next door. Overall very disappointed.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Deepa S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Leisure visit,Best beach undoubtedly!! Must go here for a visit if ur in chennai... Picturesque setting and white sandy beach... Beautiful indeed!! No wonder so many Bollywood songs have been shot here... Peaceful and tranquil... One feels happy to have been here... Best tym to go here is in the evening... Watch the sunset... Totally worth ur travel tym!!

VGP_Golden_Beach,tinu123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,one of the cleanest beach of chennai,"This is one of the cleanest beach in Chennai. There is an entry fee which restricts the visitors so the beach is moderately populated. If you are lucky then you'll get to see some celebrities shooting a movie sequence here. I got to see Hansika Motwani here with her crew for a movie shot. I personally prefer this over Marina Beach for its add on attraction apart from the beach. Inside there is a small deer park, exotic birds, there are unlimited joy rides and food court. Overall it's a good place to enjoy on weekends."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Naveed T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,Excellent place to be with family,"Nice view, cleanest beach in Chennai, great views, calm, clean and serene. Have some peanuts or some grams/corns and a bottle of water. Stay there for around 2 hours. Have sun tanning. Enjoy the beach."
VGP_Golden_Beach,vidhusagar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015,Good entertainment for first time visitors,They are one of the pioneers of resorts and entertainment in the ECR area. Still basking in the glory of the old times. The place does provide entertainment value but has somehow deteriorated standard wise. 
VGP_Golden_Beach,K Sai Bharath,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Enjoyable ,Once we enter there will be only happiness. Won't forget and will be going back to enjoy fully. Food is extremely tasty
VGP_Golden_Beach,SagarVS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Friends,Faded yet popular,"This place gets bus loads of tourists even after all these years, Of course the film shootings are not what it used to be 2 -3 decades ago. There are many interesting settings here to interest the first timer and the entry ticket is affordable and seen as great value for the visitor. However, there are better options for similar entertainment in Chennai."
VGP_Golden_Beach,AnshAgwl,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Good Beach,"It was a good beach in Chennai. The beach was well connected inside from VGP Universal Kingdom, an amusement park. You can enjoy rides and cool breeze of beach back to back. It is located nearby Iscon Temple, Chennai."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Reema A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015,Beautiful place to enjoy with family & friends..,"The private beach with resorts, amusement parks, lot of activities is a ""must see"" spot if you visit Chennai. Families, students and tourists irrespective of the age have a lot of activities for time pass and enjoyment. If you are lucky, you can watch film shooting here which happens frequently. This was one place we could really unwind and let ourselves become kids again. I really enjoyed the place along with the family and recommend to come with family. The snacks are a bit expensive for the quality. All in all well worth the effort to come & time spent."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Finn J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Family,Good place for all age,"Small places where you can by some food,other games place to youse your money,nice beach but no swimming there.They haver a very big Swimland and there are fun for many hour's there I have been there three times with a lot of Children and parants from street in Chennai,always a success for all"
VGP_Golden_Beach,Manish Bansal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,Weekday fun at Golden Beach,Had heard a lot about the Golden Beach resort. My visit here was on a weekday and hence it was very less crowded. There is this guy who stands as a statue and is interesting to see people trying hard to tease him to move or smile. The place is wide spread with many rides which are included in the entry ticket except for a few. Not happy to say that many of the rides are old fashioned and needs maintainance. There is a water park also inside the place for which a ticket can be brought separately. Dint venture there due to lack of time however appeared to be good because of the long water slides and people seemed to have fun. Less options of eating there and dint appear to be hygenic though final call may be taken by the one wanting to eat it. The escape to beach was good from there which was clean.
VGP_Golden_Beach,SenthilESR,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015,Terrible .. Very bad maintenance,"Recently i went to this theme park with my family.We had horrible experience. The maintenance of rides were very bad, especially the dashing cars. Will not recommend for anyone"
VGP_Golden_Beach,Lavanash,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015,Fun for the family,"One of the oldest and biggest Adventure parks of Chennai. Has become a little run down, nevertheless it is being revamped and repainted slowly. Plenty of rides for adults, kids and babies. A small petting zoo, plenty of restaurants, a gaming arcade and the major attraction...the beach. Good place for kids. Can spend time with family for half the day. Better to reach there early evening. Holidays and the morning times will be fully crowded. The rides will have longer queues. By early evening the visitors who use public transport start to disperse, so the rides seem lesser crowded. Plus as Chennai is a hot and humid city the evening times are much cooler. There is a newly started Snow park. The entrance & ticket to that is separate and is through the car park.Try to visit during Pongal time (January) when you can see many ancient south indian traditions like Karakatam, Poi kal kuthirai and lots of group dances. Has a resort too for those who want to stay overnight."

VGP_Golden_Beach,Hariharan S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Is it loosing its charm,"Had been to VGP golden beach with my family.... plus 1. it is a theme park not just a beach...negatives....cleanliness needs to improve, safety of the rides needs to checked,the system for the clothes at the aqua world needs to improve....still a reasonable place to be with children"
VGP_Golden_Beach,amrutanshue,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Family,reasonably clean and secluded,the beach is clean...few people.bit faraway from the city but thats what we want isn't it?? plenty of good restaurants and a drive-in-theatre around. 
VGP_Golden_Beach,Pratik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Friends,Beach : unique place to visit...,"i am writing my review only for the GOLDEN beach... not VGP resort... both are different attractions... id not been to resort... n way to beach is jus next to this resort...though its not in heart of the city, its worth to spend time for ttravel to reach there...it takes atleast 1-2 hours if travelling by local city bus... hats off to chnennai transport services... for which frequent buses are available even for this attraction located in outskirt...now coming to beach, its so calm n clean you never know when hours are spent... in taking selfies... or even sitting n chatting with ur loved ones... yes u get me right... u can include this attraction for a romantic dates... but better go in evening as sun is about to set..."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Sudha M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Family,Good place to time pass,"I guess it was the first beach resort started in Chennai with lot of games both dry and water games. Its a huge place with lot of trees around. Very good place to hang around. If you want you can go and play  or you can just relax there. Very peaceful. As the place is very big, crowd doesn't affect you much. You can enjoy with friend and family. Lot of entertainment over here. Most importantly its much cheaper compared to other places."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Hemkumar G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,No quality,"Visited it after almost 25 years to show my little daughter. Should say, they have not upgraded the facility. The look and feel of the amusement park is it is very old. Though you have to pay an entry fee of Rs 200/- approx. for most of the interesting and reasonably good raids inside, you again have to shell out Rs25/- each. The rides are in very old condition. May be for someone very new to amusement park concept, it may have some interest. For others, who might have enjoyed much higher standard amusement park even within India, it is very poor cousin."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Anshul0012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,Good One,"I visit the place and found attractive, i think one should go in morning and should stay till evening for proper enjoyment"
VGP_Golden_Beach,pksahu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,A full day fun,"Its not just a beach, its a theme park. You can enjoy the rides, you can spend your time near the beach or under the trees and take unforgettable photos around. The main attraction was the statue man standing just near the entrance. Kids just love it. I have been there for around 10 times.Hope to go there again with my family."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Svetaspy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Family,good with kids,the entrance costs about 320 RP including waterpark and some attractions. Also zoo. But what i didnt like was the dress for swimming which you must wear there. Also the swimming pool is not  deep  just for a kids. The water rides is cool but the water made me the allergy on the skin.. This place is for active ppl - you would't find any personal chears to stay 'n chill under the sun.
VGP_Golden_Beach,ben_blr_kl,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Family,good location along beach side but old,"it takes almost 45 minutes from city center to reach this place. built along the beach side, it has good ambience, price is also very affordable....the rides are okay but all look old and gives you a scary feeling about its functionality!!...the food is really good and the best part - it is available even at 5 pm !!....the water games are really funny...the water is warm and the slides are all literally non functional..the highlight is the beach....it looks much cleaner with less crowd and good security - they even alert you when you get high tides!!"
VGP_Golden_Beach,Amit G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Heard Chennai is cheap but VGP makes you wrong- Its indeed a capitalist place,"My experience with Chennai so far has not been nice, and VGP did icing on the cake. I and my colleague reached this place in order to spend some good time on the beach as we heard very good about this beach. But on reaching there we realized that we have to shell out entry fee of Rs 225.  Entry ticket is for amusement park but you have to purchase the ticket if you wish to go to the beach. This place is more suitable for families with  kids not for couples or friends."

VGP_Golden_Beach,mpsrawat83,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Family,TOP BEACH,This is a very good beach on the out skirt of Chennai. It opens aroung 9.30 AM and is open till evening. One can spend the entire day inside. Over a period of time lot of changes have taken place and now children fun items have been added. Terrific watre ride is one star attraction. The water on the beach is very clean. The location is ideal for movie shootind and on the day of our visit we did come across Tamil Movie Shooting. The environment is very good and much better than any other beaches I have visiten. Only Kovalam beach is as clean as this beach. On the day of our visit some south African artists performed and the performance was par excellence. Must visit place.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Anjula Singh Bhadauria,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 • Family,Nice and commercialised,I liked the beach more than many of Miami and goa... It may be a little crowded but you have to do the right choice of time and point...It is commercialised unlike many I visited but I like its that aspect the most...Atleast you can keep your kids entertained...
VGP_Golden_Beach,Maruthakumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Old one but nice,"It is said to be one of the old beach resort still it is good and one of the preferred resort.We enjoyed the beach, food, man statue etc but everywhere you can see it is old."
VGP_Golden_Beach,767fkhan1m,1.0 of 5 bubbles,,Worst amusement park,"This is the worst amusement part in Chennai. The water area is very dirty. The rest rooms are badly maintained and smell like hell. The changing rooms are provided with shower cutains instead of doors. The flooring in the water pool is cement, it has bruised mine and my kids legs badly. The water is literally dirty with loads of dirt floating . Most of the rides are not functioning and the ones that are functioning are badly maintained. Though we pay an amount for entry we have to pay for each ride inside too. We were forced to buy clothing for the water area, they were pathetic. Most of the suits were torn and dirty."
VGP_Golden_Beach,glenngrifton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Excellent,"Good place full of enjoy . A man standing frent ,puting yellow colour dres . That man is a good plz cover hi with any protection . Because one time a man drunk and speaking bad words and sceraching with a blade "
VGP_Golden_Beach,Unni2006,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Business,Neat Theme Park,"Visited VGP Golden Beach once along with friends during the business trip. It was once famous for Bollywood movies and some of the statues etc were reminding the old movies. However the area seems to be totally deserted are only very few people were around . Most of the joy rides were kept closed although it is maintained. The name was very famous for theme park , but except that the beach area is neat and some nice goods made out of shell available , overall it was disappointing. VGP has to ramp up and make it more more attractive so that people can have one fun and spend time over there.  Expects more...."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Truefeed,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014,Not Worth it,"Overall it is not maintained properly, given other amusement parks nearby it doesn't worth it even its entrance fee."
VGP_Golden_Beach,kumar s,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Business,Ok,Took my wife and daughter to this place. had been to this place long ago. Not that great any more. half of the rides were not open. Thw water park experience was good though.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Somasundaram G,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Family,Disappointing,I used to visit in my childhood that time they maintained well. now its horrible no much maintenance every thing we need to pay and use. looks like Mini Saravana Stores. The staffs are not in uniforms. lot of things missing.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Ramesh L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Family,ordinary theme park,we are going to this sunday.  events are same as when i lost visit 2005. the rate is also high per head 225 basic. according to safety issue the rides all are very slow no thrilling effect
VGP_Golden_Beach,lsatishkumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013,Need for upgrade,"This place I used to visit with my father when I was a kid and the place hasnt changed a lot,so lots of upgradation needed,but the food is good as always,especially the famous family dosa.."
VGP_Golden_Beach,unnatikumar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Family,Good Place to visit with family,We with family very much enjoyed the Golden Beach. However Few rides are not running. We enjoyed the Water Park and have funny moments at there.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Rina C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Couples,Interesting place to visit with family !!,"VGP Golden Beach is an amusement park at the backdrop of Marina Beach the second longest beach of the world. It holds many interesting things like thrill rides, kids rides, aqua park, restaurants, theme parks, play stations for kids etc. The most interesting thing I liked there was aqua park. You may spend hours together enjoying different rides and slides in the aqua park. I wished I had taken my kids along. They would have enjoyed a lot. Don't forget to take your kids along. They will thank you forever."

VGP_Golden_Beach,Ricky2606,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Friends,Good Ole Times,"If you want to reminisce good ole'times this is a nice place to be . Lot of 90's movies were shot here . However the place still is in its 90's and doesn't look as it has been upgraded ever since. The beach is one of the cleanest ones I have seen in Chennai , few rides were enjoyable too but very few."
VGP_Golden_Beach,Vani J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2012 • Family,Reasonable and wide spread to kill a day,"Family Dosa about a 10 feet long is the highlight is you are going in a family of over 10 or 15 members. Place is average and quite widespread. Old people might find it difficult to walk around. Rides are normal..nothing to rave about. Just a place to hangout, if you have visited all other places in Chennai."
VGP_Golden_Beach,yssubramanyam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2012 • Family,heavenly,artistic..worth visiting..recommended for all. married couple have plenty of joy to go around for romance. kids too have plenty fun places..
VGP_Golden_Beach,laksmi21,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2011 • Couples,Could maintain better,I have seen this beach in so many movies that I was looking forward to seeing it one day. But was disappointed in the lack of maintenance and interest in developing the place
VGP_Golden_Beach,Veepy,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2012 • Family,Give it a miss..,"Everyone in chennai would have visited this place many times over, right from ur childhood school picnic trips... NO new attractions and this place has not been upgraded for ages. So surely skip it.. "
VGP_Golden_Beach,AshimMitra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2011 • Friends,Clean but Lack of Maintenance,"No doubt it is very neat & clean area including beach... various types of rides the water kingdom and park is attractable..  Its a nice place for kids. But this is my fourth time visit to VGP Golden Beach I have noticed one fact that is they are not maintaining in all way. The environment and the things are not well as earlier. Basically the Toilet is very dirty and filled with water. Almost 8-9 yrs earlier the scenic beauty was natural & excellent, but at present its in one word dramatic."
VGP_Golden_Beach,ansubarik,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Clean but costly,A clean private beach with ample security men around. Preceded by a park and water kingdom with a variety of games to suit all tastes. Comes at a cost that's on a higher side.
VGP_Golden_Beach,uma29july,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Very Clean and Beautiful.,It is the most beautiful sea beach in Chennai. Golden san makes it attractive. However the biggest attration is it's absolutely neat and clean envoirnment. Most of the popular Hindi film songs are picturised here. It is worth to visit.
VGP_Golden_Beach,Abhishek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Clean Private Beach,"Its very clean private beach. The sand color is little bit Golden. Inside there are playgrounds and Play instruments for kids. You will find Bar, Food court, Shops and few small rides inside Golden beach. Its in ECR Road. Its a Paid Beach and you have to pay ₹300/- per person to Enter the beach. In special occasions and weekends the rate may increase. The beach is clean and beautiful but there nothing so special as they charge ₹300/- for a single ticket."
VGP_Golden_Beach,vinoopm,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,fun place with kids,good beach location with many amusements to keep the little ones busy . can get quite crowded & of course a little away
