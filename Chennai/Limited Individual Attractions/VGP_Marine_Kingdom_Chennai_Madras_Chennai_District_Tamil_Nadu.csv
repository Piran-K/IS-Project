VGP_Marine_Kingdom,Pasupathy V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great entertainment and poor maintenance ,Excellent place in Chennai to hangout with kids. The place is well kept and is worth every penny spent. The walk through aquarium with Sharks swimming over the heads is the highlight of the place. They have a cute AI experience for kids that takes a 2D sketch from kids and renders it on a screen as a 3D animation. Kids loved to see their imaginary fish springing to lifeI personally didn't like them have a good store in a dungeon at the end of the park. The place was fairly stinky and dingy to sell food. The restrooms were not clean either. 5 Stars for the experience of watching the fishes and2 stars for how well the place is maintained 
VGP_Marine_Kingdom,Madhu M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great ,Great experience. Lot many marine species are there. Educative tour for young brains. Can be visited by all age groups. Parking available 
VGP_Marine_Kingdom,Uthra S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worst,"#Worst experience! #VGP #Marinekingdom. With ticket price in the higher end (Rs.695 per head, excluding parking charge), we would think it would be amazing. Unfortunately.. 1) None of the staff even knows the name of the #fishes there. (They only know where the bathroom is or the price of the snacks). 2) Can't spend more than an hour. (Can go to two movies with the same money).3) Staff was rude. (A group of students came. The VGP staff gave mic to the teacher who was screaming ""Class 3A STAND IN THE LINE. Class 4A, Class 4A!!! Where is THE LINE! FORM THE LINE.. ALL STUDENTS STAND IN THE LINE..."" The screaming on the mic went for more than 10mins.felt like we were in a school playground (got a terrible headache since it was closed area and the noise was extremely loud and unpleasant). When asked about the Mic announcements, the VGP Staff named Mr.Shiva said rudely that it will be like this only! And suggested saying ""Don't come here. Yes it will be like this. I can't do anything! You can leave if you want.""Simply, They could have allowed only the school students and refused entry for public if they don't care about others!4) The place lacks proper maintenance (someone had vomited inside the tunnel and it was stinking, they took their sweet own time to clean, even after informing). 5) Food is overly priced and mostly old (popcorn was stale).While the experience at #Crocodile bank/#Snake park which is few kms away was #amazing!Snake park staffs (of #Irulas tribe) were eager to explain more, readily #answering any queries we had! The price is way lesser than VGP Marine Kingdom. Crocodile bank Rs.100 per head. Snake park Rs.30 per head.Highly recommend the Snake park in Crocodile bank!üëçüèºA big No for Marine kingdomüëéüèº"
VGP_Marine_Kingdom,Aswinkumar C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,The best experience in south india,It's a excellent place to visit with family and kids together. Under water view is beyond expectations. Number of fishes are also very huge. The main attraction I felt was sharks. They are humangous. 
VGP_Marine_Kingdom,Harsha N,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Average place!!!,Average place to visit. Overall it will take 45 mins - 1 hour to cover. Entry fee is very high (Rs.500+/head) for 1 hour. So you can avoid this and try snow world instead.

Maintenance is good , best time to visit weekdays.. Peaceful and spend more time with individual tanks.The place is well maintained. There is small underwater tunnel where we get a good view of deep water fishes. The ticket cost is 650 for adults. Car parking charges us ‚Çπ50. It will be a good experience for kids. It will take around 2 hours to completely watch the place. Family & children surely enjoy.. it would be treat to watch feeding food and scuba driving."

,,,,,"It's a great place to spend half day in Chennai exploring ocean life. It's around 20km far from Anna Nagar, on ECR (East Coast Road).Ticket price per head is ‚Çπ650/- for adults & ‚Çπ550/- for kids.It's a collection of huge aquarium well arranged with a lot of information.Almost all types of fishes can be viewed live through the glass.Glass tunnel is at the end and you can see even those who are exploring inside the water through scuba diving.There's a spot where you can touch the Star Fish inside the tank.As you get inside after taking the ticket, there will be a photographer who may take your photo (solo or group) against a green background which you may collect by paying an amount ranging from ‚Çπ250/- at the end at souvenir shop. You may buy the products with your photo on it if you wish. So, please don't miss to take photo by them in the starting as you need to pay only if you buy it at the end after checking them out.There was a long queue for taking ticket on a Saturday noon by around 2pm. Car parking was almost full and they had some parking arrangement outside on the side road. (Visited on July 2022)"

Lots of fish varieties. Most of which are a surprise to watch. You can spend atleast 3 hrs here peacefully. They have a good court and a popcorn stall too. Those who want to spend half a day outside city life, pls try visiting here once.The day we visited, we had a long queue in all counters for the tickets. But I booked online in a minute and entered the premises without wasting time. Sometimes they give offer while we book online too. Take kids and have fun."

,,,,,"Firstly the one you rather not waste your money on and recommend you should not fall for it is the ""VR"" at the entry. They advertise it as a 9D experience, but does not even give a 3D experience at the best. If you have ever experienced a 4D or such in one of those sea worlds or Disney worlds elsewhere, just forget about pulling out your wallet and wasting 150Rs/person for the 10 minute thing where you sit on a chair that keeps making cranking noises and bumping up and down while you watch a video beamed to your gear that is strapped to your head. 9D is a sham. An whats worse is the videos are not even stitched together, but 3 different videos are streamed one after the other while operator announces ""next video"" that without appropriate audio doesn't ever make you feel  like being underwater. Even Youtube does a better job of streaming queued videos back to back !! Probably enjoyable only for little kids (8yrs or younger). I would not even rat 1-star for the VR, but sue them for the misleading 9D which is nothing but a money scam.Otherwise, coming to the main attraction, if you are interested in or like to see fishes, this is a good place one could easily spend 3-4 hours enjoying your time watching them - lots of variety of fishes, big and small, can be seen.  I mean ""live"" fishes! It was amazing to see various fishes of different colors swimming together in each of the many of those aquariums (like the one in my uploaded pic), feels pretty even for me as an adult.  The only touch pool is that of the star fishes where one can touch and feel their body. There are many other pools which are open on the top and have fishes that can be viewed.The underwater tunnel provides a nice experience of like being under water (in the ocean) but the tunnel could be much well maintained - without touch marks and being clear to make the view as real as being in the water than reminding being in a  glass tunnel. And in case you were asking, there are no live shows.. this is not SeaWorld., but worth a visit if you love fishes."

,,,,,"We had a very bad experience with the wallet parking. The driver scratched our new car but when asked started speaking very rudely. Even the operations manger Vijay Kumar is so irresponsible while talking to visitors. There are no CCTV cameras to know who has taken the car. Anything can happen to your car but management won't take any responsibility. So,  I suggest people don't go for wallet parking."

Visitors will be allowed to watch the staffs feeding the fishes.

Later I called customer care and confirmed about ticket validity, they said can come anytime, after 2 months I went to visit the place with family and kids, they said tickets already expired, once again I have to buy tickets to visit the place, poor maintenance when compare with other places, it's not worth to visit this place, less fish varieties."

The view ignites to know more about marine life species its an good attempt to keep rare fishes ,  I was 78 Kgs -36 years women tried the scuba diving, the tutor Joshua and the Dive master Anish kumar was so encouraging, no negative comments or scary words, in the practising session i took little long time and had a point of quitting , dive master motivated and it was an good memory for my life .also they took care of my 8 years old daughter.Thanks for the diving team as well as the maintence guys."
,,,,,I have visited this place with my family. My kid enjoyed it a lot. Visited it on Monday so it was not crowded. So had a good time to watch each fish and it was worth it.
,,,,,It is a good attempt by its creators. There are a lot of variety of fish in the huge aquariums it houses. You can spot sharks in the 'through water' tunnel. Avoid weekends to skip the crowd. 
,,,,,A great place to visit on the ECR. It is situated next to the VGP Kingdom and Snow Kingdom venues. A good experience overall even though the venue is quite small. They also provide scuba diving tours and also have a VR zone both of which are a must try activities. Entry fees are a bit on the upside(cost per adult is Rs.600 and per child[above 90cm ht] is Rs.500). The cafeteria and souvenir shops are also a bit costly and are situated near the exit. Overall a must visit spot for a breathtaking aquatic experience.

VGP_Marine_Kingdom,VGP Marine Kingdom,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good experience,"I have visited this Marine Kingdom twice and it is probably the first to have underwater walkthrough aquarium in India. I have been always been a Scuba diving enthusiast. The moment I saw VGP offering Scuba dives, my long pending desire to swim with the sharks woke up instantly and seized the opportunity. I filled a routine health questionnaire and attended the detailed explanation by the diving instructor (I forgot his name, so posting his pic). Although excited, I was a bit nervous of the sharks as this was my first dive inside an aquarium. But I was told it is totally safe and gave clear instructions on what to do and what not to. I did a trial dive followed by the full dive. The water used in the aquarium is sea water; it makes sense as they have sea species in the main aquarium.My heart was throbbing for a while with all Hollywood scary movie bits running in my mind. My instructor was very sensible and kept checking my wellness inside the water frequently. Once he was sure that I was comfortable and that I was able to signal him back, he reduced the frequency and took me closer to the fishes.I cannot name all the species I saw, but I could identify lemon sharks, black tip, sting rays, etc. The dive was for about 60 minutes in total and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were different artificial landscapes inside the aquarium ‚Äî including replicas of some temple in ruins, and a drowned ship in the seas which was totally unexpected. As I informed my family earlier to wait at the underground tunnel to see me while I dive, they were waiting near the aquarium panel. They waved at me in excitement, so I signaled my diver and he helped me kneel, and I was waving back, which only encouraged other people to wave back at me. I continued with the rest of my dive with some beautiful memories to cherish until my next escapade.Amusingly, I came to know that those who register for scuba need not purchase a separate ticket for the aquarium. The reason I quote amusing is that if I am already swimming with the fishes, why would I crave for watching them from outside the aquarium üòäI also noticed that the cost for the dive is still economical than other scuba dives I have done in rest of the world. According to me, we are getting a world class experience within an aquarium at a nominal cost.You need good reef or sometimes luck to swim closer with the fishes in open waters. But here, the landscapes are built, and you cannot get any closer than this to the sea species. So, the only regret I had during my entire visit was that I could not carry my GoPro with me for some catchy pictures. Happy diving!"

VGP_Marine_Kingdom,VGP Marine Kingdom,,,,"We were a group of 6 including kids ( 4 and 2)  and visited the VGP marine kingdom in September 2021 and we spent a good 2.5 hours there.  The place had all the covid protocols in place and temperature checks were done. We enjoyed the walk-through tunnel and looking at the many sharks and the touch pool where we could touch starfishes.  The VR show was good ( Do not miss that ).  They do the feeding at specific times and we wanted to view that - but we missed it. You can easily lose track of time watching other things so plan accordingly if you want to watch the feeding. The whole place was divided into zones based on habitats. Appreciate the fact that it had elevators and escalators in all the places making it elderly friendly. There is a cafe and a sovienur shop at the end . Our kids enjoyed identifying the octupus, star fish and lot of rays and sharks and the meerkats"
