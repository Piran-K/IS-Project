VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Harsha N,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,"Dry rides - Pathetic, Aqua rides - Good",We visited this place in December and I am completely disappointed with this amusement park. 50% of the rides are poorly maintained/not working. So they should either charge less to the customer based on no of rides or make sure it is working. Aqua rides are good and you can enjoy. Food is pathetic. Request you to plan 1st half or 2nd half so that you can avoid food. 
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Ayush M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Nice place ,Best amusement park in India . To visit with family or a group . I have visited last month it was very nice experience.

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Vivek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,Astonishing,It is the best theme park you can go to in Chennai all rides are well-maintained and especially the water rides are mind-boggling and the wave pool experience is remarkable and fantastic. I recommend this theme park to every human who exists on this planet.
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,SURAJ K,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Best Place for family & kids outing!!!,"One of the oldest Theme Park in South India.People still visit this place only for the Brand.We were 4 family visited this place with 4 cars.No one guided us to park the car.Because of marriage inside the park,they made us to travel inside the parking lot for long.Staffs are very unprofessional.They took money from us for Dry and Wet ride.Max. dry ride not working.We reached by 10:45,still lots were under maintenance or person was not available.No drinking water available, very surprised.At last we reach Wet ride.Superb place,but the changing area,rest room ,lockers are really pathetic both for gents and ladies.Management has to take this issue very seriously.Ladies and gents bathroom without door,no water supply for shower.When we asked they don't have any answer.These are basic needs of theme park.If you want more business, you need to take care of minimum needs of Amusement Park.Only 1 resturant with 8 items available.Really sad.I have uploaded bathroom snaps.Request you to improvise same."

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Vyankatesh M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,Best place for family friends group visit,"Best place for family or group visit. 21 km from central station. Cab took 500 rs. And auto while return 400.rs. they have different packages for different rides and activities. We took platinum package having water, amusement and aqua kingdom. All are very well maintained and we enjoyed lot. Food experience was very bad for us. No multiple options for veg. And instead veg Manchurian they served us chikan Manchurian. After they apologize for that but overall experience was bad. Food quality was not good. Amusement park is very good. Aqua kingdom is must visit place. Based on dubai aquarium.superb place. very well maintained. You will not regret for first time visit. Show world is also good but we didn't get time to visit. And we already very much exousted. Overall must visit place in Chennai."

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Md Azharuddin,,,,"This is a very old and famous theme park in Chennai, and I think that's the only reason good number of people still visit it. Reason I rated it low - 1. Staff are very unprofessional and are not interested in operating the rides. Even when asked they give reasons not to operate the rides. Half of the rides were not working.2. Only one restaurant in the park with only a few and horrible options. It almost reminded me of a government hospital or a temple where free food is donated.3. Drinking water was not available anywhere in the park except for entrance and restaurant.Request everyone to provide a genuine feedback rather than exaggerating. "
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,David,,,,"We deeply regret your experience during the visit. The concerned areas have been informed of all the aspects that you pointed out, and we assure you that we are working diligently to ensure a similar situation does not occur again in the future. The experience was certainly not reflective of our usual standards."

The concerned areas have been informed of all the aspects that you pointed out, and we assure you that we are working diligently to ensure a similar situation does not occur again in the future. The experience was certainly not reflective of our usual standards."
,,,,,"The universal kingdom has nothing new to offer us. All old rides. No new exciting rides. These rides you can go in fairs.. aqua kingdom is ok ok. The wave pool doesn’t have waves. Not even periodically. It’s just a swimming pool with DJ. Water rides queue are very long and okayish. We travelled with small kids under 12. So they enjoyed. But for adults, we won’t enjoy"
,,,,,"All old riding machines , very poor maintenance , rude behaviour staffs, no clean toilets and worst food. Not advised"
,,,,,Very nice place to spend a weekend . We enjoyed too much . Plan for another visit. Recommended for friends to once visit.
,,,,,"There are two words to sum up this place: dangerous and filthy.The aqua park is full of workers fixing stands whilst people slide down the water slides.  The staircase to the top of the slides is poorly maintained with building rubbish everywhere.   The shower facilities are a disgrace.  The park itself is fairly spead out but many of the dry rides are in a state of repair.  Missing seat belts, broken units etc which would not be allowed in other countries.  Also, very few food choices so come prepared.  We went on a school so crowds were minimal.  People seemed to enjoy themselves but that is India in a nutshell where people are a lot more forgiving. If you are used to western standards I would give this place a miss!"
,,,,,"It's a wonderful experience overall and worth the money spent. Universal Kingdom is full of rides for every age group. Bring your kids if have to give them good experience of all the rides at one place. It's a good place to hangout especially with family and friends . The Aquarium and the Snow Kingdom was super awesome, It is whole new world. They are well maintained, well organized and neat, The aquarium has an underwater tunnel where you can see the fishes and sharks. Has a great collection of unusual fishes, turtles and sting rays. In my opinion one of the best aquariums in India"

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Jayesh Chandra ... P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,For Kids sake.,"I was curious to see the changes since 1997, the last time I had visited.  The snow world, the water park and other rides are new.  Kids can have fun.  The cost is high, no doubt.  But the next stop on this route is mahabalipuram.  So for kids sake, loitered around.  Some rides bring out the child, some rides are non functional and some rides are crowded.The best part is the Guard.  Make him laugh if you can.  Good for selfies."
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Manik,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Wonderful Experience,I would definitely say that it is one the best amusement parks. The best thing about the park is it is clean every where even the water is clean in water parks which every one would love. Only Few rides are good but would definitely love aqua kingdom due to maintenance which I haven't seen in other parks.
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Vairavan D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Total waste,"Went with kids, auqa game only two, that also not good. Dry games just four to five. For this rs 600. Outside food not allowed. Inside 30% high. Only beach. It can enjoy at marine itself. Travel time waste. Very upset."
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Jegan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,The best in Chennai,VGP universal Kingdom is one of the best theme parks in Chennai to go with family. They have a considerable number of water rides and dry rides to take a day out and to have fun and at very affordable price.
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Vimal A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,VGP ,Its a good place to go along with friends or family. I went along with my friends and had good time. When we went many of the rides and we enjoyed it a lot.VGP Snow kingdom is one of attractions here.Do visit this place if you like cold places and snow . it has sledge rides and DJ . Clothes and boots will be provided and duration can be spent inside will be 45min.I think VGP is the best theme park in Chennai.
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,kamalakarv00,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"glory days gone, now its just about the aqua kingdom.","the place was a big draw earlier but now all the colours have faded and most of the earlier attractions are not available, and the ones that are available are just not worth the effort. the aqua kingdom is good to spend time with family and kids. this must be the only point of attraction to keep the resort going. at the aqua kingdom you have to fight for the air balloons to go on the rides because there is no set rules, first one who grabs it, gets it and gets to keep it till he wants. food is [pathetic and they give it to us as if they are doing us a favor by giving food. be careful of the stalls selling candy and coke, they cheat and try to give an attitude wqhen you catch them cheating."
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Balasubramanian R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,VGP Theme park,VGP Universal Kingdom is one of the attractions in chennai city. Children will really enjoy and play many activities.

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,There are many things to enjoy a perfect day out,"First and the foremost thing is that you will find person as soon as you enter who doesn't even move or laugh. Many people try to make him move or laugh 😂. But till now nobody could do. He just stands still like a statue. No. 1 among all water world / Aqua world where you can enjoy in water pool, sliding through tunnels. There are many gaint wheels, rides what you come across in exhibitions. And also you will find a Roller coaster ride that is the best experience and the most enjoyed by us. But small kids are not allowed for this ride. Food is available inside and out the VGP too. Usually the food is expensive in all such places. Top Gun is another thing that you must try those who love adventures where a large group of people are turned upside down but don't worry it is secure. There are many other things. "
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Sandhya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,A must visit in Chennai,"Must visit place in Chennai. Awesome place for visit with family and friends.

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,gupreen,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Sad maintenance of a beautiful place,"Not sure if it is the hey days gone bad issue, but the good infrastructure is in need of maintenance. It is still worth a visit, especially you could club it with the Marine Kingdom or Snow World visit. The beach is worth it and so are some of the water rides. The food court should be improvised - take your own grub just in case!"
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,mageshkumar712,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,awesome place,"Want to emjoy a splendid a whole day ? then your day must be spend here.I had visited this place during the month of august, me and my friends visited this place and enjoyed the whole day very much.The water theme park was very good especially the tsunami shore which begins at 3.00pm"

Over years its become a landmark for corporate and family gettogetherss.. The HORROR HOUSE is just class.. The beach area is well customized for a enjoying a blissfull dwan..The water rides are very very good. The new attraction here is the marine kingdom and its awsome collection of marine species.. My favourite is the shark..
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Abhishek Rai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Solo,Nice park to beat the Chennai’s heat,"While planning for Chennai,one must include VGP universal kingdom in the list..it’s a nice place to beat the heat in summer and provides a pleasurable experience.As per me ,The best part is the aqua kingdom,,and for young children-rides and pool provides great amusement..#VGP The best part is private beach .VGP is not for only for a specific age class,they have things for anyone from kids to grandparents ...so many rides for amusement ...fun starts from the very moment when you enters and it provides overall pleasurable experience ..Never go solo for group activities."
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Tour774542,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Perfect theme park,"VGP universal kingdom is the perfect theme park to take your kids on a 4 day holiday.It also the closest one to chennai. They will have fun with the fantastic rides that they will ride! Riding in a spinning roller coaster, or the fun pyramid ride (i seriously don't know what that ride is called). But my main point is that VGP universal kingdom park is tons of fun and you should definitely go there. If you live in chennai, it is ideal because you only have to drive half an hour from there by car ( it is the closest theme park to chennai). Also, it is ideal for kids who are 8 and up. For me, it has been so much fun!!!! I had fun and I loved the rides, I was screaming so bad. but it seems like I am repeating fun over and over again. Anyway, its fun and fun. It is a must go there."
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,vidhyasampathkumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,The safest Theme park in chennai,"Hi, i went to vgp with my 1 year old girl she enjoyed a lot in water pool.Even after being in water for long time she didn't get any cold She enjoyed a lot.

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Vignesh K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Feels like an abandoned Theme Park,"Most of the rides in this theme park would be faulty. You would see many rides abandoned and rusty, kind of like in resident eveil movie. Few of the rides which are were not maintained properly. Say for example in Dashing Cars it is very slow and will move like a battery powered kids car."
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Susmithachen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,One whole day vacation!!!!!,"I and a friend of mine came to visit Chennai and we decided to go to VGP UNIVERSAL KINGDOM ,upon stumbling on the places to visit in Chennai. VGP is your get away from the Chennai heat and traffic. It is located near to the beach , which is a plus point considering you are tired out at the end of the day.They have enough dry and wet games & rides you tire you out . I'd recommend the fish pedicure for the ladies. Kids have endless options, honestly they fall asleep tired before the day ends. Again, a plus point 😁. The canteen and food sold are reasonably priced, as is the ticket. The water Kingdom inside is my personal favourite. They provide swimming outfit which are cute and the entire water park is covered with people running around in the same coloured outfit. Awesome!!!!!!!! The outfits are budget friendly and the deposit is cheap. Lockers are also available. VGP pretty much is an amazing place to go to in Chennai. At the end of the day, you have memories,fun and a good night sleep."

Some rides are kept under maintenance, so can't play that. Clothes are provided while go for water rides, we may use that for Rs. 250 per head( fully returnable). Locker facility is available for Rs.100, where Rs.70 is returnable. Food is available at high cost. I suggest to go as an one time visit if you want to enjoy this summer with friends and family.."

Sadly, I lost all hopes on reaching this place because of the cleanliness. ZERO!!! cleanliness. On entering the swimming pool I realized that I had made a huge mistake for coming to VGP as there was a lot of sand and moss found in the pool. I also found in many places around the pool that there was alot of slush. One more thing was there was not enough of float rings. I had to stand in a line for about half an hour to get one float ring.Before I got into the pool the staff at the lockers were extremely rude. After standing in a line there was an old man who refused us lockers just because he apparently didn't have change for 500 Rs. He yelled at my wife till i had to intervene and tell him that he had sufficient change that he had collected from other customers but was still stubborn not to give us lockers. I mean when your running a theme park which is known all around the world the least you could do is not give such excuses like this. The way the theme park is run it seems like they are only making tons money but least bothered about customers.Even parks like Kishkintha and Queensland are a lot cheaper than this place but still  more cleaner and more customer oriented. I've been to many theme parks in India and this by far is the worst!!!."

VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Blazing Warlord,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Extremely Disappointing Visit,"My personal experience in VGP Universal Kingdom was utterly disappointing. We had taken a leisurely drive to the VGP park to spend a Sunday evening after a sudden decision. The tickets were Rs 550 per person for the land based rides and Aqua Zone together. After entering, we clicked a few pictures with the legendary Statue Man of India.But as we ventured further into the 'Kingdom', we realized that we had made a mistake. Most of the rides were damaged or under renovation. The working rides too were very badly maintained. A few thrill rides including two roller coasters, a swinging ship and a haunted house were the main attractions in the land rides. For the kids, a rotating swing and a cup and saucer ride were all that could be enjoyed. For animal lovers, there is a small petting zoo near the entrance, consisting of a few birds. The Aqua zone was probably a tad bit better, but without proper planning, is not something that can be enjoyed to the fullest. A few water slides and a pool was all there was in the Aqua zone but the water quality was not well maintained and proper attire was not being followed. The food being served in the shops were also not good. The only good thing about the place was the small beach area near the sea, where one can take a leisurely walk. So, on a whole, very disappointed with the experience and I hope that they will take some effort to improve the place."
VGP_Universal_Kingdom,Sakthivel ramkumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Awesome environment,Good place to go along with friends or family during weekend. I went along with my friends and had good time. When we went many of the rides were not opened saying it's morning and would start by 11 or 11 30 am. Few water rides are ok and water used can be better.VGP Snow kingdom is one of attractions here.Do visit this place if you like cold places and snow . it has sledge rides and DJ . Clothes and boots will be provided and duration can be spent inside will be 45min
