VR_Chennai,Gnanasingh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,PVR Audi 4 Screen Review,PVR Cinemas located in 3rd floor at the end of VR Mall.This review is for AUDI 4 during Avatar English 2D show.Show Time was 10:30AMAdvertisement Till 10:53AM (23 Minutes) Movie Started at 10:54AMAll the audience were extremely irritated on this 23 minutes long advertisements. Seats cushions was comfortable and reclining mechanism was very tight. Floor and Seats was clean and neat. Audio was good. AC could have been better. It wasn't sufficient. Dedicated Counter next to AUDI 9 is available to collect pre-ordered Food and Beverages. Chocolate Donut was good but Cold Coffee was very watery and wasn't good. 
VR_Chennai,Vinoth,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Admirable Mall in the city,Hygienic and safe place. Lot of fun and did excellent shopping which covered all branded shops at one place. Most admirable mall in the city with easy accessibility to reach.
VR_Chennai,Lax,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,"""Unhappy Experience @ VRMall, Chennai""","The design of this mall is very poor in terms of usability. It hauls for long walks with people looking for lifts. One has to walk a minimum distance of 250 mts one way to find the nearest lift or escalator. It's painful when we have to carry the grocery, milk, vegetables with kids, elders, walking for haunting distances to the car park. Just be thoughtful if you are taking kids and elders, for they should be prepared to walk long distances with no support for differently abled ones as well. The support staff inside SPAR were very helpful but the mall services are below average."
VR_Chennai,Anand,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Customers beware of the cleanliness of tables in the food court,The food court looked clean. But I observed the housekeeping staff were mopping the floor and with the same mop they cleaned the table and went to the washbasin and cleaned it with the same mop in full view of the customers. Just wondering about the customers who think the table is clean and putting food stuff over the table and children touching the table !!!Absolutely unacceptable. Will the management take some action over it???
VR_Chennai,Mano,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Thumbs up for VR mall,"Compared to other malls in Chennai. the recently built VR mall offers great dine-in, shopping & fun for kids.The best part is the PVR cinemas, which has shining decor with light fixtures. In general, the mall was neat and clean all the time, I have seen the cleaning team is often cleaning the food court. I appreciate their dedication to maintenance. Furthermore, the shopping part was really great, couldn't stop shopping after buying clothes in all branded shops. Tommy Hilfiger & Jack and Jones collection for men was great (didn't visit all shops for men). Ritu Kumar, west side, mango, Vero Moda and lifestyle had a great collection for women. Noticed great watch collections, cosmetic collections as well. Toni & guy offer the best salon & spa service. Basically, you can find everything in one place. The food court looks crowded all the time, especially on weekends. however, the taste of the food from the food court was average. I really recommend the writer's cafe (small dine-in), their pizza was delicious. Karaikudi food tasted good however, the ambience needs to be improved. last but not least, my son really enjoyed the fun city.Overall, it is a great location to spend time together with family, kids & friends"
VR_Chennai,Kumar BK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Surprise for Me,"No doubt it‚Äôs one of the very good mall in Chennai but today we have become very surprised when we when we visit we find there is no celebration symbol of our 75 Independent day ,during Christmas when we visit last time we find there is a marvellous decoration arrangement culture program they organise I believe mall management is not not feeling important to celebrate 15th August Independence Day I believe being an Indian we should do at least some  Tirangaa somewhere else in this big mall but it‚Äôs look like a normal day they encourage only Christmas and other regional festival inside the mall only being Indian they must celebrate 15 August another Indian festival being a good brand mall."

,,,,,"The mall is 1. 5 yrs old and almost all the spaces are occupied. The only minus of this mall is the very high car parking charges. Dont take your car if you want to shop and watch a movie. You will be taken for a ride with high car park charges but other than that the mall is a good one.The food choices here is excellent. There is hardly any cuisine which is not served here (one can get all Indian cuisine like Chettinad, Tamil, Kerala, Andhra, Punjabi, North Indian plus international cuisine including American, TexMex, Chinese, Italian, Thai, Lebanese, Turkish, Arab, Japanese and many more fares are served. So many Bakers, Patisserie, Cook specialists, Dessert specialists, coffee lounges Shake specialists, Ice cream vendors from Arun, Hagen Daaz, Movenpick, Ibaco, Cold Stone and many more are present here. The Mall has all retailers from India and International queuing up here. The good thing about the mall is that they have life saving seating arrangements in all levels which is very comforting for old people, parents with babies, Bored husbands etc. The entertainment includes a superb Multiplex, Games for children, Virtual gaming zone. The Mall also has modern office spaces for rentals. In the near future they management plans to open a Pub, Club and a hotel.  Over all it is a one stop shop for a weekend fun."

VR_Chennai,Anand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Modern mall,"The mall is modern, spacious and had many luxury brand outlets.  We mainly visited the mall to get some cute Japanese stationery and traditional dress.Accessing the mall:I think we went to the wrong metro station because none of the auto drivers wanted to take the route to V.R.Mall. They said its a long ride before taking a U-turn, because of the bridge in-between.  Google map showed only half-a-kilometre but there was no road link directly connecting the metro to the mall.Also the drop-off and pick-up zone for auto or taxi is only at the main road, not inside the main gate of the mall.  On a rainy day with water puddles on the street, we were pushed to the edge. The mall real estate owners need to consider easy accessibility for all visitors."

VR_Chennai,JumboMumbai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Big mall ,I would rather go to Phoenix for better options than pay hefty parking fee which makes this mall as one of the most expensive malls to visit and shop if you want to hang out for longer duration. The shops will eventually have to face the consequences in future as people will start worrying more about staying longer in the mall than to shop with peace of mind. Definitely not recommended. No malls can survive if the customers cannot spend time peacefully.

VR_Chennai,Hari Shankar,,,,"VR mall opened its door to Chennai almost a year back and now the place is teeming with people. A few months back there were leeser visitors but there is quantum jump in visitors. The summer and the vacation time could have increased that along with better publicity and management. In terms of choice there is a lot in VR. The best Food joints, Multicuisine restos, International chains, Coffee shops, Creameries, restaurant chains, sweet shops, bakeries etc have set shop here, the best food clothing and leather retailers in India and abroad are present here, the mall has one of the best multiplexes in Chennai and in India itself. The air-conditioning is excellent here.There is loads of parking in the mall. In fact there are there are 3 levels of parking in the basement. Recently the parking was hiked after the multiplex opened but I think after a few complaints they have reduced the parking a little bit which is good. If the security staffs dont speak Tamil nor English. It is a must for them to speak the local language. Nearly 30 - 40 shops are still not open which is not good. A few things are missing here. A decent pub and a club would be great, a few shops selling exquisite Indian handicrafts, Sculptures, Indian carvings and memorabilia   would be a great addition. A decent sized hotel would have been great here. I hope VR Chennai is hearing this. If not for all this I would have given VR mall a perfect 5 star."

VR_Chennai,Team VR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Up coming mall,"Went to VR Chennai mall last week especially to purchase from Spar super/hyper market. The facade of the mall sports a multi-coloured design based on the traditional gopuram. The mall is relatively big one with different outlets in four floors. The prices of many house hold, grocery, dress and etc, etc items were really low in Spar. Went for lunch at the food court located in the fourth floor. All veg and non-veg outlets selling items at much higher price. While entering the mall at the parking lot was informed about the parking charges priorly that for first hour it is Rs.40 and for every additional hour extra Rs.30 will be added.  I have just crossed one hour and paid Rs.70. In that GST was Rs.10. Too high parking fee. From Koyambedu bus-stand it is about 1 km. "

VR_Chennai,Team VR,,,,"Went twice during the month of December 2018. The mall was crowded due to Christmas vacation. Tried for movie on the first visit and couldn‚Äôt get the tickets had to roam around the mall and booked the movie tickets and went for second time. Ample car parking available. The food court though it is small area has different combinations South Indian Veg only, pizzas, North Indian mix with Non-Veg, ice cream parlours, Madras coffee shop etc, some of restaurants are under construction. Some shops accept food zone special card whereas Dominos pizza doesn‚Äôt accept them . Why this two different policy needs to clarified. The VR zone was totally a waste of time. The shops are not so big branded ones, but then the taste differs as to what you plan to purchase.The movie theatre in which we saw Spiderman must be around 200 -250 capacity but the interesting part was long queues for popcorns and Nachos. Many of the sales counters was not fully operational and it seems like the mall was more interested in selling extra large sized popcorns rather than promoting the movies. Some chilling art work on the lower floors needs to be really appreciated. The writings on walls depicting old songs praising Lord Krishna is really wonderful ‚ÄúMaadu Meikum Kanne Nee Poga ‚ÄúSome light music band live was entertaining. This too be promoted to encourage music lovers Overall the food cost, car parking cost to be reduced so that more people enjoy. The entrance and exit chaos leading to busy stretch needs to be taken care. Do visit once yo have a feel of it "

VR_Chennai,clementwill,,,,"Hi,I visited VR mall for watching night show with family at 10.30pm and returned back at 1.30am. Parking fee of 120 rupees was charged which was too high for watching a movie. I would request you to consider reducing the parking charges for people who goes only watching movies. Thanks in advance. "

,,,,,"It was told that only food box card issued by VR mall is to be used to buy foodies in food court in 2nd floor. But Dominos pizza stall in 2nd floor food court was not ready to accept the food box card issued by Food box. End up in paying money to them through my credit card. On going back to Food box, the staff replied, only Domino will not accept, others will accept. But why this was not told or displayed in food box when initially recharging the card with money. Not a pleasant experience in the food court."

,,,,,"This is the latest attraction to this part of Chennai. With the opening of PVR Icon the wish for theatres in Annanagar is now fulfilled.There are good retail options, adequate parking and a partly functional food court. The parking charges are high. When all the outlets are open with increased traffic it should be at par with others else it can be a turn off"
