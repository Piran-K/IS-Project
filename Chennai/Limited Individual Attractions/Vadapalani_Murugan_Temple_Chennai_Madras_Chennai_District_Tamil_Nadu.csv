Vadapalani_Murugan_Temple,Valavanur Natar... K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,A write up on Vadapalani Murugan Temple in Chennai ,"Vadapalani Palani Andavar temple or murugan  Temple in  Chennai If one has to name  one temple in Chennai where  One will witness huge number of marriages taking place inside the temple one next to another ,practically through out the year the credit will go to this Palani andavar temple in Kodambakkam also known os tinsel town of south or kollywood . The growth of this temple from a small thatched shed with a photo of Lord Murugan ,the credit must go to the film world and the cine artists who patronised it over the years from many of the studios that existed in Kodambakkam for many years .Producer Devar of famous Devar films Who used trained animals to great effect  in his films was a great devoteeOf Lotd Muruga and his co teibutuin ti this temple is enormous .But today most of the studios have vanushed giving way to real estates, but the temple's  popularity just seems to grow.Saravana Bhavan restuarant  established a huge  branch  next to this temple with the blessings of Sri Kripanandha Warrior,  himself a great Devotee and Katakalaksheepam exponent  .This restuarant  makes it very easy for couples from the poorer section of society to get married in the temple  and then serve marriage special food for their guests in this   hotel under well established token system .This temple and hotel combination works very well to conduct marriage in a very affordable manner avoiding huge marriage hall and other infrastructure costs .This marriage facility is the main hallmark of this ever over crowded murugan temple  with around 6,000 to 7000 couples getting married each year in this temple as it houses  a very  spacious hall used for marriages and doubles as religious discourse area .Now let me  trace the origin and history of this temple In the year 1890   a strong devotee of Lord Murugan named Annaswamy Nayakar built a small shed l With his personal funds in a small way And placed a painting for his own praying  .Over time he appeared to acquire some sort of extra perceptional  powers and started giving advise to many people like a soothsayer on matters concerning their personal matters And following his advise sermed to work fine for many peole who went to him.News about him  spread and he came to be known as Arul Vakku Annaswamy . Some of acts he achieved included curing many diseases,  obtaining jobs , predict and conduct marriages  in the family The special.powers he exhibited , soon attracted the movie world and its people started pumping imoney  into development of  this shed into a regular temple with a huge temple tank Mind you those days HRCE a Govt regulatory dept was not in existance and but  temple saw a rapid growth as a private transpirant enterprise .In 1920s and a Rajagopuram was built in dravidian architecture with imagesDepicting various aspects under Sakanda puranam or storirs  of Murugan divine acts and deedsInside this temple there are separate sannidhis for  Vinayaka, Shiva ,  Meenakshi , Kali, Bhairava&  Shanmuga with Valli Devasenai.The main diety Lord Muruga in standing posture resembles the diety in the famous Palani Murugan , known to be  one  the arupadai veedagal of   Muruga in Tamil nadu .Lord Dakshina Murti, Chandikeswar, Mahalakshmi, and others othets too have small sannadhis .One  of modern addition was a glass walled palli Arai quite spacious that came up thanks to a mirror merchant. Personally speaking, writing about this temple floods my mind with fond memories when I was just a small child and my father used to drive the whole family in his car from T nagar Singara Mudali street and we had to wait for long at railway level crossing after passing a hugevpotters village  and once we are on the western side of the railway crossing , we were practically surrounded by green paddy fields and trees on either sides a rural village .Its unbelievable to see the huge metropolis that it has evolved into these past two decades and now it is extremely overcrowded .

Vadapalani_Murugan_Temple,Narayanan V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,VADAPALANI-THE ARASANGAM OF LORD MURUGAN,"VADAPALANI-THE ARASANGAM OF LORD MURUGAN Vadapalani Murugan is one of the best Shrine of Lord Muruga. Yesterday i just visited in the morning of Tuesday.The temple is located near Vadapalani bus stand off 100 feet road. Nowadays you can see huge gatherings of People with full of ecstasy and standing in ques to have the darshan of Muruga the main deity. Lord Muruga has special decorations on Tuesday especially the brilliant ""Sandhana Kaappu""[sanfalwood pasted body] the unique decoration of the Lord so the temple darshan is closed for abishekam and decoration 11 to 12 noon Especially in summer people   waiting in quein summer inside temple.As you go bare footed in temple when you come out 1230 to one.you cannot walk on the footsteps as the stones absorb heat from sun shine and so every one have a feel of firewalk when they comeout finishing darshan. Some three decades ago i have seen similar Santhana kappu for Thiruchendhoor Murugan (lord Senthilnadhan) . When i visitef vadapalani yesterday Lord Senthilnadhan flashed in my mind for a whike Secondly unlike other Muruga temple you have seperate block/ dedicated sannadhi for chevvai, lord Guru and lord Saniswaran. People with dosham perform remedial pooja to alleviate their sins and problems. I remember the famous tamil song ""Thiruchendoorin kadalorathil Senthilnadan Arasangam"" implying Thiruchendoor was kingdom of lord Muruga.So is the power of Lord Murugan in Vadapalani also. Now that metro train stop at vadapalani I wish every hindu should visit Vadapalani whenever they land in Chennai .From Airport it is only a 10 minutes travel to vadapalani. Whatsoever it is millions of public perform marriage here and take Lords blessings. and also lot of doshams/ pariharam a strong Hindus belief. Also daily annadhanam is done for more than or mutiples of thousand devotees everyday. This is being gifted by devotees and devasthaanams ,a glorious service.See my posting on Vadapalani marriage festival following this blog"

Now we have this metro, I took a train from Nehru park (I stay nearby) and got down at Vadapalani station. The temple is adjacent to the station and is just a straight walkin. Had a darshan and it was a great experience. We have here a 20Rs queue as well as free darshan queue. But often I notice many find a way through  a gate near the deity's entrance....may be through influence. But everyone remain silent in spite of paying a price for a quick darshan, They make the deity look beautiful and it is divine to have a darshan here. The prasadam, esp the panchamrutham is as good as you get in Palani and it is only Rs 35 per can."

Not known to most of us...it is the only temple in India where Lord Muruga's statue will have slippers in the legs! This cant be seen...might be possible through VIP dharshan. The temple has many deities including saints like 'Arunagirinathar'. During the festival of 'Kandha Sashti' unimaginable crowd can be seen! The management has liberally installed roofs to protect us from heavy rains. Never pay the beggars but give them 'prasad' or excess food if you have it. Parking of 2 wheelers is free. Its situated directly opp. to the market. Many autos, cabs and buses will drop you there. If you visit, never miss out the tantalising food at hotel Saravana Bhavan (HSB)!!  "

Car park is limited and mostly street parking is done on the by lane near the temple. You can see multiple marriages being conducted  in the temple same time..during specific dates. The temple is quite old and fills you with spiritual thoughts. They have separate queues for free and paid darshan. However, the idol is quite visible from any of these . Only difference is those with paid darshan can go around the inner sanctum. Idol darshan is mesmerising with a bell sound you get the high...I visited with family."

Vadapalani_Murugan_Temple,rasa006,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,"Muruga Peruman in Aandi form ,just like Palani temple, in Chennai.","I visited this temple many times in the past. After a long gap,I again visited this famous Lord Muruga Peruman temple, on Thursday , 31.8.2017, evening. At the entrance we had Lord Vinayaga darshan, then Lord Chokkanathar and Valli -Dheivanai samedha Lord Subramania swamy. Then went inner mandapam.That day there's some betrothal function and Lord Muruga Peruman kalyana Utchavam, in mandapam.We had good darshan,with Lord in Sandhana kaapu alankaram ( Sandal paste). Not much crowd ,since it was Thursday. But we prefered paid darshan which cost Rs,20/- per head. Unfortunately no Golden Chariot on that day. We also worshipped Lord Subramanian with Valli-dheivanai on inner piragaram and also Lord Dakshinamoorthy and Goddess Durgambigai. Going around the temple,we prayed at Goddess Meenakshi, Lord Sevvai,( this is unique in this temple,with separate sannidhi for Sevvai). Then Near Temple flagpost, we prayed Lord Anjaneyar. Over all a good time for us.But try to avoid on Karthigai, Sashti and other Murugan festival days. Crowd will be too much. On Marriage Muhurtham days also good crowd. Another problem in this temple, parking. If you are going in your car-self driven- you may face some problems to alight and get back to car, since car parking is haphazard and not in good maintenance."

Vadapalani_Murugan_Temple,Ammu6,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,சந்தன காப்பு (sandal) ,"Hi everybody, This is my 1st review, Pls forgive me not giving too many details. I was all excited to go to Vadapalani temple.. So got ready at 6am and mom suggested I waited till 7am.. Since we were not sure if temple would be open. Temple open timings: 5amTuesdays and Kirthigai: 4:30amI got down from cab and got the archanai materials from a lady for ₹50. Got 3 mulam jasmine (₹20 each = total ₹60) which she made into a Garland. I gave the Garland to the moolavar. Archanai are done only with the urchavar.. I got a ticket for archanai ₹5 and special entry fees of ₹20.I stood in the queue for 30-40 minutes since moolavar was being done with sandal makeup. Wait was 100% worth.. Meenakshi Amman had the same makeup as well.. So beautiful. 🙏🏼We have Lord Ganesha, Shiva, Meenakshi, Aanjaneyar, Two more Muruga with Valli and Theiviyani.. I finished worshipping and got my prasadham Athirasam, thatai, murukku, laddo, panchamirtham, Pongal and puliyotharai.. There is a inside stall which has books, key chains, photos, posters of lord Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha.. Etc. Must buy.. Check out everything.. Don't miss. Get Ghee vizghakku for Lord Murugar to be lit right in front of Urchavar. There is a sithar peedam right next to the stall. Get two lemons. The cons:The temple is all about money. At Least ₹20. Or they literally make u feel like why u came.. And.. With cash issues in India.. It is difficult to get so much change.. I had only few ₹10.. This made it the sad visit. With all the people in their FastTrack life.. People should respect the few people who go to temples frequently.. And not scare them off. Anyways..I calmed myself cos I was happy to see Lord Muruga so beautiful.. ✌🏼When I came out.. There were two not so old ladies coming behind me asking me to get idlies. Now that I have seen happen when I get them food.. They don't seem to eat and sell them instead.. I have seen this trend in many temples.Anyhow.. I loved my Tuesday with Lord Murugar. If not for the depressing temple priests.. It would have been the best experience. I don't take pics of inside temple. I was busy worshipping too. Sorry. "
