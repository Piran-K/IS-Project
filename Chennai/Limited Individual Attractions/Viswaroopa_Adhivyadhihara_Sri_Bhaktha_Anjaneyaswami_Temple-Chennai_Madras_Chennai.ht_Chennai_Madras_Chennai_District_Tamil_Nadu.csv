Viswaroopa_Adhivyadhihara_Sri_Bhaktha_Anjaneyaswami_Temple-Chennai_Madras_Chennai.ht,Somaseshu Gutala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,"On my visit to Nangallur Anjaneya Swami temple, Chennai","Sri Viswaroopa Adhivyadhihara Bhaktanjaneya (One who removes mental and physical diseases) Swami temple is a well-known place in Nanganallur which has the privilege of having many holy temples like Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Navaneetha Krishnan temple, Sri Hayavadana Perumal temple, Sri Siddhi vinayakar temple, Ardhanareeswara temple, Sri Sarvamangala Rajarajeswari temple, Guruvayurappan temple and Sri Raghavendra Mutt. Sri Anjaneya temple is located at 8th street, Ist main Road, Ramnagar. You have to get down at Palavathangal or at Mambalam railway station to reach this temple. The idol of Anjaneya is thirty-two feet tall carved from a single granite stone and is the second tallest one after the statue of Hanuman in Panchavatee at Puducherry. Sri Maruthi Bhaktasamajam Trust with the blessings of Sri Raghavendraswami and Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswati succeeded in establishing this temple in 1989. The temple was consecrated with Kumbhabhishekam in 1995 after constructing a lofty 90-foot tall Rajagopuram. In 2008 this temple was taken over by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department, Govt. of Tamilnadu. As soon as one enters one can see the gigantic statue of Lord Hanuman in standing posture with folded hands. The tall statue decorated with flower garlands and golden crown looks quite majestic and evokes a sense of devotion. There is a pathway on four sides of the temple. The mandapam or the central hall is very spacious and devotees have to move in a queue. Three ghee lamps burn continuously in front of the sanctum. The temple is well-maintained and many senior citizens act as volunteers in doing temple work.  Various type of Prasadam such as Pongal,Puliyogara and Milagu Vada are freely distributed here to all devotees. Many devotees perform Vadamala seva here when the tall idol of Lord Hanuman is garlanded with vadas from top to bottom.  The temple is facing west and there is a second entrance from the southern side. On northwestern side there is the shrine of Lord Srirama with Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman. In southwestern corner there is a shrine for Lord Sri Krishna along with his consorts, Rukmini and Satyabhama. This is quite unusual since in many Hanuman temples one does not see a separate shrine for lord Krishna.  In the Northeastern corner there is a platform with lord Ganesh and there is an idol of Naga (serpent) on the left side of Ganesh. On the northwestern side of the temple there is a cowshed with many cows whose milk is used for temple sevas. To the eastern side of the temple one finds the kitchen and the administrative building. Many sevas are done in this temple. Sri Rama Kalyanam is performed every day. Special poojas and ceremonies are performed during festive days like Hanumath Jayanti, Golulasthami,Sri rama navami and Navarathri.  Special archanas are done on Saturdays and Abhishekams on Ekadashi and Amavaasi.The temple is open from 5.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon and from 4.00 to 9.00 p.m. in the evening. On Tuesdays and Saturdays one finds a huge crowd here.  The nearby temples are Sri Raghavendraswami temple and Guruvayur temple. If you visit Chennai do visit Naganallur area where you can see many temples with unique features and significance."

Actually they call this Anjaneyar as a 32 feet Anjaneyar [Single Stone] and actually the alangaram is done from something like a 3rd floor.It is so beautiful to see the Gigantic Anjaneyar whether he is arranged with Vennai[butter] Or Chandhanam [Sandalwood Powder] Or with Thulasi leaves.It is just a treat for your eye.After finishing the Darshan always you are given some or other delicious Prashad [Absolutely Free] which is no comparison with any tasty food bought from the best restaurants.I am sure a man who goes with no confidence would come out with a lot of confidence and the students who are in fear will become no fear begore writing the exam once they see this Anjaneyar.I request all who visit Chennai to see this temple without fail.
