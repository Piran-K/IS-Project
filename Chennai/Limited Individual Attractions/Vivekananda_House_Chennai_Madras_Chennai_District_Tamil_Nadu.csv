Vivekananda_House,AdishJain2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Business,Vivekanand House a place that ignite minds for self learning & meditation,"The 3 D presentation of World famous Chicago address of Swami Vivekanand in 1893 was quite impressive as it may be a good learning for all, Here I quote just a small part of the speech being a wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita: ""Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to me."" Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. That is what is tolerance for all views, all opinions, all religions worldwide, that is what our culture has taught us."

We were greeted by a big life size idol of Swami Vivekananda at the entrance of the house where we clicked some selfies. We saw beautiful paintings from ancient texts like Gita, Puranas, Ramayana, Mahabharata each sharing some message of wisdom. We also saw the room where Swamiji had stayed(for 9 days after returning from historic Chicago convention) and sat in meditation. We were shown a 3d movie of Swamiji delivering speech at Chicago convention. There is also a book store in the premises. 20 rupees ticket per person was absolutely worth it."
