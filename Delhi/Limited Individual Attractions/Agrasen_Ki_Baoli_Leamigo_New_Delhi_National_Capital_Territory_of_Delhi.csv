Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,An ancient step well in Delhi,"This is a step well that is said by some to date from very ancient times. In its current form however it dates from the time of the Delhi Sultanate. The step well itself is quite large and visually very impressive. There are some ruined buildings near it, and the overhanging tress are often filled with parrots."

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Satish C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Stepwell in heart of Delhi,Place to visit for those interested in architecture / history. This is not a huge stepwell compared to those in Rajasthan or Gujrat but one of the few remaining in and around Delhi. We visited on a Sunday but with intermittent showers the place was not crowded. Suggest getting dropped off or walking as there's no parking facility and this is on a very narrow street.

It'll be peaceful with no people around if you reach here early before 9 am becouse after many n many people are here. At most, you can get some quiet time here. But, there are better places to get some peace. So, to be honest, it's not worth the time if you are a backpacker. "

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Anjan Sengupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A hidden gem....,Not all people visiting Delhi have an idea of this hidden place. This is located at the heart of Delhi very near to Cannaught Place and can be reached in 10 minutes from there with an auto rickshaw. The design of this step well is very unique and it feels like entering a fort when you start going down the steps. This is an ideal place to sit and relax with family and click some memorable pictures..
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,MONA .,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,"Mystical ""Agrasen Ki Baoli""",It is noted to be one of the most haunted destination in India Built By King Agrasen during the time of Mahabharata.Its a step well lined by 108 steps and paranormal activities experience differs from person to person.Due to its Mesmerizing Architecture Many Bollyhood  shooting has been done in this Location.
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Vikas Singh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Step well in heart of New Delhi,"It is named after the legendary king Raja Agrasen (or Raja Ugrasen) of Agroha, who also happens to be the founder of Agarwal community. It measures 60 m in the north – south direction and is 15 m wide, and is made of rubble masonry. On the south west corner of the Baoli is a small mosque. The mosque is approached by a triple arched entrance but the arch on the southern side has long collapsed, along with the portions of the ‘whale back’ roof. Three of the four red sandstone pillared columns, that supported the arches, stands to this day. On the northern end of the Baoli is the circular well, measuring 8 m in diameter. The top of the well is covered with an iron grill preventing people from falling. The well is connected to the rectangular passage by shafts.On the southern side is a flight of 108 steps descending to the base of the Baoli."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Brun066,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,A wonderful mixture of utilitarian purposes and refined aesthetic solutions.,"Even before my trip to northern India I knew about the existence of ""baoli"", or stepwells, as a characteristic of this part of India, plagued by seasonal drought. I had in fact heard about it from an architect friend who had visited many of them, and had illustrated their features to me.Therefore, at the time of my visit to Delhi, I didn't miss out on this baoli, so central, relatively close to Connaught Place.It is relatively recent, compared to the average period of construction of the baoli (which would have been documented since the second century AD), dating back ""only"" to the fourteenth century.It certainly doesn't have the monumental, breathtaking grandeur of basins such as the Abaneri or Patan baoli. Unlike the latter, it's in fact long and very narrow: qualities that contrast with the depth of it, and make it almost a disturbing ""crack"" in the earth, in which you descend to the bottom with apprehension (not recommended for those suffering from claustrophobia).I started from this visit full of admiration for the wonderful mix that this work (as well as other similar ones) presents between utilitarian purposes and refined aesthetic solutions."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,AZCasualTraveler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Interesting Centuries Old Architecture,"In India, it has been estimated that there are about 100 of these centuries old ""Step Well"" structures - where well water was once obtained by simply walking down the ""steps"" to the water's edge.  The Agrasen Ki Baoli - Leamigo Step Well is probably the most famous of the India ""Step Wells"" - there have been several Bollywood movies made at this location.  This Well is also centrally located in New Delhi.The architecture of this ""Step Well"" is impressive for such an ancient structure and it is very nice to look at and take in the thought of how many people in the past had made the trip down the Steps just to get water for their daily lives.  Interesting!"
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Ayushi Dixit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Dissappointed ,"Well , i was rather dissappointed after visiting this place. But what can you expect? Itz a well and a well that beautiful is worth it right ?But i expected it to be big like other monuments in delhi. "
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Mike X,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,Nice break ,"Free, easy to find and beautiful. If you're not visiting any other stepwells in India, for sure give this a shot. Mostly locals. "
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Mohit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Average. Good for a short visit. Free entry. Suitable location.,"There nothing much to see or experience here. The best part of the monument is that location. It's a convenient 10 minutes walk from CP. Also there is no entry fees for the monument. There are three levels with long stairs in the middle. Unfortunately, the access to different levels is restricted. Although it does not stop people to go to these levels for pictures but please be an educated traveller and not cross the makeshift barricades to access the levels.Baoli is a rajasthani word which means a well with staircases and that's what this place is. There is a well at the bottom of the steps. The steps are pretty steep as some places so if you have any knee problem then avoid getting down as it would be difficult to get back up. This place is also a hub for pigeons who like to defecate on tourists and there has been no attempt made to counter that problem. Seems the government of Delhi and ASI does not care much about this monument.Overall, you may spend 15 minutes to half an hour here. Take a couple of pictures and back to your merry way. I am really not sure why this monument is considered as a ""hidden gem"". There is no gem here honestly."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Roshni S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,A hidden gem in the heart of Delhi,"Surrounded by modern buildings located on Hailey Road, the Ugrasen ki Bauli is a great place for tourists and to hang around. But the steps are plenty and steep so come wearing proper footwear."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,suzirosie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Nice place to visit ,I stopped here for a quick visit on my way to Connaught Place. It's not a big sight but architecturally I think worth a look at. It's nicely maintained and you can take some good photos if you get there early when it's less busy.
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,RicherTrips,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Worth a short stop,"In our itinerary, we had scheduled a visit to a huge and famous step well, Chand Baori, but our local guide recommend to make a short stop in this one. It was a surprise to find this archeological site in the center of Connought Place, surrounded by buildings. For a start, this well origins are lost in time. Nobody knows when it was constructed.  Our guided pretended it was 2 thousand years old, but it was rebuilt on the 14th century."

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,markeric,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,A little hidden gem.,This place wasn’t on our radar but our taxi driver suggested it and we were very glad he did. You won’t spend long here but it’s very interesting and tucked away where you wouldn’t otherwise know it was there.Definitely worth putting on your ‘to see’ list!

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,namit1707,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Stepwell,"Sitiuated in the heart of capital of india its an ancient well, its a great place to visit by ancient architecture lover and historical lover. Take extra care if youare travelling with kids and senior citizens. The structure is well built. The entry to this place is free and the entrance doesn’t  gives you a clue, what are youabout to see inside, the road is bit congested where the entrance of this monument is there. Its an offbeat place in delhi which is not known to most of the people.This place is also having metro connectivity, 5 minutes walk from Barakhamba road metro station."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Stepwell,"The Agrasen ki baoli is a stepwell near Connaught Place of all places. Despite being devoid of decorations, the architecture of the stepwell is interesting, especially for it’s photogenic qualities. The top 3 levels and walkways and niches arranged around the side of the well, while the lowest level doesn’t have these features.The well is worth visiting when in Delhi, especially as it’s only about a 15 minutes walk south of Connaught Place."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,shirinlalkaka,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Amazing,"It's very beautiful. Definitely worth going and seeing. Unfortunately what used to be the well, is now covered with plastic bottles and other such rubbish."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Ibis L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Fourth of the three Baolis we visited,"One of our goals during our visit to India was to see as many step wells as we could.  We were able to see 4 of them and even though Agrasen Ki Baoli was our fourth one, it did not disappoint. In fact, they were all different and each one very beautiful in their own way.  An additional bonus is that as you admire the beautiful architecture, you can also see how  many of the locals interact and enjoy the place.  Highly recommended. "
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,MaitraSN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Lovely and Nostalgic Place to visit,Will kinda give a Rajasthan feeling. Designed differently than those in Rajasthan. The stairs in here goes straight downwards from one direction only Different from all directions that we generally see in the desert state.Lovely structure. Will be fascinated once you go all the way down and look up.Just enjoyyy
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Mags S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Stepwell,Step-wells are not well known structures to many tourists - this is an unusual example besides storing water it was a place for travellers to rest. Well preserved. Free to enter it is well worth a visit
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Journeyager,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Interesting free site,"After having to pay for almost every sites in Rajasthan and Agra, we told our Delhi driver to take us to free sites only and he brought us here. I enjoyed the movie PK and was quite excited that this was one of the sites where PK was shot. It was a Sunday, hence quite crowded. There are about 108 steps and some are quite steep. The well at the end of it is empty."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Gursharan Bahia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Bahia,Awsm ❤One of the best destinations in Delhi.

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Colin W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,An interesting place to visit,After several visits to India I have just become aware of step wells in general. This is a very impressive structure and a good example of how rain water was stored. Very photogenic and a great spot for couples
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,scott j,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,With a visit,Only a 15 or so minute walk from Connaught Place. Go early and beat the crowds for the best photo opportunities as it does get quite crowded. Entry is free.  It's a beautiful structure to see 
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,jazsacher,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Incredible Site !!,"I was literally overwhelmed with my visit to Agrasen Ki Baoli.  I came early in the morning and wasn't expecting much as I've visited other wells in India in the past.  But this place took my breathe away.... literally.  First off, we were the first ones here since it was early morning and we had the place to ourselves and therefore took some amazing shots in the process.  Secondly, this place is like a living, breathing optical illusion.  It seems to change appearance as you looked at it from different angles.  I've never seen anything quite like it.  And traveling down to the bottom of the wall and smelling the scent of bats and taking shots from there was amazing as well.  Visting Agrasen Ki Baoli was one of the highlights of my visit to India and I won't soon forget the experience.  But as I said, get there early.  Too many tourists there will ruin the experience.  You'll thank me later!"

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,792Carol_H,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Worth the Visit,"Agrasen Ki Baoli is a heritage stepwell 60m long and 15 m wide which was built in the 1400's. The structure is made of red stone and is partly immersed in water.This Baoli,(well) with 108 steps, is among a few of its kind in Delhi. The visible parts of this historical stepwell consist of three levels. Each level is lined with arched niches on both sides. The well was quite interesting but  the locals only use it to sit and stay out of the sun. Most people were on their phones playing games. We did walk to the bottom and back.Our driver did have a few issues trying to fin it which we thought was odd as it is on the tourist brochure as a place of interest. Our driver was booked via our Hotel so I would have thought drivers would know most of the places tourists would visit."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Siddarth Khare,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Friends,Worth visiting,"What a beauty in busy city.. It was a historic step well, Clean & Nicely mattened.. Good place to visit with family & friends. Just a suggestion because there is lot of waste water & due to that there are lots of mosquitoes. Good to carry some mosquitoes cream.. "
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,sunnyonsports,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Not what I thought - BETTER THAN I COULD SEE,"hidden behind a bendy road, waiting rickshaw drivers and an ice cream cart...i walked into what seemed like a scene from Batman Dark Knight Rises...cool and calm, and a lingering smell of mold and bird poop. Go early or go late but this is ancient scene does more justice in real life than pictures. The history can be reviewed online, no need for a guide.Get some great pictures, and locals can help setup a great shot. Daring? Walk to the very bottom and look up! I batman dare you."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Indu2510,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Simple and sweet,"Agrasen Ki Baoli is a small monument to visit. We happened to take the violet line and got off at janpath. From there, we took an auto, since it surely wasn't a walkable distance. Since we visited during the monsoons and also due to the presence of a small baoli- water tank within the monument, it surely was favourable season for mosquitoes. There are a series of steps leading you to the water tank or baoli but only to find plastic bottles thrown in the tank. The baoli has several angles to take good photographs and sit and enjoy on the steps. It may take about 30 to 45 minutes to complete your visit. From there, several autos are lined to take you to other nearby tourist destinations..Tip- if your planning to visit during monsoons, either wear full sleeves or apply good amount of mosquito repellent. One time visit that can be simple and sweet."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,The Author,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo,Spectacular ,"Coming to Delhi as frequently as I do, this is one place that always seemed to evade me. Usually it is closed due to public holidays or I get there too late in the day. So, I was thrilled to finally get inside to take a look. The strangest thing about Agrasen Ki Baoli is it's location in a normal urbane street in the middle of the city within a 20 min walk from Connaught place. This is an ancient step well built by the king Agrasen. The mechanics and architecture of the well are truly breathtaking. The entrance is free and it's a great place to chill and people watch as well as do some writing and drawings (to catch up on your trip so far!). Most tour groups miss this small but quite amazing site out, so if your in Connaught place and have a few hours to kill, search for it on Google maps and it will direct you. Enjoy!"
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Kaushik D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,A Historic Gem Hidden In The Urban Mess,"This isn't a monument. Just one of those rare engineering pieces that was used to quench a city's thirst, and till today, continues to be a calm, picturesque series of stone steps flanked by small alcoves on either side. Visit for that much needed adda with your squad, preferably during sunny mornings, or cool afternoons... and avoid during rainy days. And yeah...entry is free!!"
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,billyhockey,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Unique architecture,"Stepwells represent an original type of architecture and are found primarily in India and Pakistan. They were used to access groundwater but also stored rainwater. Given the resources that must have been required to construct such monumental architecture, it may be that stepwells had more than just a utilitarian function. In any event, it is remarkable to step away from the busy Hailey Road, and from the noisy horns of Delhi's cars and auto-rickshaws, and step into this peaceful baoil that may be more than 600 years old. The baoli, with three levels, multiple arches and over 100 steps to the bottom, is impressive. Entrance is free."

You may be surprised by the physical effort required to walk to the bottom and back up. The bats give it added atmosphere. It is the perfect Kodak moment and seems to attract a steady stream of visitors. The mosque tomb at the top is also worth a quick explore. Auto rickshaws are parked outside ready for your custom.

No entrance fee and very quite and tranquil place. You can walk down to the well, but the climb back up the steps is tiring in 40 degree heat so be warned. Nice place to visit"
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Mark F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Amazing,"This looks very little from the outside and is situated along a narrow lane but one you walk through the door all is revealed.  It is a step well and was used to store water for the summer months and the architecture is very clever and well worth seeing.You don't need long there, 15 minutes is probably fine.  Once inside there are a long flight of steps which take you down to the old water tank."

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Dev1972,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Step wells- nice place to visit in a short time,This is a step well that served the old city of Delhi. There is a huge flight of stairs to the bottom of the well. So be ready for some workout if you want to see form the bottom. Can be explored in 15-20 minutes. Free entry. A little of the main areas of the city and is not that well patronised by visitors. But certainly worth a visit.

Its a small place beside a narrow road. Good for a quick visit. There is a similar stepwall in old fort but that is much smaller.
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Mayank P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Holiday ,"Tucked away in the by lanes of New Delhi, far away from the chaos and noise of traffic, is the oasis of peace.  Attributed to the ancient King Agrasen (? Of Mahabharat vintage), this step well is a sight to behold.  Easy to reach, it's a haven of quiet and peace.  Do visit it if you have the time."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Anika-gupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Amazing place yet too crowded!,"I went to this place which had always been on my list as a must-visit in Delhi. The place has beautiful architecture and is amazing. I was a little bored down by the crowd and the loud punjabi music playing somewhere closet bogged me down. Going further down till where it is allowed, helped and was soon used to the noise and the people didn't matter. I'm definitely going to visit this place again on a weekday, hoping for more calm atmosphere."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,JEAN B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,An amazing piece of architecture..,"Not far from Connaught Place in the centre of Delhi, behind an ordinary stone wall we were faced with one of the most amazing sights we had ever seen. It is almost impossible to describe the experience of walking through the entrance and being faced with this unbelievable piece of architecture. We’re used to looking up at architecture, not down into it, which adds to the sheer amazement and excitement when you see it. We saw several other below ground cisterns or stepwells as they are known in India, after this and were amazed by construction of them all.Agrasen Ki Baoli or Ugrasen Ki Baoli on the information block, a stepwell, is central Delhi’s oldest monument and still remains one of the best preserved Baolis in Delhi. The red-bricked monument is now protected under the Archeological Survey of India. It is 60-metres long and 15-metres wide.The monument has 105-108 steep steps (I lost count) with a series of carved arched chambers and passages on each side.  At the bottom there are several small openings that lead into what is now a dry well shaft. The flights of steps were originally excavated next to deep well shafts, ensuring that ground water could be reached all year longThousands of stepwells were built around India over a thousand years ago but most of them are now in total disrepair. Agrasen Ki Baoli can be found on Hailey Road near Connaught Place, Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.It is open 9 am to 5 pm and is free to enter. The nearest metro station  is Barakhamba Road the or Rajiv Chowk."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,G A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Amazing Ancient Step Well In The Heart Of New Delhi,"Agrasen (or Ugrasen as the ASI board proclaims) ki Baoli is an amazing find in the heart of New Delhi.  Especially for those of us who havent seen that many old step wells before :)AKB is actually on Hailey LANE which is a narrow lane off Hailey Road near Mandi House.  The nondescript entrance is sort of opposite a plain building - maybe a school - with a large  colourful hard to miss wall mural.  As I said, the entrance is so nondescript that once you pass through the grill gate and look left, you are in for a shock!   This ancient stepwell apparently dates back to the 14th century or even earlier as per Wikipedia.   History aside,  it has loads of character and exudes the characteristic charm of all things ancient.    I first came here a few years ago when there were barely five other visitors apart from me and the site had an eerie feel in the backdrop of the then recent horrific Delhi gangrape that shocked the entire nation.   Now it was brimming with people, mostly college kids, young lovers and a smattering of tourists, with a decidedly cheerful ambience.This stone step well is a real gem that deserves a visit.  Not suitable for the disabled or those who have walking difficulties, or for children.  There are very many steep steps going all the way down to the actual rather dirty well, so it helps to wear sensible footwear and tread cautiously.  Apart from the ambience and the actual step well, there is also a khandhar   right on top where a bored ASI guard sits.AKB is very popular with the Time Pass crowd !No toilets and no food available inside.  Street food hawkers are available outside on Hailey Lane.PS:  What on earth is Leamigo???"

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Marcel B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Business,Best selfie place ever,"After lunch we drove to Agrasen Ki Baoli near Dailey Lane in New Delhi. Adress Hailey Road, Near Diwanchand Imaging Centre, K G Marg, Hamdard Nagar, Vakil Lane, Mandi House, New Delhi, Delhi 110001, IndiaThis is a surprising function in the heart of modern New Delhi, but it dates from before the new city by about 500 years and would have been used by the rural villages that once populated this area.Baoli is a feature of North India and was built to absorb seasonal fluctuations in the water supply, from the immense rainfall that fell during the monsoon season to the next periods of drought.A long staircase leads to the water level and the curved walls flank at the sides of the baoli. This is not only a water storage, but it is also a place to stay cool in warm weather. The architecture is typically late Tughlaq and the early Lodi dates from the mid-15th century. There is a small mosque at the entrance."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Rahul D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Wonderful Baoli,"If you are in Delhi and want to explore some new , exciting places then you should visit Agrasen ki Baoli.

Had seen this place in PK movie for the first time and then when visited Delhi we made a point to visit this place.You will see many tourist, many students doing sketch of the architecture and its very remarkable!!Since it’s within the city limits it easily accessible, a must visit place.Personally, I love this place!!"
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,divertliving,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Hidden Gem of Delhi,This is one our favorite place we have been so far in the city. This is a beautiful piece of history that is not crowded with people and is also free. By no means is this place huge but its well worth a visit and if you are into taking photos and learning history this is a not miss stop on your tour through Delhi.
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Tarique S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,HIDDEN HISTORIC POINT AMID BUSY CITY,"""Baoli"" is referred to step well. It is located in the heart of New Delhi. If you have ample time in hand then you must visit this place. Good for photo shoot. However if you are running short of time then you can skip it. If Jaipur or Jodhpur is in your plan then you will find lots of such step well over there. Location wise, its very close to Rajiv Chowk Metro Station. Exit from Gate No 5 or Gate No 6. Janpath Metro stop is also nearby. There is no proper parking available outside the Baoli, so you have to park on road side. Entry is free."

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Tabrez K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,A piece if history,The entrance is small but the baoli itself is big. tucked between residential buildings in one of the posh localities. There is no parking so better park in a safe parking place and take a rick to the place. There is no ticket. Lots of people visiting on a weekend. the well is dry but you can see the main well and the bathing pond clearly. Go during the day.
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,SCD,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Careful where you park!,"Interesting place to visit. Well maintained - clean and graffiti free. Very popular. Make sure you go all the way to the bottom so that you can inspect the water tank. Be very careful where you park. The auto drivers won't tell you it is a no parking zone and there aren't any signs so when you return to see your car has been towed, the auto drivers then charge you a fortune. Speaking from experience! "

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Marvin G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,A Step Well that is Architecturally Unique and Wonderful,"This step well, an underground structure that is used for the storage of water, was built by the Raja Ugrasen to help this area cope with seasonal fluctuations in the availability of water.  It was built with rubble and dressed stones and is one of the finest examples of baolis in Delhi.  Its main feature is a flight of 108 steps leading down to a very deep well.  The walls on both sides of the steps inset with a series of arches and corridors.There is a small mosque on a platform on the left side of the edifice as you descend to the well with a domed roof and columns made of sandstone.  People come here all the time to relax and take in the architectural wonders of this complex.  Shielded by trees and other plantings, it is a great place to visit on a hot and humid Delhi day."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Adesitraveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Interesting venue right in the heart of the city,"We wanted to see this venue during our holiday. It is in a small bylane and it took us some time to locate it.The place is in a pretty good shape given its age and complete lack of protection from not just the elements but the misbehaving tourists as well. The steps are quite steep and there are no guide rails. Similarly, with all the teens pushing each other around, there is an accident waiting to happen.India has some wonderful monuments with far more history than most countries in the world. We should really take care of them."
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Arnab,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,wonderful stepwell,this is architecturally and symmetrically very beautiful. unfortunately its quite full of pigeons and their poop and not just that as you go down the steps you can smell the stench of the water and the bats on the ceiling dont add to the beauty either. but otherwise its a great place to spend the afternoon sunning in the delhi winter chill
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Nilisha Agarwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,A beautiful place to hangout with friends and with yourself,"A place that was #lost for so many years in the heart of #Delhi which was found by a #bollywood movie #PK. .Agresen ki bowli is the place name and it is near to Cannaught Place (walkable). This place is one of the most haunted places in the city, and I can say that why. It have hundreds of bat inside it with a well inside it. There are stories around well , somewhere I read that water calls the name of person nearby and person then jumps off in water because it seems so beautiful to them. For me I felt, that anyone can slip into well because it's slippery and narrow.Go there, find out what do you think of this place."

Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Avik C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,A deep well right at the heart of the city,Points deducted for the poor maintenance.This is an example of the amazing architecture of ancient India.You will certainly be stunned as soon as you enter the ancient reservoir. Partly because you will not be expecting what you will see. And mostly because of the sheer genius of the construction.The place can be better managed and can be turned to an awesome tourist attraction.Warning for people with vertigo as the steps are quite steep.

Super duper place to show someone who wants to see a heritage site in Delhi apart from the famous India Gate and Qutub Minar. Mind you the place is nowdays crowded with love birds and teenagers. This structure was built in 13-14 century though no one knows the exact date. I wish the Government maintains it nicely.
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Aparajita_03,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,An old gem with new found popularity,"This ornate step well is located in a quiet locale of Hailey Road. However, after it was featured in the movie P. K. it has become immensely popular with the crowd. There was no place to stand on a Saturday. So the charm of the place came down a bit. You can visit if you are in CP and looking for something offbeat to do. However, coming dedicatedly for this is not recommended. You can spend about half an hour here if you want to go till the bottom of the well, but please be careful as the steps are old and uneven. Go when the weather is a bit cool as the rocks will get hot in summers. "
Agrasen_Ki_Baoli_Leamigo,Miranda H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Have to visit! Won't take long.,Our tuk tuk driver took us here as Red Fort was closed - very tucked away & unassuming entrance then wow! You look down a massive set of steps down to the well at the bottom.  Teenage couples sitting all the way down.  An ancient feel but also a buzzy feel with all the kids.  Definitely worth a visit - by the time youve walked down & up again & taken some atmospheric photos it will only take 20 mins.  Purana Qila (old fort) & Ghandi monument are en route/close by so that was our afternoons itinerary.
