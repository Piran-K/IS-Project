As soon as I reach lockers we‚Äôre ready Ms. Chimmi from Spa offered locker facilities, offered camomile tea to de stress my anxiety as I told her I was stuck in bad traffic (it‚Äôs like she can read guest need from far) the way she talks so calming. She remembers I prefer my herbal tea without honey, Chimmi is always on her toes to help guest with the most loving and caring smile. She is a GEMJitender was present by the pool side with big smile and greetings he said ‚Äúwelcome back to our hotel‚Äù it was so welcoming, he remembered I walk around without slippers so made sure slippers, towels, water were ready with welcome tray and fruit (what a genuine touch, he remembers all preference) and also he handed me over the swimming goggles and said last time you had red eyes because you did not put on the goggles so may I request you to put it this time so you protect your eyes ( mind blowing)Rahul was there too he saw me struggling with my swimming technique and he immediately told me some new techniques to improve my swimming skills. Very very helpful. I was little hesitant to ask for help but he was like we are always here to assist you so please feel free to ask for any help, best swimming instructor I have ever come across. 10 start to all 3 of them‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

Aheli_Spa_The_Roseate,Tshering P,,,,"If planning a wedding is a hassle looking for a place to hold down a spa day for my dearest friend bridal shower was work in itself,after many calls to many spas and visiting a few finally decided on this Aheli spa. One of the few reason was because they were able to customise our treatment, everyone wanted to get a facial but we were also a bit hesitant as we were being careful not wanting to just allow just any product out there in the market to touch our face. Fortunately Vili was able to guide us perfectly and the facial start with a consultation to face analysis And voila it works like magic. Love the spa the outdoor setting it‚Äôs unlike any other place in Delhi, who knew such a day out in Delhi will make it a memorable experience. We spent another hours after our spa session taking Instagram worthy pictures all around the resort üòÇ will definitely come back here . They got a beautiful restaurant kiyan with a beautiful alfresco setting as well.Again thank you to the entire Aheli spa team  Nishi, juli,chimi, and few others I don‚Äôt remember (sorry)for such an amazing therapy.

The manager Miss Sushma herself came to reception to welcome us,  such a kind gesture. We enjoyed Hammam, Aheli signature massage etc. All of us loved it so much. Excellent and very courteous team. Thank you so much and we will be back very soon. "

The moment I entered the resort I was astonished with the beauty, what a lovely breathtaking Resort..... I love the way Ms. Sushma (Manager) organized everything and she is so knowledgeable about therapies that she suggest exactly the therapies required to relax. Both of us enjoyed Aheli signature therapy and Oliver claire Facial. It's a little expensive but I promise it's worth every penny.... Pema and Paldon both our therapists were highly trained .Will return back for sure. Will highly recommend....... Thank you!"

Aheli_Spa_The_Roseate,Christopher B,,,,"Aheli spa The roseate.Have visited the spa after hearing so many good things about the service from my colleagues. Tried the hammam bath after the receptionist Vili suggested, and it was exactly as she had said. The heavenly hammam room was warm embracing me in it warm touches. As I swear away my toxin, the masseuse chimi scrubs away my dead cells, then comes the bubble massage which was heavenly I floated in a cloud of bubbles. The ending of the therapy I was wrap in a towel covered from neck down with chocolate . The result : i felt like wearing a new pair of baby skin . Worth every bit of it. Definitely coming back next month. Thank you team!"

She went in with a headache and came out absolutely rejuvenated and fresh! The Indian Ayurvedic spa was super super good and I would highly recommend it to everyone.As a matter of fact, within next three days, I took my entire family to experience the worlds best spa! A big thank you for making our day awesome to the aheli spa manager (Ms Sushma) and her team (Ms Chimmi and others).Best."
