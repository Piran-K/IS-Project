The staffs are super friendly and accommodate my ever changing schedule. The room is basic but with all you need. You will he placed on a special wood table and wear a special G string.

But the treatments are really rejuvenating - the massage, the Shirodara and the steam bath was excellent value and the team even opened the place for us on what was their usual day off which was just absolutely outstanding service.

On my searches for Delhi Auraveda Wellness Center repeatedly came up. I made an appointment for my first day. I had the Abhyanga (Head to toe full body oleation with medicinal oils), Swedana (Full body Steam bath), Shirodhara (Oil therapy on head) and a facial with a lovely lady Radha who has been doing these treatments for a long time!  I went back 5  times always to my 'girl' Radha. The staff is very gracious. I had so many questions about ayurvedic medicine  they arranged for a short consult with Dr Adarshkumar the center's ayurvedic doctor. I highly recommend Auraveda Wellness Center and suggest requesting Radha!"

I made inquiries and received a very helpful reply via WhatsApp.  On arrival in Delhi I called and made an appointment.  No problem.  However, from my hotel in central Delhi, not far from Connaught Place, it was quite difficult for the taxi drive to find.  It took about an hour.  (My taxi driver was very kind and helpful and waited for me in the extreme heat) .  On arrival I filled in a form about any risks or ailments.  I was taken into the massage room by a very sweet young woman.  I had the Abhyanga (Head to toe full body oleation with medicinal oils), Swedana (Full body Steam bath), Shirodhara (Oil therapy on head) followed by a shower.  It lasted about an hour and a half.  I felt absolutely wonderful afterwards.  The place is clean and very professional.  I can highly recommend this centre."

This is not a place if you expect luxury. It's just a simple yet very clean and authentic wellness center.Will return again."

,,,,,I just dropped in casually to know how an ayurveda  centre was being run at a place far away from the land of Ayurveda.  It really surprised me.  They are well organised and placed with a good and dedicated team headed by an experienced and able physician. I enjoyed their service and it gave me good relief. I recommend this Centre for those seeking  rejuvenation and overall physical well being through our age old system of ayurveda. Best wishes.....

The love and affection clubbed with the pleasing way of interaction of the staff members of the Centre deserve appreciation.  Dr. Adarsh's gentle way of clearing doubts of patients is remarkable.

But when i got a chance to do that here in this centre i really felt a mesmerising energy burst in myself. Such power of ayurveda should be explored more for studies.

Dr Adarsh Kumar took time to explain the different techniques of Auraveda and is someone who cares about people and health. He is a pleasure to talk to. The very skill massage therapist ( there were two) were extremely professional and attentive. Excellent coordination between them. it was a life changing experience. Highly recommend this center.
