Awaken_Inner_Buddha_Yoga_Meditation,Laura D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,"Amazing experience, very grateful","Big thank you to Vidhi for his great ayurvedic massage and the chakra healing session and all the conversations. After one yoga session with him in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in an autumn evening, we decided to go all (5 people) for a tea in the city. Sharing this joyful, friendly space of presence between friends, I started asking all my ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù questions/ may call them also ‚Äúlife purpose questions‚Äù to Vidhi. Questions on which I already took my time to practice and mediate, but still there was something not ending this inquiry path, something inside was blocked. I was extremely touched by a deep peace and a deep quiet space inside, while Vidhi provided all the answers in his unique, calm way, emanating wisdom, coming from experience. I immediately knew that this is not an ordinary human being sitting in front of me. He is the One Yoga practitioner, who did sincerely inquired his own path in searching for the Absolut Consciousness/Divine. This deep feeling of peace inside revealed to me, without any mind concepts, the truth of this words and made a switch in my being. Coming back home, this deep peace was still inside and I knew, I had to see Vidhi again. So, already before, I have asked for the ayurvedic massage and the chakra healing, not really knowing what to expect, but knowing that I have to give myself the gift of releasing my chakra blockages ‚Äì and Vidhi was the One who needed to do it.During the both session, I did not really felt to much, neither in the body nor in the minds-play, but this did not distracted me. The next day, I felt energized, good, very happy, full of life - as if the whole world was open for thousand possibilities and I was open to receive. And from that point on, I gain very much clarity on different topics in my life, but the most important is they joy inside which is stable and can see the beauty of life. I have also encountered strong energy connection to Vidhi the next days. This was miraculous. I am very grateful for Vidhi and his time, then and now, each time we speak and he shares his experiences and teachings with myself. Thank you, Vidhi!I do believe that outside there, there are Healers meant to be on this earth, to uplift our spirit and help us move to upper levels of consciousness, each time we are blocked. And I am fortunate to say, that I have met one of them in the person of Vidhi. I recommend you all to experience the power of ancient Yoga with Vidhi, through whatever practice you decide to pick. Namaste dear friends! May we all live peaceful and happy!"

,,,,,"I was on a work trip with a colleague who'd never been to India but practiced yoga regularly. I hadn't done ANY yoga in years,  so she and I were at very different levels. The Awaken Inner Buddha team was very easy to work with via email ahead of time, and I was able to schedule the session just for two people (my colleague and myself) at a time that worked for us on the day that worked best. Great experience before I even attended the session! Then, we met Vidhi in the Lodhi Garden and had a wonderful, peaceful, educational session... it was challenging for my well-practiced colleague, but Vidhi also attended to my level and made it very rewarding but comfortable for me to try my best. I even achieved my first-ever headstand!! I told Vidhi I was scared before I did it, but he had faith in me and was there to support me--I was so proud and it never would've happened if not for this session and Vidhi! I'd attend a session with Awaken Inner Buddha again in a heartbeat, and highly recommend it if you have a group of people who want to experience yoga in Delhi!

Awaken_Inner_Buddha_Yoga_Meditation,Marco S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Highlight of my week in Delhi,I met Vidhi in India. He was very kind and helped my friend and I out. He helped us with our health problems by giving us advice and took us around town to buy what we needed. I noticed significant improvements in my health with the help of Vidhi! He stayed in touch and continued to see how I was doing as well as giving new tips.During this time of quarantine he is now doing free meditations weekly on Facebook live. He kindly invited me to join and I have found them very beneficial. He explains the techniques in a way that is easy to understand and guides through a meditation. He is very open to answering questions and explaining. If you are interested in his work but unsure take this opportunity and join the free meditations on Facebook. He is a great soul and very easy to talk to. Enjoy his meditations and explore everything else amazing that he has to offer. You wont regret it!

Awaken_Inner_Buddha_Yoga_Meditation,Abhishek,,,,"I highly recommend this wonderful introduction to Yoga. I was travelling for work but was able to tack on 1.5 days to see a bit of Delhi. I decided to take this half-day course as I have been interested in yoga but I haven't taken many classes. I wanted to know more about the underpinnings. I thought New Delhi would be a good place to find out more :)Vidhi introduced the principles of yoga, addressed my questions and cleared up several misunderstandings. I think these misunderstandings about yoga are prevalent in Canada and the US. He also demonstrated and then taught me about deep breathing, yoga postures, and meditation. Overall a wonderful introduction in a peaceful setting (Lodhi Gardens). I would really like to do a 1-week session with my family sometime in the future. I will continue to follow Vidhi's offerings to see if that is a possibility in the future.More info and tips: There were 2 students on the day I attended which was great because I also learned a lot from the questions the other student had. You should bring a sweater (in the colder months) because the initial part of the class is teaching and discussion. The ""active"" part of the session is later in the class. Bring a pen if you want to add notes in the handbook provided."
Awaken_Inner_Buddha_Yoga_Meditation,Josh Y,,,,"I managed to squeeze in this workshop with just hours to spare before my return flight to London and I am so glad I did it. Vidhi is an inspirational and engaging teacher, and the course covered a lot of aspects of Yoga that would traditionally not be covered in a London based Yoga class. The whole thing makes so much more sense to me now and I left excited and keen to put more effort into regular practice. I can definitely recommend the workshop and would be interested in attending one of the retreats in the future."
Awaken_Inner_Buddha_Yoga_Meditation,Abhishek,,,,"I had a therapeutic session with Vidhi in Delhi, who guided and taught me about preventive and even curative care of my state of health, I had several hormonal imbalances and now that I returned to my country I have noticed that after 4 months following their recommendations, my health has been impacted  positively in physical and emotional aspects, making changes that do not require great efforts but have changed my life in a positive way, and that now as a medical doctor I will use with my patients.  thanks Vidhi for your knowledge and empathy at the service of always helping."

Even with a lot of Ayurveda doctors, they fail to see the root causes and fail to cure.

We are glad to hear you have started on the path of healing. May you be happy "

,,,,,"A friend and I recently went to India for the first time to attend a wedding. We were both interested in yoga, meditation, and mindfulness before our trip, but did not have much experience. We decided to book a personal session with Awaken Inner Buddha Yoga & Meditation because of the rave reviews online and it did not disappoint! We met at a beautiful park in Delhi and the instructor brought everything we needed for the class. He was extremely knowledgeable and a great teacher, as well as, a very patient and kind person. We spent a lot of time performing various yoga practices during which the instructor would help us gain the correct form and would also explain the value of what we were doing. In the same vein we spent a long time practicing and learning about various types of meditation. After all of that, we spent another hour talking about the practical value of what we learned, the philosophy behind what we learned, as well as the history. His passion for yoga practice and teaching others that practice was palpable and we both left the session with a craving to learn more.  I would highly recommend taking a class if you have the chance!!"
,,,,,"Private Sessions with the masters or any of our lead teachers are especially quite enriching experience. You were led into this session by Master Vidhi and such sessions are quite therapeutic as well as knowledgeable since master does not teach looking at time. If he feels the participants are willing to learn, he shares with all his heart. We are glad you had an amazing experience. "

The class was superbe and the teachings resonated with me. 3.5 years later, I finally had the privilege to be able to attend the Alchemist retreat. I would recommend the retreat to anyone who wants to start a transformation to grow. On these 8 days, I was able to reset parts of me away from the bustle and hustle of my daily life and learned on how to continually grow beyond the retreat. It was truly transformative. An added bonus was to be in the idyllic location of Poovar Island in Kerala that added to the feeling of serenity the meditation sessions brought to me. I recommend. "

Master Vidhi ( who we have had the opportunity to see in Europe) makes this subject so interesting and easy, that he makes Yoga a very scientific & easy to question subject. Simply must attend. I have done a Yoga TTC in Rishikesh and yet this seemed to be the most informative & interesting workshop I ever did on Yoga. Deep gratitude.

,,,,,"I booked in for a half-day of yoga, just incredible. I was staying at a guesthouse that was a 15 minute walk from Lodhi Gardens where the yoga took place. The guesthouse was recommended to me by Awaken Inner Buddha, it was called Lutyens Bungalow, I highly recommend. I signed up to the half-day yoga from 9-3pm. If I‚Äôm totally honest I really didn‚Äôt know what to expect. I met Vidhi at the gate and we walked into the beautiful gardens. Having done some yoga over the years, I never knew the history or had great understanding of what it was about apart from the basic exercises. Vidhi has such passion and the time flew by in a dash. He explained the 12 basic Sun Salutation as well as the Yamas and the Niyamas. We did some breath work and I was amazed how quickly he focused my mind on something entirely different to what I had been thinking about previously. We went through the 7 chakras, something I really knew nothing about. Vidhi was kind and calm and is hugely knowledgeable. I feel so incredibly grateful to master Vidhi; grateful for all the teachings, the blissful treatment (which I will write about in a separate review) and the advice following the class to me and my sister - drink more water!! I almost didn‚Äôt do it because I am on a fairly tight budget for the trip and these were ‚ÄòLondon prices‚Äô but this was worth every penny and if I go back to Delhi I would definitely book into more yoga and treatments. I highly recommend!! "
