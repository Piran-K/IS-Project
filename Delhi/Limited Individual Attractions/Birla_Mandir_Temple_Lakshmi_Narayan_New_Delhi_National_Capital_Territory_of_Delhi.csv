Birla_Mandir_Temple_Lakshmi_Narayan,Anand R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,Serene beauty which is more than a temple.,"A nice serene place in a middle of delhi’s hustle bustle. The road mandir marg where it is situated is a quiet tree lined artery with temples and schools lining one side giving it a very unique ambience. It is not just beautiful to look at but thoughtfully planned providing good flow for pilgrims with multiple levels of separation using contour of the land. Most people completely miss the best part of the complex, the garden at the backside - a place where one can just relax and get lost for hours. Do not go there for a quick visit, spend time to soak in the subtle spiritual calm of this gem of a place in Delhi."

There is Sai Baba temple at its back side. If you have time, kindly attend its evening Aarti as well. You won't be disappointed.
