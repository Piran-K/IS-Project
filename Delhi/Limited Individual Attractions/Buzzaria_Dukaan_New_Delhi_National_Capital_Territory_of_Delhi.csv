Buzzaria_Dukaan,Indrani Pushilal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,The Buzzaria experience - a friendly encounter,"This is a one stop shop for all kinds of ethnic wear, accessories and decorative products for your home. Organic, from reliable and dependable sources. The variety is enormous. I found kurtas, earrings, beautiful potted plants, lanterns, cold pressed oils, yummy relishes too. Apart from the retail experience, there are weekly events. Workshops on handicrafts, metallurgy, jewellery made from recycled materials. Every Thursday there is the Thursday thing... where you get to meet very interesting, dedicated individuals who tell their story of failures and success in a very congenial, friendly and warm environment. It's live on Instagram too. The founder Mamta has an endearing personality. Once you meet her you want to come back again just to spend a few moments with her and her young enthusiastic team. Am told, a lot is planned this winter. I shall look forward to the events for sure and pick up some goodies too. Oui! C'est vraiment formidable, je dois avouer !"
Buzzaria_Dukaan,Shamik N,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Half-hazard, over-priced, ‚Äúhandicraft-washed‚Äù","The shop is SIGNIFICANTLY high-er priced for same&similar products that are also available in other small-cottage-industry stores in Delhi. Some of those stores have a MUCH higher infrastructure/overhead costs and a fair-pricing policy for the actual workers, in-spite of that, this store decides to sell stuff at even a higher price, which should make the customers wonder is it unfair pricing or unsustainable-profitability that is to be blamed for?"

Buzzaria_Dukaan,Juan C,,,,"Buzzaria Dukaan - the name conjures up images of the erstwhile old shopping destinations , however this is very different....spacious interiors filled with a variety of stuff - exclusively made in India. Sarees , stoles, jewellery, cosmetics, lamps, gift items - you name it and they seem to have everything. With staff who are like the girls next door rather than the upscale english speaking girls at branded shops who pester you with fake accents - the place is warm and hospitable too.The location is great too surrounded by eateries and the famous qutub minar complex at a stones throw .A must visit for everyone - and don't forget to meet the owner Mamta - a lady with an infectious smile and a heart of gold !!"

Buzzaria_Dukaan,Annu K,,,,"The cashier gave me her number to send her a message if I wanted to buy something afterhours since i had no time for shopping because of the tour coach. And she did. I sent her a message and she waited me! Definitively best staff ever. The place is tidy and organized, with A/C. Prices are fair considering that everybody in New Delhi wants to sell you something overpriced just because you are a tourist!. And if you buy there you support local handcrafters, from small companies. Do not get into the scam of the ""Cottage emporiums"", instead of that, save your money, take an uber to this store and buy your souvenirs and mementos in there, you will finish your shopping with a big smile for sure!."

,,,,,"Shopping seems to me a chore most days, but this time my visit to Buzzaria Dukaan in the Qutub Tiffin opposite made me realise once again that shopping can be fun. It is like a mini mela, with such a delighful offering that one invariably comes back feeling happy. Especially when looking for gifts, there are so many options, at so many price points that one is literally spoilt for choice. Whether it be stylish or traditional clothes, funky or classic jewellery, potted plants or hand painted juttis, stylish sling bags or blingy potlis, the options are plenty, at prices that do not hurt are so competitive that you are full of admiration for their sourcing. The essential oils and attars available there give the place an even more interesting vibe and energy.Buzzaria Dukaan is a not to be missed shopping experience. I strongly recommend it."

I can bet you will not only fall in love with the place, but end up doing all your shopping for folks back home here itself. And yes - what Mamtaa (the charming owner of Buzzaria) - doesn't know about Indian artifacts and artisans, is not worth knowing. So go on - explore India under one roof !"

Buzzaria_Dukaan,Sheetal B,,,,"This tiny beautiful world is very close to Qutub Minar. If you are a visitor to Delhi and are taking a tour of the city, do not miss out the Buzzaria Dukaan. This is where versatile Indian aesthetics meets the upbeat West in a vibrant array of colourful handcrafted jewellery, clothes that are as comfortable to wear as are beautiful. Founded by Mamta Gupta, who you will run into at the store more often than not, this place keeps the artisans creativity alive. With over thirty brands under the umbrella Mamta has brought together and kept alive art and creativity that is fast fading into oblivion with the modern mall approach these days. I went to the store and there was a story to each and every concept. The passion and commitment to the store is prominently visible in every person that works there. This is a must visit place for picking up clothes, jewellery, souvenirs to carry home for family and friends. Don't miss it. I insist."
Buzzaria_Dukaan,Mamtaa G,,,,"Have been going to Buzzaria for a while now and thought it was finally time to give them the review that they deserve. Truly a hidden gem - a treasure trove for all those who love anything Indian or Creative. Mamtaa, the founder, clearly has an eye for picking out the best creative talents and giving them a platform to go commercial. So dont be surprised if you see fabric with borders converted to trays, or thread and pins used to create beautiful wall art or bindis and stones used to make plenty of gift items! Cant really decide if its product offer, the colors of the store, the festivity, the decor, the warm staff, or the exuberance of Mamtaa herself that draws me to that store over and over again. And on every visit, am always on the lookout for something new - that Buzzaria never fails to deliver.A must must visit. Now at another loaction - Qutub Tiffin too!"
Buzzaria_Dukaan,Laurie C,,,,"Buzzaria is the brainchild of the very beautiful Mamta Gupta an alumni of NIFT, founder of 'Kutir'. The space reflects aesthetics and vibrancy. We can see glimpses of 29 states in this museum where sale happens automatically and spontaneously. Highly recommended and must visit place for Indian artefacts lovers."
Buzzaria_Dukaan,Mamtaa G,,,,"Bang opposite Qutub Minar is the Qutub Tiffin Market and towards it inner lanes is a gem of a store called Buzzaria. This is the second outlet of the store. I have been to the first one many times and have always ended up getting something unusual,  so decided to go to its second larger outlet. The interiors have been done up in hues of lime, ochre and fuschia and are inviting and aesthetically appealing. The Dhokra jewelry is what catches my fancy at once. Wait a sec, I tell myself as I spot some very cool tee-shirts from the corner of my eye. I try one on and the fabric is super soft ‚Äì organic I'm told. Nice! The pretty block printed skirts and smart suede handbags also tug at my heart and I readily loosen my purse strings for the goodies. As I explore a little further, I find kurtas in pastel shades with an offbeat cut.  I like the concept of having so many unusual and new brands in one place in both the womens wear category and the home decor segment both. There's plenty to choose from, be it beautiful trays for your dining purposes, kurtis, cushions, pallazos, stationery to what have you oxidized jewelry, one piece dresses, dupattas, stoles and lots more. They have an eclectic mix of established and upcoming brands and its a must visit concept store. Before you choose to go to one of the over hyped markets in Delhi, do yourself a favor ‚Äì go to Buzzaria at Qutub Tiffin !!"

Thank you for stopping by and shopping at Buzzaria Dukaan and finding us irresistible.
We carry anywhere from 30 to 50 different brands from all across India, many of them being small independent businesses and social enterprises and ngo's and fair trade, all the brands sell at the same MRP across India.We don't define the price.
In fact, we pride ourselves on being a very reasonable store and price conscious beside socially conscious and quality conscious.
We are working to create sustainability for all involved.
As a store, which is only about makeinIndia and dying art and craft and creating income for the illiterate and the people who work with their hands.Hope you will rethink your view.
The costs of putting up a store, where the margins on products is very minimal, is a very challenging and daunting task and we need people coming in 100's to support the cause of Indian Handmade and Handcrafted.

Buzzaria_Dukaan,Santosh G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,TRIP TO FAIRYLAND,"Visited BUZZARIA as a sceptic , i am not an 'ETHNIC' person. surprised myself picking up 13 items. One hell of a lot for a person who had decided not to shop. simple ;calling BUZZARIA 'ethnic' would be undermining its reach . The place is a colourful mini india , each garment is an amazing embodiment of ethnicity, modernity, value and ultimate style.Full marks to the designer/s for encompassing so much in a single garment.Just the right blend of unique fabrics with original styles is amazing. it is a must visit place for all Divas who want to stand out in a crowd. (TELL ME ONE WHO DOESNT) Am an ignoramus about fabrics , but here there is only gentle guidance no aggressive Sales pitch breathing down you (As have experienced in some other like stores) which makes me want to flee. Also you dont feel guilty about shopping when you know part of it is going towards artisans welfare , struggling to keep alive dying arts.

If you have the slightest artistic inclination, its retail therapy and inspiration rolled into one. The products include handicrafts, quirky lifestyle products,accessories and so much more. And when you are done ogling at their wide range of products, the ladies in command - Mamta and/or Kashish - will be around for a sprightly conversation. Go to Buzzaria with atleast an hour on your hand. Enjoy the experience !"
