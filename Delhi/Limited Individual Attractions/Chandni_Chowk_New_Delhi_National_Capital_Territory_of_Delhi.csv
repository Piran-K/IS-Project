Chandni_Chowk,Apolonia70,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,"Spices, chai, perfumes, dates, nuts and Mr Spice","Whether you plan to buy anything or not - this spice market is a must just for the experience of the worlds largest spice market.  Much of it was via a rickshaw - mainly to get through the narrowest laneways and avoid physical contact with people and motor bikes. The rickshaw driver did an amazing job - very physical and hard work - really appreciated his efforts and tipped accordingly - grateful for his safe journey.  Unfortunately because the lanes are so packed with people traffic it was im[possible to stop to look at some of the interesting shops we passed - it was a  few days before Diwali so there were many colourful decorations - the clothing was amazing. We did stop - on a street with Jain history. The architectural style was lavish, colourful and photogenic. We visited one store that had some artifacts, jewellery, and another section where a person sold exquisite pashmina. Some of the jewellery was made by an 80 year old artisan.  We continued through the market by rickshaw stopping in wider road areas to look at the dates, dried fruit and nuts and of course spices.  One date seller had a variety of types of dates and had to buy some. A visit to My Kumar's spice store was the best experience. He took the time to guide me through the spices I was looking for - medicinal value as well as culinary.  Luckily, Herbies sources his spices here so we can replenish in Australia.  A Kumar is a master blender 6536 Khari Baoli - enjoy. I bought a lot of items here.  Had a chai sold by a street seller working under a shop counter - amazing. Also bought some perfume oil from a perfumery further along the road.  Rickshaw driver knew where to find one and took us there - another reason he was appreciated.  I watched people ordering custom blends of their perfume oils and was intrigued by what was available.   I wanted a simple single oil to sue as a perfume to deal with the sweat from the heat and humidity. The small bottle of lemongrass oil essence cost me only 40 rupees - bargain. A must visit location with so much to see.  Could have stayed longer but too hot for me.  Thank you Mr A Kumar from spice store (he does tea too) and guide Sanjeev from Trail Blazers Tours India."
Chandni_Chowk,VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Chandni Chowk is heart of Old Delhi- think & get that there,"Chandni Chowk is heart of Old Delhi. Full of hustle and bustle all across. The area is densely populated as well as has very dense commercial activities. The road from Lal Qila (Red Fort) to Fatehpuri Masjid is called Chandni Chowk. Recently the whole area is renovated with red stone. Vehicular traffic is closed for day time. Only hand rickshaws or E-rickshaws are plying on the road. Lot of greenery created on the centre of the road. Now people can walk on footpaths easily. Chandni Chowk is famous for local cuisine and snacks in restaurants or on road side or in small small shops along the road and streets. One can buy anything used in daily life from the market from regular to bridal clothing, jewellery, sweets, electricals, electronics, computers, shoes, all types of watches, cameras, cycles etc.;  anything will be there at competitive prices. One can go there any no. of times and will find something new there. One can go to Paranthe Wali Gali, Kinari Bazar, Nai Sadak, Ballimaran, Kucha Mahajani, Khari Baoli, Chawri Bazar, Cycle Market, Bhagirath Place, Lajpat Rai Market and many more markets at or adjacent there. Red Fort, Sis Ganj Gurudwara, Jain Temple, Fatehpuri Masjid can be visited there."
Chandni_Chowk,Akshay P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Great place with authentic street food delicacies,"A visit to Chandni Chowk is a must and its convenient location to the Red Fort makes it easy not to miss. Its a great idea to walk along the street - since cars are not allowed, its quite comfortable, but you do need to watch your pockets. Its best to walk all the way down to Fatehpur Masjid. Enough avenues for shopping at reasonable prices, but the greatest attraction are the eating joints - Tiwariji corner for chole bhature, jalebiwala, Natraj dahi bhalla, rabri bhandar in the paratha galli and other numerouse optionsFor kids, it is a good idea to book a cycle rickshaw and ask him to take a round of the entire street - great place to be in the evenings"
Chandni_Chowk,Wanderlust Family,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Friends,"Intoxicating magic, must be experienced.","I absolutely loved the all intoxicating chaos, rich history, culture, magic, colour & beauty that is the old lane ways of  Chandni Chowk. No visit to Delhi would be complete unless you spend a few days getting lost an exploring the vibrant old lanes and markets of Old Delhi. Go and experience the real India  and have a trip of a life time."

Chandni_Chowk,A_Dipali,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,A busy place in heart of Delhi.,"A busy place in heart of Delhi. The walkway is good. From 9 am to 9pm only vehicles allowed there are e riksha. So it is relatively less crowded and less polluted. There are shops on both sides of the walkway.  Red fort and parathewali galli are close by.We visited it on July, looks like not so good time to visit.  Winters will be better here. But then it will be so crowded. "
Chandni_Chowk,VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,"Tourist coming to Delhi, should spend some hours here","We visited Chandni Chowk several times in November 2021 to purchase bridal dresses. There are specialized specific markets called 'Galis' for most of the items you want to purchase. Both wholesale and retail business go together in a same Gali. Chandni Chowk is well connected with Delhi Metro. Car parking space are few and are always near full. One can not drive car here, as it is not allowed. Chandni Chowk after renovation is easy to walk and enjoy. Red stone is used on the roads which resemble stone used in Red Fort. You can use E-rickshaw to travel there. If we are in here, it is not possible to go back without the taste of Old Delhi. Every Gali or corner has shops, stalls and Khomchas selling local delicious foods. One should always try 3-4 types of items at separate shops. The taste will be there with you forever. Any tourist coming to Delhi, should spend some hours here. Several historical places are there nearby."

Chandni_Chowk,Srishti Verma,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020 • Couples,Nice but all Dug Up,"If you are thinking of visiting Chandani Chowk in 2020 or 2021 , my advise is , totally avoid it. India is pretty lame and slow when it comes to development projects. The whole place is dug up with hardly space to walk and lots of honking. It was quite an awful experience. It's a place full of history and trade even in current times but right now totally not worth it ."
Chandni_Chowk,JXXXR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Interesting Area,"Chandni Chowk is an interesting part of Delhi with a large amount of shops and food outlets. This area is very interesting for tourists, however it is an improverished area which may be off putting to some."

Chandni_Chowk,Meander With Mer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Absolute chaos but a must see...,"Our full day tour included a rickshaw ride through the narrow and chaotic streets of the Chandni Chowk, not sure how you get there by foot, but the ride and the experience were a lot of fun! There was a little bit ""traffic jam"" of rickshaws so it may be tourist trapy thing to do, but we really enjoyed it.  We saw so many different people, different shops and even the overhead wiring and cables were total chaos.  Again it may be a silly touristy thing to do but we had a great time!"
Chandni_Chowk,SAROJ8585,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,BUSY MARKET,Chandni chowk is located in New Delhi.It is near Red fort and Jama masjid.It is one of the busiest and most popular markets in North India .It was established by the daughter of mughal emperor Shahjahan.The shops of this market were built in half moon shape.At present Chandni chowk is famous for cloth and jwellery market.
Chandni_Chowk,Mo Sheik,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo,Great for bargain hunters,"I visited just before lunch and was able to buy several shawls and trinkets for family back home. The shopkeepers are always willing to negotiate on price but make sure to drive a hard bargain or you may get duped. Most are really friendly. Try to learn some basic hindi phrases which could prove useful when bargaining. Despite my tenous grasp of the language I was able to leave with some good bargains. Also tasted some great food. It's super croqded and busy. If you are a solo female traveller, go with a friend or some company. "

Chandni_Chowk,Tina H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,You have tomdomthis,"We experienced an amazing rikshaw ride on our recent visit to Delhi.  This is something you really must do.  Your driver will manoeuvre his rikshaw through tiny lanes crammed full of shops, people, motorbikes and so much more.  It’s an experience never to be forgotten.  So many items for sale in the many colourful alleys including jewellery, books, stationery, wedding flowers and gifts and so much more.  Go and immerse yourself.  "

Chandni_Chowk,R1chardN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,An amazing experience,"This is exactly what you expect of the hustle and bustle of an Indian Market.  It is incredibly busy and you should expect to be pushed and squeezed as you move through the crowd along the busy streets.  Do not be surprised to find a motor scooter coming at you on the side walks!!We were with a private guide and so were given a wide berth by those seeking to 'rip you off' but we still had the excitement, sights and smells of this amazing experience.  We visited the spice market, flower market and wandered through alley ways that always resulted in something special.  There are also the food vendors cooking over boiling fat on street corners.  This is an overwhelming cocktail and a treat for your senses!!We concluded our visit with a rickshaw ride through the crazy mayhem of the market streets.  This is a must do experience and one that will show you what 'real' India can be like until it is overtaken by modernisation.If you want to buy anything you do have to haggle."
Chandni_Chowk,Chris L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,Busy market,A busy place but you will be hassled buy people wanting to give you rickshaw rides or guides warning you how dangerous it is. Do not take their advice as they will rip you off and tack to shops where they get commission. Keep money close so no pick pockets have a chance. Also visit red fort over the road. 
Chandni_Chowk,Rish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Old world and the new,"If you go in there expecting glamorous old world heritage and charm, you might be disappointed, but if you go in with a list of specific things to do (Parathewali Gali, spice market, etc), you'll have a great time. You can visit the Red Fort and Jama Masjid the same day as well. Would not recommend going there during the summer or monsoon months, winter and spring are the best times as it will always be super crowded (don't expect air conditioning if you're planning to eat at Chandni Chowk)!"
Chandni_Chowk,Nick,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Heart of delhi,"A must visit place for shopping lovers, you get all kinda options for any occassion let it be diwali, eid or Christmas you have options here. Walking is bit a problem due to metro work rest all fine"
Chandni_Chowk,Russell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great Place to Visit - The True India,"My wife and I visited the Chandni Chowk as part of a Golden Triangle tour with the TripaDeal group in February. We were treated to a rickshaw ride through this area and it was very interesting.....the true India. Very busy and very lively and the lanes are very thin......some places were that thin the rickshaw could hardly get through.  Witnessing the stalls and vendors and the way the Indian people go about their every day life was great to experience. Well worth a visit, either by rickshaw or walking."
Chandni_Chowk,davudsons,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Rickshaw Ride,Very interesting and lively area. Lots of shops and interesting things to see in Old Delhi. Jewellers and Sari Shops abound. Very colourful.
Chandni_Chowk,Amit_and_Alex,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Another visit to Chandni Chowk,"My preferred place in Delhi, Chandni Chowk, offers a glimpse of yesterday’s India that lives side by side with modern India. In its tiny and crowded alleyways, it offers delicious sweets and snacks, colorful clothing, religious items, textbooks, hardware supplies, … Chandni Chowk is at the same time a mess and a delight. In Chandni Chowk, one does not find fusion or contemporary takes on food. It is hard core traditional. We did not find Raj Kumar, but found another hawker selling Daulat ki chaat. The sweet has a delicate flavor.  It is interesting, but not mouthwatering We found Giani di Hatti and loved its rabri and urad dal halwa.  We found the Tewari Brothers and loved its motichoor laddu. We found the Old Famous Jalebiwala. The Jalebiwala’s pea samosa was great, but its jalebi was disappointing. It was very thick and not very crispy.  We found Kanwarji and got their spicy dal-biji, peas somosa and potato chips. All these snacks were tasty but a little too spicy. We found Haryana Paneer Bhandar and had the best milk cake I ever tried.We found Natraj Dahi Balla Corner aka Natraj Chaat House and ate their Aloo Chat and Aloo Tikki.We went back to Hazari Lal Jain to have their delicious khurchan"
Chandni_Chowk,Libby in Cincinnati,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Fascinating!,"This was a fascinating tour.  We took a rickshaw ride through all the alleys and side streets.  The electric wires hanging all over were shocking as to how they don't start a fire.  There were some expensive beautiful stores selling lovely things next to tiny street vendors and stalls. There were people bathing in the streets, sleeping and working.  It was a real slice of everyday life in India."

The streets are very narrow, it’s extremely busy and hard to navigate around.My best advice is if you’re going to this area to definitely go with a tour company because venturing out by yourself is overwhelming. Our rickshaw driver was friendly and thankfully helped us get around. "

Aslam ka butter chicken..something different you might not have eaten so far...  I leave the rest to your imagination and to explore the internet for what all is available here for each one of you..Hit the internet and hit jama masjid area to taste the best Old delhi has to offer..Cheers !"

The sights, smells, sounds, colours and the friendliness of the people are unforgettable.  The vibrancy of the colourful spices and the aromas were truly fantastic. We visited a few spice and tea stores and just had to bring some back with us. We did this market on a rickshaw which in itself, is sn experience but a great way of seeing everything there is to see. Lots of monkeys around, cows - of course but the hustle and bustle of daily life and the chatter is something else. Don’t hesitate yo get yourself down to Chandni Chowk. You will remember it forever!

There is metro work going on and hence too crowded. You will probably need a day, to explore the streets of this place. I am sure with good walking shoes you . It boasts great food, especially Parantha wala galli, do try the chole kulcha, samosa and chai. Then head for shopping at Nai Sarak for Sarees, Ghaghras, sherwanis. My Mom went berserk shopping sarees. There is Dariba Kalan for bangles and artificial jewelry. You can also visit the Kinari bazar, for some handwork and sari work materials. The streets are too cramped and dirty. However, there are autos that you to the streets, you want to visit. There is also Metro from Rajiv Chowk and other places."

Not everyone's cuppa tea and I'd advise cutting your teeth on less chaotic places if you're new to the souk scene.  Don't worry about getting lost because you probably will. Just embrace the place"

Chandni_Chowk,gemlovestotravel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,"Chaotic, fascinating and surprisingly easy to navigate","I have always avoided Chandni Chowk after my first experience in an evening.Braved it this trip and so glad I did. Originally I was looking to do a walking tour as I thought this would make it an easier and more enjoyable experience but the ones I saw on the internet were, I thought really expensive. I also considered getting a tuk tuk round but once I’d crossed the road from the fort I felt braver and decided to just go for it. So glad I did because it was fascinating just to wander round. It is chaotic, there’s tons of people but there is so much life to see!I would not recommend this to be the first thing you do when you are in Delhi as I feel you need to acclimatise first- it’s a bit much for a first experience.Give it a go, have a wander round and don’t miss the spice market."

You can wander off yourself but you will get more out of the visit if you take a guide who will take you to the better places rather than just go round in circles and getting very fed up quickly with the crowd and the noise.The streets are crowded with people and animals. You will come across countless stray dogs who seem to be everywhere. There are cows wandering about, people pushing pushcarts, food stalls selling all sorts of things. The smell can be very enticing. Traffic jams like you have never seen before and everyone hooting and tooting like there is no tomorrow. Then there are the shops with colourful clothes and everyone trying to grab hold of you to take you to bargains. You need to have your wits about you and not get taken by a friendly chap – remember he is out to look after himself not you.Oh do look up and see the maze of electrical wires.If you are buying do bargain or you will get ripped off. They can spot a jug from miles. No one is there to do you favours."
Chandni_Chowk,bhindbikinis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,You Have Too,"This is a must do experience!  Just perfect chaos in the heart of Delhi.  Spice market sends your nose into overload, smell, sneeze & cough but the experience is great. you are really amongst it here.  Shopping galore for everything, thats if you remember to shop!  The cows are the best part, just roaming long in the street, brilliant!  We did it alone but maybe try with a guide to get to see it all if you can as it is a maze."
Chandni_Chowk,She_Traveller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A shopper & a foodie's delight but an Agrophobiac's nightmare !,"So if you are a foodie , esp. ethnic/desi  North Indian /Mughlai food and do not have Agoraphobia and are ready to rub shoulders with anyone and every one , the place is for you , for sure . You get amazing variety of clothes , toys , books , stationery , spices , dry fruits and even rare stuff like Camera lenses here at relatively cheaper prices . In nutshell , shopping could be really worth it here if you have to buy in bulk . Is a good place for pre wedding  shopping . Remember to leave the car out side , somewhere near Red fort and either walk down or take the e Rickshaw . Explore lanes and by lanes , some of which carry remnants of past with relics of old havelis and temples etc.  "
Chandni_Chowk,globalnex,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Once in a lifetime experience ,When you visit this market you would be surprised with the volume of goods that pass through the market.  There are areas with sub special products and the stores are just packed with the goods. Currently to add to the caos the government has dug up the central road and there is barely any room to walk. You have to be careful for people pushing you and of course the pick pockets. Take a tour on a cycle rickshaw and you will enjoy the ride. Traffic jams with people. Simply amazing!!!
Chandni_Chowk,Kuntal B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,It is a traders paradise!,"Loved the view of Red Fort, Sheesh gunj gurdwara and old historical havelis around the Chandni Chowk main bazaar area and tasted some delightful and novel dishes like kulle ki chaat,daulat ki chaat, nihari and other meat dishes of old Delhi. Some families still source their monthly spices from the old suppliers here. Fantastic outlets for getting your wedding trouseau shopping completed can be found around Kinari bazaar that suit your budget and desire for designer pieces, as well as one can buy unique silver jewelry and corporate gifts from an abundance of traders. However it is also a very congested area, which is heavily crowded, so much that only a single person can walk sideways in the narrow lanes - so hard to get in your vehicle there. You need to know which shops to go to else, a lot of time will get wasted browsing and bargaining. It is well serviced by erickshaws, metro stations and hand pulled rickshaws. I enjoyed doing a walking food tour there in October 2019 with a local guide, who also shared historical information about local buildings."
Chandni_Chowk,mconnoisseur,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Business,Shopping,You can visit there to buy anything at the most reasonable price . Don't forget to bargain and do beware of thief . 
Chandni_Chowk,Fred V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Kaleidoscope,"Went here twice. I enjoy hustle and bustle and tight crowded narrow streets , so this was right up my alley ( inadvertent pun ).I was with a guide so I did not get lost but it would be easy to get lost here if your not familiar with the area. Lots of touts here which should be no surprise , but I never felt concerned for my safety although I was cautioned to mind my valuables. I thought it was an exciting place and a kaleidoscope of activity."

Chandni_Chowk,Erika C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,A Five Senses Experience ,"First off, let me start by recommending you explore Chandni Chowk with a knowledgeable guide. This was my second visit and included a “food tour” and a separate “shopping tour.” Both were amazing experiences with visits to the best street food stands and shops. Our food tour was led by a “Tours By Locals” guide who introduced us to stalls that were safe to eat at. Delicious!! The shopping tour was also led by a “Tours By Locals” guide. He led us to shops that sold items we were particularly interested in, such as textiles, jewelry, and essential oils (Attars). It was fantastic!! Be aware that Chandni Chowk is not for everyone. It’s crowded and hectic. But with the right guide, it can be a wonderful way to experience India. "
Chandni_Chowk,Prakash,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Old Delhi Charm,"Much have been written, but to really soak in all that this place has to give, be prepared to travel on foot and at a slow pace. It will take a day or two to really hit all the right spots. Great food and a good shopping area. Be prepared to bargain, I would start by quoting back half the price the vendors come up with :-). Do try the parathas, Jalebis and other street foods. A little hard on the stomach though, so be prepared."
Chandni_Chowk,Abhitheexplorer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Buzzing,"The place is busy and buzzing. Point to remember, never go there without a guide, someone who's been there. There are chances you may get lost. You can't take ten steps without bumping into someone and / or something. But the place offers you some of the best food items, specially Paraanthewali gali and Kachori. Also recommended for wholesale shopping of Indian traditional dresses, jewellery and also dry fruits and spices."
Chandni_Chowk,Rishi Tayal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Business,Foodies can definitely go here n enjoy,There are a huge variety of food items present here Here you can search each and every thing you want Here everything is Pocket friendly ❣Best place for foodiee ❤
Chandni_Chowk,Payal G,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Crazy crowd,"One of the most famous markets of India located in the heart of old Delhi, this place hardly retains any of the charm that it was historically supposed to possess. While it may be romantic for foreigners to get a glimpse of the crowd and chaos of India, the truth is that it is super congested and crumbling with roadworks adding to the confusion. The crowd may be too suffocating in the narrow lanes with drooping overhead wires and no clear exit ways in case of emergencies. Even the by-lanes close to the metro stations are poorly lit. It is next to impossible to enjoy anything with knowledgeable local guides are most of the people working in the area are clueless about the historical places in the area. Best visited during the daytime for the many historic buildings that are located in the area like Ghalib's haveli, the town hall etc. The closest Metro train station is Chandni Chowk on the Yellow Line and Lal Quila on the Heritage Line."

Chandni_Chowk,Naresh1936,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Heart of Old Delhi,"Chandni Chowk was the hub of Delhi in Mughal period and for long time during British Raj, till New Delhi was built. Even today, it continues to be the centre of activity and attractions for old traditional shopping, and traditional Indian food, sweets, snacks, street food and the like. Ideal for roaming around for a taste of true India."
Chandni_Chowk,Raj S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,Great unique shopping experience,"Great unique shopping experience at this oldest market of old Delhi. You will literally get everything you are looking for, at wholesale as well as retail rates."
Chandni_Chowk,John,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Best cloth shopping destination,Chandni chowk a well known place for shopping and dining too...Cheaper cloth u can buy here... But beware of third party person... They can take you to wrong shop where they can earn commission... So its better to go on your own
Chandni_Chowk,macedonboy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Too busy for me,"Chandni Chowk is a major shopping hub of Old Delhi that's a conglomeration of local markets and shopping streets. Most of the things on sale are aimed at locals, but I found it a useful place to get local food and a few clothing items to deal with the winter weather. It's a nice place to wander around for a feel off Old Delhi. Generally I found the place ridiculously busy and too much of a madhouse to stay for long or even visit more than once. Add an extra star if shopping is your thing."
Chandni_Chowk,ghoomboom,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Visit this to get a feel of Old Delhi,"Very crowded and chaotic place indeed. The renovation work is going on and hopefully it will be better. This place gives you a true feel of old Delhi. Ideal place for shopping of fancy bridal wear, local perfumes(itra), clothings etc. The famous Paranthe Wali Gali is here only and Bhagirath Place here is one of the biggest electrical markets of Asia. You can get wide variety of electrical lights/chandeliers/LED lights etc in bulk quantities.The Chandni Chowk starts from Lal Quila Metro and extends upto Fatehpuri Masjid. Near Fatahpuri Masjid, there are shops selling dry fruits in bulk quantities. Many food shops along the market selling local cuisines like Chaat, Samosa, Kachauri etc. Rabri Falooda is worth a try. So, Chandni Chowk is crowded, chaotic yet enchanting."
Chandni_Chowk,Ravi Singh Delhi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,For old City charm and traditional Indian street food,"Though things are a bit more chaotic than usual these days because of large scale renovation work, but any semblance of order is the last thing that any visitor should expect from Chandni Chowk. It's Orient at it's best in all its Glory and madness. A visit to Sheesh Ganj gurudwara is an additional attraction not to be missed. Best is to combine red fort visit with Chandni chowk so that you don't suffer chaos and the crowds twice in such a quick succession."
Chandni_Chowk,Sunil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Busyest place ,"The place too huge and crowded. You can find many more outlets and you get whatever the item you required.kindly ensure if any one visit  this place, keep your wallets safe."
