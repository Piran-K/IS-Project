Chhatarpur_Temple,gentbrugg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Without sinking heart,"Before, when I began to travel to India (about 12 years ago) I had to get to Qutab Minar and Chatarpur pretty long and expensively. Now, when I wanted to refresh my memory of old experiences, the trip became much more comfortable. Now to that area was  conducted the metro and to get to these places, you need only a little bit more than half an hour. Still approaching to the station, you will see the temple complex  - the station is overground and elevated.I wondered at my sense. And I caught myself thinking that I felt no particular aesthetic attention to  Chatarpur mandir. I had seen in India so many different things that the temple complex, which I watched earlier with a sinking heart, this time seemed to me only too massive and overwhelming. Too neat and newly built. A failed replica of some original masterpiece. And even stone carving, to which I usually pay attention, this time haven't impressed me. These same feelings I felt when the second time came to Hampi. And after  Ibrahim Rausa mausoleum in Bijapur, after Pattadakal complex, after Badami, Aihole, Mahakuta and Banashankari only Vittala temple and Lotus Mahal  caused some stir in my soul. But not the rest."

The main temple is dedicated to goddess Durga. What Modern Hindu temples have lost in style and grandeur, they have attempted to recreate through ostentation- the Chhatarpur temples, like other modern Hindu temples are massive structures with copius use of white marble."

Chhatarpur_Temple,Dr Amit Rahul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Knocking Gods Door,"The temple is grand in architecture and size. The temple premises is quite clean and above all here the priests do not follow you wherever you go. The temple has its own free parking and it is also very near to the Chhatarpur metro station. A place worth visiting for the religiously inclined people of all age groups. However, students of architecture and religion could also get to learn a lot from their visit to the temple. The huge Lord Hanuman's Idol is a big draw. Visit the place to seek his blessings."
