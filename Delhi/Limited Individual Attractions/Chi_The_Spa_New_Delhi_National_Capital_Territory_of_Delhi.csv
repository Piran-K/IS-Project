I chose Chi due to proximity, as I’m staying at the Shangrl-la hotel which is where they are situated. Luckily for me I chose well. My facial and massage where amongst the best I’ve ever had anywhere.  And I’ve had quiet a few. Both at home in Australia and various other countries in North America and Asia Masseuse Tina surely has magic fingers.  I would highly recommend.  And facial was top quality. Beautiful surroundings and world class treatments. All staff very kind and very friendly."

,,,,,"Few days back I went to reside at Shangri-La Eros New Delhi for some conference in Delhi itself. Everything was perfect rooms, hygiene and other stuffs but the other services they have in there pocket are so pleasing like the Chi Spa, I'm in love with the name and more than that it was so relieving for me, I had a great time after the finishing all my conference work nearby. Then I was fortunate enough to meet Bharti who's the receptionist there, very dept and calm. She gave me every bit of the detail they could offer including salon and pool service which I later was fortunate enough to try and I loved it. Thanks to her. And this won't be my best stay if i couldn't address Mr. Chandan Singh Bisht, the manager who came as my saviour. I had some issues and he was there so composed and he really got me resolved with all my issues. So glad to every other staff member too who made my stay memorable and worth every penny. Thanks a lot Shangri-La... See you soon, you have all my respect and love. ❤"

,,,,,"Really excited to share my experience with gym and pool facilities that I enjoyed at Shangri-La Eros in New Delhi. As a gymer my utmost priorities were availability of efficient machines, dumbbell etc. for each and every exercise, hygiene, clean washrooms and changing rooms and I was really impressed with each of them. The staff there especially Sahil and Manoj were really friendly and were always available to help. I was really not that much into fitness but the ambience that Shangri-La provide is quite commendable and get me going. With the rising temperature in the capital I went to the pool area of Shangri-La, and that experience too was remarkable. I really liked the hygiene and cleanliness in the pool it was 10/10; really enjoyed every minute I spent there. Hats off to Vishal, who look after mundane things near pool area. So, believe me if you want a smooth and pleasing place for gym and pool area Shangri-La is what you are looking for, it really worked well for me. Also, I won't hold back to mention their Chi Spa facility which is best in the town I must say, really recommend everyone to give it a shot."

This time I went for their salon service with my sister and I must say the experience was spellbound. I wanted a buzz cut and my sister desired for facial and manicure. The professionalism they displayed with proper hygiene and servicing was really impressive. I was really satisfied with the end results I got, it was way more aesthetic than I desired for. My sister too was really happy with the products and the results she got. She especially mentioned a lady named Anju, she really admired her work. All in all the experience was as gratifying as could be, worth every penny I spent, really looking forward for some more service that Shangri-La has in there pocket.
