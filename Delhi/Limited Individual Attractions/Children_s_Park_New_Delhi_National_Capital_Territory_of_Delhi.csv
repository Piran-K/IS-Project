Children_s_Park,Suchig06,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Old is good,"One of the best childhood memories with all cousins and elders were created here. Simple park, safe and clean, ample swings and very good walk ways. A water pool stretching within the park used to have water and a dummy crocodile (till 1995). The aquarium zone has been fun and that can be made better - add a voice feature to learn about stored fishes. May be put some mechanical puppets, clowns, traditional (life-size) dolls, folks etc. People can pose with them and take photos. Appu Ghar used to have a clown which used to laugh and move after we dropped in a coin. something like this!I hope the authorities never make it a contemporary westernized unsafe park in the name of modernization.The park is walking distance from India Gate and has easy access. Old park culture symbolizes the purest love and affection we had as kids towards fellow kids and animals in the parks around us."
Children_s_Park,reemkeshvik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Not fair for grand parents with little Grand children due to parking place too far.,"Children enjoy swings & rides. Not enough swings as earlier there were.. Not maintained well.Main problem is parking place. It's too far from the park . Little children can't walk such long distance even elderly people  , they can't take their grand children easily .There is a column "" who was with you?""There is no column of little children.We were with our 05 years old grandson."
Children_s_Park,Madhulika L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Pleasant outdoor play area,"The Children’s Park next to India Gate is approached through the India Gate main entrance. You walk past India Gate, and off to the right, is Gate #2 of the Children’s Park. This is a pretty large park, full of trees, flowerbeds, even topiary—bushes shaped into elephants, rabbits, and other creatures. There are several spaces with outdoor play structures, from slides and swings to see-saws and monkey bars. Some spaces are specially designed for younger children (with smaller slides, shorter ladders, and so on) and some for older children. There are also a couple of different outdoor gymming areas attached to these, so if you’re keen on exercising while your child plays, you could keep an eye on your child in the play area beside you while you work out on the gym equipment. Besides the play areas, there are some other child-friendly spaces, or other spaces that are educational/entertaining/of practical use. There’s a small herbal garden (with quite a lot of herbs growing, though since this was fenced off, my six-year old and I couldn’t explore it properly). Beyond it is an amphitheatre, which I suppose could be used if performances for a child audience were to be staged. On the other side of the amphitheatre’s back wall is a small aquarium, very shabby and not at all worth seeing. In front of the aquarium is a large and poorly made plaster representation of a scene from The Jungle Book animation movie. This is supposed to be a ‘Jungle Fountain Plaza’, but was completely dry when we visited. One place which looked very promising was the Children’s Library. It’s open only to children between 6 and 14 years of age; parents are not allowed to enter. From the peek I could get through the open door, this seemed like a good place for a reader to hang out (and my daughter was very eager to go in). However, since we were short of time, we had to skip it. A pleasant place to go, especially if you have a small child who’s happy with a play area and doesn’t expect anything very sophisticated. No entry fee is charged. All children below 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult."
Children_s_Park,ArtiSingh_Travel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Lots of swing and no Entry Fee,"If you stay in Delhi NCR and have kids of the swingable age than you must visit this place. Opens at 9:30 in the morning and has no entry fee , loads of swing to spend some good time with little ones, further there is a library too here to ignite the curious mind. They have a musical fountain which was not operational while we visited and the place is next to India gate only. Open gym for parents while kids have fun at the swings "

Children_s_Park,Amolak Rattan K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Very nice place for children to enjoy,"Very close to India Gate, this park is well developed for enjoyment of children. Elders can relax in the neighbourhood and taste an ice cream or a cold drink. This place is very crowded on weekends and holidays as if whole of Delhi and all tourists have come.Amolak Rattan Kohli Former Governor of Mizoram"

Children_s_Park,Vivek C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Enjoyable for Children But Otherwise a Mess,"Located right next to India Gate -- a quick 5-10 minutes walk -- the Children's Park has a large number of swings and slides. The moment you step in the park, the first thing you realize is how crowded it is. Children everywhere, shouting and screaming in joy, with their parents running after them.That is where, however, the good part ends. The place is unkempt and full of dust. There were trees around but hardly any grass in the play area. With thousands of children running helter skelter, from one slide to another, the dust was all pervasive, to the extent of  feeling the dust inside you.Almost all the slides were taken over by teenagers, with younger children forced to share the slides and swings with them. Even some of the middle-aged women didn't mind a slide or two. It's nothing really wrong, but then when you are there at the end of tunnel slide trying to catch your 5-year old, and instead see an 80-kg women emerge from the tunnel slide, it's discomforting. There should be at least some rides, which should exclusively be for children below a certain age.All the rides were perennially overcrowded. Some slides had long rows of children waiting for their turn on slides. In spite of that hassle, the children seemed to enjoy, but I wished these tiny tots get a much better experience. The landing for most of the slides were piles of dust. All the children were ending up covered in dust except for those whose parents managed to catch them just in time.Last but not the least, the place is not well maintained. I didn't see any garbage around, but the place certainly had a shoddy look.They don't charge any money, but may be they should. And use that money to maintain the park.All in all, I would say it's an enjoyable experience for children but a poor one for parents.All in all"
Children_s_Park,Tarun W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Good old times.. ,"An incidental visit to Childrens Park this morning brought back lots of childhood memories. Of course one hadn't visited for ages and needless to say the park has undergone sea of changes with modern and newer facilities, but somehow it still has that old feeling of a park. There are swings and rides for children and place for families to sit around too. It's a nice place to visit if one is in the vicinity and even as a tourist attraction. "
Children_s_Park,Kaushik G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Not a tourist attraction,"During my vacation in Delhi, I had visited the India Gate and this big park is located beside the monument. This is just like any other public park where people can sit and laze around while children take full advantage of the different play items like swings, slides, seasaws, climbing frames, rockers etc and enjoy their time. Entrance to this park is free. This place is not really a tourist attraction and can be visited only if you are at India Gate and want to kill some spare time."
Children_s_Park,IzaRos,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Overrated playground with to many adults,"Overrated playground with to many adults using the toys and the swings. Almost all the swings were occupied by adults and the place is filled with teens that score the small kids. And oh, if you are white - be prepared to be asked to be in a lot of photos!"
Children_s_Park,Sadhan M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,Children’s Park,"Your Delhi visit may not be deemed complete if you have not visited Children’s Park and spent some time there and relaxed your body and mind. It is rather difficult to imagine that in a very busy intersection of Delhi’s traffic near India Gate there can be a quiet corner as this.Located opposite Bikaner House from where long distance buses to Rajasthan start and adjacent to the Pandara Park and Pandara Road as well as air force colony where central government officers live, Children’s Park is ideally located for the children of these areas to come by and play there.There are a number of attractions for children in the park; notable among them being swings, slides, Seasaws, kids Playware, Climbing Frames, Rockers, Wheels, wide space to play foot ball, etc. There is a very attractive fountain to sit by and simply while away your time.Not that the park is meant only for the children. Many elderly persons also come there and spend some idle time. The Park is closed on Mondays. Entry is free.I found this place exciting for children and a quite place for the older people. Chindren’s Park has well maintained lawns and in the night when the Park is closed, there are hawkers selling toys, snacks and ice cream. There is beautiful illuminations also to see and enjoy."

Children_s_Park,Ravi Kumar R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017,Fun place to go out with kids on weekends,I born & brought up in Delhi and I used to visit here with my parents and sometimes with school mates. This place is good for kids and travelers who visit Delhi for the first time. Only problem is the littering. People come and enjoy but leave a lot of garbage behind them. They should follow the thumb rule of cleanness which is to put the garbage in bins. 
Children_s_Park,Neelam K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,nice place for chidren,It's pretty good and has decent variety of swings. It is mostly a picnic spot for school children and when there are too many of them then there is also increase in air dust. You better go on a quiet day.
