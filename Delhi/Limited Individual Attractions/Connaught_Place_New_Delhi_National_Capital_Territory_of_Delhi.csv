Connaught_Place,Jonathan,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Solo,Beautiful place with many people harassing you with every step you take.,"I loved the architecture of the place but that’s all. There need to be police to stop all the people who harass you as you shop and walk around . I came to see the buildings and I was constantly being harassed by people asking me “Sir, how are you doing, let me show you this”. They would follow you for about 100-200m.  I was stopped, harassed and followed by more than 10 people in an hour!  As a foreigner, you just want to shop in peace and marvel at the architecture but here is not the case."
Connaught_Place,Surya Katakam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,One of the Best Shopping area in Delhi,"Located right in the heart of the New Delhi, Connaught place is a busting hive of activity. Before the bazaars, stalls and dining establishments sprouted around Connaught place, the area was all about Cinemas. In the 1920's it wasn't Bollywood and Hollywood shows that has the spotlight. It was built under British rule between 1929 and 1933. Robert Tor Russell designed this British Commercial center in collaboration with W H Nicholls. It is Circular and known as the largest commercial hub of its king in India.It was named after Prince Arthur, 1st Duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria and uncle of King George VI of England, who visited India in 1921.The area in and around Connaught place is a shopper's Paradise. The Market is divided into two circles. Inner circle and outer circle. The inner circle comprises of Blocks A to F. All Major brands outlets are available in Inner Circle. The outer Circle of Connaught place consist of Block G to P having all big Show rooms."
Connaught_Place,Andrew,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Awesome!,Lovely restaurant and very clean! Both had mutton biryani and it was so delicious! Friendly staff and food was served fairly quickly. Will definitely return!
Connaught_Place,podrozniczka60,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,"Crowded, interesting, not many tourist.","The place is an example of  beautiful Georgian style architecture. Around the Central Park semicircular buildings form a busy shopping and dining hub, The sections are marked with the letters of alphabet. Many interesting stores and restaurants. We ate at Diggin. Be prepared to assume defensive and unfriendly body language to survive the stroll. Otherwise  constant harassment and aggressive beggars completely change the experience."
Connaught_Place,Tony,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Business,Continuously followed,"Stayed here for a week for work to go to a trade show nearby, not my first time in India. I could not leave the hotel to go for a walk at all. Shops and restaurants all over but every time I walked out of the hotel I couldn’t even go half a block without getting followed by someone trying to convince me to go to a government shopping center where I would pay no tax or try to get a free map. People would start off friendly but ultimately try to get you into a rickshaw. I walked the full inner circle and was hassled constantly by at least 5 separate people, as soon as you shake one the next comes over. It was a real bummer I couldn’t do any shopping or try any of the restaurants in the area, had to go elsewhere for that or just get room service if I was lazy."
Connaught_Place,J W,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,"Some nice places, but constant harassment","Some nice restaurants and shops, but was continually harassed by persistent vendors from a local market trying to get me to go there."
Connaught_Place,sudosandwich,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Great shops but dangerous,"Location wise -- tons of great restaurants and shops for you to browse and shop. The only reason why this is 2 star is because you do not want to come here alone.Even as a male, you will get approached by multiple individuals trying to scam you, even trying to force you into a rickshaw at some point.Unfortunately, I did not feel safe even once when I was at Connaught Place. I rushed what I needed to get and got out of there."
Connaught_Place,jsthouston,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,Busy and pricey ,Not what it was years ago and very busy with more tha the usual traffic .   Can't say I would go back as far more interesting shopping and dinner spots exist nearby.
Connaught_Place,Renato D,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Solo,"Be CAREFUL WITH SOMEONE ASKING WHERE ARE YOU FROM? I Dont NEED NOTHING ONLY TALK, STUDY ENGLISH or SOMETHING LIKE THAT","Cuidado com sua visita, cuidado com sua visita ao ser abordado por estranhos perguntando de onde você vem? Qual seu pais, não de confiança, são pessoas tentando te levar para algum lugar para que você compre algo não acredite que é para estudar inglês que não querem nada, que são estudantes, são comissionados, não há policiamento no local, TAKE CARE ABOUT PEOPLE THAT START ASK FOR YOU WHERE ARE YOU FROM, THEY TRY TO  to take you somewhere, I think to shop or be commissioned, but it could be some scam too, there is no police on site so avoid answering question or asking for help only say I dont need buy anything!!! Be rude !!!"
Connaught_Place,FreddieFvE,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,"Can't blame the location, but don't do it alone","We decided to explore and do it with just a transfer to the area. Expect to be accosted by attempted scammers - be careful, as they hand you off from one to the other.. check how they use their phones. Couldn't find any place to really shop where we felt safe. Wouldn't do without a guide."
Connaught_Place,Anand K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Tourist & Foreigners - Avoid this Place at any cost. Very Dangerous City so called Capital City of India,"Dangerous place for non locals, tourists, families and mostly - foreigners like us. During our last visit to India, we been to this place and some group seeing us, approached us recommending some shops in other direction. We avoided them knowing that they will cheat. However the guy keep following us saying - "" We don't want your money. We will just help to show you some nice shopping area."" We rejected they help and started working to different section of the building. At one point to avoid them, we entered Subway in Block""A"" . Shockingly the guy followed us and started ordering sandwich as a regular person. After a phone call, other guy joined him they eye contacted each other to follow us.After we done with the sandwich, we walked out while the new guy followed. My wife altered me on him following us and at certain point we stopped and confront and cornered him and started interrogating him on why he is following us. He is in shocked as he never though a tourist will confront and corner him. He was shaking while answering us and said that he was just doing is job. However we warned him and moved away from the place as we know that we wont have our stands there as we are just tourist and no police are there in the place to support.All shop vendors started starring at the situation and we explained what happened. To their surprise, they explained that it a big gang where they follow and cheat tourist.I wasn't worried about the money, but i was worried about my wife and daughter. After walking couple of blocks. I have seen a digital signage where all missing children pictures are displayed rolling and showing one by one on missing children.They i though that they could them and i need to be very careful. That place is rotten with local gangs and local goons. I felt that many people are involved in scamming and cheating tourist people as they all talk the same language. Even the Tuk Tuk driver and foot path vendors.My advise to all the tourist and foreigners not to travel to this place as you have better and safe shopping centers in Delhi. Even though you travel, don't approach any foot path vendors, tuk-tuk drivers and any dirty looking local trying to speak good english. ** Hold your children tight to yourself and don't leave they hand at any case.***** They may just drive and can kidnap your kid **** After seeing the traffic situation and talking to some Ola driver, they mentioned that Delhi police are rotten with corruption and they will close their eye to anyone who pays money***From this experience i analyzed  that even Delhi Police are part of the daily Cheating, Scams and Kidnaps the city is going through.** Its such a shame that i couldn't feel secured in Capital City of India **** For sure i think twice to visit this place again**"
Connaught_Place,Sarah,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,Very touristy,A cool little square to spend some time but definitely a tourist trap. If you're a foreigner expect to be approached and asked for money a lot. There are some neat restaurants but they are over-priced when you can get just as good food elsewhere in Delhi for a quarter of the cost. 
Connaught_Place,Ron,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Business,If alone avoid at all costs,Went there to do some shopping on Sunday. As soon as I got there a taunt approached me saying I should not be here and wanted to take me to Indian bazaar run by government (?). I dived into nearby store to get rid of him. Had to deal with three more taunts before I finally gave up and took uber to the hotel. Even when I was waiting for Uber they would not give up trying to convince me I should take Tuk Tuk.
Connaught_Place,Vinder,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Couples,Absolutely Happy Experience ,"First time staying with Connaught Delhi, had a very happy experience.

Connaught_Place,AirborneSpoon,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Solo,Outdoor Mall with Beggers.,This is basically an outdoor mall but with beggers and shoe cleaners who pester until you either let them clean your shoes or almost yell at them.  The only thing that might be redeemable with this area is the central park which is directly in the center of Connaught Place. Skip it.

Connaught_Place,deepti,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,"Heritage, shopping and gourmet.","Well, CP is iconic for its perfect blend of colonial legacy in terms of its architecture and its modern day constituents in terms of stores, restaurants and people. Due to its central location, and the heritage value, it is among the world's top 10 most expensive rental places. It is divided into different blocks- A,B,C and so on, with Cafe Coffee Day in each block. There are three circles- inner circle and outer circle ( mostly retail and food outlets, some hotels too), and the middle circle (mainly commercial and financial offices). The closest metro station is Rajiv Chowk. One of my favorite places here are Wenger's (one of the oldest patisserie here), United Coffee House, Social, Starbucks (unique in its style and rustic decor) and Haldiram's. For shopping, Heels and Balujas are the oldest and occasionally, you might get something nice here.  At night, it turns into a party hub, with places like Hot Mess and Lords of the Drinks hosting Dj nights."
Connaught_Place,Sherry G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,this place is jumping with people outside,make sure you take in the large Indian Flag flying in the center of the Connaught Place. People are literally everywhere unless you are on lockdown.

Connaught_Place,travelfotofanatic,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Lively, bustling place","To me as a tourist this is the lively, bustling heart of Delhi, It has almost everying to offer in various store, plus many different restaurants. It appears to be relatively clean compared to other parts of the city that we drove through. Generally, prices seem a little higher than elsewhere, but I suppose that reflects their clientelle of more affluent locals, plus the tourists. Yes, it might be cheaper elsewhere, but I think this area is safer and it'll do me. Worth visiting for a memorable Indian experience."
Connaught_Place,PBlyth,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Central Shopping Area in New Delhi,One of the better centrally located shopping areas in New Delhi.

Connaught_Place,Brun066,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Landmark worthy of a federal capital,"I visited Delhi at the end of my trip to Northern India. This trip for a Westerner is unsettling, because - apart from the precincts of the most famous monuments, and some rare examples such as the ""pink city"" of Jaipur - almost nothing in India urban centers reminds the traveler of the decorum that is considered normal for a modern city (obviously, according to many travelers, this is precisely the charm of India).Connaught Place is undoubtedly an exception. Here the strength of British imperial planning has impressed its signs of rationality and at the same time gracefulness not to a building or to a group of buildings, but to an entire neighborhood. The eighteenth-century Crescent in Bath is mentioned as a source of inspiration for the architect Edwin Lutyens, as it's equally curvilinear and imposing. But apart from the fact that the ​​Connaught Place planned area is much more extensive, the residential (and non-commercial) nature of the Crescent greatly attenuates the reasons for similarity with this Delhi area (which is instead extremely lively by its retail facilities). Rather, this area reminded me - for its aim to organize a large space following geometric criteria, which recall the idea of ​​perfection through the central plan - the ""Portrait of an ideal city"" (1480?) by the Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello , now in the ""Galleria nazionale delle Marche"" in Urbino (Italy).Walking through the streets, the central square and under the arcades of Connaught Place reminded me of a definition of the political philosopher Giovanni Botero, who at the beginning of his treatise ""On the Causes of the Greatness and Magnificence of Cities"" (1588; first English translation 1606) writes: “Città s'addimanda una ragunanza d'uomini ridotti insieme per vivere felicemente”  (City is defined as a meeting of men gathered together to live happily).Well, it seems to me that Connaught Place has been extremely oriented by the ""pursuit of Happiness"" (Jefferson, 1776), within the limits in which it can be obtained in a town planning solution.A landmark worthy of a federal capital, Connaught Place remains among the most enduring memories of my recent trip to India."
Connaught_Place,vasudevamunish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Childhood memories,Taking a walk in the inner circle of Connaught Place is like going back to childhood and remembering those walks with parents and enjoying a softy ice-cream or a bottle of cold milk . Nostalgic memories of the colonial place
Connaught_Place,ward27342,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Just a wander,I wasn't after anything in particular but could find everything I needed here from clothes to Gifts with ample refreshment options. Additionally as opposed to some ares it wasnt as 'in your face' there was a lot more left to browse without the hard sell 
Connaught_Place,AstroBloke,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Best avoided...,"I'm really not sure what the fuss is about Connaught Place.  It's home to lots of shops selling overpriced yuppie western brand name goods, and the streets are full of touts trying to con you.  If they start telling you about ""government tourist centres"" or ""free maps of Delhi"" then it's a giveaway that it's not legitimate.  We were persuaded to visit such a place, and instead of a free map we were given a quote for a 3-day guided tour of Delhi for 26,000 rupees!  We did not take them up on the offer, of course, but it did waste our precious time.Really, there is so much more to experience in India than this glorified shopping mall."
Connaught_Place,Vivienne M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,An assault on the senses - in the nicest possible way!,"Connaught Place is in the heart of New Delhi surrounded by hotel chains and branded shops i.e.  Adidas, Benetton, Levis, Skechers, Zara, H & M to name a few. It is also the hub of New Delhi’s business centre. You will see magnificent architecture and find plenty of places to eat. We ate at the Embassy Restaurant which was great. However, this is India and you will also find lots of hawkers. Shoe-shiners are abound as are indian jewellery sellers, book sellers and inevitably, street food like aloo tikkas and paan puri. There is also a lovely park with tended lawns, trees and fountains. Several hours can be spent here just taking everything in. Highly recommended and a must-visit!"

Connaught_Place,ownthisplace,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Busy and over-run by tourists and hagglers.,Worst part of New Delhi especially if not interested in shopping.  Many Western shops that you can get at home so not a true ethnic experience and one to avoid especially if you don't like crowds.

Connaught_Place,Zumtinelz,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Busy. Avoid.,"This area is extremely congested. Difficult to avoid bit do if you can. That said, if you're going to the New Delhi grand sites, you will go through. Also there are a number of travel agents that are mainly reliable and respectable. There's a shopping centre under the park at the centre of the three ring roads around the area that I have never managed to actually get into. Look for the amazng oversized national flag in that park. A sight to behold. It's more fun in Old Delhi or Paharganj and the prices are better. On that front, if you are going to move on the Rajasthan, postpone purchases till then. Delhi wasn't generally great value though you can get some reasonably priced knock offs around Chandni Chowk that are well made. Sorry I took no pics of Connaught place this time round. "

Connaught_Place,saetravel,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"120 touts there, watch out if you hear “free Delhi map” or “tourist information center”","Every person that approaches you and starts talking to you at Connaught Place in Delhi (or also north of it, in the backpacker area near New Delhi Station) is a tout. That people are super friendly, they first start talking to you about normal topics, are interested in your country or want to give you helpful information. But in the end they want to bring you to one of the hundred unofficial “tourist information center” around Connaught Place where you can book an overpriced tour and the touts get their commission just that they brought you there. As soon as they mention “free Delhi map” or “tourist information center” in their words, that’s your call, you know what this friendly chat is really all about. Stop the discussion immediately, say politely “thank you, but you are wasting my precious time so that you only can get your commission, bye bye” and go away. They will feel sorry and admit they’re touts and walk away. Every single person that started talking to me around Connaught Place or in the north of it while I was in Delhi for several days, was a tour, there was not a single exception. Even when I went to a restaurant and sat at a table, few minutes later a guy came in and sat in front of me and ordered a small cheap drink and started talking to me. After I finished eating and left, he followed me and turned out to be a tout that only came into that restaurant after her saw me entering, to try to bring me into one of that unofficial “tourist information centers” to get his commission. It is very sad. Don’t get it wrong, Indian people are very lovely people, and also that touts are very lovely, they just want to make a little money, but be careful as they steel your time only to drag you into a shop so that they get their commission. One of that touts admitted to me that there are around 120 people operating around Connaught Place as touts.Even when I was leaving Delhi from New Delhi Station with a night train and had my ticket bought online already days before, one of the staff at the station checked my ticket, brought me to the ticket counter where they both discussed and then tried to convince me that I cannot go with my “general ticket” and that I had to go to a “tourist information center” and change my ticket for a “tourist ticket” first, to be allowed to use the train. Of course I already knew the magic words “tourist information center” and ignored them even he was walking after me, I could enter the train and go with it with my ticket that I bought online without problems, the ticket collector in the train didn’t say anything about my ticket."
Connaught_Place,The Food Wanderer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Heart of Delhi,Connaught Place is placed right at the centre of Delhi and has a plethora of shopping and food outlets. It is a hub for all the young Indians to hog. The imperial infrastructure still makes it a attraction. 
Connaught_Place,Rishi Tayal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,Best place,There a lot of restaurants which are great enough 😊Roads are clean here Everything here is well maintained Loved all these things😍😍👏👏
Connaught_Place,Payal G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Nothing exceptional - use public transport only,"Just an average centralized place for shopping, movies and food as found in every other metro city. Being super crowded it's next to impossible to find parking and the best way is to use the metro. One can get down at the Rajiv Chowk metro station on the yellow and blue lines to reach the place. Overall nothing missed by skipping this place."
Connaught_Place,Sanjeev Takyar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,The best place in Delhi,"Ask any Delhiites about Connaught place and they will vouch for it, there is a vibrancy all over, shopping, restaurants, street hawkers, well connected with metro, buses and public transport, roam about in inner circle, perfect outing, we love it"

Hanuman Temple is the perfect place to head to, as on weekends, worshippers fill the white space with prayers, chants and offerings.The Jantar Mantar in Connaught Place has 13 grand astronomical tools which still give the accurate time and date, as well as marking important astronomical movements, and is a fascinating glimpse of India’s historical scientific prowess.Must select Metro to visit for easy route"

Providing you all kind of shopping as well as eating experience. Best is there is place to shop and / or eat for all pocket sizes. Moreover if you are not interested in either, its fun to ""Window Shop"" in the busy inner and outer circle. Specially in this winter, its the best place to be."
Connaught_Place,UKAghada,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Very Happening Place.,"Good Morning Friends. Greetings for the day. This was very Happening & Busy place.    Inner Circle & Outer Circle were filled with all the Top Brand's shops, & exclusive showrooms. All the Elite & Top tier Upper class of Delhi's population was there. In some Small streets there was some middle class people as well. All the area surrounded with Top hotels & Exclusive showrooms. Like Mumbai's Nariman Point or Lower Parel's High Street Phoenix Mall. It was very Different experience for me. Quit Unique I think. Thanks for reading my review."
Connaught_Place,Kovilan_Naidoo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Business,Shopping mecca ,"Loved the atmosphere and buzz of connaught place. Endless shopping from boutiques to department stores and a variety of restaurants. It was really busy during the day and night. Take care of your belongings and watch your bags, there are lots of pickpockets and scammers hanging around. "
Connaught_Place,康 世,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A little bit boring place,"This is the place only shops, restaurants, coffee shops, bars..... for me it's a boring place, but you can visit if you are the first time in Delhi, or you want to have some different food and drinks. 對我來說，這就是個無聊的地方，只有商店，餐廳和酒吧，而且東西比較貴，還有騙子在此，所以不值得在這裡購物。雖然中央有個公園，但也沒有太特別的地方，只有一座號稱全球最高最大的印度國旗，但對外國觀光客的意義不大。但如果你想品嚐一些不同的食物，也許勉強可以試試看。這一帶的速食店如麥當勞等，口味也比德里其他地方的分店要好一點。"
Connaught_Place,Travel Photographer Lalu.co.za,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Nice branded shops,"The heart of New Delhi with many branded stores to shop. Not cheap but you can pick up real bargains especially at Christmas time. Most stores have buy 2 get 2 free offers. There are great restaurants there too. We really liked Rodeo, a Mexican Resturant in the heart of India. The place is crowded with loads of locals and tourists alike. Not very clean but then it’s India."
Connaught_Place,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Great landmark place of Delhi,"Connaught Place is a popular and major shopping hub in the heart of New Delhi. Mostly I come here for the European style shopping and plentiful decent cafes and international cuisine. May of the shops here are instantly recognisable international brands, although there are some local brands as well.One annoying thing about Connaught Place is the number of touts and scammers looking for victims. Beware of locals striking up a conversation and suggesting you visit a “tourist information office”, which are really tourist agencies trying to arrange trips and hotels for you for fees. Then there's the people who want to clean my ear, urghh."

Connaught_Place,Natália B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Beware of tourist office scams,"We stayed in a hotel at Connaught Place (which was fine). The area is full of embassies so we thought it would be safe for our first trip to India. We (2 women solo travelleres) left the hotel for our first walk around and were approached by an indian guy who was trying to be friendly. He asked us where we are from, how long in India, how we were getting about. He advised us to beware of show thiefs and late trains and said the best thing would be for us to go to tye tourist office for advise. He even offered to take us there as it local. We said no thanks. We noticed he made a phone call but then vanished. After a few minutes another guy approched us at a corner, noting we are obviously tourists. He had the very same approach but was more insistent. He gave us directions to the shopping area and wanted us to go via an underpass. We thought it was strange and took a different direction. By then we saw this and another guy was following us, constantly. Of course we thought there was somethinf very dodgy and bit scared. We rushed to a tuk tuk and paid a ridiculous price to be taken to the Indian gate. At this point we saw the second guy taking 2 tourists to the side street where the 'tourist office' was.  We then realised the scam (they probably take a comission off whatever the fake office sells) The tuk tuk driver was half way to the gate, he stopped and tried to conving us to go to the very dame tourist office to which we said definetly not! When dropping us off he tried to charge us twice the agreed rate (200 rupees for a 5min drive) and got pissed off when we declined. It was a stressful situatuon and it really ruined for us for a few days until we were over it. Indian people are very insistent but they are hard working nice and kind people when given the chance."
Connaught_Place,yetanotheropinion,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,It's fine,"I can see why people stay here: easy access to metro lines, plenty of food and drink options in the area (albeit a bit pricier than elsewhere) etc. but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit if you're not already in the area... It's calm and easy to get around though, so makes as good a base as any."
Connaught_Place,Heena D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Busy and full of men!,It's a lovely shopping centre. Has nice selection of boutique and designer shops. It definitely has two sides a run down and a nice classy side too. Do need a good couple of hours to find way around too
Connaught_Place,Shay and Peter Australia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Just another shopping area.,Have to be on guard for touts in this area - they are everywhere posing as 'helpful locals'. We actually escaped into a hotel for a very expensive cup of tea just to get a break from being hasselled. There Is a good western restaurant in this area if you need a break from Indian food. Prefer staying at Aerocity.
Connaught_Place,Ashok Gupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Business,Business Place,"One of the best business, financial and commercial hub with most of the banks, offices, restaurants and shops.

Connaught_Place,anujabedi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Heart of Delhi,It is a circular place you can keep going in circles. Historical extravaganza. You would find exclusive showrooms as well as local brands. Try tasting the street food- it is awesome. Some eateries are at least 100 years old- worth trying. Keep roaming yourself and avoid people hired to influence your mindset. Explore yourself - It is a beautiful place to visit
Connaught_Place,Ravsh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Vibrancy would charm you,"Despite presence of many malls and new shopping hubs, this remains the most vibrant place in Delhi. You can get all the brands for clothes as well as local market at Janpath. At Janpath, all artifacts can be brought. All types of restaurants, bars are there. The whole place is teeming with people, mostly youth, but families  and older people  also come. Must visit in Delhi."
Connaught_Place,Nick S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Hawkers Everywhere - Carefully cascaded approaches,"If you're not Indian you are a real target for hawkers here. They will befriend you then try to get you to go to an emporium. Do not follow them. We did the first time then said NO firmly, only to be pressured by another hawker. Organised teams of hawkers will target you, they will even leave you then another will continue. Say NO and go where you want to go, even if that includes an emporium (tax free goods from all regions of India).Just be savvy, the hawkers will also tell you the main area is not safe.Our stroll was ruined, we had no intention of buying anything, just wanted to soak up the atmosphere."
Connaught_Place,williamsonsontheroad,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Beware of scammers,"Beware if you visit Connaught Place of the scammers waiting to divert you to “better shopping centres” “charity operated shops employing tradespeople with disability” and of course the “government tourist office”. These scammers are well dressed, speak good english and will casually engage you in conversation before offering you free advice. They will tell you it will be 20 rupees to get to the place they are recommending & try to engage the rickshaw driver to get you in. Luckily we realised they were scammers, but read other reviewers feedback from those who weren’t so lucky. The approaches are constant and I would not go back again. "

It normally starts, where are you from, then they say that’s my favourite country then it starts. It gets annoying after a while but you then get used to it."
