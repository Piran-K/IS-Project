Crafts_Museum,David M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Unexpectedly nice place to visit,Nice audio tour. Not overwhelming. Good place to buy gifts from local artisans. Only downside is the vendors are always trying to sell you more (which is normal in India) which makes just browsing difficult.
Crafts_Museum,Shweta Rao,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,In Delhi and out of Delhi,"I have spent hours at Crafts Museum, if you love craft, if you want a day in Delhi but out, you go here. You sit with artisans, hear stories, buy lovely stuff at better prices than most other places. I love this one."
Crafts_Museum,Hunter Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,Must see under appreciated museum.,"The crafts museum is divided into two parts, the museum section, which contains an assortment of decorative arts from antiquity, and the gallery of local artists. I was fortunate to come on a day where the museum featured female artists from various Villages across India. Speaking with the women about their art and their inspirations imbued a spirit into their crafts that i could not achieve otherwise. I was happy to see the indian government setting aside a peaceful place for these women to share their crafts.Please visit this place when you are in delhi to support the artists. This museum doesn’t receive enough traffic and they will be grateful to host you."
Crafts_Museum,Kanika_born_a_traveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Perfect for people who are keen to learn about Heritage and Culture of India,Perfect please for Art lovers. Got to learn so much about our rich heritage of Art and Craft. Such beautiful Artwork at display done by such important Artist. Lot of shops to buy such amazing craft done by local Artists in the Area. We we're lucky to see an art exhibition. 
Crafts_Museum,Madhulika L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,‘A Museum out of Heaven’,"My eight-year old daughter described the Crafts Museum as ‘A museum out of heaven’ when she visited it. Established in 1991 to preserve and showcase the traditional arts and crafts of India, this is a beautifully designed museum which spreads out across a large outdoor space. The indoor galleries are housed in a large single-storeyed building, which includes galleries on Folk Art, Cultic Objects, Textiles, and so on. There is a large and very impressive collection here of beautiful, often historic, objects from all across India, some of it utterly priceless in its beauty and intricacy. The outside areas have their own expositions of art: the walls of the museum have been painstakingly painted with fine murals by traditional folk artists; there are massive terracotta sculptures, wooden bird houses, and more. A little further on from the indoor galleries, looms stand where weavers do their work, and beyond, there is a bazaar area where artisans from across India sell handicrafts (a little like Dilli Haat, but less commercial). There is a roofed but otherwise open pavilion where a duo from Bengal were singing beautiful folk songs. There are trees all around, and off to one side, there are reproductions, many of them full size, of huts and houses from different parts of India: Kullu, Nicobar, Gujarat, Nagaland, etc.Entrance tickets to the museum cost Rs 20 per adult. There are toilets, there is an audio-visual room where they host free viewings of shows on various Indian arts and crafts; there is also a souvenir shop, in the form of a Cottage Industries shop (not very big, but adequate). Next to the shop is the very pleasant and good Café Lota, which is a great place to lunch if you’re taking your time seeing the museum."
Crafts_Museum,Jon,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Couples,Good collection in a nice setting,"Spent a few hours at the Crafts Museum.  We were glad we went and enjoyed in particular the textiles exhibits, which were curated well with great English language signage and some interactive technology.  Handicrafts displays were great too, showcasing some of the amazing diversity of India. We also appreciated the short movie on women weavers.  The chariot is really something too.  We wanted to like the outdoor exhibits more - the positive was the peaceful setting and lovely trees.  The negative was the structures were poorly signed, inaccessible, and kind of arranged randomly among construction piles and debris areas.  They also have craftspeople making and selling some items, but the actual museum shop was apparently closed (indefinitely?).  Cafe Lota looked promising, but the 20-minute wait stretched to over an hour so we gave up.  Maybe best to put your name in before viewing the museum."
Crafts_Museum,psante,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A trip highlight.,We loved this museum.  It gave such a good documented history of the textiles of India.  We could have spent more time there.  
Crafts_Museum,Aikenfans,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,The two must-see places in Delhi are the Qutub Minar and the Crafts Museum!,"You must visit this museum!  Crafts Museum is a terrible name - the place is so much more than that.  It gives a wonderful look at the culture, the architecture, the crafts and the artistry for centuries of people from all over India.They have a stage in the center of the property, often with free concerts or dance performances.The museum is a delightful oasis.  There is so much to see there.  They have a really good, very casual, inexpensive restaurant.  (Try to walk in and make a reservation 15 minutes before you are ready to eat.)The museum also has a shop with a lot of very interesting things, including books, for sale.Don't miss this delightful, enlightening place!!!"
Crafts_Museum,naveen siromoni,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Authentic craft,The museum  located just next to the zoo has the most amazing display of model rural traditional homes that are amazing. A section is dedicated to artisans who actually make their craft items right there and sell them. Its great to interact with them and spend time watching how they create their masterpiece. The store is just unbelievable and has a huge collection of arts and crafts in fact just too much when it comes to choosing something. The restaurant is exquisite. the best part is that its not a crowded place and you get your time and space. The staff are polite and helpful. I just love going there and cant stop myself from buying the most amazing pieces of art

Crafts_Museum,Tarique S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,INDIA THROUGH A KALEIDOSCOPE,"India is a vibrant country with myriad traditions and cultures. These tradition and cultures manifests itself in various forms including that in handicrafts as well.The Craft Museum in Delhi is one such place which preserve and showcase the magnificent collection of India’s rural and tribal handicrafts.The main museum has been divided into different pockets such as the Bhuta Sculpture Gallery which exhibits a unique collection of coastal Karnataka’s Bhuta Cult, The folk and Tribal Craft Gallery where diverse selection of paintings, sculptures and other objects from folk and tribal tradition of India is put on display, Cultic Craft Gallery displays stuffs related to ritual practices of various religion, Court craft Gallery is yet another good place to learn how the houses and Palaces were decorated in early India and Last but not the least comes the Textile Gallery which is the most sought after corner of the entire museum.

A separate section has been created where the artisans make and sell different types of handicrafts.

Though I didn’t eat there but I have heard a lot about it. It is situated inside the main premises. Café Lota Shop which is basically a souvenir shop is also located just beside the restaurant.Craft Museum, I believe can be a good choice for a day out for people of all the age groups. Exploring craft museum is definitely like watching india though a Kaleidoscope.Important Info:1. There is a valet Parking available outside the museum. One can also park their vehicle near Bhairon Mandir which is just on the opposite side of the road and it’s a 10 min walk from there.2. Entry Fee is INR 20 for Indians and INR 200 for foreigners.3. Public Convenience is available inside the premises.4. Still Photography is allowed inside the museum.5. The museum opens at 10 am and closes at 5 pm. 6. Winters are good time to visit this place.7.

Crafts_Museum,speckles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,FASCINATING GLIMPSE INTO INDIA WIDE CRAFTS, Very well done museum with both outdoor displays of living quarters from the various Indian states as well as indoor rooms with textiles and other objects.  There is also an outdoor market with handicrafts also from assorted areas in India.  There is an exhibition area near the vendors where we caught a performance of some very flexible kids doing traditional dances and acrobatics.  They were temple dances and as such were danced by boys dressed as and made up as females since women are not permitted to be temple dancers apparently.

It is an amazing experience to be in Craft Museum and see the primeval world, minimalist existential surroundings, undaunted human spirit and quitenssetial serene beauty of human excellence.  "
Crafts_Museum,Ishuarav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Tradition of Indian craftsmen,"The museum will be an interesting place to see if you are a lover of traditional arts and crafts of india. It contains various galleries and holds dolls and idols of different ages as well as from different parts of our country. Inside the museum one can buy Madhubani paintings,worliart works from the artisans directly. The museum also has a store which sells all craft items. But very expensive. Parking is not available outside the museum. So park your vehicle in the pragati maidan parkinglot before heading to museum. Three hours is needed to witness the entire art works."
Crafts_Museum,NikaJunie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Museum and Living Displays of Indian Crafts,"I recommend this museum to anyone interested in traditional village arts such as wall painting, terracotta sculpture, metalwork, and textiles. It consists of various pavilions and courtyards and so is a lovely place in good weather. This is a living museum. There are performance spaces, one surrounded by the stalls of a revolving set juried artisans who set up shop here for a month. Quality is good and prices are modest. There is also a café that promotes and teaches Indian cuisine. A reconstructed village is on display."
Crafts_Museum,Maneesh2700,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,"Well maintained, clean and beautiful","It has got enormous space to provide you the feel of a museum as well as that of a village. The presence of craftspeople from across the Indian states is a great plus, you get to see how they work and prepare beautiful antiques"
Crafts_Museum,MarthaF,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,"A different kind of museum, great collections of historical folk sculpture and textiles and lost arts of India","A fascinating display in many galleries covering sculpture, folk painting and an outstanding collection of textiles hidden away in the back galleries past the vendors. Be certain to ask direction for access downstairs for these wonderful saris and other historical textiles on exhibit."

Crafts_Museum,Andrew C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Small and a tad disappointing ,I personally found this attraction a tad disappointing contrary to some of the reviews on-line.I also hate the way that the on-site vendors ambush you and then go for the hard sell 
Crafts_Museum,schoudhury2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Interesting place,Very nice place to spend a few hours among Indian crafts and textiles. Loved the open ness of the place.
Crafts_Museum,Mrinal Kanti D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,Good collection of handicraft and tribal craft,"Good collection of old crafts, people of all age groups will like the place. Indoor crafts are a must see.If you are lucky then you might see some small mela happening where you will be able to buy first hand from the craftsmen/ women."
Crafts_Museum,Lipsa A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,A standard place to spend some time along with kids,"This is a good place to spend around 2 3 hours with family and kids..If you have a kid then it's an enjoyable place but I personally feel this place is not managed too well.You can get some of the exotic items of few major states but I found them too over priced.The best experience in the museum is the pottery making that the craftsmen were showcasing, infact they even allowed us to try our hands :)Overall it was a nice experience for one time visit."
Crafts_Museum,PushExplore,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,Lovely collection of tribal & handicraft craft,The Crafts Museum visit was fun for us and for the kids. Saw some really interesting works of art. Kids were quite intrigued.

Crafts_Museum,Amolak Rattan K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,"Impressive collection of folk and tribal art, craft and textiles",There are about 15000 objects and to see such a variety one needs a few years . The gold leaf printed fabric of Rajasthan is something which is admirable .Governor Amolak Rattan Kohli
Crafts_Museum,Picky2traveler,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,Too hot today; would be great when cooler,"Really interesting museum of traditional crafts, housed in multiple buildings and with an outdoor area as well. If only it wasn’t 110 today. The main display has a cooling system and was small but very interesting. The textiles are separate in a run-down setting and not well displayed. Plus the space had no cooling system. Still some very beautiful pieces in there. Finally, ambience in the restaurant is nice (I stopped for cold water) and the shop has nice things. "
Crafts_Museum,87stutik,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,Treasure hidden in the heart of Delhi,"Well it's the biggest irony that inspite of being centrally located right next to Zoo and Pragati Maidan Gate no. 1 this place has very few visitors. It seems people don't know about it. Bureaucrats, ambassadors, art lovers and their families and friends are the only ones who visit this beautiful marvel. As the name suggests it has the collections of art and artefacts from different parts of India. The place is full of greenery. The brick and mud entrance, the vast area covered with trees of various species, each carefully nurtured and even labelled for the people to know their names, the large shady banyan trees circumfrenced with benched to sit and read, or write or simply chit chat with the family, the large art museum, the horse carts and bullock carts of ancient times are kept in the big ground it gives you a perfect setting for clicking some awesome photos of yourself spedning time with family and friends. The Kullu hut, the odisha hut and houses from different states have been modeled and made with their architecture completely explained. It's a perfect place for learning and having fun at the same time. Take  your children here for the sure if they are 5+. They will get to learn about the art, crafts and architectural marvels of India. I really think that it is important for us to show such places to children for they not only learn they also become more inquisitive and aware. It is right next to Zoo (Purana Qila) so a visit to Zoo can be combined with a visit to craft's museeum also. It is just before Gate No. 1 of Pragati maidan. "
Crafts_Museum,SJ49-London,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Superb indoor displays,The indoor displays are certainly worthy of five stars: amazing carvings and paintings with very good information. The temporary textile exhibition was also excellent.  The outside display of village houses completely lacked information about different styles of building - a sadly missed opportunity. It is very well worth a visit.  Good value at 200INR pp.
Crafts_Museum,Barbara P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,"The textile exhibition is extraordinary, the rest...meh...",the textiles on display are truly awestriking - the restof the stalls/huts are very disappointing & in dire need of a little TLC (which I believe is happening).Murals on all the walls are really interesting if you take a few minutes to pay attention.
Crafts_Museum,JMGeneva,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,Some beautiful pieces,This museum is basically in two parts with a fist sections presenting  craftsmen from various part of the country who sell their art and the second that is a real museum. The latter presents a wide diversity of pieces and some are spectacular and certainly worth a visit. In addition we were lucky enough to see a temporary exhibition of modern Indian tapestry with some amazing and fntastic works. This museum might not be a must but it is very pleasant. 
Crafts_Museum,gabymassiel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Concentrate and you will find a treasure,This museum is under construction so the facility is not top notch however the pieces on exhibition are really incredible specially the fabrics The store is great with beautiful pieces from all the country at decent pricesAlso there are artisans in the patio selling their work It is a must in Delhi
Crafts_Museum,LibladyHighWycombe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Fascinating well laid out museum.,"My driver took me to several museums and art galleries in his attempt to locate this, the one I wanted.  Not well known apparently.  This is a shame as there is lots to see and it was very quiet during my visit.  Laid out in is several traditional buildings around open courtyards where artisans work and display their works.  I liked the traditional village houses from various areas of India and the traditional tools depicting rural life.  I am particularly interested in textiles and spent most of my visit in the air conditioned halls displaying  wonderful silk and woollen fabrics.  I enjoyed my visit which lasted about 1.5 hours."
Crafts_Museum,anonymous055,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,Crowded on a Sunday,"There is an exhibition section, worth visiting.  However, there are also stalls selling Indian Crafts - commercial stuff.There is a Museum Shop as well.The restaurant is supposed to be good, but I did not go there.I was a bit disappointed by the Museum.  I had been there decades ago and I had a better experience - but I still think it is worth a visit."
Crafts_Museum,NovaNYC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Fabulous textile collection ,"We booked a guided tour at the museum, and because we’re interested in textiles, we asked the guide to start with that section. We’ll, we didn’t get to the rest of the museum; their textile collection is that good, if a little under-curated. There also was a special contemporary textile exhibit. So I can’t speak about the rest of the museum, but it’s reportedly excellent. So is the gift shop. And save time for thep restaurant — very much worth it!"
Crafts_Museum,mahuabose,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,lovely little place,It's a beautiful little place to spend few hours with friends. A good place for craft lovers. Also it's one of the most important meseum and art galleries in India. Take a craft walk to a small open market inside for artisans to sell their products.There is also a crafts shop inside with lovely handmade stuffs. And don't miss the cafe Lota at the entrance.Entry is free. Parking is available  at Bhairon temple. Easily accessible by car or metro. Nearest metro station Pragati Maidan. Timing 10 am to 5 pm and closed on Mondays. 
Crafts_Museum,Macloo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Undergoing renovations - wait until they are done,"Quite disappointing. I really love ethnic and traditional arts — carving, baskets, textiles, pottery, etc. — but this place needs a lot of work. The so-called village of traditional houses from many far-flung areas of India is dusty, old, and neglected. The area of stalls with (some) craftspeople making things is really just a bunch of stalls selling stuff. Many of the galleries were closed for renovations. I very much enjoyed the Folk & Tribal Craft Gallery — although some of the exhibits had burned-out lights and could not be seen properly, most of this gallery was well displayed and really interesting. I tried to go to the textile gallery, but the guard said I could not go in with my very tiny backpack, and I would have to go back to the entrance (other side of the complex) and put it in a locker. Although I wanted to see the textiles, I felt frustrated by this and just left, as I had already been there for about 90 minutes. I would suggest that it you can walk everywhere with your backpack except the textile gallery, then they should put the lockers there, beside that gallery, for convenience. Signage could also be better. I was given a nice map of the complex when I paid to enter, but with the lack of clear signs, the map was not very useful."
Crafts_Museum,flotrowski,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,Under renovation but...,"The Crafts Museum consists of two parts (excluding the textiles). The indoor gallery has crafts from several regions of India, some of which are quite unique, like the huge wood figures and the smaller carved dancers. The highlight, however, is the outdoor violage which has recreated dwellings from all over the country. This will be a 5 star attraction once the renovations are done."
Crafts_Museum,Kumar S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Crafts Museum,An interesting place if you love crafts. No very big but still couple of hours can be spent easily. Nearest metro station is Indraprastha. 
Crafts_Museum,frend09,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Gorgeous little place,This is a tiny but cutesy little place. Spend an hour or so here while you wait to get a table at the famous Cafe Lota attached to this place.
Crafts_Museum,Geoff F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Villages brought to life,"An excellent museum, the highlight of which was a village of houses of varying types representing the variety of residences throughout India, some of which are still current housing types. It gives an insight into the way people lived. The crafts section shows people still performing traditional skilled crafts without the aid of modern technology. A good 2 hours."
Crafts_Museum,Ullans,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016,Interesting but a bit tired,This is a good place to find out more about the different peoples of India and a very good place to pick up hand crafted souvenirs at good prices and made by actual artisans.  The museum is currently undergoing renovations so some parts may be closed. Check before you go!
Crafts_Museum,Sandeep_SIngh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017,Peek into rich heritage of India Culture,This place is great opportunity to have a glimpse of the rich Indian craftsmanship and heritage. Although most of the halls are gloomy and it is hard to stay there for more than 10 min due to intense (June-July) heat.
Crafts_Museum,TravlQ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Good Museum,"Crafts Museum is run by Ministry of Textile, Govt of India. One can visit it free of cost. It has a good collection of art crafts from all over the country. From handloom, sari , fabrics to the wall en cravings, its treat to watchAlso do try cafe lota located inside the premises"
Crafts_Museum,Gavster Bedlington,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Wonderful museum shop,"And an excellent cafe with artisan exhibits showing how they manufacture their goods - there is an interesting sari / fabric collection but the display really lets this down , The shop for choice and price as one of the best selections I've come across anywhere in India . Don't miss it ."
Crafts_Museum,HiteshAdventure,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,A beautiful collection ,The museum is amazing. It has an entire variety of crafts from different places. It could definitely use a little more explanation in the description cards. However it is a must visit for an in depth look at our nation's craftsmanship. 
Crafts_Museum,Vi H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Craft museum ,"Enchanting museum, full of little surprises, art crafts from all over India, including huts and toys. I have spent the hall afternoon here and it was delightful!"
Crafts_Museum,Michael D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Wonderful textiles - but oh the layout and conservation ,We spent 90 minutes here - the galleries are full of priceless textiles but not properly conserved and shown in a haphazard manner! We came out somewhat annoyed at how the textiles were going to be lost. Entry is free but there is zero parking outside.
Crafts_Museum,pawdy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Interesting look into village life and craftsman ship,We enjoyed walking around the reconstructed villages and seeing the craftspeople at work.  A lot of what was going on was crafts-selling which we avoided.  There was a fun group enacting part of the Ramayana.  The textile museum is a well hidden gem.  Unfortunately the lighting and signage was terrible.  Still they have some beautiful textiles.  Worth a visit.  And don't miss the Lota Café at the entrance.  Best food in India.
Crafts_Museum,phebert,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,More a market than museum,"This was something of a disappointment.  We;d read about artisans working but there weren't really any just a craft market albeit selling some interesting items,  The puppet show was interesting though.The museum was very strange.  The entrance wasn't well signed and turned out to be through an empty room up some stairs to some rather gloomy rooms displaying rugs, saris and decorative fragments from buildings none of which were labelled.  Though there were several people browsing the market we were the only people in the museum."
Crafts_Museum,smeezan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,Village in the city,"Lifesize versions of cottages of India, all put up in the crafts museum making it a mini village in its own. Aside from the textile exhibition, which is also amazing since they have all the fabrics from years before, there is a small vendor market full of ethnic products from all over india. Even a small boutique store to collect your gifting items."
Crafts_Museum,kamakshi j,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Simple and beautiful!,So the crafts museum has two parts - 1. Houses- An array of houses from all around india. These are traditional houses that encompass the culturally diverse arts. 2. Artisan Shops- The artisans from different parts of India sell their handcrafted products through these shops. We were fortunate enough to see a shadow puppet dance here as well. Overall...Great Experience!
Crafts_Museum,773chrish22,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Interesting museum,We enjoyed our visit to the craft museum although several parts were closed when we went. There is an area where local craftsmen can sell their crafts and a traditional puppet show was on while we were there. The village area has houses from different times and places in India. We especially enjoyed seeing the fabric department where a man showed us all the different techniques and styles from every area of the country. Also a litter of very cute puppies there. It was free to go in. There were a lot of school children visiting but it was a pleasure to see them. We could have spent longer there but our driver had dropped us off because parking is difficult.
Crafts_Museum,Bhati,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Pragati Maidan Museum,"This is an excellent place to visit.  Quite an expanse with open air exhibits.  However, the internal exhibits and exhibition were outstanding.  The main problem is that it is not publicised enough."
Crafts_Museum,lahari2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Couples,best place to have an overall look of Indian culture.,"I made a  small pot which was a great experience. The place and surroundings were awesome as I am a nature lover . every small thing there grabbed my interest. It is an open place ,very peaceful and joyful too. We watched and talked to people who were making crafts ."
Crafts_Museum,RX61,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Worth a visit,"There are four parts to this museum: 1) an outdoor area with old traditional houses, huts and farming equipment from different parts of northern India; 2) a museum, which was being renovated when we visited but which had an amazing display of textiles - saris in various techniques - ikat, brocade, resist dyed; some wonderful shawls; and fine embrodery including kantha, which is a quilted embroidery technique. There were looms intended as part of the display, but sadly in a poor state.  I so hope they are part of the renovation project too; 3) a market of craft stalls (we bought a nice cashmere scarf for a Christmas present - fortunately they had credit card facilities as no-one had cash due to demonetisation); 4) a restaurant, Cafe Loka, which we didn't try as we were too early but it had been recommended to us.  There is also a museum shop which we didn't rate, and as they refused to give us change for our 2,000Rs. note for a small item, so we bought nothing.  In summary we were glad we went.  Apart from ourselves there were were 5 or 6 parties of boisterous, selfie-taking schoolchildren numbering about 50 each, most of whom wanted to say ""hello""!"
Crafts_Museum,Tanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,I love it ,"A part of it has been recently renovated and it looks even better. A place which is not very big but has beautiful aura, and where you can watch many painters practicing their skills. My little one was excited to see terracotta animals and beautifully painted huts. They also have a restaurant which has traditionally Indian recipes but not commonly found. "
Crafts_Museum,Reema L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Fun trip,The huts are so beautiful. The place is awesome if you want to spend a good afternoon do head out. No tickets required. You can shop too and cafe lota offers hot drinks too. Worth a visit. Don't forget your cameras.
Crafts_Museum,gadgie57,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Very good :-),"We enjoyed a nice walk around the exhibits, including craft stalls. The shop is good value and dealing directly with the makers of the goods.The cafe is wonderful with super food and non alcoholic drinks.Enjoy :-)"

Crafts_Museum,j N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Solo,Enjoyable place to spend some time.,This complex is great for anyone who enjoys crafts/arts. This is one of my favorite places in Delhi. The place is a peaceful getaway from the Delhi hustle. I really liked the cafe and the food was very good.Besides the Museum there is a courtyard with a village kind of feeling where crafty goods are for sale. There was also live traditional music being played.
Crafts_Museum,Sarahash55,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Beautiful,"I loved this small museum, worth visiting. A guiet place , well designed , nice yard picturing diferent regions of india. A wonderful fabric collection. Craftmen and women selling their nice crafts at the yard , also there is a coffeshop."
Crafts_Museum,Matthew J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Lots to See,"The Crafts Museum offers lots to see but you need to navigate a maze to see it all. Textiles, furnishings, home goods, and other odds and ends are all on display. The indoor halls lack A/C so keep that in mind if you are hoping for an escape from the heat."
Crafts_Museum,Navya M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,For those who love to explore tradition !,It was a visit planned by my college and I suppose anything with friends makes the place even more exciting. The art gallery is a one time watch having people's efforts reflected in the price tags. The huge sculptures made of clay and mud were found to be dusty. The Kuchipudi dance performance was truly admirable. And of course you have a lot of spots to take few clicks and make your day a memorable one.
Crafts_Museum,NipunMittal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016,A beautiful 'clay' world where dreams come to play,"This one place is dreamy. Truly dreamy. You enter it and walk slowly into the arms of clay and forget what you intended out of this visit. Just the beauty of sculpture art, human finesse, precision, and silence takes over your mind and body. You will see painters painting, sculptures sculpting, and many others enjoying an art form at their exclusive amphitheater. You can also purchase the art forms and other accessories made by the skillful hands of India.     "
Crafts_Museum,Sanjay B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Solo,The spirit of India ,"The Crafts Museum located in Pragati Maidan competes with the Matka Peer which offers excellent biryani. But once inside, you are transported to a different world of folk arts and crafts, of traditional handicrafts and artisans, and colours and splendours of our villages. The practice of bringing in the master craftsmen began a few years ago and it provides the visitor to see first hand how these beautiful objects are created. Many of them are from daily life - fabrics, pots, decoration pieces, musical instruments and so many others. It seems our villages and villagers live an exciting life, though in reality it has been a struggle to keep these crafts alive. The interface between artisan and market is strengthened and also innovations in design and technology. I would strongly recommend all visitors, especially those with little children, to visit the Crafts Museum. You can also take an interesting curio back home. "
Crafts_Museum,Singh56,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,One time visit place,"I visited this museum with my cousin brother's.The Museum has not many things to see because renovation is going on.So,I recommend this place only if you are feeling boredom in New Delhi."
Crafts_Museum,HimanshuVohra86,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,It's a complete waste of time,"We have visited this place after reading wonderful reviews here but it turned out as a very bad experience, although the entrance was free,there is literally nothing to visit in this place,few handicraft horses made of mud in the entrance.there is a big shop selling handicraft items at very high price and it seems that the target customer are mainly foreigners whom the travel agents made them visit this shop to earn commission.There is a restaurant also but we didn't went there.Overall reviews : don't visit this place ,better to visit national science museum at a walking distance from this place ,it's a much far better place to visit.Parking tip: parking is not available in this place and the cheapest option is to park car near baihron temple."
Crafts_Museum,BananaLu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,"Under renovation, but still lot to see and buy!","The crafts museum is actually under renovation and only the textile gallery is open right now (free of charge). The gallery looks quite old and dusty, and needs to be renovated as well but I guess they need to keep something open.I loved the tribal paintings on the walls of the hall and courtyard, and the few tribal artifacts visible. They all have a sign indicating which tribes paint / use them.There was a South Indian market during our visit in July.The museum shop is one of the best I have seen in India, they have everything you might want to buy: decorative items in wood / metal, toys, jewelry, books, art pieces, beautiful greeting cards & notebooks, DIY art boxes, clothes, purses etc. Everything is well organized and the State from which the pieces come is specified.The restaurant is also a great option so plan your shopping session in the museum shop close to lunch time! They propose original dishes that I had never seen anywhere else before. Everything is delicious (thumb's up for the apple jalebis!). The staff is correct, but as the place is full on weekends, they might ask you to pay right after you complete your lunch to give the table to the next people.Definitely worth a visit!! And I hope the museum will be completely renovated soon!"

Crafts_Museum,savsv,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,"Frankly, I expected a lot more!",Very sparse. There's much more to Indian crafts than what was showcased. The place is more for textiles than crafts. Needs to be made more engaging and interactive to bring the place alive.
Crafts_Museum,AtulKB,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Worth a Visit to see Unique Crafts of different Corners of India,This place is must visit if someone wants to see unique and diverse culture of India thru crafts. There is no better place to see skills of some the artisans which are difficult to find elsewhere.

Delhities are not much aware of this place adjacent to Pragati Maidan, yet it has its own charm. A miniature rural/historical India could be seen here."
Crafts_Museum,NirupamPanjim,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016,India under one roof!,"Its a must see place place. It houses a very good collection of the crafts of India. Could be made a bit more interesting and interactive though. The staff seems very inattentive. The kids would enjoy the replicas of the houses found in different states. The craft shops are quite interesting. ""Lota"" the shop of the museum is a delight."
Crafts_Museum,Bushra Muzaffar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Unique Place for an Art Lover - A Must Visit,"Crafts Museum is a unique place for an art lover located in Pragati Maidan opposite Purana Qila on Mathura Road, Delhi. It is a peaceful place away from the hustle-bustle of busy Delhi. The Crafts Museum has a village kind of setting with open galleries with wonderful display of interesting exhibits of wooden carvings, terracotta sculptures, village houses and huts and tribal paintings from remotest corner of India. The open market has stalls selling craft items. Workshops are conducted by craftsmen here and you can also try your hand at painting, block printing, pottery etc. This place is a window to not only Indian crafts but also to the life and people behind these crafts. I had a quick tour of the gift shop while waiting our turn at the Café Lota which was like good 45 minutes. You can also shop for the craft items at the gift shop. The crafts items were neatly labelled with a brief description. I enjoyed reading about various crafts. Entry is free. Parking available at Bhairon Temple for Rs 120/-. Easily accessible by car and metro. It takes nearly an hour or more to go through this museum and add another to enjoy food at the Café Lota. With interesting things to see and experience the crafts museum is a must visit."

Crafts_Museum,Kartik Gupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,A Must Visit,"This museum has a rural essence inside its' boundaries.It narrates the diverse culture and arts spread across India of all time.Exhibits are minimal but spectacular. No so well organized though.Less time, Less Budget, Accessible place, Seek peace? Visit this one.A small open market for the artisans to sell their products (try talking to them generally if you are an art lover, they always got something to amaze us). A good souvenir shop too.Cafe Lota (a restaurant inside) is EXCELLENT IN ALL ASPECTS."
Crafts_Museum,Martyszka,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,"Great collection, poor presentation","As I am interested in textiles and other crafts I found the varaiety and quality of the collection fantastic. Sadly the presentation of most of the items is very basic verging on destructive to the objects shown. Information of each object is almost non existent or worse, wrong signs by wrong objects. This doesn't take away from the quality of the collected items providing one knows a thing or two about Indian crafts. The buildings are interesting. The series of connected buildings with small courtyards in between.However the most interesting is the display of new crafts in the garden's open pavillion showcasing different region every week/ month(I am not sure) Different craftsmen representing different disciplines show and sell their ware, often very original works.It is much better than millions of emporia throughout town selling basicly the same products. I loved the idea and the quality of things sold."
Crafts_Museum,Rissala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,great place to understand the artisians of india,the museum showcases the various Indian arts very well. for a traveler with limited time and travel oppurtunity its the best place to go and understand india and its various strengths in the crafts section .  could be better with more articles and regular change of products but great place of once
Crafts_Museum,Deepak975,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,good hotel,"its been now one year since i relived that great moment here, outstanding hotel in all perspective, service was great and quick in responding, food availability has ample of vareities , so overall a great deal at this price"
Crafts_Museum,RGS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015,Traditional India,With a village like look this place needs a visit. It is having beautiful atmosphere of a traditional Indian village. No entry fee and location near Pragati Maidan mkes it easily accessible. Do visit to understand Indian traditional craft. But yes don't expect much at the same time.
Crafts_Museum,Jose H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015,"I love the place, restaurant and the shop","Set up like a traditional village, this museum aims to preserve the Indian traditional crafts. Among the interesting things to see are a carved temple chariot, terracotta figures, or a  copy of a Gujarati haveli residence. There is an open market for the artisans to sell their products, and a very good souvenir shop. The restaurant Cafe Lota is a chilling place with a wonderful modern cousine."
Crafts_Museum,MawaNewYork,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Couples,Not much to see - undergoing renovation?,"There wasn't much to see, which may be why there was no entry fee being charged. It looked like the museum was undergoing renovation, if you can call it that. It was a peaceful place, especially the village area, but exhibits were minimal, old and not being maintained. Very few people were present. Walked through everything inside the building and out in about an hour and then met our taxi outside. We found the best way to get around Delhi efficiently and comfortably was to have an air-conditioned taxi and driver each day at a cost of around $25 for 8 hours. We could be dropped off wherever we chose and picked up at a set time. Parking can be a nightmare, so this was the best arrangement."
Crafts_Museum,Evergreen1984,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,Delightful setting - not at all the usual museum experience,Village-like setting to some of the exhibits makes them come alive.  Good place to bring children.  Craftspeople at work.  Small but quite good museum shop.  Excellent restaurant.  No entrance fee.
Crafts_Museum,Terezia_77,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,An oasis in busy Delhi,"A relatively young museum features collection of artefacts and buildings from all India's states. It provides an excellent overview of different ways of life of indian people. The quality of artefacts is excellent, but sometimes there is lack of information and context about it. The museum is certainly worth visiting if you are into arts and crafts, but be prepared that it is not the most well organised museum out there.Dont miss the restaurant close to the entrance, it is a true jewel."
Crafts_Museum,CHG0gal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Excellent peaceful experience,"Lovely museum with indoor and outdoor exhibits. Outdoor is a peaceful shady location, set up so you can meet the artists that create the crafts that are for sale. Designed like a village, with the opportunity to see different arts and architecture of the various states of India. Peaceful setting. Free admission. Cafe has EXCELLENT cuisine, a must to visit."

Great collection of Indian crafts ... great to travel through the pages of crafts history... No entry fees... with only one food joint ... so book early ( at least 45 mins before you are really hungry) .. small stall of artisans ... ..Very enjoyble place.
Crafts_Museum,ANILKUMARVAHRI,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Solo,ancient and ethnic craft items,"If you visit Delhi you must visit all museums in Delhi, most tour operators are avoiding museums from their tour package because of time management. this is the one of the best museums in India to learn about history of Indian handcraft. "
Crafts_Museum,Masafira,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Solo,Outdoor and indoor museum,Very interesting museum concept.  They created structures to resemble dwellings from different parts of india. There's also a nice gift shop along with a bazaar area. The shops change every 2 weeks so there's always something new. The indoor textile museum is amazing with decorative fabric from the turn of the century And clothing from even earlier.  The elephant drawn cart for the king is magnificent as is the ginormous balcony.  I also thought the old fashioned hair dryer was unique.  There's no cost to this museum.
