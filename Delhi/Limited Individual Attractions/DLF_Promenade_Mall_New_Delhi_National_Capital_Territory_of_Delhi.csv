DLF_Promenade_Mall,Melanie E,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Just Like North American Malls,"This is the biggest shopping mall in New Delhi. It's about 30 minutes from the main airport. It's a high end mall filled with international and local  brands of clothing, electronics and accessories. There are Western restaurants such as Nando's and TGIF. Also has a food court with at least 10 different vendors. The mall is fairly new and is clean. Much like the big malls I see in North America. The mall is opened from 10 am until 11 pm for those who want to max out on shopping time. I was staying at a hotel about 15 minutes from the airport where I took Uber to this mall at a reasonable rate of 70 rupees. This rate was probably to do with a sign I saw at the mall saying if you book Uber between 10 am until 5 pm, you paid a special rate. Within a short walking distance, is another big mall called DLF Emporium which has mainly the high-end fashion designer stores such as Gucci, Lois Vuitton , etc."

DLF_Promenade_Mall,mail2bibhu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,Would say the Best shopping mall in New Delhi,"I would rather rate this as the best upmarket shopping mall in New Delhi with home to premium designer shops and luxury branded apparels and items. Located in Vasant Vihar, this area doesn't have any metro station, but can be accessed with public transport buses and also with private auto from anywhere in New Delhi. Nearest metro station is the Chhatarpur metro station."
