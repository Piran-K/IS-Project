Delhi_Airport_Metro_Express,Ilovemyjollies,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,The most modern thing in the whole of Delhi,"We only decided last minute to take the metro rather than get a taxi, what a great decision!It cost about £0.40 ea to get to the verge of Delhi, hassle free, no traffic jams, no queues or beeping horns and it took around 10 minutes.

Delhi_Airport_Metro_Express,naveen siromoni,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Delhi's best Merto line,The airport express as we call it has a very specific reason as the name suggests its actually the fastest way to get to the T3 terminal.Whats good about it:1. Comfortable interiors I would say its even better than the jet your just going to board2. Space to put your baggage right next to the exit so that you dont have to carry it around and jam the walk way3. Speed and time: It does not necessary travel faster than the average metro but the number of stops are limited unlike the rest of the routes4. It covers the most congested areas so that saves literally 70% of time from surface transport5. The Rajiv Chowk station is located bit off the main central circle so its too close to take a cab or auto and too far to walk with baggage. But its one of the more de-conjusted stations6. Use this line even if you have to get to any of the other terminals as ther is a good inter terminal transit bus

The railway is the way to go."

I did this because I thought I would be able to get the metro to the airport. How ever it turns out that the metro is positioned at the back of the station. It is accessed via a horrible flyover with a lot of steps. I walked there the morning before my flight to check it out. It seemed lovely once you are there. However accessibility with luggage, via flyover and steps far to difficult. Even getting a taxi to the station would have taken almost as long as a taxi to the airport. What a waste of a lovely facility. Sort your self out, Dehli!"

Delhi_Airport_Metro_Express,PipPaul W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"Fast, clean and  cheap","60 rupees, that's around 70 UK pence, to whisk you from the airport into the centre of town, or reverse If three is a downside it's that there are hardly any stations in town, just centre and one near-miss to Connaught Place "
Delhi_Airport_Metro_Express,vasu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Must use,It was a very amazing experience using airport express.I just got my boarding pass at New Delhi metro and in 20 minutes I reached T3.Only problem is at T3 we have to walk for so long for the entry at airport.
Delhi_Airport_Metro_Express,ST_INDIA,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Excellent- fast and convenient,This is definitely an excellent metro service and by far the fastest way to reach T3 and T2 airports. The metro is very convenient and definitely escapes all the traffic of Delhi. The airport station is right at the T3airport. For T1 you need to board a shuttle as it is 1km approx. From there.

Compared to travelling by road this is the safest and cheapest option.Lifts and escalators were present in the stations we used.Only suggestion: better directional signage in English in the stations.

Delhi_Airport_Metro_Express,The Food Wanderer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Comfort on a Train,Trains are often problematic due to the crowd and the lack of facilities. But the airport is different. It has all the basic amenities that a traveller needs in an hour and will reach the airport quickly
Delhi_Airport_Metro_Express,Turdinthepunchbowl,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Business,Cheap and clean,Very cheap and clean transport in Delhi. But if you're coming from Noida from the central station or Vaishali like I did then you might have to endure the agonizing stench of human faeces in the early morning metro trips when rustic commuters defecate in the rice fields with only a lota of water and no soap or tissue before boarding the metro. For your safety pls wash your hands thoroughly with a disinfectant at the end of your journey so that multi drug resistant typhoid etc do not creep into your orifices.

Delhi_Airport_Metro_Express,Jay,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Good train to commute the Airport,"The train is directly connected with Terminal T3 (IGI airport) and convenient to put your luggage and travel at ease specially during peak hours in morning and evenings. Since the traffic crowd in Delhi/NCR is very jam packed during these hours (starting 7:30 AM - 12 PM, 5 PM - 10:30 PM). So it easy to commute through Delhi metro Airport line. The only caveat with this train is it's availability. Since there's only 1 line connected for this route, it's not available on all the other routes of Delhi metro. It starts from New Delhi Railway station and stops at only main stations like Dwarka Sector 21, Dhaula Kuan, Rajiv Chowk and Kashmiri Gate , so the passengers have to chose the lines accordingly, otherwise it's the most convenient way of travelling to the Airport both T2 and T3 terminals."
