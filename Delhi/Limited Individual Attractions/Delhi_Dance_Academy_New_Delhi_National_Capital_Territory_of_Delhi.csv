Delhi_Dance_Academy,Mateusz M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Definitely recommended for couples and groups :),Great way to start of the trip in India. On the first day after our flight this was the only thing on our itinerary and it was a really amazing experience. We learned two dances and after learning the routine we did a short recording.  The entire class took about two hours to complete. We hired one costume and the other we bought before the class. We were given some drinks during the dances and some local food at the end was a great final touch. Definitely recommended! :)
Delhi_Dance_Academy,firstripwithkids,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Fun! Great Energy!,"Our two hour class was a highlight of 9 day, amazing trip to India. We were 10 people and every one of us had a great time!   We are very glad we paid extra for the outfits. It added to the fun environment.  Most of us are not great dancers, but it didn't matter. We all learned the dances and had a wonderful time. The studio and especially the bathroom, are not super clean or lovely, but none of that mattered and we all had a great time!  The teachers were nice and talented.  I would recommend this class to all ages who want to have a lot of fun!"

Delhi_Dance_Academy,birroa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Laughter & dance moves,Although our driver found it a little tricky to find - the amount of fun we had was completely unexpected. We learnt dance moves and a little bit of insight into Indian culture.
Delhi_Dance_Academy,John Mendez,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Great dances and a great time!,"As a solo traveler I was a bit worried that the studio would only book for groups but they were happy to book me and I had a fantastic time with them! I'm not the best dancer and I forgot a few moves here and there, but my choreographer, Sujeet, was super patient and a bundle of positive energy.  Thank you guys for a wonderful experience. I wish you all the best!"
Delhi_Dance_Academy,Maths99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,What a great experience!!,"8 of us 50-somethings on a trip round India........had a 2-hour, 3 dance, class with these guys & it was brilliant!! they made us feel very welcome, dressed us up, patiently went through all the steps with us and we ended up doing not  a bad job of all 3 dances.

Delhi_Dance_Academy,mo71ey,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Do not miss! ,"Delhi Dance Academy are fantastic. I was really looking forward to this class, I found them through trip advisor, when I left a question on their page another dance company in Delhi contacted me - I‚Äôm sure they are also great but I‚Äôm so glad I stuck with Delhi Dance Academy. We were running late due to a miss communication with our driver but Nazir was very understanding. Our dance teacher was wonderful, very patient but still fun. The 2 hours went so quick. My husband has literally never danced in his life and even he had the best time (he was still doing the moves this morning around the hotel room lol) If you are in Delhi even just for a day you MUST do this. If I lived in India I would be here every other day. Can‚Äôt wait to see the video and again Thankyou so much for an awesome time! "

Delhi_Dance_Academy,Hazelwood09,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"Brilliant, good fun and a great for the body and mind","My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her 2hrs at this dance class, it was the highlightof our holiday in Delhi. She loved learning the two different dances and was delightedto receive an excellent video afterwards of her routines. We would definitely recommend it.  A little hard to find, but with a good taxi driver, it is possible."
Delhi_Dance_Academy,Cathy Busby,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Authentic Indian Dance Experience,"My husband and I visited India and I had seen great reviews online for Delhi Dance Academy so I was eager to try it out. They were very accommodating with our schedule (which had actually changed a couple of times due to flight delays) and we did a one-hour mini private workshop. We got to dress in Indian attire and were greeted in a traditional way. We were taught both Bollywood and Bhangra dances by request and they were the perfect level of difficulty. I did folk dance in college and loved Bhangra so I was very excited for this class and it definitely didn‚Äôt disappoint. My husband would have liked more time to learn the dances (he‚Äôs not a dancer), so he wished we would have done the 2-hour session instead. I thought the timing was fine though. Our instructor was good, although I felt like he lacked the enthusiasm I had seen from other instructors online at Delhi Dance Academy. Overall, everyone was friendly and kind, and the class was so much fun, even for non-dancers like my husband. It makes me wish that they had a similar class near my home to learn even more Indian dances. Definitely do it if you are in Delhi!"
Delhi_Dance_Academy,Jessica R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Bollywood Dance Fever!,"My best friend and I took an Indian dance class complete with costume. We learned 3 different dances. This was one of the best things that we did while in India! The instructors were great and each dance was so much fun! A great way to experience Indian culture and also a little bit of a work out, lol! Highly, highly recommend taking a dance class with Delhi Dance Academy!"
Delhi_Dance_Academy,Tania P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Must do in Dehli, amazing and fun experience!","The Team at Dehli Dance Academy were very welcoming, enthusiastic and full of energy. We had an incredible time which was fun and exciting. Relaxed atmosphere full of laughter. It was our last day in Dehli and it was the perfect end to an amazing time in India. The choreographers were very patient and ensured we had fun but also learnt the routines which we received on video for long lasting memories.We would highly recommend this to anyone regardless of age, skills and ability. The Team will make you feel looked after and it will contribute to an unforgettable trip to India. We can't thank you enough Dehli Dance Academy! Namaste"

Delhi_Dance_Academy,22KiwiTraveller22,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Professional and fun,I had my own private 2 hr dance session and it was so much fun. The facilities are modern and airconditioned. All the staff were welcoming and well mannered. I was well looked after. I was taught four dances by two instructors. The instructors taught the dances in small manageable chunks and were good at explaining what to do.  I was given a short break between each dance. The dances were energetic and fun and the music was lively. I enjoyed wearing a sari. I was offered a bottle of water. The toilets were clean. I was even given a snack at the end.I was sent a lovely video of myself doing the dances. When I had trouble opening the video on youtube they resent it in a different way so I could access it.  I am recommending Delhi Dance Academy to everyone in my dance group back home.

Delhi_Dance_Academy,Anna,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Amazing dance experience,"We loved our time at Delhi Dance Acamdemy. As a dancer, I was desperate to do the Bollywood, stick dance and Bhangra workshop and as a non-dancer, my boyfriend kindly agreed to do it too!!! We both loved it. The company is amazingly well run and the teacher was fantastic. He was very intuitive to our needs when learning the routines and filled us with confidence and made it fun. The owners couldn't do enough to make the experience enjoyable. They provided us with costumes when we arrived and water, then gave us fruit juice half way through and, as we had a late session from 8-10pm, sent us away with sandwiches afterwards. They filmed every stage and sent us photos via instagram the next day. We eagerly anticipate the footage arriving soon which they assured us it would and we have every confidence it will. An amazing company providing a fun and fantastic service."

Delhi_Dance_Academy,laurentin9,,,,"Due to flight cancellations and delays, it took me fifty two hours to fly from America to Delhi! I continued to stay in touch with Mr Nazir as I was now in jeopardy of missing my private class! Not only was Mr Nazir prompt with responding, he was gracious and calming. When I FINALLY arrived at DDA, I was treated like a queen!! Ruchika was so patient with finding the perfect saree for me. Mr Nazir came to personally welcome me with the customary flowers. And then there was the class!!! So. Much. Fun!!!!! Forgive me, I cannot remember my instructors name but he was magnificent!!!! So much energy, patience and talent! It is obvious that he loves to dance. I wish I still had his energy but at almost 50 years old, I tried my best to keep up. It's been 4 days and I am still sore...but I'd do it all over again! My two hours at DDA were even better than my visit to the Taj Mahal! If you are in Delhi I urge you to take the workshop!!! They cater to suit your skill and fitness level. They taught me three whole dance routines and filmed my performance. I took the class solo and had a blast! I can only imagine how much fun it would be with friends. Take this class. It will provide a lifetime of fun and beautiful memories! THANK YOU DELHI DANCE ACADEMY!!!!!"

As an occidental I don't have too much of an idea about the diversity of Indian rhythms and dance and it was possible to go through three very distinct styles. It was, for sure, one of the highlights of my trip to India. I just wished I could stay longer to learn more!"

The guys there were ever so polite, energetic and their smiles were enough to brighten up our India trip.  We learnt alot within the short time we were there, and such a good workout and even better dance routine.  To see it in the movies, looks like its a piece of cake, but to actually learn some of the steps makes you understand the amount of time and energy.  It only but makes you smile."

Delhi_Dance_Academy,DelhiDanceAcademy,,,,The Bollywood dance class was a great kick off for our Honeymoon. We had lots of un with our teacher and Nazir was super quick and professional arranging everything by e-mail before we got to India.They also were super quick to send us a fun little video and photos of our poor but lovely performance. It was a great experience and we felt happy to support this local business made with love and care.We highly recommend it.Joana and Hendrik

Delhi_Dance_Academy,vanstrander,,,,"My young daughter takes dance so I thought it might be fun to try a Bollywood dance class while we traveled through India. Delhi Dance Academy came highly recommended on TripAdvisor. The owner, Nazir, was quick to respond when I wrote him. We settled on a time and I confirmed the price. Unfortunately, it ended up being a bit late for my daughter so mum had to complete the class, but she really enjoyed watching me learn the two dances we went through during my 1 hour class. Overall, this is a great experience and the team at Delhi Dance Academy are friendly and knowledgeable. I recommend if you like dance or just want to try something different."

Everyone was professional and dedicated to making this a joyful experience for me. I loved learning all three dance forms. They sent me the video in about a week. My friends loved it!"
