Delhi_Metro,Gustavo A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Useful and easy to navigate,"The Delhi metro has very large and far-reaching infrastructure. For instance, if you want to go from one corner of the map to the other, it may take you around 4 hours of journey. Other than that, it's great and easy to navigate through. Some points to consider, you'll always have to go through security checkpoints when going in a metro station and these may be full of people waiting to enter (and Indians will cut in line, so hold your ground). The metro can be accessed via token or card. With tokens you simply choose the station you want to go to, and a token is dispensed with that information so you may use it at the gates. The card costs 100 rupees I think, but they give you back 50 if you return the card if you feel you don't need it anymore. To use it simply recharge it and it discounts the value respective to the segments you're traveling on. Personally, tokens are cheap and super easy so I just used those. HOWEVER, avoid the metro during rush hours. Unless you're ok with huge crowds in closed off spaces and consistent shoving, then avoid rush hours. If you have to use the metro during rush hour, buy your tokens in advance, otherwise there won't be any or there will be huuuge lines to buy them when you get there. To get in or out of the carts shove if necessary. Others will do the same and if you don't you might not be able to get in/out of the train cart. There's individual carts for women only as well, if you feel safer in those. The metro is very safe, I'd say, so no worries. There's strict security and it does feel like it is really enforced there."
Delhi_Metro,Anika S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 â€¢ Family,"Fast, economical .Ticketing system needs improvement.","Fast,economical mode of transport.Clean and modern compartments.However at many stations Ticket Vending Machines were either not operational or not accepting cards or certain currency notes .Ticketing system definitely needs to improve but barring that Metro is a boon for both localities and tourists."

Delhi_Metro,Aaditya Paudel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Delhi Metro Service | Delhi,A really really really really really really really good facility if you are about to visit Delhi please use it.

Delhi_Metro,Tanvir Singh Sabharwal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 â€¢ Solo,Coolest way to travel Delhi ,The Delhi metro is one of the cheapest train systems I have ever used. The best part is the Air conditioning on board in the Delhi heat. The rails are very well spread out and with the help of Google maps you can easily figure it out.

Delhi_Metro,VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Long distances in city are convenient in Metro,"Delhi Metro is the longest Metro Network of India. If you really want to save yourself from Delhi Pollution and crowd on the roads, it is the best way to travel.

Delhi_Metro,Brun066,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,"Much more than a transport network, it's a powerful welfare tool","In my three-day stay in Delhi, I used the metro as much as possible. It was a pleasant surprise for me to be able to take advantage of a structure such as the Delhi metro network: efficient and clean stations and trains, fast trains, a network that - alone or with the help of other means in the ""last mile"" - allows you to get anywhere.Can I say it? The Delhi metro doesn't look like the city. Delhi (but almost all of India) presents contrasts between rambling places (if not distressing) and places that shine with wealth and luxury. In this context, the Delhi metro is much more than a transport network (anyway more than appreciable): itâ€™s a powerful tool of the welfare state, of reducing inequalities, of a policy of progressive reformism.."
Delhi_Metro,Harsh Malhotra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 â€¢ Solo,Great,It is always a great experience to travel Delhi metro It is neat and clean.  Stations are hygienic and public friendly. Security is alert and staff courteous

Delhi_Metro,Payal G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 â€¢ Couples,Truly Delhi's lifeline,This is the most efficient way to get around the NCR i.e. New Delhi and it's satellite towns from Noida to Gurgaon to Faridabad. Visitors to Delhi should opt for this mode of transport as Delhi lacks an organized metered Taxi or Auto rickshaw system like Mumbai and Kolkata. The Metro is way better and safer than haggling with unreliable auto drivers.Most of the sites in Delhi can be accessed through the metro. The tickets are very reasonably priced. Even the peak hour crowds are less than Mumbai local trains and metro making the journey quite comfortable. There are ample guides and maps for the various lines. It is easier and faster to get a metro card if one has to make multiple trips.

I found it really useful for visiting the main sites, some would require a walk, but that's life. It's especially useful for staying further out from the more expensive areas and the metro is so cheap by western standards and is a great way to save money to get around the city."

Delhi_Metro,JamieJW,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 â€¢ Family,Convenient & Efficient,"Struggled with Uber a few times, wanted a bit longer than we wanted for a car, so decided to use the Metro.  Great choice, convenient and efficient.There are Metro maps at all the stations so you can decide the stops you need to make and the names of the stops.  Price of the ride depends on the destinations and the number of lines used.  For example, taking the yellow line from Rajiv Chowk to Chandi Chowk costs 20 INR each way.  Adding the blue line to get back to our hotel room cost 40 INR as we had to switch from yellow to blue.  Switching is eazy, there are signs posted everywhere you just need to know the name of the last stop of the line your taking, or the destination.Seemed intimidating at first but quickly found it much easier and more efficient than other forms of transport."
Delhi_Metro,Sabeera A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Convenient transportation,"Very well maintained fastest transportation system for public.

Very convenient for travelling around NCR but a very strange incident happened today while I was getting my metro card recharged, a transgender was taking a token to travel to some destination via metro but a man at the token counter denied him/her giving that. I wonder why did he deny.. like there is no rule which says that transgender cant travel through metro??? This is really the India which we are creating? Are we still so narrow minded? This is a transport system for humans.. & I suppose transgenders are also humans. Wanted to take the pictures/videos but could not as I was the only girl there..rest were men who were making fun of that transgender & were supporting that counter man, I could not help that transgender as I did not feel safe. We still live in India where its not safe to interrupt between other people's issues.*5 stars for Metro but sorry no star rating for whatever I witnessed today* But I had to star rate something so I just gave 1 star."

Lot has changed w.r.t. the distance it now covers and the overall time that it saves while commuting within Delhi and NCR regions compared to the road based commutation. I have similar expectations with other cities that are upgrading to support Metros."

I am so amazed that how come it has managed to stay so clean(literally) and tidy.Its a miracle that people of Delhi have not ruined it with their spit, filth, trash and God knows what. How come the the metro managed to control the beyond control people of Delhi? May be the fear of fines, police presence and security cameraâ€™s did the trick. Its commendable. Truly a masterpiece.

Delhi_Metro,Jam4ika,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 â€¢ Couples,WOW. It has impressed me!,"World class brand-new metro in Delhi! I have seen few metro systems in Europe and I can say that Delhi Metro is far better, cleaner and safer (than the one in Rome, for example). I thought after our Moscow metro nothing can impress me but Delhi Metro has done it. The trains are huge! The first compartment in every train is given to women (that is only Indian thing as were don't have gender segregation here in Russia). Some junction stations looked more like a shopping mall than a metro :) Inside the metro it is a bit hard to understand where to go so we took some time to find the way to our line. Anyway, guys, you are so lucky to have such great metro in the capital!"
Delhi_Metro,IntrepidNomad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 â€¢ Couples,Excellent - Rivals London etc,"The Delhi Metro is very clean, reliable, fast, efficient, and so impressive.

Women can even travel in their own carriage.We couldn't  buy a return ticket so we had to queue twice in short queues. Metro travel is cheap, fast and efficient.Before entering the platform there is a security check - this is a good thing.Next time we are in India we will definitely use this mode of transport as car, taxi, bus travel on the ground is a nightmare, especially during peak hours."

We were amazed at it cleanliness, efficiency and absolute value for money. We could visit all the noteworthy places across Delhi by metro as most are situated close to metro stations and only sometimes(if the attraction was too far from the metro) we used tuk-tuks. We bought the 1 day(as opposed to the 3 day card) tourist card which was 200 rupees and got a refund of 50 rupees on return of the card. We enjoyed the metro so much we used it again the following day. We were two women and felt completely comfortable as we used the women only carriage.

Delhi_Metro,iti_94,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Family,Fastest way to travel in Delhi,we wanted to visit some of the main tourist spots in Delhi and so i have checked the internet and found that there is a one-day tourist card for Rs100 for unlimited travel where there is a deposit of Rs50.When we asked for the card at Rajiv chowk metro station we were told that it is for 150.we still took 3 cards for 600 .From the very beginning one of our cards were not working.we told the staff they checked and told us that it is ok.But throughout the day we faced a lot of problem and in lal qila station we faced a lot of harrassment and the person at the counter was charging usextra amount because the card was not working.we showed him the receipt of our cards still he was not convinced.This continued throughout and we lost a lot of time in the process and finally i decided to use the same card with my son to avoid all these harrassment then some guard caught us and to end all this we didn't get our refund for the one card which was not working.As tourists is this the kind of treatment we are supposed to receive? Next day we travelled by normal tokens and it was hassle freei have full regards for the service as it is very fast and on time and also very easy to understand the routes and lines as all indications are there.

Delhi_Metro,TYPSUKR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Business,Reliable Means of Transport,"We had to get from Old Delhi to the Diplomatic Enclave, and rather than risk haggling with a cab driver, we rode the Metro to our destination. The system is cheap -we paid about 50 INR for a ride across the city - and also easy to navigate as English is available on all signs, charts, and maps. Once in the system, it's pretty much like any other major metro system around the world. The cars are air-conditioned, and both signs and announcements are bilingual in Hindi and English. Our ride was a bit crowded near Connaught Place, but the train emptied out once we got south of there."
Delhi_Metro,travelalot,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Business,Surprisingly good,I was slow to try the Metro in New Delhi but half way through my visit to the city I eventually gave it a go - I was sorry I had not ventured underground sooner as the Metro proved to be one of the best ways of getting about the city. The price was cheap and a day tourist pass at 200 rupees quickly paid for itself.The system is clean and efficient with a number of lines going in different directions. The first carriage is reserved for females which tells its own story about India. The metro seemed to be filled with normal working people and while it was busy and crowded at times it was relative calm compared to the chaos that is Delhi above ground.
Delhi_Metro,Sam Greep,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Solo,"Convenient, cheap and comfortable to use","Used a couple of times throughout my stay in Delhi, there are maps throughout all the stations to help you get to where you need to go (didn't see any printed ones you could take). And directions of travel at the platforms written in Hindi and English to make sure you board on the right side. There were staff at some card/token machines to help you buy what you need to buy for free. Most trips cost me anywhere between 10-30 rupees getting to tourist locations (the longer the trip the more you pay so prices may differ depending on which station you use) and from New Delhi Station to the airport, a very quick,cheap and convenient way to get into the airport as opposed to a taxi, cost 60 rupees (Â£0.64, $0.84, â‚¬0.74 at time time of writing) and takes around 30 minutes - quicker than driving with the cities crazy traffic!Machines only took 10 and 20 rupee notes so change larger notes before use. Machines also rejected a lot of notes so make sure you have plenty!Air con provided in stations and on trains. As a white foreigner i got some curious stares but overall felt safe using both day and night."

Clean and neat , not much costly , spacious; what else would we ever want? Highly useful for daily commute to the office or just going out. Easiest way to break the traffic. Crowded at peak hours though. If you've travelled in metros of other cities , do travel in this to see the difference."

Delhi_Metro,Marvin G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 â€¢ Couples,Riding the Delhi Metro was an exciting experience,"The Metro in Delhi is a fantastic experience in an of itself.  It was built to help alleviate car and truck traffic in the inner city.  The Metro is ultra modern with air conditioned reticulated cars that were built by Bombardier, the Canadian company that's more famous for Ski Doo water craft, snow mobiles and commercial regional jets.  The Indians are so proud of this new modern mode of conveyance, that they have set up a museum at the Patel Chowk Metro station.  This museum showcases the genesis of this monumental project.   India's first modern public transportation system has revolutionized travel by providing a fast, reliable, safe and comfortable means of transport in a city that has been characterized by rickety vehicles including tuk tuks, taxis and unreliable buses.  This was a fun experience."

Its affordable and easy to get around once you know where you going.. we had to ask for a bit of help but it's expected.... Everyone is on the go and on a mission in terms of atmosphere... The waiting period is not long. There are police in every station. The metro is clean and people follow the rules of the metro. There are even designated seats just for ""ladies"" which I found to be cool...there are numbers and signs to call in case of an emergency... It safe and I didn't feel threat. I recommend everyone to use it. "
Delhi_Metro,ROBIN M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 â€¢ Solo,Convenient way to travel through Delhi NCR,Delhi metro is quite well maintained and evolving every year to connect more and more places in and around Delhi NCR. Very convenient to travel and less stressful than driving around at peek times in car. Though I should mention in peak times and in some routes the metro can get really really crowded. Beaware of get pick pocketed in and around crowded metro stations. Pick pocketing is not very common though but its good to be alert. Having a Delhi Metro App downloaded can help navigate between stations and places and can give you an estimate of the charges. Having a delhi metro card is the easiest way to travel quickly and costs only 100/- and can be recharged online or via kiosks in most delhi metro stations. 
Delhi_Metro,Dr P K Mehrotra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 â€¢ Solo,Lifeline of Delhi,"The metro network of Delhi has expanded in past few years and more routes are being added.

Fare is very reasonable."
Delhi_Metro,rapha_y_nici,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 â€¢ Couples,Good network,"The metro in Delhi is clean, runs very frequently and has good combination points and walkways. A lot of sights which are interesting for tourists can be visited by metro without the pain of bargaining for taxi or tuktuk. Nevertheless, depending on the location, tuktuk can be also very efficient and an interesting to explore the areas. But good and well maintained network, difinitely recommended to use it at least once."
Delhi_Metro,Niraj S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Best metro system in the world,"Delhi metro covers all the attractions in Delhi. Hence you donâ€™t have to spend money in cabs. I was here in mid December with my mom so it was easy to travel around Delhi with her. There is one day and three day pass for tourist. One day pass cost Indian rupees 150 which is best offer if you are traveling throughout the day to various locations. DONT GO FOR TOKENS GET THE METRO CARD. The problem with token is that you need to stay in line at every station which can be bit annoying. Further you need to have change every time which can be irritating while your are traveling. So get the card you need have a minimum balance of INR 200. You can easily get the card in every metro station. The vending machine at the station can be slightly difficult to top up so you may  choose to top up from a metro staff.  The metro stations in Delhi are very huge so always look for signs to make a proper exit. Download the metro app which makes it so much easier the app shows the fare, number of stops and switches. At every switch there are footsteps on the floor matching the color of the metro line for example violet color foot steps fro violet line navigating your direction to the various metro line. Thank you Delhi metro for making my stay in Delhi pleasurable. "

Delhi_Metro,akashdhiman,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 â€¢ Family,Like any other Metro !,"The Delhi Metro is like any other metro in any of the world cities. However there are few points to take care of...the first coach is ladies only and gents should avoid it all costs, inspite of this there are again reserved seats in other coaches as well for ladies...this should not be the case. Then there are reserved seats for disabled and senior citizens which is fine and should be there. Some routes have terrible rush in the metros and you won't get to sit if its peak office hour so plan your journey accordingly. Also please keep in mind that you have to walk a lot on line interchange stations."
