Dilli_Haat,podrozniczka60,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,"vibrant , colorful market","The visit to this market was recommended to us by a local person. We took Uber from our hotel ready to explore. There is an entrance fee one has to pay to enter, higher for foreigners. The market is fenced in and perhaps safer that way than an open street. It is truly impressive, colorful and vibrant. Excellent shopping but some pressure and the need to bargain are still a part of reality here. Beautiful dresses, pashminas, bags, jewelry, souvenirs etc. There are also many restaurants with Indian cuisine.This is a shopping mecca of Delhi but even if you just want to explore this colorful destination is a worthy attraction for most."
Dilli_Haat,Rajesh Kumar Singh,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Fake delhi haat,"Delhi Haat Lotus Mall is fake and I was cheated today. My taxi driver from Bharat tour and travel took us there. When we checked the products, there was no price tag on any item, no bill inside as said and all products different from what was shown. There is no contact number anywhere available nor location shown on Google map. Even my taxi operator stopped attending my call. It seems all are party of this fraud. Just I saw the reviews of being cheated and feel disappointed. I shall go tomorrow to see if something can be done."
Dilli_Haat,JastiGrl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Solo,Pleasant shopping & windows shopping experience!,"You pay a small fee to enter and you have various booths and shops from different collectives and artisans. Prices are higher at many stalls but I think it’s worth it. Its an enclosed area so you’re not among street traffic and noise. It’s cool to be able to “meet the maker” and see people actively making the items to purchase. There are small businesses and artisans selling things from woolen hats, artsy purses, accessories, soaps, art, you name it. I bought a warm hat (it was freezing!), some hair pins, hair oil, books, and painted bookmarks. I enjoyed just looking at things too! If you go - do stop by the tribals store. They have shops all over India that sell handicrafts from different tribal groups fair trade. Beautiful items and they always have a sale! From here I bought some nice kurta tops and a black sand teapot set (that I saw at the airport for 4X the price). Salespeople are friendly and super helpful. Food stalls are all in one location selling cuisine from all over India. I enjoyed my momos but you can almost anything here."
Dilli_Haat,2kl4scl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,An excellent shopping experience and venue,"This is an excellent place to buy QUALITY souvenirs and handicrafts in India.  It is a safe and contained setting, the vendors are very pleasant, and there are great places to have a snack/eat a meal.  I really wish I had spent more time here and purchased more gifts--I didn't find another place quite like it in the 2.5 weeks we were in India."
Dilli_Haat,Indiestar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Must Do Shopping in Delhi,"If you’re visiting Delhi and want to buy lovely souvenirs or gifts, don’t do it anywhere else but here at Delhi Haat. Beautiful handicrafts from true artisans in an enclosed, clean, safe and fun environment. The food stalls are terrific and the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend spending half a day here - there’s something for everyone (locals and tourists alike)."
Dilli_Haat,PANDEY JI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Wow!,"I loved the place. Full of handicraft stores ranging from footwear, sarees, metalcrafts, paintings and what not.Tonnes of food stalls."
Dilli_Haat,Ted P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,Recommended Stop,"Wonderful evening visit. Went with a local friend (both of us 50+ white males) and had a peaceful time visiting stalls and talking to vendors. Did not eat, but enjoyed the music, aromas and vibe. Would highly recommend to out of town visitors. Somewhat fixed price, broad selection, wonderful vibe."
Dilli_Haat,Rahul2604,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,"Handicrafts,hand looms and food","Place to visit for handicrafts and handlooms ,can found from all over India,also food from different states,good hangout place with friends with shopping and food.If looks price inflated do bargain.Maintenance and cleanliness has deteriorated in recent months,authorities should look at this."
Dilli_Haat,JOYLIN19,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Shopping+ Food,"Entry ticket for around 30 bucks! Amazing handicrafts here, from puppets to carpets, bags, clothes, variety of earrings, shoes,etc you have these state wise restaurants here. You could eat authentic food."
Dilli_Haat,Fran-Svk,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,it's ok,"so i have tried it this morning. but next time must come after lunch. make almost no sense to visit it earlier. i came at 10:30, when it is open, and most of stalls were close. anyway come here and buy some tiny items for home. btw as foreigner you must pay 100R (locals pay 30). and entry is just next to metro station."
Dilli_Haat,charles b,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,"NO mango festival this year, empty stalls",Don’t come if you’re expecting mangos.  you will pay 20 rupees to see only EMPTY stalls.  There was No announcement on this and all the news websites are misleading.
Dilli_Haat,Kanira1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Couples,Foods and shopping,A place where you can get foods from every state of India (litti Choka) from Bihar was my favorite and guess what this is one of best place to do shopping in Delhi too .
Dilli_Haat,Kathryn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Solo,Good for an afternoon browsing for gifts,"Great market, quieter than others and a good selection of handcrafts, opportunity to meet the artisans and watch them work.  Some factory made stuff, but relaxed vibe."
Dilli_Haat,FloridaPmb,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Friends,Foreigners Beware of dishonest worker who tries to rip you off!,Beware of woman at ticket entrance! We paid our entrance fee and they gave us an old banned bill for change.  You’ll know because it’s much larger than the others. We told her to give us the correct bill and she did. I told her she needs to be honest- had to scold her a bit. I’m from the USA and she was taking advantage of that. This made me wary of the workers inside. I did buy a few things but getting taken advantage of at the beginning put a damper on the visit. I would not recommend for this reason.
Dilli_Haat,sushil_11,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Family,A must to eat at dilli haat,Naga restaurant has great double fried pork ribs - the best I hv had. Great helpful staff and excellent.Also the best authentic pure silver jewellery in a variety of traditional and modern designs
Dilli_Haat,MedhaviG,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,"Nice set up, but be prepared to pay a premium","Lots of great crafts and national fabrics and clothing available. However, the prices are at least double or triple of what you can find in other markets. Similar items can be found in Lajpat Nagar markets or Old Delhi area. "
Dilli_Haat,Anita M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Excellent one stop shopping for souveniers - they have elephant pants!,"I wish we had stopped here the first day of our trip as they have every souvenir you could possibly look for in India at good prices. One store just inside the entrance, to the right, up some small steps, had every color elephant pants you could imagine. We had searched for those pants for my daughters friends every stop on our tour of N. India. A waste of time and stressful considering this place had it all. If you start and end in Dehli I would ask if the hotel could hold a small bag with the souvenirs you purchase so you can pick them up on the way back home."
Dilli_Haat,Vipul Agarwal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,"Eat, shop, roam around, relax!","Adjacent to INA metro station, this is one of the oldest tourist place of Delhi. Being a Delhite, I've known people to just go around here with friends and have a good time before the concept of malls were even born. The place is divided in stalls from different states of India, marketing the speciality of their states. The diversity and versatility of this place is its biggest strength. Though, being more of a tourist place, the items comes with a high cost, more than that what you pay in local market, but the variety of products, their authenticity and everything under one roof (or rather no roof since its an open market) makes it a worthwhile experience. Same goes with the food. It has variety of food from different states, and though you might not get the exact same taste what you get in the native place, the recipe and cook being from there is a consolation of sorts. The prices of food may be higer than local market prices but its way less than the trendy food chains and high class restaurants. Also, it has a nominal entry fee (Rs 30 for an adult) before you can experience all the bliss. Must go place for a local and tourist alike (at least for once)."
Dilli_Haat,SRKTB,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,bazaar,craft market & open air food plaza located in South Delhi opposite to INA market. Plenty of cheap products
Dilli_Haat,shanu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2020,Dilli Haat is an pleasent place,"Very good place for shopping especially ladies' jewelry and small items. The place is full of tradition and artistic things. Most of the things such as earrings are handmade by artisans. If you in Delhi, Do pay a visit to Dilli Haat. (Nearby Metro Station is INA on Yellow line and Pink Line)."
Dilli_Haat,Akanksha C,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A versatile experience but no good place to eat,"a good place full of life. i went there to check out the teej celebrations. its open on the weekends. lot of good shops where you can buy handicrafts, handloom apparel, marble and wooden show pcs for your home and many other such things. no doubt i enjoyed shopping here the vendors charge a bit high rates but the vibe is awesome on special occasions there are dance performances etc cultural programmes going on, tarot card readers, palmists etc but sadly there are no good restaurants at all. a handful of food stalls where the food is sub standard and hygiene doubtful so i guess after exploring this place its best to head somewhere else for a meal ! also i would add washroom facilities arent good so yeah thats another minus point. but connectivity is superb its right next to metro station. there is an entry ticket line and foreigners are charged rs 100 while indians are charged rs 10."
Dilli_Haat,Samantha H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2020 • Couples,Another fantastic meal !,"Yet another fantastic takeaway meal. Food was on time, hot...and DELICIOUS!! This Indian has never failed to deliver quality !"
Dilli_Haat,Debashis T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,All states comes to one place,Dilli Haat is an open air craft bazar cum food court by Delhi Tourism. It has paid entry with Rs.30/- for adult. Inside the haat handicraft of almost all states and the foods from these states are on sale. Along with these at places folk songs and dance of specific states are going on. Though the foods are not very high price but the handicrafts are very high price.
Dilli_Haat,Nigel G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,A market for all of India’s crafts and art,Eclectic mix of handicrafts from each state in India. You must pay to get in and foreigners pay well over what Indians pay. Careful when you buy your ticket because last year I was given less change so best go prepared with correct amount. So much to buy. So many pieces of clothing providing you can bargain the prices down. I like the Himalayan clothing which is nice and warm.Good selection of native restaurants with state by state food. Have fined here previously without adverse outcome. Artwork and handicrafts are stunning and not so expensive if you bargain. Great market place within walls so no beggars etc. 
Dilli_Haat,sawhneysaab,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Touristy,Nothing really great about the place. You can visit if you wish to explore the cuisines of various states in India.
Dilli_Haat,Jazzie,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,botched henna and expensive goods,I knew it was a tourist trap but was willing to pay more for some good quality work. My only regret was to go to a lady who charged me 300rp for a botched henna which looked like a kid's drawing. The makeshift stands right outside Dilli Haat's entrance were selling prettier and cheaper accessories.
Dilli_Haat,frankieisacat,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Give it a skip- save your money and time. ,You pay $100IRN as a foreigner to enter. There’s nothing special- same shops as outside in other markets/bazaars.Save your money and shop elsewhere. Rug/carpet store located to the left of the entrance- when I first entered was quoted $4000INR for a rug (crazy $$$). Came back 1 hour later to the same shop lady and price shot up to $4500INR?! She said a story how she gave me “morning good luck price”. Good try- so rude. 
Dilli_Haat,Badasaab,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Gone to seed,A ruin of its true self. This place which encouraged artisans is now a roadside market selling clothes and imitation jewellery at 5 times the market price. Just a farce. Go if you like being swindled. The food outlets are still ok. 
Dilli_Haat,gemlovestotravel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Lovely relaxing shopping experience,"Loved Dilli Haat. The feel of the place is relaxed and although the sellers are calling for you to buy their wares, they are not pushy and you can haggle or you can just walk away.You will pay more here than at the red fort market and obviously more than say Paharganj bazar or Chandni Chowk but it is definitely worth the trip.The food court is good too."
Dilli_Haat,Armonjoy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Curated outdoor market with great assortment, good prices","Really enjoyed this market. Run by the state, vendors have to compete to get a booth.  Nice assortment of fine art, clothing, jewelry, handcrafts, food and fun."

Dilli_Haat,S B Khare,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Amazing place - a must visit,"I live in Delhi and I have always loved going to Dilli Haat which I do often. Whenever I go abroad and I want to bring some gifts for my foreign friends, Dilli Haat is the place to go. These days the Dastkari Haat Samiti exhibition is going on with the Craftsmen displaying their wares. This place is complete with lot of eateries as well therefore if you have stamina you can spend a whole day there. Winters are the best time to visit. In addition to handicrafts, ethnic wear and other items, there is always some cultural program is going on in the Haat. It is really worthwhile to visit the place especially when the entrance fee is so low."
Dilli_Haat,Caroline H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Beautiful handcraft but too expensive ,The place was clean and safe. Food was good. Entre fee was 100 rupees. But all the pricing was too expensive. I mean a scarf for 6.000 rupee is just too much. 
Dilli_Haat,Alana G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Great marker,"This is a lovely market to visit for shopping and eating in Delhi. The market is not super crowded like you’d find in the bazaars throughout the city. It’s great for buying leather bags, pashmina, Kashmir or jewellery. You can barter and can get some good steals. "
Dilli_Haat,Abhishek Mehra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Delhi’s Culture Heart ,Delhi’s heart is Dilli Haat .A perfect blend of culture with no barriers.Entry Rs.30 for Indians .Timings 11am-9 pm varies on special days .A lot of traditional food options.Nagaland Kitchen my favourite for the aura n sitting n music .You will love the variety of traditional states  clothes items you can get here .You need to bargain a lot .A perfect place for leather bags around .A wonderful experience but needs to be maintained more ..as it use to be better earlier so 4/5.#Finishyourplatefirst #musaafir_mehra 
Dilli_Haat,Stuart Allen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Convenient and structured,"Haggle, don't trust everyone but don't mistrust either, and get a fair deal. Don't mistrust the food stands, the Awadhi place is tasty, clean and cheap. "

Dilli_Haat,ghoomboom,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,A perennial handicrafts market in Delhi,"Very close to INA Metro station, Dilli Haat is a permanent Indian handicrafts market though shops keep changing.  Handicrafts items of almost all states of India can be found here and when we visited, there were some shops from outside India also like Thailand etc. Also, Food stalls from almost all states in the food area so if you want to try cuisine of different Indian States, you can have it here. Notable items are Madhubani paintings from Bihar, Pashmina shawls from Kashmir and some bamboo items from North Eastern states. Just go and enjoy handicrafts shopping and food from different parts of India"
Dilli_Haat,MansourQabandi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Worth a visit,"If your looking for shals, scarves, pashminas, hand crafts, this is the place you wanna visit. Sellers from all over India present their products at this place. I especially come here for Kashmiri products."
Dilli_Haat,Lynette Q,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Quite a good market but is very clothing orientated.,Nice place to walk around great atmosphere.  Alot of clothes Sari for sale.  But managed to pick up a couple of presents some home made jewellery at a good price.  Worth a walk around.
Dilli_Haat,Jajabor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Must Visit,It's one of must visit for people visiting the capital city of India. Foods of different states of India are available. It's good to buy local souvenirs and artisans products. 
Dilli_Haat,Ellemay 🍹🐠🐳,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Shopping market 🛍,"We dropped into Dilli Haat to see the local products on sale from different regions from India. There is an entrance fee of 100R for tourists. Evidently, it was Tourist Day when we arrived but I’m unsure what the day was about. We arrived early so maybe there were cultural events happening throughout the day. The good thing about the market is it’s clean & very easy to walk around without getting hassled to buy something. Although there were heaps of stalls selling products nothing really caught my eye, so I left empty handed. "
Dilli_Haat,JaniJermans,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Shopping destination,"This is a very good initiative by the local govt where for a very minimal price local artisans are given space to sell their products for 15 days and it goes on rotation. So you might always find new artisans and also you won't be able to go and buy more if you like something as every 15 days they change. Heard that usually each one is there from 1-15th of the month and 2nd batch is from 16th to 30th. So it's always recommended not to go on the first date as usually the artisans unpacking on the first day so it would be difficult to see more options. Try to make it after 2-3 days, that helps. Also it has restaurants in various state food themes of India. I am sure even a non shopholic like me ended up picking up stuffs as these are local and unique. Happy shopping...."
Dilli_Haat,Shobha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,Amazing market with huge options,It’s one of the best market I have visited in my life . There are lots of varieties of products from different states . Food is also good with lots of varieties .
Dilli_Haat,Sanjeev Takyar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Nice winter outing,"Diili haat is now very well connected with metro, in case you want to avoid parking hassles, haat is full of handloom stuff, furniture, antique shops and bargain shopping is quite visible, artisans from all over India display their traditional materials, the state restaurants offer good good at cheap prices and that is a very big attraction for one and all, we have tried most of them, Maharashtra and Sikkim stand out best, one point, we always go in winter months as summer could be harsh in open area and stroll."
Dilli_Haat,8ofus2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Great fun at Dilli Haat,I went in the middle of the day in the middle of the week when very few people were there.  It was fun.  Everything is priced right and negotiable.  The sellers were nice and had a playful attitude about bargaining.
Dilli_Haat,Beth Braun,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Wonderful,"This is a beautiful market to look around. It’s calm and quiet, compared to the chaos beyond its gates. You can shop in peace, and chat casually to the sellers as they are not too pushy.I bought a few nicknacks and had a henna tattoo done. You do have to barter though, or you will get ripped right off. Was quite shocked that after I’d paid 900R for some bangles (bargained from the 1500R he was trying to charge me), I found more of the same elsewhere for less than half that."
Dilli_Haat,Iqbal M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Solo,nice,dilli haat is one of my favouriteplacein delhi .this is my first visit in delhi and i loved it i come delhi haat for shopping and i loved it
Dilli_Haat,alpana254,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Solo,Good time,"I quite liked the place. Enterance tkt helps filtering the crowd. Little bit of bargain also possible!Variety of things from all over the state with reasonable price adds up the attraction. Its hot but fruit beer and pakoda ice cream from motherdiary can beat the heat!! If in Delhi , recommend one round to the place!"
Dilli_Haat,curious_and.curiouser,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Too hot!,"Dilli Haat is the kind of place that is entirely set up for tourists. While it offers a one-stop showcase of goods and food from different parts of India, prices here are definitely more costly and I question the need to charge an entrance fee. We visited in the afternoon of a hot summer's day and the heat was unbearable as none of the shops and eateries had AC. For the same kind of merchandise and open-air shopping, I much prefer and recommend Janpanth Market."
Dilli_Haat,Maha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,amazing Indian staff,"I full in love with that open market which fulls with all Indian producers. the accessories, bags, clothes, souvenirs, scarfs and all handmade pieces attracted me.

Having a local with me, she was able to bargain and tell me more about the goods etc and I even purchased a few items that are a must in every girls wardrobe that weren’t a sari :) I was able to pick up different gifts for friends and family. The stores rotate every 15 days so you will always get something new. Some stores do have the same. A suggestion is write down the number of the store and the price that they told you as the prices do differ across the market. "
Dilli_Haat,MedhaviG,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,"Nice set up, but be prepared to pay a premium","Lots of great crafts and national fabrics and clothing available.

There is parking available and there is a nominal entry fee. Toilets are available inside the place. There is a small kiosk near the entrance from where you can buy old All India Radio recordings.

Dilli_Haat,Shubhadeep Roy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,A must visit place if you haven't been here,"Run by Delhi Tourism and with a paid entrance, this is a nice hang-out place. There are food and crafts pavilions from all states, so you get a feel of the rich Indian culture and tradition at one place. You can get to try food from all parts of India. The food may not be as good as you would get them locally in the individual states but it gives you a fair idea of what each state food tastes like. Some states also present their folk music and dance at various times. I have been there multiple times and have always loved the feel and the ambiance."

I was travelling solo and wanted to do some shopping, have great food and spend some quality time alone on a Saturday afternoon.Dilli Haat has stalls / shops that sells junk jewellery, pearls, bags, shoes, Indian wear and decor items. They have stalls representing different states of India. Assamese Sarees, Chikankaari, Pashminas; you will find it here on a very affordable price and you can bargain as well. Apart of shopping there are restaurants for every state. I had some nice Sattu paratha from their Bihar eatery. Rates are affordable. As most stalls and stores have a roof and shade it's easy to shop and spend time in Delhi heat. "

Dilli_Haat,unordinary_traveller,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Overpriced Tourist Trap - Your Moneys Better Spent Elsewhere,"Don’t waste you time, especially if your a foreigner. After you pay the 100INR entrance fee (albeit Indians also pay 30INR) you will then be confronted with the most overpriced art and crafts anywhere in India, with the vendors knowing that they just don’t have to negotiate with you as another foreigner will be along shortly to pay their ridiculous prices.But actually I did buy a painting, but only after watching an Indian buy basically the same thing first and seeing how much he handed over. I then simply said the last person paid ‘this amount’ and finally a reasonable price was obtained, to which he smiled knowingly, which was more than half of his original offer when I first asked. "
Dilli_Haat,Siladitya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,A shoppers Paradise,"For earthy home decors to dress materials to anything natural, Dilli Haat, opposite INA market is highly recommended.

Dilli_Haat,Damrassi K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,No crowded shopping.,"This place is good and easy to reach by metro. We get down at Patel Chowk (if I do not remember it wrong). And Dilli Haat is just about within 50 meters from where we exit the station. The market is packed with handicraft, arts, cloth products and good food from all over India. There are both expensive items and things with reasonable price. I got many Indian Kurtis from the shop called Tribes India. They sell good clothes with reasonable. They do not allow to bargain and I agree with that since their products are nice and cheap already. There is entry fee for RS 200 for foreigners. The food there is also very good, tasty and cheap. There are many things to choose. We enjoyed our shopping there "
Dilli_Haat,Romini1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,My favourite,"If you are in Delhi, you can't miss visiting this place at least once. This is your one-stop to get a flavour and taste of India. They change the exhibits every few weeks, so the stalls differ every time, but the food ones are generally the same - which are all great. Do not miss the authentic regional fare from Kashmir (Wazwan), Bengal, Hyderabad etc - all lip smacking delicacies. We end up going manya times for just the food! You can buy a lot of traditional handicrafts, clothes, artisan products, and gift items - there's something for everyone here.   "
Dilli_Haat,Jane H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,A must to visit,"To enter this market there is a small cost but it’s well worth it. There was a huge selection of Indian crafts and clothes wear, gifts, spices. I was particularly after pashminas ( scarves) and was utterly spoilt for choice. Prices  were very reasonable (with a bit of haggling which is expected). Also managed to buy spices there which could be smelt, sampled. If bought they were available in sealed packages for travelling. Really worth a visit."
Dilli_Haat,Nidhi Gupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,the place is a good move to promote regional art and artist.,"A place that can be visited again and again. the place is a good move to promote regional art and artist. its bridging the gap between rural and urban. Also, the place is good for exposure towards foods of different states of Delhi. the most popular foods of dilli haat are momos and fruit beer."
Dilli_Haat,Ali Vaseghnia,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Overpriced ,So you basically pay an entrance fee to enter a touristy market where everything is overpriced. Doesn’t make sense to me. 
Dilli_Haat,Nipa,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Overpriced! RIPOFF!,"We bought sari's and scarfs from here and the quality was terrible! VISIT but DO NOT BUY.  RIPOFF. They were supposed to press and send the saris to our hotel and they sent them in terrible condition.  So beware. I understand that this is a tourist place so it will be little pricey but the service, quality and cost were too much and you will be able to find the similar items at 50% less price."
Dilli_Haat,Kanica M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Mini India,Best place to get a glimpse of the Indian culture and cuisine. Entry ticket is only 20₹.You can find here authentic food of all the states of India. PS- You can bargain here while shopping.
Dilli_Haat,SandeepSaha1967,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,A place on every vistor's schedule,"I don't know whether it is good or bad. The must do places of Delhi for tourists used to be the The Red Fort, The Qutub Minar and The Lotus Temple. Now it is Select City Walk, Hauz Khas Village and Dilli Haat.Everyone loves shopping. Ethnic wear and gifts are cool. Add to it clean spaces to walk around in without bumping into people, you have a different Indian experience. Not to mention the mind-boggling variety of food from all parts of India.The entry fee is a filter for only the serious shoppers and so are the prices. Still, I have not found any tourists who is dissatisfied with his/her purchases. As for the locals like me, it's a different story. I would go to Chandni Chowk and Lajpat Nagar any day for the trill of surprises."
Dilli_Haat,MiraGB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Great local shopping ,"Loved shopping at Dilli Haat for local products representing many Indian locations. Good fabric choices, albeit a bit overwhelming and confusing at times. Lots of local Indian women buying fabric for sarees and “three-piece suits”, many of whom were happy to offer me advice on where to look for block-print cotton fabric. Shopping tip:  I purchased nice block-print cotton fabric as a gift for my seamstress niece from Sandeep Shukla at Has Creation. I didn’t get his stall number, but he was located close to the entrance. "

Dilli_Haat,Marg,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,not worth the entrance fee  and haggling is not my thing!,"this is the first time my family and i visited this place. the driver said the entrance fee will be about INR 20/- but we got a surprise when the sign said Foreigners INR 200/- !!!!???we were in two minds to enter but everybody speaks about this place, so we paid the INR 200/- per person and got in. The shops were just opening up. what we saw was nice but prices very high. the shop keepers do rip off us foreigners and if you don't know what you would normally pay for an item, you are stumped. i hate haggling, but i did for an item I bought there.  i'm sure could have got it cheaper elsewhere.  anyway, it was the first time here, so took a look around and left. i don't see why foreigners have to pay much more than the locals. the locals know what price to pay and will get things cheaper than us foreigners will, so why should we pay more for entry ?? that goes for everything else, sites, monuments are extremely high for foreigners but we don't get any privileges for the price we pay. Disgusted how we are treated, even though we pay more in EVERYTHING,  we get nothing to compensate for the high prices we pay."
Dilli_Haat,Nins,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Haggle to get the best!!,"Visited this place on Taxi guys recommendation as we were very near to the market. Dilli Haat has a different design, common features of each are handicraft stalls that host artisans on a rotational basis, some permanent shops, and a food court serving cuisine from all over in India. Too tempting….. Popular items to shop include bags, cushion covers, embroidered and woven fabrics, wood carvings, shoes, carpets and rugs, saris and other ethnic wear, leather items, jewelry, and paintings. Haggling is most important to get a good price."
Dilli_Haat,GoWrong,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Mini India,So colorful and so beautiful. There are art works from all the states of the country. There are even food stalls from various states of the country. Spending a winter afternoon in Dilli Haat is one of the best things you can do in Delhi. Chatting with friends while sipping Kashmiri Qahwa while folk music is playing in the background. . Add to it some or the other event or performance happening here. Heavvenly !

Dilli_Haat,rohanpillai1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Great place,"There are different shops representing the different states of India. Although, they say that they are selling regional items, all items from all the shops looked the same to me. Yet, the place is neat and clean so it is a better experience than visiting local markets. There is a food court with the same concept of different stalls representing different states' cuisine. The place is definitely worth visiting."
Dilli_Haat,travelalot,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Very pleasant,"It took three attempts to get to Dilli Haat as the first two attempts resulted in the taxi /tuctuc dropping me at a shopping emporium that was not where I was trying to get to - taxi drivers have their favourite spots to take tourists to and I am convinced they phone ahead and get rewarded for dropping off tourists. A tourist is fair game in New Delhi and NEVER trust the advice of a friendly and smiling driver.I eventually went by Metro (separate review) and after paying the 100 rupees entry (locals pay 30 - common in India) I wandered through the stalls and sampled food at various eateries.There was a constant barrage of invitations to check out the merchandise at each stall which you need to tune out from (even to the point of being rude at times) and when you eventually begin to haggle aim for less than 50% of the opening demand for any item you are looking at. As one local explained they enjoy the haggle. By the end of the day I was tired of haggling and paid the small asking price for a handcraft item, the vendor nearly seemed disappointed and unsolicited threw in another item when I handed over the requested 500 rupees.The entry fee keeps most of the street vendors out and makes this a very pleasant area to stroll and enjoy for a couple of hours. Stalls take credit cards but I prefered to use cash and divided my cash across a number of pockets to assis in the haggling process - this is all I have left!!!"
Dilli_Haat,Manish T,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Don’t Waste Your Time Here,"This place has goods that are way OVERPRICED(many times what you can find elsewhere).  Plus, one vendor sold me a damaged piece of art(I had selected an undamaged one, but when he wrapped it - he gave me the damaged one - he pulled a sleight of hand trick).  Some of the goods here are of ok/good quality, but many things here I found to be of low quality - for instance, some of the paintings seemed like a child had painted them.  This is basically a place to defraud foreign tourists.  If you don’t believe me, there are videos on youtube that will tell you the same thing."
Dilli_Haat,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,A mini-India; remember to bargain,"Dilli Haat (Haat means market) was established by the Government of India to make people aware of the wide diversity of cultures in the country and the sheer scale of products produced in the different states. Initially having 1 center next to INA market, now there is a 2nd center at Pitampura in West Delhi as well. This review is of the first center.Dilli Haat has pavilions and stores selling produce belonging to various states, as well as restaurants offering food items native to some of the distant and remote parts of the country. The items are priced quite high and one should bargain heavily to get a good deal. At times, there are also cultural performances here.Nowadays, however, Dilli Haat has lost much of its novelty factor with the advent of e-commerce as well as newer and bigger venues such as Shilparamam in Hyderabad. The place is worth visiting for about 1-2 hours and primarily one should look to come here to sample the cuisine of other parts of the country, where one may not have visited."
Dilli_Haat,Brett F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,A local cooperative market.,"A pleasant market area and restaurants, handy in the city, not as crowded (when we were there).

Dilli_Haat,lotusdiamond,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Awesome collection of handlooms and handicraft,This place is located in the heart of Delhi near INA market and METRO train station. You need to buy ticket to visit inside. Parking is also available. Very colorful and bright place. Nicely decorated as per theme. You can buy all varieties of handicraft and hand looms. Prices quoted are on  higher side and you need to bargain a lot. Don't forget to negotiate. Very well maintained place and well organised. You can also  enjoy food of different Indian states at various food stalls. You can also do photography for capturing memories of this place. A great place for family outings.  Good place for tourists and for buying souvenirs. Must visit place.
Dilli_Haat,divertliving,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Stress free shopping and eating,This place is great for travelers and families. With its nice clean location and perfectly situated next to the subway you cant get a better place to do some shopping in Delhi. The vendors are very nice and not pushy at all. The only thing i would look out for is the prices of the accessories are very high compared to the rest of Delhi. They are trying to charge 400INR in the market when you can get it for 20INR outside. Other than that and the 100INR entrance fee its a great place to relax.
Dilli_Haat,Maneesh2700,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,The sheen is maintained,"Dilli Haat has been successfully able to maintain its sheen over the period of time. The variety of food items, the collection of shoppable items and the spirit of celebration has been maintained very well ... when you feel like seeing numerous things under one roof, go Dilli Haat"
Dilli_Haat,Jen Mackenzie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Loved this place,"We really enjoyed our visit to Dilli Haat - admittedly it’s a tourist market but it’s good shopping for presents or souvenirs. Everyone was really friendly and we had great fun bartering with stall holders. We went in the early evening and it was quite quiet - probably easier to get a bargain?You pay 100R to get in - there are lots of clothing/stalls selling everything from beautiful pashminas to cashmere blankets and woven bedspreads. Also there are lots of stalls selling jewellery, wooden crafts, sweets, tea, spices. There are several cafes and restaurants which looked good too. Different experience to Chandni Chowk - where we didn’t see any tourists but didn’t see anything we would buy either. "
Dilli_Haat,A_NIELSEN_987,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Fun family visit,There is an entrance fee but if you are a tourist to India you should not mind it. If you are from a place where shopping stalls are not common and you are ok with a little friendly bargaining (pls dont go if you are looking to be cut throat and get the lowest price possible) this is a nice market due to the sheer variety all in one place. Yes - You can find cheaper prices elsewhere but nowhere else did we find this same variety of goods all in a relatively compact and safe environment. So if you are limited on time go and check it out!
