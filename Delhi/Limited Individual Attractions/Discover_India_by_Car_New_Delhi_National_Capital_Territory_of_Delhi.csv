Discover_India_by_Car,Bob O2,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,Golden Triangle Tour I can recommend India by Car as a reliable and honest tour operator.,Wow. What an experience with India by Car. We were late booking and only had limited free time in India. We organised a 3 day tour or the Golden Triangle and everything was great.Because we are two big guys we upgraded the car to accommodate us. The driver picked us up promptly at 9am on the first day and then met the guide and done a full day tour of Delhi.Late in the afternoon we left for Agra and the guide met us at the hotel that night and we went thru what we wanted to see and what time to see the Taj because of the weather. We saw everything that we wanted and was impressed with the knowledge of the history of the area of the guide. Again the lunch stop was clean and the food was great.  We left forJapour late in the afternoonIn Jaipur we met our guide at the first attraction and had a full day with him. Again he was a University lecturer and knew all the history of the city. We left for the trip back to Delhi that afternoon. All drivers knew where there was clean toilets and refreshment stops along the way.I can recommend India by Car as an honest and reliable tour operator when in India.Sugar kept in contact every day to make sure everything was going well. We organised our own hotels.CheersBob from Australia

It was an enjoyable experience. Haven't personally met with Ankit, but he did regular checks on our trip to make sure everything went smoothly.

Sushil was the driver and he was with us all 5 days.  Sushil was very professional and can speak in multiple languages including English.

He arranged for guides promptly and gave us good tips on shopping, safe places to eat, how to be careful at certain locations etc.. The van was cleaned every day and he would come to our hotel on time everyday. I would highly recommend both this company and Sushil as the driver."
Discover_India_by_Car,Matt M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Golden Triangle Safe & Sound in a Single Day,"In three trips to India over the span of two decades, I have never had a better experience than Ankit's Discover India by Car. We had an ambitious itinerary for our arrival in India, navigating the entire Golden Triangle in a single day with a pickup in Delhi, a sightseeing stopover at the Taj Mahal, and a dropoff in Jaipur. Ankit went out of his way to ensure that our arrival was smooth and seamless, providing us with water, amenities and excellent company on our adventure. I was very impressed by his courtesy, professionalism and attention to detail. He went out of his way to ensure we felt comfortable parting his company to see the Taj Mahal, helping us purchase tickets online and giving us detailed instructions to avoid touts and ensure we found him easily following our visit. He gave us a great recommendation for a restaurant in Agra before hitting the road. We were exhausted from our international flights and felt completely comfortable napping in the backseat during the ride to Jaipur. Upon our waking, Ankit helped us find restrooms and an ATM, even helping us safely cross the busy roads to reach them. We were extremely grateful for his service upon our arrival and will undoubtedly recommend Discover India By Car to our friends who visit India!"

He was extremely communicative leading up to my booking and welcomed me at Delhi airport with a sign holding my name. We drove to Agra where he dropped me with very clear instructions at the shuttles that take tourists up to the Taj Mahal and even helped me buy entry tickets online. After my time at the Taj Mahal, Ankit was waiting for me where he dropped me and he drove me to a nice lunch spot in Agra before we continued on to Jaipur. He was extremely patient with my needs for multiple ATM visits and even a bathroom break. He is such a gentleman and I can not recommend his services more highly!"

Discover_India_by_Car,Dagi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Memorable Golden Triangle Tour with Discover India by Car,"We’ve made our 4 days / 3 nights trip from Delhi to Agra and Jaipur (""Golden Triangle"") with Discover India by Car, which we have chosen based on the great TripAdvisor rating. Our management summary: We can really confirm this top-notch rating!Everything went perfectly smooth: Starting with a quick response time to messages and an interesting, good timed travel itinerary provided by Ankit (""Sugar""). We booked a full service “don’t worry” package - including all entrance fees, a highly reliable driver and well-educated local guides for each city.Gautam was showing us Delhi, he took us on a memorable bike-rikscha ride through Old Delhi and it was nice that he also spoke some German. We’ve learned a lot about Delhi.With Vikram in Agra we were visiting beautiful Taj Mahal and Agra Fort. From the best angles he took awesome photos from us with our phones and gave us so much valuable information and details regarding monuments, architecture, handcraft and history. We could feel the passion for his hometown and the beauty of the sights.Ali showed us Fatehpur Sikri on the same day and did a great job too to complete the puzzle of history with another beautiful fort.Mr. BK is a guide-legend in Jaipur with 40 years of experience. At some time we asked him why he was greeted warmly by nearly all other guides we met in Jaipur. His answer: ""I have trained most of them"". So it was really fantastic and a pleasure to participate in his deep knowledge of Jaipur and its history. Last but not least: Our driver Mr. Prem did an awesome job. He is a very experienced and safe driver and was always on time. He was always very friendly, decent and trustworthy. The car has been clean and comfortable. As driving in India is following its own rules (good horn, good brakes, good luck), we felt that we can trust Mr. Prem to bring us safely everywhere.Discover India by Car - you’ve made an incredible job to make our trip to Northern India a most memorable one!"

Discover_India_by_Car,Billy H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Family,Amazing thank you so much,"I was a little hesitant when I booked this tour originally, it was relatively cheap in my country’s currency but sugar was super and helped get it organised. The trip was absolutely fantastic, but I wanted to highlight the key points that other travellers will be interested in… 1. Clean and comfortable car.2. Safe driving. 3. Great sightseeing. They organised tours, recommended restaurants etc. I hardly needed to think about a thing. 4. Very very good customer service. Our original driver was Sugar who met us at the airport. We were driven around Delhi, Agra and Jaipur for 5 days. During our trip and when we arrived in Agra, Sugar had to drive back to Delhi as his son was sick in hospital. Sugar arranged for Mr Prem to come and meet us in Agra. He was just as brilliant, and a very safe driver.We also booked tour guides throughout with Sugar. I would recommend doing this, as they will prevent you from being hassled and give you useful facts you’d otherwise miss. I’d recommend asking for the tour guides we used below. Even with the tips (I was doing 100%), they are very cheap. What I really want to say to all the hesitant bookers out there is, don’t be - this will be great! I’d like to make a special mention to the following…1. Sugar (driver)2. Mr Prem (replacement driver)3. Mr Ratan (tour in Agra)4. Mr Mehraj (tour of Fatehpur Sikri)5. Mr BK Pareek (tour in Jaipur) Ask for these people ^"

The car was very clean and the driver was very courteous and informative which made a long journey very enjoyable. The company went an extra mile to arrange Guides who could speak good Spanish in a short span of time which made visiting Taj and Fatehpurskiri a lifetime experience.

In that occasion, we put him some special bracelets his sisters gifted him: It was so emotional!! Everything was perfectly organised from the begging to the end. Even before leaving for India, we had a super efficient communication with the company and in a short time we’re able to arrange all the travel’s details. We had a great and special welcome as soon as we‘ve landed in Delhi: the company owner waited us directly in the airport and presented himself and our driver for the next days. Then we started our lovely tour: firstly, we did a sightseeing of Delhi - both historical monuments and markets - with a local guide. After few hours, we moved to Agra where we spent 2 nights to see the city, the Taj Mahal in a stunning sunrise view and the magnificent stop in Fathepur Sikri. We then moved for other 2 nights in Jaipur, 2 nights in Jodhpur and 1 night in Mandawa. Finally we got back to Delhi for our flight back to Italy. We always had local guides who showed us around a provided us with super useful information.Everything was great, thank you once again. I totally recommend them and I’ll come back again India for sure with them. :)"

Discover_India_by_Car,Alison,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Friends,100% recommend - amazing experience!,"We had a really wonderful experience with Discover India By Car. I traveled with two other people and we did a pretty long trip - a week through Rajasthan - and I am SO GLAD that we were with Manish. Traffic in India can take a little getting used to, and I always felt so safe and grateful to have such a skilled, calm driver. He was great about planning stops with clean bathrooms and delicious food, and generally ensured that our very ambitious travel itinerary was manageable and fun. The car was super comfortable and well-equipped (Manish always made sure we had cold water, hand sanitizer, tissues, etc), which was key to staying rested and ready for each day’s adventures. The guides organized by Sugar - Mehtaz, BK, and Mukesh - were also excellent! Very knowledgeable and friendly. We felt so lucky to have such wonderful people looking after us all week, and for a very reasonable rate. Would absolutely recommend them to anyone. Thank you, Sugar and Manish! You’re the best."

Discover_India_by_Car,Toorjo G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Incredible Experience,"If you're going to drive from Delhi through Rajasthan, do it only with Sugar, Manish (our driver), and Discover India by Car. Seriously. They are absolutely the best, with very reasonable rates. There were three of us - from the US and the UK (one guy and two women), and we visited Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, and Delhi. Sugar was extremely flexible with a very demanding schedule, accommodating multiple changes quickly and graciously. Manish was highly skilled, ensuring that we saw everything there was to see in the safest manner possible. He became a friend on the way, and we will have enduring memories of him and the drive. The guides organized by Sugar - Mehtaz, BK, and Mukesh - were extremely well-informed, personable, and explained everything in English. Manish took us to many memorable eating spots on the way. As an Indian introducing the country to my friends, I was very proud and glad to do this with Discover. Thanks Sugar and friends!"
Discover_India_by_Car,Fidu Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Wonderful Experience ,"Our recent holiday trip to India was fabulous. Discover India by Car did an enormous job at organising a very detailed and nice tour tailored for us to see the golden triangle (Delhi, Agra & Jaipur) and Taj Mahal. Everything went very well and we had a great time. The Itinerary was perfect but the people who implemented it were even better. Normally people are fond of creating complains for faults that happen to them from the tour agents but few will remember to thank those who work hard to make their vacation a success.We are especially grateful to Mr. Sugar for all of his arrangement and hospitality. Thank you very much for the fun and memorable trip we had in India. We felt very well cared for by all of your staff in India. We definitely recommend Discover India and will return shortly for another fantastic holiday."

Discover_India_by_Car,Brit H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Family,Wonderful 8 days driving the Golden Triangle and Ranthambhore National Park with Gulab💚🌍,"Gulab and Discover India by Car has been amazing from start to finish.  We are a family of 4 Americans on a gap year and well traveled. India was high on our list and it reopened at the right time with our schedule.  I was a bit stressed trying to plan logistics at the last minute and decided a private driver would be best. One of the best decisions we made on this trip.  We spent 8 days going around the golden triangle along with Ranthambhore National Park.  From the moment Gulab picked us up and every day he was professional, punctual, and patient.  He was always calm in any driving scenario which made our trip so much more enjoyable in the India ""chaos"" (which was so much better with a driver).  He figured out our preferences immediately which is an amazing gift. Truly I expected to be more stressed this leg, but the local people coupled with Gulab's calming disposition made it one of our highlights this year.  He was an amazing educational resource with our unending questions about the local culture, etc. We did not have an itinerary set in stone and he made so many great suggestions and stops.  The company has respectable guides in most places if you choose to go that route.  He helped us navigate every day tasks too.  I will recommend this company and Gulab to anyone who wants to explore India with some flexibility (like booking your own hotels/setting your own schedule).  If you read this review to the end,   you know you no longer have to research and book with this company of upstanding character.  Thank you Mr. Gulab and Discover India by Car!"

He gave the details of my driver and car in advance, which was helpful, but he also took the effort to met me at the airport and introduce me to Mr Manish, as well as giving me good safety tips for travelling alone in India. Mr Manish was very friendly and went to a lot of effort to make sure I was always comfortable and happy and had everything I needed. He really cared about making sure I had a good trip, and went out of his way to help me. He was a safe driver, and I felt safe with him as a solo traveller."

Nothing was too much trouble, he was very punctual and impeccably maintained his vehicle.  It was a pleasure to be driven round North India by him.  He provided advice when we asked which was very helpful.  It was also very comforting to know that we were being driven by someone with local knowledge, so we were given useful and helpful information about the places that we had selected to visit and our Itinerary.  We also felt safe and comfortable.  Sushil is excellent at his job and is very professional and pleasant.
