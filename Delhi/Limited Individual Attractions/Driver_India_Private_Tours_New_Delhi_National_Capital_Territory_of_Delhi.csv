Each driver spoke excellent english and made us feel very safe.Big shout out to Mahesh and Jeetu! Both were outstanding drivers. Jeetu was the most amazing driver in the crazy traffic of Agra and Jaipur. He was our own personal guide too (although Driver India Private Tours also recommended great and well priced private tour guides at any location we wanted)."

Driver_India_Private_Tours,EDNY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,""" EXCEPTIONAL & MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE ""","EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE! My best friend and I customized out 10 day trip to 5 cities by land. I highly recommend DRIVER INDIA PRIVATE TOURS and professional driver PANKAJ! He is polite, warm and knows his way around without a GPS. PANKAJ knows all the important historical places to visit and their history, along, as where to shop. PANKAJ was extremely helpful and accommodating to any of our requests and needs. PANKAJ's main goal of course was for us to enjoy ourselves, which we did but his first main concern was our safety.  We have traveled around the world but never had such a personal connection and care as we did from MUKUL who I initially contacted by email and phone. The icing on the cake was of course being greeted at the airport by PANKAJ! I highlight PANKAJ because without him, we would not seen the magic and culture of India. He is well deserved of praise and a HUGE ASSET to Driver India Private Tours and hope he is well appreciated! THANK YOU MUKUL AND PANKAJ!"

All the local guides Abhinav (Udaipur), Shub (Agar), Amit (Amritsar) organised by DIPT were very knowledgeable and provided a great service!

Driver_India_Private_Tours,Kiki B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Solo,Perfect choice for our Rajasthan trip,"After consulting other local agents, we decided to use DIPT for our 20 day trip through Rajasthan/Mumbai  and we could not have been more satisfied. A private car and driver is the best way to discover this historic area. We planned the itinerary together with Uday in the DIPT office and he was quick to answer emails and gave good suggestions for our route Ramesh, our very friendly driver was not only an excellent driver, he made several suggestions of places to visit or where to eat, he took excellent care of us. We visited Delhi, Agra, Fatepur Sikri, Jaipur, Pushkar, Jodpur, Ranakpur,Udaipur …  before taking a domestic flight to Mumbai where another driver waited for us. The local guides that were provided by DIPT were all great, esp Vivek in Jaipur. We recommend this company 100% for any travel within India and we will use them again on our next trip (and hopefully we are lucky to have Ramesh as our driver again)"

Our driver Sushshil and our tour guide, Lucky, made us feel safe, comfortable and treated us with above expected experience.  In our opinion, if ur staying in delhi and want to see the Taj, call DPIT, they will ensure u have the least stressful experience.  Our package included the driver, food, all tickets and our tour guide.  It's the best way to see the Taj. We will definitely be using them again.  "

Everything went so smoothly and our driver and guide were both fantastic (thank you Rahul!) going above and beyond to make sure my friend and I were comfortable. The wake up time is early, but its definitely worth it - some of the best pictures Rahul captured for us are free of other visitors in the background, making it feel like we were the only ones there :) Lunch was delicious and I learned so much about the site.

From the start, communication with the company was great. My driver Nawal was with me for 2 days. His driving is superb! Driving in India can be chaos and I felt completely safe with him behind the wheel.  My guide Shobhit did my Delhi tour. He was so much fun and really was knowledgeable about Delhi. He let me try some local deserts and guided me through the nooks and crannies of Old Dehli. It was awesome to get a locals perspective. Vikram was my guide for Agra. He was amazing! He had so much passion for his job and really made the Taj Mahal come alive with his stories. I learned so much. Not, to mention, Vikram is a great photographer and knows all the hots spots for good photos at the Taj Mahal. The staff at Driver India Private Tours really goes out of their way to make sure there clients are taken care of. I will definitely be using them when I come back to India again!"
Driver_India_Private_Tours,Zachary K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Great first trip to India,"We had a fantastic tour of New Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur with a few guides from this company, as well as with our wonderful driver Nawal.

Driver_India_Private_Tours,Anita M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Stress Free and Fun with a Driver!,"We hired DIPT to get a driver during out trip to India, we needed a driver fro 2 nights in Jaipur, 1 night in Agra, and 2 nights in Delhi. We had a driver in Kolkata that was not a DIPT driver and there is no comparison! Even the suggestions about traveling in India on the DIPT site were so helpful! From the moment we were picked up at the Jaipur aiport, we were welcomed by Mr. Naval Kishore with garlands of marigolds and blessings. He was wonderfully hospitable and knew exactly where to go. He was safe and on time and fun! Unknown to us, we also were given a tour guide at each city - which was amazing! The guides were so knowledgable and made some great suggestions. We had a different tour guide in each city and they truly made a difference! We had Nawal as our driver the whole time! He was always calm driving, and in the larger cities in India, that is a huge plus. We never really understood the complex ballet that is driving in Indian traffic - and we're glad we didn't have to. Nawal took care of everything. Making stops when we needed it and really catering to us each day. On our days without guides, he made suggestions on what to do that were great. We immediately felt safe and at ease with him navigating the roads for us. I highly recommend Nawal Kishore as your driver! Mr Himashu Ji was a great guide in Jaipur - he was extremely knowledgeable and made great suggestions - from going to the Wind Palace at the right time to heading to how to plan out what you should do when you don't have him as a guide. He suggested a wounderful plan and gave us great insight into the city. DIPT made our trip stress free and unbelievablely fun! I had no idea how much more relaxed I would be having so many details taken care of for me! I'm so glad we found DIPT.!!"

Uday is very pleasant to work with and he arranged a fantastic itinerary for us. We were so lucky to be given Pankaj as our driver who was with us the whole time. We felt so safe with him. He is a skilled driver,  never gets flustered, he is patient,  reliable and cheerful. Whatever we wanted,  Pankaj made sure we got! Our guides that were allocated to us at each site were also very good and together with our driver, having them made our experience smooth and stress-free. We were sad to say goodbye to beautiful India and highly recommend DITP."

Driver_India_Private_Tours,Jefferson D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Incredible day trip from Delhi to Taj Mahal & Agra Fort,"Had a wonderful experience going from Delhi to the Taj Mahal! Driver (Ramesh) picked us up promptly at our hotel and drove us speedily and safely to Agra through the thick Delhi fog and traffic. Our guide (Vikram) met us in Agra and took us on a wonderful tour of the Agra Fort, where his storytelling helped bring the story of Shah Jahan and the Mughals to life. Then we stopped for lunch before heading to the Taj. I was worried about the dense fog at the Taj, but Vikram helped us pick the perfect time to arrive. His stories and guiding for the Taj was excellent, and he took great photos of us throughout. Then we had one stop at a marble workshop where we got to see the craftsmanship of the Taj up close, and the sales experience was very nice and not too pushy. Then back to Delhi and another safe/fast drive with Ramesh. Thank you Vikram and Ramesh, had a wonderful time! Highly recommend this experience!"
Driver_India_Private_Tours,Matt J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Solo,Great trip with Satwinder,"Fantastic trip to Agra. Satwinder Singh was a fantastic driver , he picked us up very punctually at 8am from our hotel in Delhi. We drove to Agra and Mr. Singh provided great conversation, but we also slept on the way. We arrived to Agra and met our guide, Nandos who was also fantastic. We checked in at the hotel, then went for a fantastic lunch. We were meant to go to the Taj Mahal early in the morning but there was that much fog that we went the same afternoon. We had a great 2 or 3 hours at the Taj mahal and Nandos provided fantastic explanations. We then went to Agra Fort which was also really interesting. Throughout the whole trip, Mr. Singh was very flexible and attentive. We stayed at the hotel to rest in the evening. I would fully recommend, the communication with Mr. Mukul sharma was quick and professional, and Mr. Satwinder Singh was a great drive with a very high level of English."

This company was very communicative and flexible.   I initially booked a sunrise tour at 3am but they were kind enough to offer changing the time since the visibility would not be great.   My driver, Satwinder, was outside promptly at 7am to begin our journey.  He was very friendly and most importantly a safe driver. Once I reached Agra, my tour guide, Lucky, facilitated the most wonderful experience.   He gave me great detail about both places and he even took some nice photos for me at Taj Mahal.  I would definitely suggest using DIPT services."

There were many sites to behold including the Amber fort (as pictured with Om). I highlight for me was the chance to walk and bond with the elephant Sheba (@ Elefon elephant sanctuary, Kunda, Amer).And most surprised by the beauty of Udaipur city palace and the wonderful mirror mosaics and paintings. And the quick thinking to shift the arrangement so we get the best chance to view the Taj Mahal with weather constraints. A memorable start of another year.Thank you so much. Nameste Marie & Rob"

Driver_India_Private_Tours,MarkoLoco,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Golden Triangle with Dharam Pal Singh,"Starting from our rough Golden Triangle visit plan, the team supported our preparations for a really nice first sightseeing visit to India. Our driver Dharam Pal Singh not only acted as a skilled driver, but also helped out with ad-hoc adjustments to the plan. Having lunch locations already planned is really a treat, being driven in a car which was obviously cleaned on at least daily basis a dream.I can only recommend DIPT, and then especially Dharam Pal. They are not the cheapest, but they do deliver a peace of mind, which was something quite important for us, coming to India for the first time!I hope to be driving along with Pal again in the (near) future! Thank you for helping us to create unforgettable memories of India!"

Mukesh, our skilled driver was incredibly helpful and courteous. His priority was to ensure we were happy. His English excellent. In Jaipur our very knowledgeable guide Himanshu took us to so many amazing places. He was fantastic giving us space to wander freely. Our guide in Udaipur was also  very knowledgeable.

Driver_India_Private_Tours,JORDI C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,The perfect family trip,"I travelled with my family to India for 14 days with DIPT. To be honest, we usually travel in our own, but since it's not recommended to rent your own car (because of the crazy Indian traffic rules) we decided to count with a local agency for the full organization. I can't be happier with the result, it has been excellent. Uday was our travel manager, he did all the hotel bookings, car arrangements and guides (Spanish speaking) organization. Everything was perfect, with no issues in our entire trip.Mukesh was our driver for most of the trip (except Varanasi). His driving skills were great, very punctual and very nice and funny person, we had a great time with him.If you travel to India and you're looking for a local agency, I would highly recommend to book it with DIPT."

Overall, our experience was amazing! They have been really quick and available in answering us, suggesting the itinerary, and addressing our requests. With our driver Sanjay, we felt always safe in the Indian traffic, the travel in the car was comfortable, the car cleaned-up every morning and several bottle of water available every day. He is very professional and extremely careful to our needs and wishes."

Nawal Kishore was our driver and he demonstrated high professionalism. He was punctual, courteous and provided right guidance/suggestions when needed. High recommendation both for him and DIPT."
Driver_India_Private_Tours,Anil S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,"Brilliant tour of Delhi, Agra and Jaipur","We used DIPT to do guided tours of Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, and were very happy that we went with them. The guides were all excellent - very knowledgeable and enthusiastic - and we saw things that we would never have been able to on our own, such as the food being prepared in the Sikh temple in Delhi. Sanjay drove us from Delhi to Agra and then on to Jaipur, and chatting with him made the long journeys pass quickly. He also arranged a last-minute leopard safari in Jaipur, which was one of the highlights of our trip. Also a big thanks to our guide in Jaipur, Uday, who not only took us on a great tour of the city but also helped us find some wedding outfits for later on in our trip. We would highly recommend DIPT - the drivers and all of the guides were fantastic and the communication from the company was excellent."

Our driver Omni was such a great bloke, really personable, knowledgeable and attentive. The best of our guides by a mile was Rahul, who we spent two days with around Agra and Jaipur - it really felt as if he was not just going through the motions, but really loved his work ad his photography skills were absolutely superb. It was a pleasure to spend time with them both. Mukul was also very accommodating as we had to change our original plans. Great company. Thank you!"
Driver_India_Private_Tours,J Blair H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Exceeded my expectations significantly!!,"Having visited over 55 countries, I consider myself a seasoned traveler. I normally make all of my own in country arrangements (hotels, guides and transportation) and move at my own pace. I like the flexibility of an untethered itinerary. When discussing my pending trip, my Indian friends told me India is a little more...nuanced than most countries and recommended a private escorted tour as the most advantageous way to see the country and get a better understanding of Indian culture. They also said a tour like this was affordable in India!! I said ""amen""!After working with 3 companies I selected DIPT because of their number 1 rating,  outstanding reviews and the excellent communications with my company contact; Udaydeep. They were not the cheapest, but they were the most professional. My trip was fantastic and the services provided by DIPT greatly enhance my ability to get close to Indian culture. Uday was the ""puppet master"" overseeing all of the arrangements and on call 24/7!! All of my drivers and guides were excellent, but one of my drivers, Satwinder, was the most exemplary of the group. It would be advantageous to select him as your driver!! DIPT has the number one rating for a reason and I can attest that they deserve it. I visited Agra, Jaipur, Mumbai and Delphi. At each stop Uday was in contact with me gathering feedback and offering tips about my itinerary. I did get the opportunity to meet Uday at the end of my trip in Delphi. He was as genuine in person as he was on the phone. DIPT is the best!! Spend just a little more and a better experience!!"
Driver_India_Private_Tours,Hemal P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Amazing Agra!,"We had an amazing trip with Yogesh (guide) and Pankaj (driver).  They were very accommodating to us and was extremely polite, courteous and respectful. They showed us around and made sure we didn’t miss any info the important sites and sounds.  Pankaj is an extremely good driver who can literally drive with his eyes closed! The journey flew by because we started so early and were able to sleep in the car.  Yogi knew everything about Agra as he is from there so it made it an amazing day.  He shared so much history about the sites and even gave us time to explore for ourselves!  They treated us to an amazing lunch that capped off an amazing day!  When in Delhi and you want to see Taj Mahal then make sure to go on this tour.  You won’t regret it!"

Our driver was Sushil. Everything was outstanding. Sushil was a careful driver, an excellent companion, a knowledgeable guide, and a good person. The car was large and comfortable. We could not have asked for more.  I would definitely recommend both this company and Sushil as a driver to anyone interested in a tour package around Delhi."

They found a way to include everything I wanted and delivered.  Ramesh was an amazing, personable driver.  Local guides provided insight and were patient with my onslaught of questions, all speaking excellent English!  As two women traveling we felt safe and respected.

Driver_India_Private_Tours,at_gooner,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Fantastic company - Sanjay is a star,"We did a bespoke 4 day trip (Delhi - Agra - Jaipur) and DIPT were fantastic. Before the trip, Uday was very helpful and clear in terms of planning the trip.  I am not sure how they compare on price but it seemed a fair price to me and they were flexible with payment options.Our driver Sanjay for the whole tour was simply amazing. We have had many drivers during our travels of various parts of India and we wish all of them were like Sanjay. He speaks great English, very helpful and flexible. He made sure the car was clean every day, provided us with bottled water, and really made our trip. Obviously his driving was always safe and responsible too. Honestly I have no words to say how great Sanjay was during the trip - huge thanks to him. The guides provided in Agra and Jaipur were great especially Mr Khan in Agra who went out of his way to take great photos of us and told us lots about Agra and the history of North India. If I was ever visiting any part of North India again I wouldn’t even look at any other company."

Driver Ramesh and tour guide Yogi were top notch and highly recommended. Took us to all the cool spots and some. If it’s your first time don’t think about it just book it.

We’ve been very happy with the service provided throughout.Firstly, when planning the trip, Uday was very responsive and clearly answered all my questions.  He had some good advice on the itinerary and vehicle choice, and there was no pressure to add additional tours or services.  The payment process via online credit card was smooth - a rarity in my experience with other providers.We were also very pleased with our driver, Om.  He was always punctual, turning up every morning with a neat and clean car and a smile on his face. He was accomodating with our requests, and made some suggestions on arranging our daily itinerary and additional sights along our route.  He’s a good driver - cautious and patient, and was happy to stop periodically for breaks.  His English is fine, and it was easy to coordinate via Whatsapp.So, all in all, I’m happy to recommend DIPT and Om for your Northern India adventures."
Driver_India_Private_Tours,Tiffany,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Fantastic Golden Triangle India Trip!,"Loved the flexibility of India Private Tour, we always felt safe and supported by our driver (big shoutout to Deepak, would highly recommend) and tour guides. They catered to what we loved (taking photos) and took us to new stops that most tourists wouldn’t get a chance to see. Appreciated the early start days so we can beat crowds and then enjoy our evenings to rest. Also appreciated that we were able to adjust the schedule on the fly if we felt there were things outside of the schedule we wanted to see, or places we wanted to skip.Some feedback I would point out is after some tours, we would be taken to some hard-sell shops and this felt like a waste of time and we felt a lot of pressure to buy things (i.e. the stone in-lay shop after the Taj Mahal, some of the souvenir stores, and tea shops after the Rickshaw tour). We would have also liked to know which attractions we would need to pay entry for out of pocket and how much the entry would be so we could be better prepared. Some days, we would skip lunch but it wasn't very clear what the schedule was and whether we would be able to eat or not. So it would be nice to have additional information up front. Overall, we really did enjoy the tour and had a great experience with our Driver and our Tour Guides. Thanks so much to Mukul for taking us around Delhi and on a great one-day shopping tour and for being very fast to communicate. This was very important when deciding which tour company to go with! He was very quick to solve any issues we encountered and a pleasure to talk to."

Deepak, the driver was very caring and professional (even with the massive fog we felt very safe), also fluent in English.Our Guide (Shez Khann) was wonderful! He shared a lot of information and presented it in an interesting way. He also answered all questions and provided many details. Patient and flexible, willing to help and share insights about his culture. If you are visiting taj mahal and fort - only with them! An unforgettable experience, we would recommend!"

Both of these gentlemen were beyond accommodating, patient and respectful of my time. The tour has some stops into other merchants to see the artisan work of Agra (no pressure in buying, but you may just want to!) My tour ended with lunch and the food was amazing (flavor explosión in your mouth). Appreciate the time and effort and highly recommend you book with DIPT."

Driver_India_Private_Tours,StefanMayak,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Good Driver,"Overall the experience was good with the driver we booked for a few days.The communication up front via e-mail and whatsapp was very efficient, transparent and honest. Everything promised and discussed was later delivered (e.g that all costs of the car such as parking, tolls etc were included) and the fixed price agreed upon was kept with no additional costs or discussions. Out driver was a very good and safe driver and additionally very nice. He handlet the chaotic traffic very well. Unfortunately his English was only basic which lead to some misunderstandings, especially when trying to discuss the order of sights to see in a city. Also it was not really possible to ask deeper questions about the country, culture etc. What I also didn't like was the constant pressuring to give a 5 star rating on TripAdvisor. To summarize it: Good and transparent communication, very safe driver which is the most important thing in India"
Driver_India_Private_Tours,Bernadette,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Great company,"Excellent company to organise a private tour in Delhi.The driver was confident, cautious and very professional.The guide, Kieran Singh, was an official guide, very nice and knowledgeable.

Uday was our trip manager, who helped us organize everything: hotel, car, guides and activities reservation, as well as quickly answering the many questions we had before arriving to India. The star of our trip was Mukesh, our driver, who took us around the crazy Indian traffic for 11 days. Always smiling and bringing the best vibes to the group. Very punctual, giving recommendations of places and restaurants and, most importantly, making us feel safe in the chaotic routes of this country. Will definitely recommend visiting this beautiful country with DIPT."

Himanshu, our Jaipur guide, was amazing and probably the best tour guide we have had on a trip as he was very kind, knowledgeable but also not too intrusive of our holiday and left time for us to explore alone if we wanted. The star for us was our driver for the 6 days- Pankaj!! He was so lovely and caring. We felt completely safe with him and despite all the crazy driving from others he remained very calm and courteous. Nothing was a problem for him and we are very grateful he was our driver."

A group of 12 booked this golden triangle tour for some exploration before a wedding and it was the highlight of the trip. Every guide we had was knowledgeable, kind, engaging and responsive to our needs and requests. We had such a blast and they showed us the big highlights as well as some hidden gems. In fact, after the wedding Mukiul bent over backwards to book us a last minute half day tour of Jaipur and a bus ride back to Delhi - and then met us at the airport to say goodbye!I can't imagine our India trip with a different group of guides. This was our first time in India and we had such a wonderful experience. The sunrise tour of the Taj Mahal, especially, cannot be missed :)"

I highly recommend Sushil, our driver, for taking care of us and for getting us to all the places we needed to go to (from handicrafts to temples and particular restaurants).

I came with a big group for a friends wedding and doing a tour with DIPT for a few days before was perfect. They were very flexible with doing what we were interested in.

All of them made us feel safe and their insights widened our knowledge on India. As a first timer in India, I had a lot of questions because I only knew India from books and movies, yet they our guides and Sushil patiently answered to our questions. Sushil attended to all our needs given from shops to buy handicrafts from to local restaurants that will make you love India even more.  Overall, My family and I had a wonderful experience.

Driver_India_Private_Tours,cwidarma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,A nice introduction to India,"DIPT helped make my wish to see the Tai Mahal come true. It was a last minute addition to our family trip, and I happened to stumble upon their listing on TripAdvisor. From there I went to their website and found their WhatsApp contact info; and that’s when I met Mr. Mukul. He was such a courteous and supportive presence. He was always there to answer my questions and quell my fears/doubts. He was willing to work with my tight schedule—we were literally going to India just to see the Tai Mahal for a day. Everything went smoothly. Once we arrived at the airport, there was someone pleasant that greeted us and escorted us to our driver. The driver, Mr. Mukesh, was the star of the show. Most of our laughter and excitement happened while on the road. Mr. Mukesh is such a phenomenal driver! With his skill he was able to get us to the Tai Mahal and back to the airport within our insane schedule. Our tour guide, Mr. Ratan, treated us like VIPs. He was a reliable gentlemen who ensured we received all the photos that we purchased. My only tip is to make sure to keep track of the time when you’re at the Tai Mahal. It’s such a splendor to be there that you loose sense of time, and if you’re on a tight timetable like ours, you may miss out on other sites. All in all, DIPT was pivotal in making this trip happen. I feel like I’ll be visiting India again, some time soon. And when I do, I’ll be contacting Mr. Mukul to help arrange my more extended trip."

Once we arrived, I was blown away by the amazing hotels we stayed at and the quality of the tours.Mukul gave us a great tour and even helped us find amazing shops on a lighter day. Niku in Delhi was a crowd favorite, giving super helpful information. Vikram in Agra kept everyone laughing, even though it was literally 5AM. Uday in Jaipur helped plan a last minute half day trip that felt incredibly informative and not overwhelming.Highly highly highly recommend taking advantage of this great company. You really won’t regret it!"

We would definitely recommend DITP to others!"
Driver_India_Private_Tours,Daniel L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Over-exceeded our high expectations,"Incredible 7 day trip around Golden Triangle thanks to DIPT and to our driver Ramesh. He has treated us like family, taking care of us, avoiding tourist traps and showing us amazing places when spending time together. Ramesh has been the best person we have met in the trip, super patient all the time and flexible, he’s got massive heart, he’s always been super friendly and professional but making jokes as well, showing us local culture and always keen to pick up thousands questions about India and its culture. Mukul (DIPT) has been super flexible up to the very last minute accommodating the trip to our needs and planning it accordingly. We spent the first three days in Delhi, two days with amazing driver Ramesh showing us around and explaining all about Indian culture and the temples we visited. The remaining day Latit (Delhi guide) showed us the main monuments and let us experience Delhi not just like a tourist but as a local. The fourth day we went to Agra where Hassan Late (Agra guide) with massive cultural and historical knowledge explained all about Agra fort and Taj Mahal. He was super professional but close person coming for lunch with us where we spent an amazing time together. The 5th day we spent a great time with Ramesh on our 6 hour journey to Jaipur learning even more things about India and having a familiar conversation with him. He stopped a few times on the way to show us big sightseeing attractions and good local (but good for tourists stomach) restaurants. The last two days we had a super good and interesting guide (Himanshu) who took us to touristic attractions but also going off the beaten track showing us amazing local buildings. Then, Ramesh took a walk with us showing pure local markets avoiding touristic markets, tourist traps and remaining best places of Jaipur. India can be a big shock for foreigners so booking our trip with this company is the best we have done and we are now ready to experience India much better during our next few days. The hotels have been stunning and the best ones we’ve stayed at, the car and service is spot on with an always clean vehicle. Not a single complaint, not even one. All we have a good words to DIPT and specially towers our driver who made this trip inmemorable. THANK YOU and we will definitely come back to India."
