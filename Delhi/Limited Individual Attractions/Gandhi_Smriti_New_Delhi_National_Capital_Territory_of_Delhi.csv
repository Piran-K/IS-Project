Gandhi_Smriti,smvNYC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,A place of reflection,"Our tour guide suggested to visit this place instead of the Lotus Temple and we were thankful for that. Being weekend, the area attractions were crowded. Yet Gandhi Smriti was not, and we had the opportunity to enjoy the beautifully maintained grounds, learn about Gandhi, life, work and death and understand better the history of India. Most impressive were the staff. We found them all smiling and accommodating, as they seemed to have a strong understanding of the importance and solemnity of the place!There is also a shop with books and handicrafts related to Gandhi's work. The prices were surprisingly low."

There are a number of sections in this museum. One is the exhibition on his life, his simple living quarters, his mortal remains. It has the main events in his life, sayings by world luminiaries, his efforts at khadi and self reliance through a system of self sufficient ashrams, events in his life like naokoli satyagraha, salt march and so on. Outside the main building, there is a marked path which was the last path taken by Gandhiji before his assassination. There is a memorial at the exact place. There is also a world peace gong.

Gandhi_Smriti,Meander With Mer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,I was truly surprised at how much I enjoyed my visit here,"Like the title says, I was truly surprised at how much I enjoyed and took away from my visit here.  While I have the general background on Gandhi this provided additional insight and education without being boring.  There were rooms laid out just as they were then, there were digital displays proving background and history and many dioramas showing different events in his life.  We only spent about an 1+ there but could have easily spent more."

Gandhi_Smriti,MWandAW,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,More than his last steps,"My wife and I visited this lovely museum as one of the first museums on our luxury guided tour of India in March 2020. A profound way to start our adventure was to view  a memorial to the life and death of one of India's greatest humanitarians. This museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi, is the site where he spent the last 144 days of his life and where he was assassinated on 30 January 1948. The two storey house, which was owned by the Birla family, was converted to a memorial museum in the 1970s. The museum consists of many rooms and corridors showing photographs, oddments and documents. A covered walkway has been constructed around the enclosure and filled with photos and information about his life, politics and religion. There are gardens, sculptures and a beautifully kept lawn where the assassination took place . A dedicated walkway shows raised footprints where he walked from the house to the lawn showing his last steps on this earth. An annex shows the place he used to spend his last days and a glass showcase contains all of his worldly possessions at the end of his life. Monkeys roam around the gardens, so be careful of food and your cameras. Adequate toilet facilities are provided on the premises. Families of Indian locals, wearing their best clothes were sitting around the grounds enjoying and smiling at the endless lines of foreigners streaming past the assassination place. This memorial gets very busy which can be identified by the number of coaches in the parking area.  Despite this, a visit to this sacred memorial is highly recommended."
Gandhi_Smriti,R1chardN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A moving experience,"We visited Ghandi Smriti as part of a City and highlights tour of Delhi.  We had to ask to have it included as it seems it is not one of the usual monuments.It is the place where Ghandi spent the end of his life and footsteps mark the route he took to his assassination.  It is incredibly moving to see the minimalist life he had and to witness his final walk and the spot where he was killed.There is an exhibition to the side of the walk way that details his life, the obstacles he overcame and the achievements of this great man.It's a must see and I would encourage you to have it added to your itinerary if it is not already."

Gandhi_Smriti,RicherTrips,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,A peaceful spot,"This former house of an Indian entrepreneur and philanthropist hosted Mahatma in the last months of his life. This is also the place where he died, but the exhibit focus on his life, mentions his death, but not his murder, which I find very respectful.It´s better to start at the garden, where you can see many pictures with information about his life and achievements. Then, visit the house, where you´ll see his personal rooms and a collection of miniatures that explain Mahatma´s life."

Gandhi_Smriti,HuntleyNewYork,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Visit sadly marred by our guide ,"We were very enthusiastic to visit this special place where an icon for peace in India and revered around the world spent the last part of his life. Our expectation was a respectful contemplative experience. We also happened to be there on an important related holiday for our native country — Martin Luther King Day. Unfortunately we had a private guide who insisted on infusing criticism of Gandhi / focusing on issues such as his view that Gandhi was a hypocrite for living in such large quarters / that Gandhi was dishonest and possibly immoral in his intimate life / and other similar points of view. We felt this was totally inappropriate for the place, and could have been explored by our guide after the visit, when he continued to accompany us, as topics that might be worthy of our own research into the man if we were inclined to gather more information about his life & times. He spent barely a few minutes providing historical context or information about Gandhi’s promotion of peace while we were there, gave us no quiet time for exploration and contemplation, and was, in point of fact, the personification of the antithesis of the place itself. He is with a large very well respected company that provides luxury tours of Africa & India. We will never forgive this guide for ruining our Gandhi visit And we remain deeply saddened by it. We contacted the company and they have been very accommodating, providing us with a new guide for the balance of our trip. We are currently anxious, but hopeful, that the balance of our trip will take a more respectful tone."
Gandhi_Smriti,Sam M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,An enlightening experience,On our stopover in New Delhi we visited Gandhi Smriti. This is where Gandhi lived and was assassinated.

I found it interesting to tour his home and his compound and to get up close and personal with his life.  I thought the photos with him as well were compelling as well.  But would I found most interesting was the pathway outlining his final walk before his asassination which I found poignant and personal to see.  Overall, I would recommend this visit, however I seemed to enjoy the Indira Gandhi home even more."

I learnt a lot about how Gandhi ji spent his last days here from the well-informed lady staff/volunteer from the Art of Living organisation here to guide us around who herself held him in the highest regard. It was certainly better than just strolling around by myself as I'm won't to do at many decrepit museums in India. This place was a pleasant surprise for me. There is no entry fee and it is maintained in immaculate condition.  Ensure you block a decent part of your itinerary to visit here at leisure."

Gandhi's room in the house has been preserved, and his final (few) possessions are on display. The house has otherwise been converted into an interesting museum. Behind the house is a gazebo-like structure called the Martyr's Column which marks the spot where Gandhi drew his final breath after being mindlessly gunned down. We enjoyed visiting this peaceful place and taking time to remember an important and very good person. Entrance is free."

It is an oasis of calm in a chaotic city and a fitting  tribute to the great ‘Father of the nation’, Mahatma Gandhi. You can feel his serene presence in the house and, despite the brutality of his assassination in the garden, it is peaceful.

The small museum has many interactive exhibits as well as some personal items that belonged to Ghandi. I would only recommend this place if you are interested in the man himself.
Gandhi_Smriti,TheKidsMum2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Peaceful and respectful,"We enjoyed walking around the museum and garden. You can just walk in from the street and enjoy the gardens and memorabilia. The walk through museum by pictures/text was a bit outdated. There were repetitions of text and photos and it wouldn't take much to update this. There were a series of boxes with crafted models detailing Gandhi's life which were a bit odd, but at least in chronological order. In the garden there were more pictures and text. This is not a museum for children, unless they are late teens. Way too much reading. You get a good feel for the history by spending some time here."
Gandhi_Smriti,Tony C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,A place of quiet reflection and learning about Gandhi,"This is a tribute to Gandhi and pays respect very well. The memorial is the place where he was murdered those many years ago and includes the ability to understand his journey that day. There is also a museum which focuses on this hero of India, his life and his importance to what India now is.You probably only need about 90 minutes to take it all in.Not a must see but if you can does allow you to learn more about the man and what he did for this vast country."
Gandhi_Smriti,Aussie_Binturong,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,A must-see,This museum is free and well worth a visit.

It features the place where he was assassinated and sandal-shaped footprints indicating his last steps before he died.
Gandhi_Smriti,Jan Nielsen,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Interesting place but the museum is a bit outdated ,It is fairly easy to go to the museum by the metro. Just hop of at the Lok Kalyan Marg station and then walk for around 15 minutes.The museum is free of charge and is placed in the buildings where Gandhi lived before being assassinated. The museum mostly consists of pictures with quotes from Gandhi and a few of his belongings. At least to us that was not overwhelming interesting.The best part of the museum is the park behind the buildings. It is very peaceful and well maintained.
Gandhi_Smriti,kamakshi2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,The place of reverence !,"This monument is in the memory of the Father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi - the place of his assasination .

Gandhi_Smriti,Ralph Wilhelm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"MUST MAKE TIME; most peaceful, highly significant, location-last months of Gandhi's life.","Gandhi Smriti was more moving than I expected....the last almost half year of his life was lived here.  The Birla House is well kept up and maintained.  Recommend that you hire a guide if you want more background on his life and the Birla House.  Yes, many signs are in English and Hindi but the backstory is just as fascinating, plus the location of his last walk, where he was assassinated, where he lived, etc.  If you have seen the movie regarding Gandhi's life, this will all come alive with your visit.Note also plenty of older pictures of Gandhi growing up plus pictures of family and friends and key leaders of India's move to a true democracy.  Please make time; you will find it very worthwhile."

The information boards are very informative and the garden is very tranquil and well kept. The footsteps marking Gandhi's last steps are very poignant.

Gandhi_Smriti,Linda Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,“Father of the Nation”,"Formerly known as the Birla House, this museum is dedicated to the life of Mahatma Gandhi. It was here that Gandhi spent the last 144 days of his life and was assassinated on January 30, 1948. You can view the simple room where Gandhi lived, then follow his final footsteps. The Martyr's Column marks the spot on the grounds where the ""Father of the Nation"" was shot during his prayers. I found my visit sobering, moving and uplifting. Here was a man that not only led India to independence but through nonviolent measures inspired other activists across the world. I visited on Jan 31, the day after India celebrates Martyrs' Day, and Gandhi’s memorial was covered in flowers."
Gandhi_Smriti,LeeLo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Iconic and peaceful,"Set in the leafy embassy district of South Delhi, this place has a wonderful gentle feel about it. There is extensive information about his life and legacy. The grounds of the house felt so peaceful and calming on a drizzly grey day. The assassination site is iconic, and you really feel you are in a place where important history happened. Gandhi's glasses, pocket watch and other possessions are on display in his bedroom, and the overall experience feels respectful and privileged rather than tacky. The interactive exhibition upstairs can be skipped.There seems to be several Gandhi places to visit in Delhi, but we chose the right one coming here."
Gandhi_Smriti,PipPaul W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,The Gandhi place to visit,"There is a Gandhi Museum elsewhere in Delhi. That isn't a patch on this placeThis is where Gandhi spent the last 144 days of his life and where, in the gardens, he was assassinated. This area is marked by a memorial. Inside the house is the room where he lived and some artifacts,  and the rest is mostly extensive narrative and pictures. A very restful and calming place. And it is free"
Gandhi_Smriti,Paul J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Detailed and peaceful,"As we had not read much about this lovely place, we were unprepared for its gentle beauty and power.  The site of many Ghandi visits and his assassination, these buildings and grounds are understated but very interesting.  Not at all crowded when we were there, the grounds are lovely to walk on (following Ghandi’s final steps is moving), and the interiors of the main building are so very full of information about Ghandi’s life.  Take special time to see the dioramas which show scenes from Ghandi’s life, and stroll casually amid the outside walkway with interesting highlights of his early activism.  We wish we had more time here to read more."
Gandhi_Smriti,Kar C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,A museum for a Great man,"Our guide took us here and we loved it.  Since I have already seen the Raj Ghat, he suggested we go here.  We followed the footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi on his last walk to the back garden for prayers.  We saw the spot where he fell.  The building where he was staying at is the museum and details of his journey through life.  A must visit while visiting  Delhi."

Gandhi_Smriti,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,evokes emotions,"This is the house where Mahatma Gandhi spent his last days & breathed his last. The house has been converted into a memorial now. It is incredibly peaceful inside. You will get the complete overview of the last few months of the Mahatma's life, including the partition of India & the religious riots succeeding it.The staff is dressed in khadi kurta- pajama, which adds to the aura of the place. At the exact spot where Mahatma Gandhi was shot, there is a memorial built with his last words.A multimedia display has tried to give a technological spin to the Mahatma's life & ideals in a bid to, I think, make it more relevant for school children. At the library cum store, you can read and/ or buy books related to Mahatma Gandhi.There's also a khadi store in the premises from where you can purchase khadi products. A must - visit for everyone!"

Gandhi_Smriti,Marvin G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Gandhi's Home contains a compendium of his life and work,"Behind a a wrought iron fence stands a beautiful while British colonial styled residential complex that was Gandhi's home in Delhi for the last 144 days of his life prior to his assassination in 1948.  Now there is a  museum in the main building that houses a number of articles associated with Gandhi's life and death.Visitors can tour the building and grounds, viewing the preserved room where Gandhi lived and the place on the grounds where he was shot while holding his nightly public walk. Gandhi was shot during his prayers at the place where Martyr's Column now stands. The museum holds a series of tableau writings with accompanying photos of Gandhi's life, development of his philosophy of ""non-violence"" and peaceful protest as well as an interactive exchange and video footage which display basic information on his life's work.  The home, gardens, meeting hall, peace gong and bronze statues can keep you involved for hours.  There is even a small shop purveying snacks and small lunch specials so that you can spend more time on the property taking in its importance and relevance to the world today as well as gain a greater appreciation of Gandhi.  There is even a shop that offers crafts and clothing on the premises that's government-certified and price-fixed.  We spent over three hours on the premises and could have used a full day to take in all of the artifacts and history on display here.  The Smriti (Remembrance) is a must when visiting Delhi."

It was a very moving experience and well done. Visit the museum for information about his life and what he stood for to make this a better world.The path he took to the spot where he was assassinated is marked with footsteps so you can see exactly where he went.

Gandhi_Smriti,Michael D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Gandhi Smriti,"This is the place Ghandi spent his last days before being assassinated. His simple room that he lived while here.  Also the exact spot where he was assassinated on his way to prayer. This is an emotional experience and you are hit with sadness and sacredness when you first enter the property.   There is no charge and a lot of written description as well as video footage.  You can spend hours there.   Upstairs there is an interactive museum that is very good for all ages.  If in Dehli, you must see this to better appreciate Gandhi's life."

Gandhi_Smriti,Susan M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Gandhi's life story,"This site is so much more than Gandhi's assassination site.  The museum on the grounds gives a thorough overview of his story, from education in England to South Africa before his return to India.  Kudos to the caretakers of the grounds; they ensure that his memory is respected by all visitors.  This site needs a few hours because there is so much to see."
Gandhi_Smriti,Geeess,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Amazing grace,"This is the old Birla house where Mahatma Gandhi the apostle of non violence lived the last 3 months of his great life. This is also the place he was assassinated. It is a well organised place ,No entry fee but a registration is sought.The simple room that Gandhiji lived in is well spending some time in to understand his simplicity. The path to the spot of his assassination is marked with his footsteps To go  to the actual point shoes need to be removed.There are hand spun and cottage industry shops on the premises I found it  a place of great reverence and historically important"
Gandhi_Smriti,Ana P.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Fantastic.  Must go.,"Fantastic, I add a note of well preserved. You do not leave sad but hopeful. A must go, if you missed it, you would have no sense of this icon importance for his countrymen.  "
Gandhi_Smriti,Yogadeva,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,A good place for quiet reflection,"There is a lot of information to take in here, with details of all of Gandhi’s life as well as how his last days unfolded. It has been slightly upgraded since I was last there, with a new block of toilets and a better sense of direction through the outdoor part of the display. Birla house remains as beautiful as ever and that alone gives one a sense of the elegant charm of that era, contrasted all the more starkly with the violent assassination of a frail old man. Not to be missed if you’re interested in Indian society and history."
Gandhi_Smriti,Christine F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,A very interesting visit to Ghandi's final footsteps!,"This building is an insight into the final hours of Ghandi's life. A very humbling experience, well preserved with dignity and respect. Not a huge site to visit but worth going to experience the reality of this man and his passion for peace."
