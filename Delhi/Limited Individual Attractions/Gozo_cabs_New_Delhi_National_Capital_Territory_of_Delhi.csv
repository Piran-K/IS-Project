Gozo_cabs,anant r,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Trichy to Chennai,"I had booked a cab 3 days in advance for 26th Jan 9:30 am and also paid in advance. On 25th night at 10:30 pm, i get a call from gozo cabs that they won't be sending cab in the morning. It was such pathetic service. I had senior citizen traveling with me and it was such a stressful situation to figure out for a cab late at night. Unfortunately my entire plan of traveling went on a toss and had to pay extra money to other cab provider.WONT RECOMMEND AT ALL... PATHETIC PATHETIC AND WORST EVER SERVICE WE BOOKED."

Gozo_cabs,Team GozoCares,,,,"Gozo provided the worst driver - first did not put on the heater in car for morning hours 5 AM in cold weather, and then started demanding additional money (2500,2000,1500,1000 etc) for an on-route itinerary included within the contracted km. When denied, the driver first demanded money, then held us captive, our luggage captive, and left us midway on the road (from Jaipur to Udaipur); all this went on for 5 hours during our trip with a family of 4 with a 4-year-old.  Gozo customer rep kept on saying we are talking to the driver as he is obliged to take but the driver did not move; the Gozo cab rep finally said we cannot provide service in the area and we will have to get another cab for ourselves. With no contacts at an unknown place, we were left stranded; we had to request unknown people to get local contacts for cab services.Gozo reps did not even refund my money for all this mishap and still hold my money. I pre-planned a return journey fare and when the driver left, we had to hire multiple cab services with a lot of inconveniences, and had to make extra payments everywhere on the trip (to Udaipur and back to Jaipur which also included on-the-way sightseeing). They said they have suspended the cab vendor.After, telling the customer rep the whole story, he again asked me to write down the sequence of events in an email - I mean why do you waste time listening on phone? On my vacation, I had to write down emails (spending 3-4 hours) to describe the story. I demanded my full refund and additional compensation as my family had to suffer harassment and my vacation was completely ruined.Additionally, Gozo has issued me fraudulent invoices with incorrect cab details and itinerary to claim the payment I made - horrible practice; attaching a pic of the cab and an incorrect invoice sent to me. I have sent multiple emails with no action over a month and I keep getting messages from multiple reps that someone will call you."

You can book one day in advance, which gives you so much flexibility and a lot of comfort.Only inconvenient is that they only take indian cards for reservations so we needed an indian friend to lend us his card for the bookings and then we paid the remaining amount in cash.Highly recommended!"

Paid the advance also. They gave a call on 01Jan late evening and simply say sorry, our partners can't provide a car on 02 jan. So we are cancelling your booking from our end.That is all. Their job is over. And your tension and anxiety begins. You are left high and dry in the peak season. These guys lack commitment. They may be doing good business,there my be a plenty of satisfied customers but then there is no guarantee. You could be the next one whom they ditch at last minute at their convenience.

,,,,,"Hello,Do not use Gozo. It’s a scam and good for nothing company. I usually don’t like to give any bad reviews but I want to share my experience so that no one else have to cancel their trip or worse left without a cab at the last minute. And I am also sharing all the screenshot with actual details to confirm that’s this is a genuine and authentic review for a scam company. I booked a cab through Gozo on Dec 22nd at a 20% premium than market rate just to guarantee a cab ride in Kerala during peak season (my travel dates were Dec 27 to Jan 1 2023); rather than trusting local cab services. Gozo charged me 30% advance (INR 7,478) and provided their ASSURED cab guarantee. Gozo at the very last minute on Dec 26 (6:30 pm) cancelled my ASSURED reservation, stating that there is no cab availability. At this point no other cab services was agreeing to take my booking since my travel was the next day (Dec 27, 9 am) and I did not get any assistance from Gozo in finding another cab. Just an email that the money would be refunded in 7 days To rub salt on the wound, when I called their reservation services, they offered to book another cab at INR 52000, 2X the original reservation price. So, cancelling my booking due to unavailability of cabs was just a sham to haggle extra $$So in summary, 1) they cancelled my confirmed & assured booking. 2) didn’t offer any assistance in find an alternate cab services 3) requoted 2X price ( price gauging) 4) kept money for 14 days for an unprofessional, pathetic and unreliable service.Unfortunately, we couldn’t find any cab services and cannot even cancel our flights & hotel reservations. Gozo ruined our vacation and traveling plans and I hope if you are reading this, you are warned and hope you do not use their services & risk your vacation"

Gozo_cabs,Sinora P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Good choice,"I was searching for one way cabs from Jaipur to Noida, as my parents were travelling so i was bit worried. I came across Gozo Cabs and found their quoted prices competitive. I called to their customer care number and felt assured after talking to the representative. The guy even helped me in booking the itinerary. Cab (Dezire) was also good and journey was comfortable. As my experience was good so i again booked the cab (Xcent) from Gozo for my parents return journey one week later. This time again the booking and traveling experience was good. Same guy on their customer service entertained me who was truly professional and was very good at his job. I don't remember his name exactly but he was a Bengali. Full credit to him as he was the first person to make me feel satisfied. Cabs were on time both the time and the journey was hastle free. Driver on return journey was very good.I recommend Gozo Cabs as per my experience and Hope that they will continue their services with continuous improvement and focusing customer satisfaction."

Gozo_cabs,Amit K,,,,The driver asked to take a different route to avoid traffic and bad road for which he said it will be Rs 300-400 extra. But it was around Rs 900 extra I had to pay. I felt this was a misguidence as it can be inconvenient for the travellers. People follow a budget while travelling so if it exceeds so much it is really inconvenient. Otherwise the driver and overall experience is great.

,,,,,Worst customer service experience. They are not adjusting or refunding my Advance paid Money. booked a cab from Jaipur to Delhi on 20th November 2022. The Driver attitude was not good so i called GOZO team to replace the cab driver or send me any other cab. They told me that now driver reached your point of pick-up so you have to travel with the same else your booking would be treated as cancelled and we will not refund your money. This is a fraud company and don't want to take complaints.

Thank you for writing to us, We've investigated and tried to do a conference call with the Driver along with you to find out the issue, however you're not interested to get on that conference call and we do not found any issue with the driver, hence as per the policy refund is not possible. Kindly let us know if you need any further help from our side. Thank you! - Team GozoCabs"

Their customer service people kept on calling to book and offering discounts, finally i went with them. Once that was done, I kept on asking them driver s information and they assured me that i will get it 5 hours before the start time. Confirmed with them again, and again - all good. Pickup time - 9amNight before -at 10pm they call me and inform they couldnt find a driver and they will be happy to refund full amount. I mean cmmonnnnit led to a panic in my family as we had to reach to an important occasion the next day. Worst experience I booked another taxi with makemytrip at 10:30pmGuess what - seamless service, excellent. Driver reached 1 hour before, informed that he will wait and to take our time. MAKEMYTRIP IS A GO TO PEOPLEDont fall for this company. They pay to get sponsored on google searches."

,,,,,"I had booked cab from Chandigarh to IGI airport New Delhi on 16/11/2022 vide booking ID 202951581 and payment of Rs 1026 made as 30% in advance with a commitment that the cab will be available with carrier for the convenient journey of 4 passengers alongwith their respective 4 small size briefcases by Shri Ravi on mobile number 9230888598 with departure time ie 8.00pm .On 19/11/2022 vide message the vehicle number was intimated as PB01C1768 with driver name as Harwinder mobile number 9517999751 at 5.02 pm.I called Mr Harwinder at 6.54 and he shown his inability to perform the journey at 7.14 pm and he gave me another number 8728066709 assuring that he will pick & perform the said journey.I had extended pickup time from 8.00PMto 9.00 pm and driver reported at 8.35 pm with a  Maruti Desire Sedan cab without luggage carrier resulting we couldn't adjust all the luggage and I reported  the complete circumstances to the booking guy at number 9230888598 ,he further narrated that another call from some competent authority of GOZO will come . A call came from cell number 337122002 and wasted lot of time up to 9.30 pm pressuring that no any other vehicle will be provided & will have to adjust all in this vehicle only.Further uttering words that no refund will be initiated at all. We had to take flight for Portblair at 5.45 am with reported time at 3.30 am so we hired another taxi with a cost of Rs.5000.  I witnessed many sedan cabs on the way to Airport having carrier installed at the top. In the hired Etios all luggage was  adjusted in dickey itself.I had to pay extra amount to the tune of Rs 1300 as well refund  loss which was  paid in advance .I am going to file a legal case for this harassment as well  for loss.I would advise that the services of Gozo are worst and totally contrary to commitment and should not be availed."
