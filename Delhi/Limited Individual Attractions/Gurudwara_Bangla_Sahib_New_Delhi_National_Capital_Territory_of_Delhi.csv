Gurudwara_Bangla_Sahib,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,A large and famous gurudwara in Delhi.,"This is where one of the Sikh gurus spent time helping the poor and needy during epidemics and food shortages. It is sacred to the Sikhs and now many pilgrims come to pay their respects, and to walk in the waters that flow through the site. As with all gurudwaras, this one provides free food to all who ask for it, and it is said that over thirty thousand people eat here daily. The gurudwara also provides medical care to those who need it. For those who visit, they should remember to be respectful and to not take pictures inside the durbar hall, as well as having all men cover their heads with one of the free head coverings provided."

Gurudwara_Bangla_Sahib,dr ganapathi bhat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,""" Not to be missed""","Any major Gurudwara in India comes across as a disciplined and calm place sans beggars and trouble mongers. Gurudwara sahib is no exception. It's a huge property teeming with devotees. One need not walk an appreciable distance to gain entry into the darbar which is the main worship hall. The darshan takes a few minutes, no pushing or pulling. Down, the beautiful area filled with the holy pond or sarovar  is a sight for the sore eyes. Can't miss the delicious  prasad or Kada Prasad. There is no entry fee, plan to stay for at least two hours, you'll love the place. Best to visit in the night. One has to cover the head with a scarf. Cameras and phone can be carried but one is not allowed to click photos, though the rule is not strictly enforced.  Footwears need to be deposited at designated places. People are helpful, a sense of bonhomie pervades the entire place. A must visit in Delhi."
Gurudwara_Bangla_Sahib,Hospitality Plus,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,"Hospitality plus provide a platform for our readers to get daily news about Pakistan. All updates of Hotel management, T","Gurudwara Bangla Sahib ( listen) is one of the most prominent Sikh gurdwaras, or Sikh house of worship, in Delhi, India, and known for its association with the eighth Sikh Guru, Guru Har Krishan, as well as the holy pond inside its complex, known as the ""Sarovar."""
Gurudwara_Bangla_Sahib,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,A very unusual experience,"RELIGIONS vary across the world, but when I went to what was one of Delhi's most prominent places of Sikh worship I really had to concentrate.For a start, there were nearly 70,000 people in the site.Secondly, while I was used to taking my shoes off to visit various sites across India, I had never been asked to take my socks off as well as covering my hair.It was no big deal.....until I came to the large tray of water in which I was supposed to step to purify my feet.I am well aware of the opposing significance of feet and head in different religions, but I am still Western and religion wasn't uppermost in  my mind when I dutifully stepped into the water tray at the entrance.Instead all I could focus on was how the water had been turned into a sort of soup by the passage of tens of thousands of feet before me. I hope Sikh people respect my concerns the same way I respected their religion.Once through this mental obstacle I had a few other things to occupy my mind including how I could ever take my next step.The place was absolutely rammed, packed with worshippers, many of whom took advantage of the incredible amount of free meals being benevolently dispensed at the kitchen area which did brisk business.In some places it was so packed you were almost carried forward in a dense crowd of people keen to do everything from stroll round the central holy pond to buying religious souvenirs.The smell of sweat and the press of bodies did create a feeling of claustrophobia at times, but I shook it off because I needed to keep track of my guide. There were so many people there that I lost him three times.Finally I completed my visit and went and collected my socks and trainers only to meet an official interested in explaining Sikh religion to me.I listened and even took away a leaflet which allows me to tell you that the word ""Sikh"" means ""disciple"", a person who believes in one god and the teachings of the Ten Gurus enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh Holy Book.We chatted for a while and then I followed my guide out of the site to reach a different state of mental enlightenment, one where I didn't feel as much of the overpowering presence of religious fervour as I had in the temple.Definitely an experience I will not forget, but if you go to this temple be prepared for a demanding experience.A side issue is that no photography is allowed in the main areas."

Gurudwara_Bangla_Sahib,Anonymous,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Couples,Hostility towards taking photos even outside gurudwara,"The place is surely nice and recommended. But what I find troublesome is the hostility displayed either by the guards or some self imposed guardians regarding taking photos outside the premises. Sure one respects the place and does not take photos inside the gurdwara. But if somebody wants to have couple of picture near the lake or a selfie with gurudwara as the backdrop, I think none should have a problem with it ! One is following all the rules, covering our heads, removing the shoes, respecting the place in general. On a special occasion I had gone with my gf and as a memoir was taking a selfie to be reminiscent of the day.. some uncle from behind started shouting you taking photos go and pay chalan ! Mind you it was outside the gurudwara building.. there should be some logic in not allowing.. there are already 1000s of picture on internet including filmed from dscr.. why those allowed then ??"

The rooms got AC and there are also toilets. We were told to leave our shoes in a drawer as we have to be barefoot all over the area. We were also given orange headscarves which we need to wear while inside the temple premises. I suggest to bring your own headscarf for hygienic purposes!Our guide showed us first the kitchen where we saw volunteers help in peeling, cutting and slicing the vegetables. We also saw a lot of people sitting patiently and calmly waiting for their turn to enter the dining area for the free meal that is distributed in the temple. We were told that everybody is welcome to eat and volunteer to help in the kitchen. The food are also donated by people.The kitchen is big and got huge pots and utensils. It was impressive! You can also help make the bread. You also have to be barefoot while in the kitchen. Be careful as it can be slippery and sticky.You are also allowed to enter the temple while everybody is praying. It is really interesting! By the temple, there is also a big pool where people bathe. You can also see some fish in it.It was a sunny day and the whole place is so bright because the temple is painted white and gold. Sunglasses may be good to have while there."

Gurudwara_Bangla_Sahib,Nell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,A great communal experience ,We aren’t religious but were welcomed warmly to attend the prayers and communal dinner afterwards. A great experience in a beautiful setting. All people there were friendly and let us know what we needed to do but there was also a tourist information centre. You need to have your head covered but they have bandanas there is you don’t have a scarf: I’d recommend this to anyone visiting New Delhi.

The atmosphere in and around the temple is calm and peaceful and the most beautiful singing and praying is piped around the complex.  We removed our shoes and donned scarves to comply with the entry requirements and wandered around, exploring the temple, the sacred pond, the dining hall and the kitchens where the mammoth task of preparing meals for the thousands of visitors is conducted.  I was given the opportunity to work with the volunteers preparing roti and it was a very special experience.  The Sikhs are warm and welcoming and the memory of our visit holds a special place in my heart."

Gurudwara_Bangla_Sahib,RicherTrips,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,An impressive community work,"In case you arrive by car, it has a modern parking lot. You’ll have to remove shoes and socks and walk on a stream to wash your feet; and the floor was really cold in January. In the tourist center they give abayas for ladies and handkerchiefs for both to cover the head; I wore my scarf, but had to wear the abaya although I was wearing a tunic style blouse. Pictures are not allowed in the temple but you can take them at the entrance and in the Langar. It’s impressive to visit this huge kitchens when they’re working, and witness all the pilgrims and visitors being fed, regardless of their religion. The temple is not the finest architecture, but the ensemble withe the Sarovar or sacred pool and the Langar are an important visit."
