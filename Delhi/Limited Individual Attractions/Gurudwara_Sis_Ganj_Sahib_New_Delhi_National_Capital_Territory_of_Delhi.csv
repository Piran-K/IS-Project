Gurudwara_Sis_Ganj_Sahib,PhilthetravellerXI,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Beautiful Sikh Temple,"This lovely temple is in the midst of Old Delhi and a historic site, the martyrdom of the ninth Sikh Guru (dating back to 1675). It gives one some exposure to the Sikh religion and for me as a westerner was a great experience. A very nice old building (built in 1783), you enter in bare feet and wash your feet prior entry, the music, the reverence of the interior, the colours and the music and chants are quite amazing. It is indeed a special place. It is worth reading about the Temple before your visit (we sadly had not done that but have since done so and relived the visit reviewing the many photos taken). We now know a lot more about the history and philosophy behind the Sikh religion and way of life. It is also important to visit the kitchens and see where the huge amounts of fresh food are prepared – vegetables and breads, to feed the poor. A very worthwhile visit and a unique insight into a major part of Indian culture."

We walked around the temple through the kitchen and a dining hall, where the temple feeds roughly 20,000 people for lunch and dinner every day. Anyone can eat there rich, poor and even tourists if they wish. It was quite interesting listening to our guide explain about the Sikh religion.Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib is one of the nine historical Gurdwaras in Delhi.

Gurudwara_Sis_Ganj_Sahib,meetpetef,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Lucky to be here,"If you are Sikh or just have an interest in religions this is MUST SEE.  It is one of the nine Gurdwaras of Delhi.  You must walk in barefoot and must have your head covered (male or female).  You can see and feel the passion people have in this very religious building. The ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur was beheaded here on 11 November 1675 on the orders of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb when Guru Tegh Bahadur protested against the forceful conversion of Kashmiri Pandits and non-Muslims to Islam."
