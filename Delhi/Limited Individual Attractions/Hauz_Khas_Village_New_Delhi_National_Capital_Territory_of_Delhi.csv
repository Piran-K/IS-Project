Hauz_Khas_Village,Vinod M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Okay Okay place,Hauz khas village turned out to be a bit of disappointment for us.

Hauz_Khas_Village,ton l,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Friends,Unfair prices ,"Why does the goverment makes it so much more expensive for foreigner, locals should pay 20rupies foreigner 250 rupies. Thats pretty unfair it's a lot of goverment stiff which makes it with purpose a lot more expensive.

Hauz_Khas_Village,eamesescape,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Come for a day of exploring the outdoors & stay for the evening night life !,"The Hauz Khas Village aka HKV in South Delhi is an urban hangout hotspot as well as a heritage place . As surprising as it might sound, it is a posh neighborhood, a historical complex, and an upscale hub, all rolled into one. While Hauz Khas keeps its buoyant vibes with a wide range of modern restaurants, pubs, cafés, shopping places, and boutiques, it also retains its old-world charm through the historical complex that houses many structures from the Sultanate era. And this smooth merger of the past and the present makes it one of the top tourist attractions in Delhi. eating and drinking are Very expensive in this district, however the unique parklands with deer, heritage buildings and fantastic range of restaurants, make it a worthwhile adventure. Come for a day & stay for the evening night life !"
Hauz_Khas_Village,FreeIndianBird,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,"Restaurants, Cafes, shops worth visit","Actually it is not village maybe in old times people call it village. It is a very popular posh area of south delhi and you will see foreigners tourists. If you are a party person go in evening and if you like peace prefer to go in day time. Here you will find lots of restaurants, cafe & shops. In most of the restaurant there is lake view."
Hauz_Khas_Village,Surrey 13,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,A lovely  family hotel with excellent attention to detail,"We arrived quite late 11pm and went through a gated community area.  The son of the owners met us and one of the staff promptly took our bags to our rooms.  The rooms are spacious,  an electric heater as it can be a little  chilly first thing at this  time of year.  Complementary coffee, tea.  A large  shower which worked well. It did not have a fridge.The rooms are very quiet. Breakfast was good and served promptly. Eggs to order.  In the afternoon the first floor has a lovely terrace which you can use to enjoy the afternoon heat.The dinner is very good.  Put in a request in the morning. 600r for veg and 900r for a chicken dish.  We met the chef and the food was really good and more than enough !  We can bring in your own wine , beer.  There is a liqueur  shop about 10 mins away. They do sell beer if you want it.  A lovely dinner.The hotel provides lots of info on nearby Restuarant, shops etc and good maps. They also provide a list of possible  tourist attractions.A quite different hotel to the 'norm'.  Fabulous ethic   photos taken  by the dad in the lounge dining area.   I loved  it and felt very much at home."
Hauz_Khas_Village,Lark,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"Fun grouping of shops, restaurants, and historical site as well.",As tourists from America we enjoyed the small shops and choice of many different restaurants in Hauz Khas Village.  It was a bonus to be able to visit the ruins and walk along the duck pond after a great meal in the village.
Hauz_Khas_Village,SalimM,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Waste of time,"Not a village as such. It has grown a reputation as the place to go and be seen by the locals. Nothing going for it in my view. A couple of cafes, bars, galleries with a few paintings and a couple of boutiques with not much going for them.  Lots of touts trying to get you in to the bars. You can walk in 15 mins and that’s it. At the end of the main walkway you come to the ruins – entrance fee to be paid. There is a deer park but deers are not to be seen.  You will see a few ducks by the water. A complete waste of time considering that it is out of town and will take at least an hour or so to get there."
Hauz_Khas_Village,Naresh1936,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Blend of fashion and feast,Hauz Khas Village is a hip place for whiling away time and experiencing offbeat fashion stores and cafes. Naivaidayam is particularly good for southern cuisine.
Hauz_Khas_Village,richard t,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Complete waste of time,"8/1/2020:Overrated place. I took 10mins to complete the so-called ‘hip’ neighbourhood. Nonsense! More like a drug dealers village with absolutely nothing to offer but men standing around offering joints and magic mushrooms (Psilocybin Mushrooms) in the broad daylight. Art gallery looks crap, not even a decent cafe for coffee; Deer Park without sight of Deer. Don’t go!"
Hauz_Khas_Village,Raj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Never go to Monkey boy club,"Hauz khas village is good but never go to Monkey boy club, very unfriendly staff, and they force you to order again and again if you want to sit, otherwise they will force you to leave seat even if there is many vacant seat. We were disappointed."

Some of the eating joints face the lake and it makes a picturique view.The shops have dorned an earthy look, which compliments the ambience .A must visit place for all ."
Hauz_Khas_Village,Joost N,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Not to interesting,"Perhaps this attraction is so high rated because of the ruins, but what I have seen was not to interesting. It was nice to have some green, but I did not even make time to visit the ruins (they did not seemed to interesting). I would say visit Lodhi Gardens if you want to see park and ruins."

Hauz_Khas_Village,Ant,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,"Nice around the lake, not worth going into the buildings","A lovely walk around the lake and park which you can enter for free and enjoying looking up at the buildings and the view over the lake. The building themselves are not really worth paying for. You get to roam around but there is very limited signs to explain what you are looking at which is a shame as upon later research it is a very interesting place. Lots of the locals just climb over the wall to enter but internationals will get told off and potentially punished for doing this, with a security guard sitting just on the other side waiting for you, which was a interesting thing to watch. Finding the proper entrance can be tricky. You actually have to walk out of the park and down the road with all the shops and restaurants to then end and that is the entrance. 300 rupees so not badly priced. Would probably just walk round the lake and park if I had known."
Hauz_Khas_Village,Ida,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Nice evening walk,I loved walking around the deer park and seeing all the ruins. There are some nice restaurants as well. Worth visiting
Hauz_Khas_Village,Georgie_Fen,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,"Some good, some bad... interesting still","We were given a recommendation to come see this neighbourhood and we didn’t get off to the best starts as the pollution on the road in was dreadful, plus we were in a tuk tuk. Anyways, in we went and walked thru the main thoroughfare which is quite short honestly. Not just that, but we headed down one of the winding roads (a left of main road) and it looked like a right dump. As we were above to call it quits, we ended up wandering off again (to the right of the main road) and it was completely different - boutique coffee shops, clothing and other artisan good shops. Much nicer indeed, which helped balance our overall opinion of this place."
Hauz_Khas_Village,Jacqueline D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Amazing place,"This area is amazing.  The contrast from new and old.  What an amazing place it would be to live.  I very much liked walking around the ruins.   Unfortunately I was with a guide who only gave me 1/2 an hour here.  You could easily spend an afternoon walking around the lake, cafes and shops.   There is also a deer park that would have been nice to see."

Hauz_Khas_Village,deepti,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Once it was the coolest place!,"HKV was one of the coolest places to hang out and party but not anymore.Partially due to the Supreme Court-mandated ceiling drive and also, because of mushrooming up of substandard bars and pubs has ruined the vibe of this place.Yet, some of the places like Social, Kunzum Cafe and boutiques like Ogaan has kept the grace of the place alive.However, antique and pawn shops are great here.Also, deer park and Hauz Khas fort are places to visit here."

Walking thru the busy market full of Curio, Fashion apparels and Watering holes is this historic water facing fortress dating back to the Mughal era. Vehicles are not allowed to come past the check point except for some locals/special permission vehicles. The streets are narrow lined with shops.Once inside the fortress it's a different world altogether with ruins of past, greens and huge water body. Its relatively quieter except for if you have company of some noisy youngster/prankster or group. its a perfect place to spend winter noons basking in bit of sun and a whole lot of history.If you wish to explore the place then be prepared to walk up and down rocky stairs or rubble.

The streets are packed with touts trying to lure you into doorways and side-alleys and whilst there are some good restaurants (Yeti is one) others are not so great. There is a degree of intimidation and a strong male presence which is not at all Indian.Much more a place for the under 30's."

Approached by a guard, who coerced me into following him while he talked about the ruins. Something I did not ask for. Then once in a secluded place, extorted me for a tip. Of course, he was a security guard and I’m just a visitor. I gave a small tip so he would stop harassing me. Soured my afternoon, so I left right away. Beautiful and relaxing place overall. But that experience was just unfortunate as a tourist in this beautiful country. "

This is not what I expected , I thought it must a modern place with decent restaurants, but found it unorganized and very okay types . We had gone around 9 pm . I was not impressed at all.

Hauz_Khas_Village,Mrphyx,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Great escape from the city,"Love this area, maybe because I'm not into huge city's and this place is definately an escape from the city. Lots of great food and cool drinks in the area and the park and tombs are beautiful. If you like small boutique shops you won't be disappointed either.The bars are quite expensive and some can be quite loud but usually the rooftop open air ones are more relaxed."

Hauz_Khas_Village,Rahul R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Business,"Hauj khaas, a site for academicians","As a tourist guide I always felt sad not being able to show to my foreigner guests a place of historical significance in Delhi in the field of Academics, until I made a visit to Hauj khaas. The place was built by Firojshah Tughlaq in the medieval period to encourage Islaamic studies. The building is too vast and double stories with a huge 13th century Haujkhaas surrounded by it from two sides. Manytimes, the teachers and students would come to the sides of Hauj and have extensive classes amidst cool breezes coming from Pond. If you need my services as a guide, call me at 7838251519"

Hauz_Khas_Village,LizzieWallis,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,Lovely sunset viewpoint,"We were a bit disappointed by Hauz Khas Village - there was a lovely view point to see the sunset in the deer park, some ruined monuments, lots of history. We didn't spend much time exploring the deer park or reservoir, as we were there for dinner and the park shuts at sunset.I was expecting more from the 'village' - it seemed to be one main road of very noisy restaurants. I thought there would be more cafes/bars rather than 'dives'.We struck lucky in finding the Coast Cafe (see separate review) which was an oasis of calm amidst the noise. Perhaps we are just not their target market (we are over 55's)."

Hauz_Khas_Village,Theholehog,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,A hidden delight!,"Ask people in Delhi about Hauz Khas and most of them will talk about the chic cafes, boutiques, restaurants and bars. Very few will tell you - because most of the locals don't know about it - about the Hauz Khas complex or ruins. It is only the really knowledgeable local who will tell you about this delightful gem hidden at the end of the market. The ruins of Hauz Khas comprise a small fort, a madrasa (Muslim religious school), tombs and pavilions, they were built in the 14th Century by Allauddin Khilji and Sultan Firoz Shah Tughluq. Firoz Shah's tomb is also part of the complex. Those were the days when Delhi was a Sultanate.  Indeed, as you walk along the market, you will see nothing about the ruins until you reach the very end of the street. It is a good place to spend a couple of hours in, preferably before the sun hits the roof. Sitting on the ramparts of the fort or in one of the pavilions in the garden is a favourite activity of many. If you are interested in history, you could keep aside two hours to explore these ruins. Afterwards, you can stroll through the Hauz Khas market or hit one of the pubs/eateries there to fortify yourself. :)"
