Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,DIL KHAN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Solo,SERENITY  AND SPIRITUALITY AT ITS BEST,This dargah it’s just a place of worship. It’s a place where you forget all your worries  and submit to yourself to the Sufi Kalam and aura that surround the place .if in delhi it is a  quintessential to visit this on a qwaali night listening to those Sufi singer heal your soul..It’s my third time here… will go again if ever I visit delhi
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Sarang,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021 • Family,Safe and divine place,"Absolutely a safe place for women, no one is there to harm anyone as there is a separate place to them to be at dargah in parda (not directly visible to the mazaar) but yet close enough to pray and experience the divinity of the place. At the entry some shopkeepers will approach you to buy offerings like chadar rose petals, essences from yet and also for the safe keeping of your footwear but it totally upto you if you respond to them or not. Go there sit, visit dargah walk freely and simply ignore-respectfully (if you wish) when you are asked for donations etc. Muslim, sikh, hindus and even christians visit this holy place for taking blessings and get rid of unwanted spiritual/worldly loads and troubles."

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Brun066,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,"After the Great Mosque, the most evocative Islamic place of worship in Delhi.","We learned from our guidebook that this complex, not far from the Humayun mausoleum, was worth visiting. So, after the visit to that mausoleum, we got transported to it by a motorickshaw.This is a high place for Muslim worship in present-day India.Dargah means mausoleum. Nizamuddin (full name: Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya, 1238-1325) is a Sufi saint, belonging to the "" Chishti"" order. The order originated in present-day Afghanistan and is one of the four main orders of the sect of Sufi mystical ""monks"". Within the Chishti order, I learned that Nizamuddin is the founder of a particular branch, called precisely ""Chishti Nizami"". The surrounding neighborhood was named after him, and also the nearby Hazrat Nizamuddin station, which is today one of the three main railway stations in Delhi.Here the Nizamuddin shrine stands (which, however, is much later than him; as far as I read it dates back to 1562), together with other buildings, which host other shrines, shops related to his cult, and also a small baoli (stepwell).To get to the mausoleum, from the spot of Lodhi Road where our motorickshaw left us, we walked a narrow, picturesque and crowded pedestrian street, lined with shops of all kinds. These shops are evidently favored by the continuous influx of shrine worshippers. After passing through an entrance arch, the shops also continue inside, further narrow and winding. Finally, after skirting the baoli, you reach the very crowded area where the shrine stands, under a large, highly decorated marble canopy surmounted by an onion-shaped dome.No less evocative are other shrines that flank the courtyard where the main one stands.Behind an offer, we received our tray of rose petals, with which to sprinkle the shrine.The whole is extremely picturesque. And it certainly would have been even more so, if we had stayed until sunset, when, apparently, the Sufis sing poignant religious hymns. But it was not in our program to dwell so much.As far as we could understand, after the Great Mosque this is the most evocative Islamic place of worship in Delhi."
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Madhulika L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Busy, commercialized but still spiritual","One of the greatest and most-revered Sufi saints of the Chishtiya silsila (order), Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya spent much of his life in Delhi and died here in 1325 CE. In his lifetime itself, Nizamuddin had become an immensely popular and powerful figure, so his tomb or dargah became one of Delhi’s holiest spots very soon. In fact, because it was believed that the grave of a holy man would impart blessings on the surrounding area, many famous and powerful people, including Humayun, Jahanara, Mohammad Shah ‘Rangeela’, Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan, were buried in the vicinity (if not right within the enclosure of the dargah itself).The dargah is easily reached on foot from the main road (Mathura Road), a little before the Nizamuddin Police Station. The lane soon narrows down and becomes a covered pathway, with shops on either side, selling flowers, chaadars, incense, attar, and other items of worship as well as souvenirs for pilgrims. You need to just keep following the path, and you’ll soon arrive at the dargah enclosure. Here you need to remove your shoes. Either leave them at one of the shops outside (almost all of them offer racks for this purpose, and the one where we left our shoes didn’t even accept the money we offered). Or, if you want to carry them in, take off the shoes and hold them in your hand in such a way that the soles face each other—the principle being that the unclean soles of the shoes should not accidentally even face hallowed ground.Inside, the first building you’ll see, with a red-painted exterior and a somewhat unusual white marble dome, is the tomb of Amir Khusro, the famous poet and statesman, who was also a very good friend of Nizamuddin’s. Legend has it that Khusro was so heartbroken when Nizamuddin died that he died of grief six months later. Beyond Amir Khusro’s tomb is a grave enclosure surrounded on all sides by carved screens of white marble. This houses the graves of several people, including, notably, the Princess Jahanara (she was a Sufi mystic too, and in keeping with her faith, asked for her grave to be left open to the skies; this is why her cenotaph has a portion left uncovered except for mud). Also buried in the same enclosure is the hedonist Mughal Emperor Mohammad Shah ‘Rangeela’. Adjacent to this grave enclosure is an impressive building, mostly of beautifully carved red sandstone: this is the Jamaat Khaana mosque, built in the early 14th century. Right opposite the main doorway of the mosque, and the epicenter of activities in the enclosure, is the dargah of Nizamuddin. Women are not allowed to enter inside the chamber, but there are designated spaces in the corridor outside where women may sit. As it is, the area all around the tomb (which has been renovated and embellished time and again over the centuries) has carpets etc where you can sit to either pray in silence, or listen to the qawwalis that are often sung here. On the opposite side of the enclosure from the Jamaat Khaana mosque is yet another enclosure with a carved screen of white marble surrounding it. This is the tomb of the Mughal Prince Mirza Jahangir, son of Akbar II. Mirza Jahangir, angry with the then British Resident Seton for opposing Mirza Jahangir’s claim to the throne, tried to assassinate Seton but failed, and was subsequently exiled to Allahabad. Mirza Jahangir’s distraught mother prayed and vowed that if her son was returned, she would go to the Dargah of Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (in Mehrauli) to lay a chaadar there as offering. This did come about (Mirza Jahangir was allowed back into Delhi a couple of years later) and his mother’s votive offering became the basis of the annual festival which is today known as the Phoolwaalon ki Sair. The Dargah gets especially crowded on Thursdays, and even on weekends, the rush begins fairly early. So if you want to beat the crowds, it’s best to go early in the morning."
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,manojjjj2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,very effetive,"Hazrat nizamuddin aulia dargah is one of the peaceful places ever. A person feels the vibe there and peace of mind. All the stress is releaved and vanished. The evenings are filled with prayers and qoires, the ambinece is out of the world. The scented fowers are a attracted spot. Must visit place."
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,MedhaviG,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Peaceful place to visit,"Wonderful and peaceful place to visit!To visit, leave your shoes with any of the stores outside the entrance. You may need to buy a plate of flowers/offerings for 50-100 rupees. The Dargah has Sufi music around 8pm every night except Thursdays. Sit on the ground and enjoy in peace. "
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,FreeIndianBird,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,First Time visitors will get difficulty to find entrance gate,If you are visiting Dargah for the first time it is better to ask someone about entrance gate else it will not be easy. It is situated in a residential area and you have go through narrow galiyan of delhi and market maybe you will not feel comfortable first time but do not worry people are good there. On Thursday there is Live Kawwali's  if you are interested reach at 6.30 pm to get place.
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Ian R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Not too difficult to visit; don't be put off,"I very nearly decided not to visit the Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah and Chausath Khamba because of several reviews mentioning unwanted harassment and general unpleasantness in the area.  But I had a free morning, and decided to attempt a visit.  It was surprisingly straightforward and easy, and I was glad I went.Nizamuddin village is quite small and the Dargah is fairly central within it.  By asking for directions once or twice I came to the entrance easily enough.  Directions were readily given.  On my way I encountered several demands to buy flowers or other gifts, or deposit shoes for safekeeping, but a polite refusal was always sufficient.  I kept my shoes on until I was at the very threshold of the Dargah compound, and then left them with a shopkeeper who seemed happy with 20 rupees which I gave on leaving.  At no time while on the way there, or at the shrine, was any payment necessary.  People there were polite and helpful.There is more than one entrance to the Dargah compound;  I found there was less hassle while approaching from the east.  The Dargah, mosque and Amir Khusrau's and Jahanara's tombs are all in one compound.The Dargah and Amir Khusrau's tomb were pretty, and nicely decorated.  I enjoyed seeing them , but I like that sort of thing.  If visiting Humayun's tomb, I think this is a worthwhile addition if time permits.The Chausath Khamba is a short distance to the east of the Dargah compound."
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Ann C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Entrance not easy to find,We tried to walk here from Humayun's Tomb and let me tell you...the entrance is NOT easy to find...we walked past it a few times and I am pretty seasoned with getting around by myself.  This is the rare occasion were I recommend that you get an auto-rickshaw from the metro to take you directly there.
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,ghoomboom,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,No information for Visitors,"In the middle of narrow alleys, this is the tomb of Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia, great Sufi Saint of 13th century. This is a holi place for Muslims and one has to leave the shoes outside and cover his head to enter the shrine. There is no fixed place to keep your shoes and the shop that you buy flower basket would also keep your shoes. Beware of middle man and there is lot of bargaining. The place is purely a religious place and does not provide any information board for the visitors. There is also the tomb of Amir Khusro in the same premises, famous poet of 12the century India, who was disciple of Hazrat Nizamuddin. As the custom is, one has to visit dargah of Amir Khusro first then the dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin. Just beside the Dargah, there is a Mosque to offer Namaz (Prayers). Qawwalis are also sung in the Dargah every day."
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,macedonboy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin,"The Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah is a islamic shrine to the Sufi saint, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya. Very popular and commercial. The dargah is accessible from a warren of streets lined with vendors trying to sell you shrine offerings and insisting you have to take your shoes off and leave it with them. Just ignore them, I took my shoes off and carried it with me. The building of the shrine does look nice and is very similar to other Mughal era dargahs, but other than that this is one for the faithful, me thinks."
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,thameem k,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,dargah is good but lot of middle man,Dargah main entry is very narrow. lots of middle man trying to loot money. i didnt find any security people . This should have been well maintained but not sure why this is not take care.
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Sabeera A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah,"It is the durga of H. Nizamuddin , a soofi  saint. during 12th century . It is a wonderful experience . The quwalli singing together with the ambiance was intoxicating and uplifting. Peoples were worshiping by flowers"
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Rob_Ireland,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,"Scammers heaven, beware ","So many people seem to be on the make off tourists backs here. I  went through 3 “ pay points “ where you give money to the mosque, the school, the singers etc. At each subsequent pay point, I was told my receipt was invalid. The singing was nice but the whole experience left a very poor impression of the place. Nowhere else in India has this happened me. "
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Ansari Iqbal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah,"Syed Muhammad Nizamuddin Auliya (1238 – 3 April 1325), also known as Mahbub-e-Ilahi ""Beloved of God"" was a Sunni Muslim scholar, Sufi saint of the Chishti Order, and unarguably one of the most famous Sufis on the Indian Subcontinent. His predecessors were Fariduddin Ganjshakar, Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki, and Moinuddin Chishti, who were the masters of the Chishti spiritual chain or silsila in the Indian subcontinent. Nizamuddin Auliya was one of the world's most famous saints and a spiritual successor of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer. The dargah was built in 1325. It was renovated and decorated by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, as well as by later rulers. The present structure was constructed by a nobleman named Faridun Khan in 1562 AD. This grand tomb has lattice screens, marble arches and courtyards. Devotee’s ties red threads to these screens with a belief that their wishes would be granted. Tomb of Amir KhusroThe Parrot of India, Abul Hasan Known as Amir Khusro Dehlavi (1253-1325) was a renowned musician, poet and lyricist of Hindi and Persian. The chief disciple and a devoted friend of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, he is said to have pined away and died of grief six months after the death of the saint. Amir Khusro’s tomb stands south of Nizamuddin’s, opposite the main entrance to the Dargah Complex. Sabz BurjGreen Dome or Baghdadi tomb a striking blue-domed known as Sabz Burj, literally, `Green Dome’, Historians consider the Sabz Burj tomb is constructed to be for Fahim Khan, who died in 1626 A.D. He was an attendant to Abdur Rahim Khan during 4th Mughal emperor Jahangir's reign. There is no grave inside.Tomb of Jahanara “Let naught cover my grave save the green grass; for grass well suffices as a covering for the grave of the lowly”. An inscription is written on the marble-slab ofJahanara grave 1614-1681, the daughter of emperor Shahjahan and Mumtaz. She was very close to Shahjahan, and is renowned for having voluntarily shared her father’s imprisonment after he was deposed by his son Aurangzeb. The Tomb of Jahanara stands in the southwest corner of the Dargah Complex. Built in 1681 while Jahanara was still alive, it stands in a four-sided enclosure of white marble jalis with a decorative strip of carved marble running all around the top. The other graves are of other members of the Mughal royal family.Tomb of Mirza JahangirLies to the east of Dargah, Mirza Jahangir was the eldest son of the Emperor Akbar Shah II, who after a failed atempt to assassinate the British Resident Seton, was exiled to Allahabad in 1808. His mother vowed that if he were allowed to return to Delhi, she would make a pilgrimage to the shrine of Sheikh Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki in Mehrauli. This wish was granted, and the queen’s promise was duly fulfilled and eventually became an annual event that continues even today and is known as Phoolwalon ki Sair. He and his brother Mirza Babar are both buried within, but oddly enough the marble graves of both were originally placed over the bodies of other people. Tomb of Mirza Ghalib Just beyond the Ghalib Academy, a fenced enclosure houses the tomb of Delhi’s poet laureate, Mirza Asadullah Khan `Ghalib’ (1796-1869). Acknowledged to be one of the greatest poets of Persian and Urdu ever, Ghalib lived most of his life in Delhi. He was buried here when he died in 1869. Chausath Khamba 64 pillars an ancient tomb was constructed by Mirza Aziz Koka, the son of Atgah Khan, during the period from 1623 to 1624. Mirza Aziz Koka (Khan-i-Azam) (c. 1542 – c. 1624) also known as Kotaltash, foster brother of Akbar. According to inscriptions, the structure houses the tomb of Mirza Aziz Koka. It was built as a mausoleum for himself, at the time of Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Mirza Aziz Koka had served several times as Jahangir's Governor of Gujarat before he died in Gujarat. The tomb of his father, Atgah Khan, the Prime Minister of Akbar, is also in the vicinity. In addition, there are several other unidentified tombs inside the monument.Urs MahalAssembly Hall located in front of the Chausath Khamba, is assembly hall where Khawwali programs are held on festival days and during Urs (Death Anniversary) of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya. Barah Khamba12 Pillars The structure is located in an open park and is easily visible and accessible, leafy park known as Mirza Ghalib Park. Barakhamba Monument is a 14th-century tomb building from the Tughlaq period within this stands Barah Khamba there is a tomb of an unidentified person. The partially demolished remains of Lal Mahal are situated close to the tomb. This heritage monument also called by Kushak Lal was built by Balban (1266-1286), the Slave Dynasty ruler, during the rule of Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah. This red sandstone structure had prominent chhatris which have been demolished.Baoli (Well)Hazrat Nizamuddin’s Chashma Dilkusha “Heart Uplifting Spring”, the well was constructed under the supervision of Nizamuddin Aulia himself, and its water therefore is believed to be sacred and to have curative powers. The building of the baoli in 1321/22 had become the major bone of contention between Nizamuddin and the then ruler of Delhi, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq. The emperor was at that time building his citadel at Tughlaqabad, and he summarily forbade all labourers in Delhi from working during the day at any site other than Tughlaqabad. The labourers, however, held Nizamuddin in such esteem that they got around Ghiyasuddin’s ban by working on the baoli’s (Well) construction at night."

Just remove your shoes and hold them in your hands and go to the main Dargah area, you can put your shoes there near the water taps or any convenient place.BEWARE of Maulanas there, they'll tell you to contribute some amount and will be having a diary/book to write your name.Instead of you want to donate money, you directly out the money inside Donation Box inside main Dargah of Nizamuddin Aulia Baba and also donation box is in Baba Amir Khusro dargah too.HOW TO REACHI went there from Nizamuddin Railway Station, there pick up the DTC Bus and reach the Neeli Gumbuz(Blue Dome) and there the Dargah is at a walkable distance of just 400Metres."

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Reedeg,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Very Special Place,"I was reluctant to go here after reading some horror stories but I had a very nice visit as a solo (male) traveler.  This is a congested area on a good day so I came with bare essentials secured and left valuables at the hotel.   Staying in Aerocity, I took Uber which was about 250 IR.  My driver dropped me at the entrance to the alley that led to the entrance and it was a 5 min walk.  I was offered some flowers but a polite no thank-you was accepted and I walked on.  I left my sandals at the entrance with a guy who gave me a metal tag and he seemed happy with 20 IR at the end.  Inside the shrine emotions were high as has been my experience at pilgrimage sites of all faiths.  If you are expecting a serene meditation experience than this would not be the place for you.  There is a lot of activity.   I found a spot to take in the procession of worshipers and enjoyed the Qawwali music that began about 6pm on a Friday night.   I have no doubt that there are lots of unscrupulous characters lurking about who would take advantage given the opportunity so plan accordingly.  I was glad that I came to see for myself."

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Lizzy & Mick,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Horrible!,"After reading the glowing review from the Lonely Planet, describing HND as both magical and mystical, myself & my partner were keen to experience it for ourselves.First mistake- we went on a Sunday not realising that this is one of the busiest days.Secondly we were not prepared for the haranguing, hassling and hostile atmosphere that greeted us. We were expected to buy gifts for the shrine, the stall holder loaded us up and then when my partner refused to buy everything, some irate man shouted ‘ cheater, cheater!’.We did buy the flowers, I covered my head with my cardigan because I was not going to be forced into buying a headscarf from a pushy stall holder. When we got into the packed Dargah area, we were met with disapproving looks even though we had conformed to the dress code, bought the flowers, were shoeless and completely respectful! We tried to sit down somewhere and were barked at and given more scathing stares...and that was the final straw. We gave our flowers away and left.So much for the doctrine of tolerance Nizam ud din taught, because it was completely lacking when we visited.We have loved India but this was the worst, and a horrible experience."

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Miranda H,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Scary!,"Sadly I agree with the other negative reviews.  I visited with my husband - we are in our early 50's - & by the time we visited this place, were used to being in very crowded situations & being hassled to buy stuff.  However this place felt a bit hostile & it was the only time in India I felt uneasy & was quite frankly outraged at the women having to wait outside the temple & give their gifts to men who were the only ones allowed in.  It didn't feel friendly, was absolutely packed (we went mid afternoon on a Sunday) & beggars, who you are used to seeing outside temples, lined the very narrow cobbled alleyways all the way inside.  The actual pond is screened off so you can only catch glances through jali windows.  The only joy was seeing my husband haggling with 2 hat sellers directly inside (he needed to cover his head).  Just grateful to come away in one piece & to find that noone had nicked my flipflops!"
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,halis67,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,An “experience” but not a joy,"I’m no shrinking violet but going here with my wife and two 13 year old daughters was not what I would describe as a great experience or indeed, a fair taste of India. Not sure what place the Lonely Planet reporter went to but it wasn’t the same place as me!!An interesting enough walk down a bustling market alley gets you to the small entrance to this Sufi shrine, but at this point you are first hit by the unwelcome feeling of being in a “very big crowd in a small place where you have absolutely no idea of what is going on”..... And then the hustling....oh yes, the hustling....lots of it. Being the only foreigners there we were clearly the honey around which the bees would gather....It starts apace with first the flower sellers and then the headscarf sellers and then more flower sellers and then the religious sweet sellers and then the candle sellers.....and then the “charity” collectors....To be very honest, despite an apparent religious significance and holiness, this temple shrine is actually not much more than a chaotic madhouse....and not one for the uninitiated.... with crowds of people only too eager to relieve you of your pennies. We spent about 30-40 minutes here and the whole time I felt concerned for both my possessions and my family,  as you are continuously disorientated by people constantly coming at you from all directions. Without the crowds it would probably be a pretty and fascinating place, but I didn’t get to experience any of that I’m afraid. Now I’m not a religious person at all, but I was struck by one thought while I was in this place (while not thinking about protecting my wallet)....something I remembered from my old Religious Studies lessons at school, about Jesus and the money changers....so I googled the passage when I got back to the hotel and this passage pretty much sums up my thoughts about what the authorities need to do having visited this place today......... “And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.""  So, if you’re up for it, good luck but if you are not up for a challenge steer clear....until some order is imposed on this place. "

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,SamRawal,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,"Pickpockets, snactchers, beggers....the piety and the pious have flown away","I have been a regular visitor to the Hazrat Nizammudin Dargah for many years. However my recent visit left me saddened at the state of affairs. Everyone second person is out to loot you. Starting with the pickpockets, there are hundreds of them and they form a gang. They will encircle you while you are praying, or when you bow to light the agarbatti they will flick your wallet from behind. When you stand in the queue you will find people checking you out. Outside the main mausoleum you will find people with huge fans who will try to divert your attention while the next person uses that opportunity to get to your money. The entrance is lined with people who sells a small bunch of roses at extremely high costs. When you take the ""tokri"" of roses in your hand you will see it is elevated from the centre to look big. In reality it is a small set of rose petals which are recycled and spread out on the tokri to look big. Then there is another set of people, usually dressed in white clothes, looking elegant , they are the so called Khadims. They are the ones who will sell you ""dua-prayer"" for a price. These khadims are supposed to be caretakers of the Dargah but in reality they lead from the front when it comes to corruption and crime. They may not indulge in it directly but they do patronize it. Then you have the street food vendors. These people connive with the beggars to sell you coupons for food distribution. I was so upset and mentally exhausted seeing all this criminality that I was ashamed to think what Amir Khusrau and Hazrat saheb might be thiking. This Dargah needs to be handed over to the Govt to run or to a body like the Vaishno Devi Shrine board. They can turn it around and take it back to where it belongs- the fountainhead of spirituality."

Walk in through the narrow winding paths and come sit here for a bit. Listen to the live Qawwali (best chance to catch it is on Fridays).

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Team Charlie,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Avoid!,"The Lonely Planet lists this as a top sight in New Delhi.  We were dropped off by a taxi at the end of a busy street, which we walked down with no idea where we were going.  After some time, we asked a shopkeeper for directions.  He pointed us into a bustling market / alley and warned us to avoid flower sellers.  We didn't realise what he meant until we'd left our shoes at what we thought was the shoe rack and then realised - having been handed two plates of flowers - that this was one of the flower sellers.  We assume they wait until you come back to charge you for the flowers and refuse to return your shoes until you do so.  Thanks to the shopkeeper's tip we took our shoes and carried on as soon as we realised.  We fought our way (shoeless) through the rest of the market until we arrived at the outside of the mosque.  All we could see was the roof of the mosque and hundreds of people squished up into a small space outside.  It seemed a bit too much like hard work so we gave up and headed home!  Needless to say, we wouldn't bother with this again."

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Aryaman S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,A must visit place in Delhi,"Had a very enriching and peaceful experience at the Dargah. THURSDAY visit is recommended because of the 2 Qawwali sessions, one in the evening (6:30 - 8:00) and other in the night (8:30 - 10:00).Few important points to take care of:1. A very narrow lane takes you to the Dargah from the Mathura Road entrance (main entry point to the area) with a few diversions on the way. So, an effective way to keep track of the correct path is to follow the lane which has shops selling Chaddar, Flowers, etc. items on both it's sides.2. On the way to Dargah many shopkeepers will try to persuade you, that too very intensely, to keep your shoes at their shops as the Dargah starts right from their shops. DO NOT get into the trap. There is an official place just at the entrance to the dargah where you should keep your shoes. They will give you a proper token. Please see the attached PHOTO of this place for reference!!3. Photography is allowed (except in the inner sanctum where ladies are not allowed to enter).4. Carefully observe the carvings and paintings on the four walls of the Dargah. They are really beautiful. Impressive architecture.5. It is not mandatory to cover your head with a cloth or cap.6. Be vigilant throughout your trip to the entire area as many pickpocketers are present.7. Do not take your shoes in your hand or by your side inside the Dargah. I had come across one such individual during my visit!8. Also, see the tomb of Amir Khusro that is present inside the compound itself. He was the disciple of Saint Nizamuddin Auliya and the court scholar under the Khilji's of the Delhi Sultanate. It is said that so intense was his love and devotion for his Guru that he died soon after hearing the news of the death of N. Auliya in 1325. He was primarily responsible for developing the genre of Qawwali.Moreover, enjoy the visit by immersing yourself into the spiritual environment that gets created there because of the intoxicating mix of faith, history, music and love!"
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,keith h,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017,Mausoleum of Sufi Saint,"The Dargah of Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya is in the Nizamuddin complex, an historic area opposite Humayun's Tomb.   Enter the area & proceed past stalls & shops then under a covered, zig-zag pathway sidelined by sellers of devotional gifts. I'm not usually caught out but here I was in that I accepted a paper plate containing flowers, a cap & green/gold cloths The die was cast because as I reached the dargah I found myself down for donations to various good causes listed in a book. Following this, I scattered my flowers on the tomb. Needless to say, my plate supplier was waiting on my return for his fee. Of course, if you are a devotee, feel free to indulge.  However, worth a visit to enjoy the activities around the dargah & be sure to look in at the old mosque whose domes rear behind the dargah."

One also finds a lot of flower selling shops asking you to leave your foot wear there...basically they are looking out for customers for the flowers and other articles for sale.There is a good shoe keeping facility just as you enter the Dargah, so there is no need to leave it in other shops.It is a deligtful experience and it is worth visiting in the  evening"

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Vyanams,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,"Women should not go here unaccompanied, but the qawwalis are wonderful","I went on a Thursday night to pay respects at the famous Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah and hear the legendary qawwalis that take place here. Having visited many religious sites within and outside of India, I am relatively familiar with the setup - there will be stalls outside the shrine selling offerings, usually you buy something from a stall and keep your shoes with them, proceed into the shrine and pay your respects, spend the time you wish to in there, then leave and collect your shoes from the stall.Imagine this process, but with 10x the amount of hostility and yelling.I would strongly, strongly encourage any women travellers to go with a male companion or to join a tour group / use a guide. I am very used to going to religious sites on my own and have never felt as keenly my vulnerability as I did here. Having gone on my own, it was a profoundly upsetting, tumultuous experience that I will probably not repeat ever again.For one thing, travelling on your own makes you an instant target for a lot of yelling. Male shopkeepers were yelling at me the whole way walking in from the main road to the shrine (which, by the way, is a long walk down some very crowded alleys). They were yelling about how I needed to cover my head and absolutely had to buy something to gift the shrine (you only need to cover your head inside the shrine and lots of women were uncovered. However, they were walking along with men so were mostly ignored).Once I finally stopped at a stall and bought a gift for the shrine, the shopkeeper started piling more and more things into my hands insisting that all these items were necessary. I insisted I didn't need them but then the yelling commenced again. I finally just grabbed one item and went into the shrine.Inside the dargah, there was a wholly different set of issues. If you do not plan to offer prayers there and are more interested in the qawwalis, I would recommend arriving after 7pm, instead of during prayer time (which was around 6.30pm). I was barked at by the religious staff, repeatedly told by one of them to go and pray because it was time for namaaz (again, lots of other non-Muslims were milling around not doing it but they were with male companions).One man associated with the dargah started instructing me to follow the process for paying respects, which I was happy to do, but then he pulled out a book and asked how much I wanted to donate to the dargah. As soon as I said I would think about it he snapped it shut and walked off. Once the prayer time was done, there was another dargah-associated man sternly telling the women there to be pious. He said things like ""Really you've done your prayers but you're not reading any sunnahs? What is the point of calling yourself Muslim?"" ""These women - their heads might be covered but they have no piety.""You will not be able to go into the sanctum sanctorum as only men are allowed in there - you can, however, stand outside and look through the openings in a lattice wall. When a woman (I imagine unknowingly) tried to go in, she was again barked at - ""Dont go into the sanctum sanctorum it's for men only what are you thinking?!"" etc etc.Aside from all of this, there are a large number of people who will be asking you for donations, begging, etc. Give as your heart and wallet will allow, but also be prepared to be constantly tapped on the shoulder / arm / waist.Overall, there was very little spirituality or positive vibrations to be felt in this place, so I would not recommend it from that perspective. That said, I am adding one star to this review because the qawwalis really are absolutely lovely. The singers are full of passion and heart, the atmosphere is quite electric, and if you are a fan of qawwalis, it is a great experience. To sum up: Women should - travel with a male companion or a guide- go after the main prayer time; around 7 - 7.15pm should be good- wear your head covering from the time you get down from your car / bus / train etc- keep your head down, look stern, and resolutely ignore all the shopkeepers yelling at you. There is actually a place to leave your shoes just outside the dargah for a small fee, so you absolutely do not need to buy anything from the stalls if you do not want to. I paid about Rs 500 for the gifts to the shrine because I was so overwhelmed by the yelling, but you can learn from my experience.- stay in the main courtyard where the qawwalis are going to take place and find a good spot to sit down- have some small currency notes ready in case you want to leave a donation to the qawwals, or for the people asking for donations- be mentally prepared for the whole experience."

Thanks to my friend circle, I happen to be present at all types of Musical gatherings. Sufi Music is not a musical gathering, it'd be more appropriate to call it a Sama, as they say it in Urdu. Truly magical, if listened to the lyrics carefully, it transports you to a different world altogether. As a Delhiite, I can't get enough of this place. It's got its own essence and mystical feel.. As first timers, please do not feel obliged to donate any monies inside. Do it, if you really want to.. There's no compulsion.. Allah Bless.."
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Mukul A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,Spiritual! ,"I parked my car at Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station and took a rickshaw towards the dargah. It took me about 20 minutes to reach there. The place is a little crowded almost everyday. There are lots of shops on the way to the dargah. If you buy a 'chadar' and the other holy material, the vendor of that shop will allow you to keep your slippers at that shop. Make sure you remove your slippers at the shop nearest to the entrance of the dargah and don't pay more than 100-150 bucks for the material purchased. The dargah is known for its qawwali sessions on Thursday and has been featured in a lot of movies. There are two dargahs inside. "

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Gaurav Manu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Business,Go Seek the Blessings of Nizamuddin Aulia...,"You probably do not review a religious place, as it has more to do with faith and feeling that practical/material aspect.This is one of the holiest shrines in delhi and been an identity of city, you reach this place throw narrow alleys amidst the smoke of food... approach might not be very clean for ppl with OCD, however with the kind of footfall it is comparatively kept quite well.The whole coplex comprises of multiple tombs, including tomb of poets like Amir Khusro and Ghalib.. Which itself makes this place worth a visit.Every thursday night, specially during ""Urs"" this place is ""the"" place to be, for culture and music lovers. You see all sort of people listening to full night qawalli sessions.Just go there and feel the place, get blessing of Nizamuddin Aulia, the guardian saint of my city.Word of advise:- Do keep yourself covered for sake of local sensibilities and ladies are not allowed inside the final sanctum sanctorum as a matter of tradition, no offense."

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Nitsnath123,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Peaceful,"Visited thisDargah on a solo trip. Have seem this dargah many times in movies, and heard a lot about it, hence, visited this place. The approach to this Dargah is bit narrow and crowded however, once you reach the main building it gives you different feeling. It is open for all and no need to cover your head. However, women are not allowed inside the main part of Dargah, but can offer prayer from some distance."
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,Akshay G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Needs a lots of maintenance,I went there after seeing this place in movie Rockstar. But I was led down. It was nothing as shown in the movie.Small and dirty lanes to reach this place. Lanes are full of beggers. Which can even follow you. So Take care of your belongings.After reaching the dargah. That place also needs maintenance. People also throw garbage here or there. 
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,arizazealuis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Great experience. Be aware of entering the shrine if non-Muslim.,"The whole place is dirty and poor but very pretty. It was very interesting/adventure like walking through the bazaars. There was a sign in English prohibiting entrance to the shrine to ladies and therefore my mom and sister stayed outside and I walked in with my dad (both non-Muslims). When we exit the shrine, there was a furious old man who grabbed my dad by the arm and asked him if he was Muslim. We managed to walkway from the situation and meet my mom and sister which were being harassed by people taking pictures of them. We all walked very fast to exit the place. Overall the experience was very interesting and adventurous. However I think the experience could easily be negative to westerns. Specially ladies alone."
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,MakkD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,the holy place which could be cleaner too,"Being religious & respected place could get a place 5 star rating, like this one.I visited this place on a Thursday which is also the day they perform musical prayers at this mosque which has its name in the name of sufi saint. The whole neighbourhood is crowded crazy even for Indian standards, and one has to be on alert all the time. I was in group of 12 people which made is bit bearable as to move within the dirty lanes to reach the mosque. However we were successful in securing a good spot to watch the musical ""qwwali"" being performed by many musician using Indian instruments. We also watched many people dancing in trance. It was different kind of experience. If you are not able to shake off the inconvenience of reaching there, you might have difficulty in comprehending the real thing. Few pointers:1. Keep your belonging secured, you would moving in very crowded lanes of a very dense area 2. dress appropriately ( both men and women), it is not mandatory to cover all over body but its not bad choice either, covering your head is only necessary if one enter in inner most room. Anyway carry a handkerchief, you can use it for wiping your sweat if nothing else. 3. you dont have to buy anything at all, rose petals, white, green whatever color cloths. you can just go in and come out when you feel like 4. Shoes: there is arrangement for keeping your shoes safe at  the main entry to the shrine. Dont put your shoes just anywhere. There will be guy who will keep them safe and you get a token which you can return when you come back.  5. Keep your mindset open and nose close. Winter are better to visit then summers for obvious reasons."

Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,whosanenator,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Solo,Spiritual Place amongst the Hustle of the CityLife,"It's a nice getaway and can be an unplanned visit. It is well connected and the place is thronging with good eateries as well. It can get crowded depending on the day and special times according to the Hijri calender, also expect larger crowds on Thursdays and Sundays. If you happen to be around the Qawwali session, give it a go (provided you happen to know Hindi/Urdu). Dress modestly. Beware of pickpockets !"
Hazrat_Nizamuddin_Darga,zap r,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,"Religious place, very croweded!!","1. Five star rating only for it being a religious place.1. It is a very famous dargah of muslim faith, but non-muslims are welcome too.2. Very crowded and dirty lanes lead to this famous dargah, such holy place with zero maintenanace.3. A very small and narrow lane leads to the main dargah, the lane is full of beggers, phisically handicapped people, pushing you to give money, the dargah inside is not too big, very crowded most of the times. 4. Even inside the dargah its not clean, trash cans overflowing, people almost pushing each other to get a glimpse of the shrine. 5.  There is hardly anyway one can have a peaceful prayer, or spend some time with god. People are more in a hurry. 6.  I personally dint get the feel of this holy place.7.  The management has to streamline the crowd, and make arrangements of the clenliness of this place. 8.  Good place ---NO MAINTENANCE."
