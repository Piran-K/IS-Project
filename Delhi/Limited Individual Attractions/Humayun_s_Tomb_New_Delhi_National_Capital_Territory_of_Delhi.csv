Humayun_s_Tomb,SEEDJEN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023 • Couples,A beautiful & impressive heritage site,"This tomb of the Mughal emperor Humayun, an almost 500 year old UNESCO site is a very impressive place in scale  and design. You will marvel at the skilled craftsmanship of the work on show in trellis stone lattice windows & geometric designs, and ingenuity of the Persian architecture of Mirak Mirza Ghiyas. It is set in a large garden with some very old trees dotted around creating an oasis of peace juxtaposed with the busy city streets outside. There are other interesting structures to visit in the complex."
Humayun_s_Tomb,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,The first of the great Mughal era tombs.,"Humayun inherited the Mughal Empire, then lost it, fled into exile with his wife and a small group of soldiers, made friends with the Safavid Shah of Persia and traded a priceless diamond for an army, which he then used to take his empire back. He trusted everyone around him and nearly everyone betrayed his trust, but despite his trusting nature, he died the prosperous ruler of one of the largest empires on earth at the time. His wife went on the Haij pilgrimage to Mecca and then built this tomb in his honour from her own treasures. The tomb complex is also historically important in that it was where the last Mughal Emperor was actually captured by the British in 1857. The tomb complex also houses other tombs, such as those of Isa Khan, who predated Humayun’s rule in Delhi."
Humayun_s_Tomb,Ambassador435631,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Beautiful monument,"A very beautiful monument, so huge, the grounds are beautiful as well. We could have easily spent 3-4 hours marvelling at this wonder. Don't miss this!"
Humayun_s_Tomb,Hanzik von Tutenschwarz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Baby Taj Mahal that's worth the price,"Very interesting experience. The area is quite well maintained. Takes around an hour or two to walk around. You can go all the way inside the tomb. Around 50 Rs for locals, 600 Rs for foreigners (I think it's 550 Rs if you buy the ticket online, but I don't know where you can do that). You can take everything with you, there seems to be no restrictions on cameras and bags.Combined with a visit to the Sunder Nursery across the street, this was a lovely afternoon."
Humayun_s_Tomb,Shil P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Great history,Such beautiful grounds that we didn't realize the importance of and almost didn't stop to see. I highly recommend paying a little extra for one of the official tour guides. The history of the moghuls who came to India and this site being the inspiration for the Taj Mahal was just amazing. Highly recommend this on your tour of Delhi.

Humayun_s_Tomb,Sarah Afker,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Oh the architecture ,"This is a breathtaking mausoleum in the hub of Central Delhi. The architecture is splendid and I would recommend carrying water and being wary of fake guides and pick pocketers. This is a must see when in Delhi, nothing quite made my trip than the visit to the Humayun's Tomb"
Humayun_s_Tomb,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,The first garden tomb on the Indian sub-continent.,"THIS is the tomb of the Mughal emperor Humayun.It was built in 1570, is the first garden tomb on the Indian sub-continent and the site is a Unesco World Heritage monument.When you arrive you walk into the site through an archway flanked by trees.Visitors then walk down a stone drive towards the main tomb area which can be viewed on several levels.Times are different post-Covid and all the waterways around the site which used to be full are currently empty on Government orders as part of efforts to combat the virus. You have to imagine the tinkle of water or the look of reflections.The main white marble dome is impressive and rises more than 150ft.It is possible to climb very steep stone steps to get out on to a terrace overlooking the gardens, but be warned. There are handrails but the climb needs care particularly if you are elderly or disabled.Inside the main building itself are several tombs with graceful stone and marble work and fretted stone windows.The structure is a combination of Persian, Turkish and Indian architecture and was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and consort, the Empress Bega Begum.Keep an eye out when you wander round the gardens because a wealth of birdlife lives there. I even saw a Brown Kite come down to drink at a point where lawns were being watered.A very peaceful place and well worth a visit."
Humayun_s_Tomb,Woodstag,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Great Mughal Tomb Garden Place to visit,"Interesting place to visit and explore this first garden Mughal tomb built in memory of his wife and inspired several major architectural innovations, culminating in the construction of the Taj Mahal and other Mughal architectures.

Humayun_s_Tomb,vyasch,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,A different in the line of Mughal monuments,"A different in the line of Mughal monuments, commissioned by a wife in memory of her husband. It gives a little sad feeling when one circles around the tomb.A very few structure has this good platform. The structure looks the same from all the side, surprisingly and unfortunately.Had this monument been built in marble, it would have been one of the seven wonders of the world but perhaps, it doesn't have the kind of legends the Taj Mahal has with it."
Humayun_s_Tomb,Smarthitech,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Wastage of Money,"If anyone is planning to go there please don't. According to my experience, you should only go there when you think that it is an ancient monument and must visit once otherwise there is no fun even a park is better than this and let me make you clear you need to pay 40 rs per person if you go there, Instead, I will suggest you the newly developed park just opposite Humayun's tomb and that will be more enjoying."

Humayun_s_Tomb,Ron,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Business,Interesting but needs some TLC,It’s surprising to see monument of this magnitude in center of Delhi in rather poor shape. Government should spend some money to spruce up this place. Overall Delhi is least impressive of the golden triangle places.
Humayun_s_Tomb,EastTNVol,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Friends,"Rich Cultural Experience, in the Heart of Delhi","This was a very interesting site to visit.  Several people to whom I sent photos assumed it was the Taj Mahal, which allowed for a discussion on the differences between the two sites.  I especially enjoyed comparing the two sites, with the differences between the red stone and white marble.  Note when planning a visit that the stairs leading up to the building are very steep. "
Humayun_s_Tomb,Achal N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Family,"Beautiful, Relaxing Monument","Beautiful monument indeed. Looks more like a mini Taj Mahal of a different shade. The surroundings of the monument are well maintained and clean. Outside the compound it's a whole different story. Good place to walk around and rest too. There's also another tomb at the entrance with another small monument. If you're not planning on relaxing, nothing much to do here. Avoid visiting during afternoons, extreme heat. The entrance and the route leading upto the monument could've been slightly better. There was some sort of construction/renovation works going on at a stretch, things might be better now."
Humayun_s_Tomb,Moniesha V,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Could skip it,"Firstly, it isn't well maintained. There is no water as shown in the picture. It is just a good place to take a stroll and some pictures and nothing much. The only thing I liked there was the upper area (terrace) and the view that you get of the entire place. The inside of the tomb is blocked."
Humayun_s_Tomb,Niket Kumar Dixit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Family,"Must visit, but place can be better managed. ","Had really high hopes from this place as always saw this place in history books.

Humayun_s_Tomb,Shubhanshu B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Absolutely Amazing!,"A clean, green and serene place in the middle of the city. Truly grand at scale that can't be imagined from its photos/videos. Easy to reach from JLN metro station (the nearest), there are absolutely no prearrangements required. Can scan and pay for tickets at the entry (Rs 70 for Indians). Carry essential food/water as there is no kiosk/eateries inside the complex. Washroom facility is available. Guards double down as guides and happy to share what they know about history. Maps/artefacts/stories have been maintained to make it historically interesting. The best part is access to first floor of the main tomb (huge open area with great visibility, ideal for winters). Rich artistic roof work and intricate wall angles make it an architectural marvel. People not comfortable with steep stairs and long walks may want to avoid. Ideal for dates, families, shoots, and spending quiet quality time. Overall, a fulfilling 2 hour place :)"

Humayun_s_Tomb,Jon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Family,Our favorite sight in Delhi!,"What a great place to visit - as many others have said, it is an oasis of calm and beauty.  The architecture is fantastic and surrounding buildings and tombs are equally lovely.   While everyone is struggling for the perfect picture from the entrance side, be patient and walk all the way around the building from the same distance - you’ll find fantastic views with fewer/no people in your shots!  Great history to boot - read up a bit first to truly appreciate just how special this place is."

Humayun_s_Tomb,pawandeep@1990,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,wonderfull,"This is a monument that is the model for the Taj Mahal. This is a wonderful Indo-Islamic architecture and is a feast for the eyes. It is a mausoleum and there are multiple tombs inside it of the Mughal Emperor Humayun and his family. But the tomb was also used as a refuge and has seen a lot of blood shed in the past. The last Mughal king Bahadur Shah Zafar hid there after the 1857 uprising. There are many tunnels running under the building leading out from the monument. There are other beautiful buildings around it which are also worth a visit. A building with a green mosaic dome behind the main building is worth a look.You must approach this building by going around the main tomb. The gardens, much of which are being restored are beautiful. It is a declared a World Heritage site. The fact that these buildings have survived the ravages of centuries and multitude of wars is a testimony to their solidity and workmanship."
Humayun_s_Tomb,AjaySingh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,Delhi Taj,The Tomb is in central Delhi. It is large beautiful building set in formal gardens. The site is very peaceful compared with chaos of the streets just outside. A visit is definitely recommended if you are sightseeing around Delhi. There is a relatively short walk from the main entrance through the gardens to some steep steps up to the first level of the main building. From here you can get a close up look at the design and intricate work that has been put into the building.

Humayun’s Tomb was built in the 1560’s, with the patronage of Humayun’s son, the great Emperor Akbar. Persian and Indian craftsmen worked together to build the garden-tomb, far grander than any tomb built before in the Islamic world. Humayun’s garden-tomb is an example of the charbagh (a four quadrant garden with the four rivers of Quranic paradise represented), with pools joined by channels. The garden is entered from high gateways on the south and from the west with pavilions located in the centre of the eastern and northern walls. There are a number of graves in the main tomb building. Windows are beautifully decorative and bring a level of mystique to the ambiance of the building. A visit here is highly recommended."
Humayun_s_Tomb,R1chardN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A Beautiful Mausoleum,We visited Humayun's Tomb as a part of a City and highlights tour of Delhi.  You need to have a guide to get the most of these monuments.It is a UNESCO Work Heritage site and a 'must see' when you are in Delhi.  This is the fore runner to the Taj Mahal and should be seen before the Taj.There are a greater number of graves here than at the Taj and there is a far greater use of colour but many of the archeological features are the same.

Humayun_s_Tomb,DP1066,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Impressive!,"Another ‘must visit’ is this UNESCO World Heritage site.  This houses both Isa’Khan and Humayan’s 16th century tombs, which were the inspiration for the Taj Mahal."

Humayun_s_Tomb,Debbie P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Just breathtakingly beautiful,"I had never heard of Humayun's tomb....we visited as part of a tour around Delhi - it took my breath away.  It really is one of the hidden secrets of India.  Not as busy as the Taj Mahal, but just as beautiful,  one of the many hidden highlights, cannot recommend it more....."
Humayun_s_Tomb,Brun066,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,The first of the great Mughal mausoleums,"Humayun (1508-1556), to whom this mausoleum is dedicated, is the second emperor of the Mughal dynasty. At the time the capital city of the Mughal empire was Delhi; after him he will migrate to Agra (and for some periods also to Fatehpur Sikri and Lahore), whence it will return to Delhi only in 1638, with Shah Jahan.But when it returns to Delhi, the new capital will have its center in the Red Fort and the Grand Mosque area, then this mausoleum (whose location had been dictated by the proximity to the shrine and residence of the highly venerated Sufi monk Nizamuddin Auliya , 1238-1325) will remain peripheral and forgotten. The chronicles tell us that already in the eighteenth century the mausoleum's garden was occupied by informal settlements. The layout we currently appreciate took place after the 1960s, and especially after 1993, when the monument was declared a World Heritage Site. So the story of this building is a story of violent ups and downs, which fortunately has preserved the essentials of the original architecture (but not of the surrounding gardens, completely canceled and only recently restored in a form that vaguely recalls the original one ).Hence the bare character of the rooms that are visited: these are rooms that have been deprived of their original furnishings during the long period of decline and abandonment.Since the buildings completed during the rule of the two first Mughal emperors, Babur and Humayun himself, are not very relevant, this building, intended for the burial of Humayun but not started by him, is the first of the great Mughal mausoleums and in general the first of their great architectural initiatives. Although the author of this tomb is the most eminent of Humayun's widows, Bega Begum, the era of construction is attributable to the reign of Humayun's son and successor, the most powerful and memorable of the Mughal rulers, Akbar, known above all as builder of Agra Fort and of the admirable new capital Fatehpur Sikri.Compared to these wonderful creations, Humayun's tomb (which actually houses many tombs also of other members of the imperial house) appears as an archetype, as the first proof of construction models which will then be gradually perfected; but which is already somewhat perfect in itself. Already in it you can see some solutions, mostly from Persian and in general Central Asian architecture (and in fact the architects, called by the widow, are Persians), but which are new to India: the large central dome which covers the tomb chamber and which stands on a raised large platform; the dome built by white marble, which contrasts with the red sandstone prevalent in the remaining parts; the walls opened by large arches called ""iwan""; the surrounding ""Charbagh garden"", a quadrilateral Persian garden, divided into four-part channels that symbolize the four rivers of Paradise mentioned in the Qur'an.Going inside the building allows you to appreciate, in addition to the large (and now bare) central room, the four smaller octagonal rooms that symmetrically surround it (actually there are eight, because they are arranged on two floors), the smaller rooms that in turn surround the larger ones. All this creates a lively, amazing interconnection of volumes.. And going through the garden allows at least to imagine its ancient magnificence.This monument, located in a corner of Delhi which is now somewhat secluded, is a fundamental chapter in the history of Mughal architecture; and, I would say, also of world architecture."
Humayun_s_Tomb,davemartin3,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Superb,An amazing piece of architecture with a really interesting history. Set in lovely grounds so although it was quite busy it never felt crowded. Certainly one of Delhis night lites.
Humayun_s_Tomb,Greeneyedhiker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Lovely afternoon walk,"I would definitely recommend this place to visit when in Delhi. The area is beautiful and very picturesque. Just a warning, the price is 40 rupees for a local, but 600 for foreigners. You could easily spend a couple of hours there walking around the gardens and tomb, chilling and taking pictures. They don't have a shop once you get in, so bring water and snacks with you. We went in the afternoon, but the view is meant to be lovely once it gets dark."

Humayun_s_Tomb,Sheena P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Well worth visiting,"There is such a wealth of monuments and buildings to visit in India that it can a bit overwhelming but this one is a must. The scale is huge but this does detract from its beauty. As always, a guide is invaluable as there are so many questions to ask! Not too busy, so visiting was quite peaceful and unhurried."
Humayun_s_Tomb,AZCasualTraveler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Facinating Tomb for Emperor Humayun,"The Tomb for Emperor Humayun is a large elaborate complex honoring the second Emperor of the Mughal Empire - including the area that is now Afghanistan, Pakistan, Northern India and Bangladesh.  To get to the Tomb stucture itself, you must pass through several large and ornate gateways.  The ""Tomb"" was designed after the Taj Mahal in Agra - with a long walkway leading upto the structure that is similar in design to the Taj Mahal.  Very ornate design both inside and outside - very nice structure.Nearby the Humayun Tomb is the Isa Khan Tomb which is not as large or as elaborate at the Humayun Tomb but still a nice place to visit since both ""Tombs"" are located just steps apart."

Humayun_s_Tomb,Ayushi Dixit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Mini taj mahal,I went to this place with my friend and with family as i have a fetish to visit old monuments. I loved how beautiful this place was but it deserves a little more maintainence and it ll be even more prettier. Worth a visit if you are in delhi. 
Humayun_s_Tomb,Adamthegardener,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Group visit while on the tour of the Golden Triangle,"This was the very first visit on the tour of the Golden Triangle. A terrific visit well worth taking the time - requires 1-1.5hrs. A 16th Century tomb built by Haji Begum, senior wife of Humanyun, the 2nd Mughal Emperor. It is early Mughal architecture."

Humayun_s_Tomb,gfsc5,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Taj Mahal inspiration,If you can't get to Agra to see the Taj Mahal then this is probably the best alternative.  A beautiful tomb set amongst a large park area.  Some great photo ops.  Get lots of shots of the outside.There are some very steep steps to negotiate to enter the tomb area itself.  There are some nice views from up here of the adjacent barber's tomb and a bit of a sight of a lovely Jain temple.Humayun's tomb has a tomb in the centre of the building with a few more in adjacent rooms.  It's not a fancy place but quite peaceful inside.  The highlight for me was the domed area just before the main tomb area.  Take the time to look up.One of the must see places in New Delhi.
Humayun_s_Tomb,Mike X,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,The other building in the back is more interesting ,"The structure itself seems mostly restored so the outside decorations are not as intricate as some other structures. Don't fall for the friendly people inside who offer up information when you walk in. They'll ask you for money for the ""tour"".There is a smaller blue domed structure near the back of the complex that has more impressive outer decorations. "
Humayun_s_Tomb,Karan S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Historical relevance ,Humayun tomb has historically  relevance  and is a place history  buffs must visit. With the monument  opening  now at night as well and up-to certain point
