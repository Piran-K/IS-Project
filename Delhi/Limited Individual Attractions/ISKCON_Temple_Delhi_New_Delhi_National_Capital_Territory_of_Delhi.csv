The imposing sandstone structure with the tricolor fluttering on top swell the hearts of Indians. The symmetry of the North & South Blocks are worth seeing.Start walking down from the Raisina Hill towards the India Gate. On both the sides are well laid out lawns with fountains thrown in. During the cooler seasons, you will be able to see more colors apart from the staple green.The lawns abuzz with activity - hawkers vending stuff, families soaking in the sun, lovers stealing moments, government employees napping in their lunch breaks, & dogs, kites & pigeons running around.

However was quite disappointed with the upkeep of this part to the corridors of power. The road was lined with hawkers. The lawns on one side were not well kept (don't know about the other side as I did not venture there)The only bright side about this walk from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan was that I got to see a variety of bright and beautiful flowers.The credit goes to the ending winter season and not to the caretakers.
Rajpath,victor4000,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Not as good as we hoped,"We had included a walk down the Rajath as part of one of our days in Delhi but in the end, when we saw it, we opted not to, It's just a wide tree lined road - not as imposing as say Paris or London."

Rajpath,Vijay Jotwani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,A must go place during Republic Day Celebrations,"It would be a great experience to go to Rajpath and nearby South Block, etc to see the effect of lighting on any evening during the Republic Day Celebrations."
Rajpath,Ema Datshi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Kingsway - Delhi's great street,"Every great city needs a great street and whilst Paris has the Champs Elysee, Berlin the Unter den Linden, and London 'The Mall', Delhi has Rajpath - or as it was originally know, Kingsway. This is the wide and often not very busy road that links the Presidential Palace at one end to the India Gate at the other. Its sister road 'Queensway' a.k.a Janpath crosses it at right angles.It's a beautiful walk though I'd suggest to start at the palace and then it's downhill to India Gate. It's a bit of a way on a hot day but well worth a walk. Of course it's also free."
Rajpath,gireesh s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Royal Path,It's a royal Path connecting national museum to Rashtar pati Bahavan you must visit this place in evening for better view
Rajpath,mail2bibhu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,"That feeling called ""Live Life King Size""","RajPath is a Hindi word when split gives (Raja=King + Path=Street/Way). Walking on this Rajpath gives that feeling of a King. Mostly people walk from India gate to President's house (both of which are famous tourist places of New Delhi) via this nearly 4 km stretch of Rajpath. Republic Day Parade of India is celebrated on this Rajpath each year on 26th January, which is worth seeing. Political dignitaries from across the world are invited to attend this event.Best time to visit : Evening to midnight during Summer and all throughout the day during winters. One can reserve time to relax at this place for as many hours as possible. Whether Delhi's temp. is above 40 degrees celcius during peak summers or freezes to zero or sub-zero during winters, you will hardly find a decrease in number of ice-cream vendors selling ice-creams in this area. People drive from distance to enjoy the ice-cream on this Rajpath. You may sometimes find celebrities / dignitaries jogging on this Rajpath during early morning hours.Located at the heart of New Delhi, walk on this Rajpath is worthwhile and a lifetime experience. If you are in New Delhi for any reason, take out time specially to visit this place. Nearest Delhi Metro station to access to this place: Central Secretariat and Udyog Bhawan."
Rajpath,Sanjay S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,A must see,The Rajpath drive up is itself so good and you can see the India Gate on the other end. This is the place where the Independence Day and the Republic Day Parades are held every year.

Full of greenery and favorite of love birds.Unfortunately the illumination done recently for night viewing is not very impressive.Still one must visit this area in your leisure time during day as well as nite

Rajpath,blackdrongo167,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Decorated Raj Bhawan,"What a time to visit Raj Bhawan and North & South block, on the eve on 16th Aug, decorated with light. A colorful environment where India top official seats and all major decision taken from here. We just walked from India gate its awesome (if you are visiting this place in evening). Otherwise you can take auto from India gate which will cost 10-20 rs per person. If want to take a complete round of parliament, Raj Bhawan and North & South block then auto will cost around 150-200"
