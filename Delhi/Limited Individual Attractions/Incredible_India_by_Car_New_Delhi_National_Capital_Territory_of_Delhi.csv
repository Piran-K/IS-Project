Incredible_India_by_Car,drcremaster,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Highly recommended company,"My wife and I organised an 11 day tour with Incredible India by car. Gulab Singh was attentive and responded rapidly to our requests. He was also very patient when our Australian bank had a delay in transferring money. Initially we were to have Gulab as our driver however he was unable to take us and organised Mr Harinom as a driver. Hari was a careful skilled driver and importantly never sped. His English was broken but understandable and the care he gave flawless. Our itinerary was Delhi, Mandawa, Bikaner, Jaisalmir, Jodhpur, Udaipur.— Toyota Innova.Highly recommended company. Alan (Australia)"
Incredible_India_by_Car,Bo D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,Excellent 16day trip with Gulab!,"This was my first trip to India and Mr. Gulab Singh made it an amazing and memorable holiday. He was punctual, great at navigating the busy streets and provided insightful tips. Gulab added so much value to our 16 day trip through India. He was willing to answer any questions as well as give his honest opinion on where to visit and at which time. This made our loose itinerary come to life in a perfect way! His expertise was evident right from our airport pick up and we were very excited for the journey ahead. I can, without a doubt, recommend Gulab to anyone travelling through India. He makes travelling through the country such a rich experience. We learnt so much about Indian life in cities as well as whilst driving through rural towns thanks to his knowledge. We look forward to having Gulab take us again on our next trip!"
Incredible_India_by_Car,Nick B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,10 out of 10 experience with Gulab!,"I travelled to India for the first time recently with my friend, visiting from Australia. We engaged Gulab Singh as our driver. Gulab expertly guided us across 16 days, in Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur and Ahmedabad. We’d done a fair bit of research in the lead up to our trip. Gulab was very respectful of what sights we wanted to see but also made some fantastic suggestions. Gulab was very honest in his recommendations and whether they were worthwhile. He showed a very impressive knowledge of each town and its attractions (and importantly the best place for a chai in each city!). He took the trickery and scams away that we’d heard about from other travellers who’d been to India. Gulab went out of his way to help us and ensure we had a safe and relaxing time in India. Where appropriate, he’d arranged a local guide to show us around some of the attractions in Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, and Jaipur. These guides were very affordable, and Gulab was very upfront with us and never placed any pressure on us to utilise the guides. Above all else we felt that Gulab was a careful driver, and he showed his experience in commanding the chaotic roads of India (the drive into the Jodhpur old city is one memorable example). Gulab greeted us warmly on our arrival at Delhi Airport and maintained an extremely professional and friendly nature throughout our trip. It felt like we were travelling with a friend. We can only agree with the reviews below in this respect. We will, without any doubt or reservations, recommend that our family and friends travel with Gulab in any trip to India. We hope that this review persuades you to do the same."

Incredible_India_by_Car,Lana V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,"Professional, calm, excellent.","Gulab is the epitome of professionalism. My friend and I did a 3 day private golden triangle tour which included Taj Mahal and Jaipur. Gulab is not only an excellent driver, but also had great recommendations that were presented very openly and without pressure, which was a much needed break from the usual sales tactics we found along our trip. We do recommend getting a guide for Taj Mahal as the entrance to it was quite chaotic.Gulab was always on time, kind, and cool while driving on chaotic Indian roads. I couldn’t recommend him more!"
Incredible_India_by_Car,Juliana Jasper,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Awesome driver - great experience in Delhi!,My husband and I did a half-day tour in Delhi with Gullab who organized everything for us via whatsapp. We asked him for a tour guide and he provided us with an excellent professional who explained to us all about the sights in Delhi.

Incredible_India_by_Car,Junior H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Friends,Car with a driver around India,"I rent the car with the driver for one week. He pick me up at the airport and drove to Angra, Jaipur, New Delhi, including the nights on those cities with the accommodation and food for the driver. It really worth because he can take you whenever you want, stop whenever you want and even sleep in a different city with the comfort to have the car with the driver for your time.The car is comfortable, the air conditioner works really  well and fast.

Incredible_India_by_Car,Ofir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,Day Tour of New and Old Delhi,"I had a long connection through New Delhi airport and I wanted to use the day for a quick visit of the main attractions of the city. I contacted Gulab, and he was super responsive on WhatsApp. We set pick-up and drop-off at the airport, and he was totally flexible and chill when my arriving flight was delayed and immigration took forever.He picked me right at the arrival gate, and we started the tour in his sparkling clean modern tourist van (with AC!).Gulab assembled a very satisfying schedule of palaces tombs temples and mosques. He would drop me off at each with clear instructions where to go and what to expect, and after each experience (with per-site ""local"" guides) he would review for more background and context of the site.I really appreciated the conversations we had en-route about life in India, and of course the endless supply of cold bottled water.I strongly recommend Gulab for a comprehensive and customizable drive-through of New (and Old) Delhi!"

Incredible_India_by_Car,Brit H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Family,Mr. Gulab made our 8 days in the golden triangle spectacular!,"Mr. Gulab has been amazing from start to finish.  We are a family of 4 Americans on a gap year and well traveled. India was high on our list and it reopened at the right time with our schedule.  I was a bit stressed trying to plan logistics at the last minute and decided a private driver would be best. One of the best decisions we made on this trip.  We spent 8 days going around the golden triangle along with Ranthambhore National Park.  From the moment Gulab picked us up and every day he was professional, punctual, and patient.  He was always calm in any driving scenario which made our trip so much more enjoyable in the India ""chaos"" (which was so much better with a driver).  He figured out our preferences immediately which is an amazing gift. Truly I expected to be more stressed this leg, but the local people coupled with Gulab's calming disposition made it one of our highlights this year.  He was an amazing educational resource with our unending questions about the local culture, etc. We did not have an itinerary set in stone and he made so many great suggestions and stops.  He helped us navigate every day tasks too.  I will recommend Gulab to anyone who wants to explore India with some flexibility (like booking your own hotels/setting your own schedule).  If you read this review to the end,   you know you no longer have to research and book this company of upstanding character.  Thank you Mr. Gulab!"

Incredible_India_by_Car,himanshi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Friends,Trip to manali,It was amazing!

He’s a honest, trustful and kind man, who gently drove us to different tours in Jaipur, Agra and Deli cities.  He’s car is safe and clean, Gulab is an experienced and careful driver, polite and educated. Since India is a big country and sometimes difficult to move from one city to another, to have a private driver made our trip easier and more comfortable.

Incredible_India_by_Car,gmurran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,2 Day Tour Delhi and Agra,"I was only in Delhi for two days so wanted to see as much as possible. As I was travelling by myself many of the organised tours were too expensive. I contacted Gulab and received a good price for two days of transport around Delhi and Agra.At 10 AM my driver Sanjeev picked me up outside my hotel. We made stops all day at the top destinations around old and new Delhi. It's not possible to see everything in one day but I felt like I saw the most popular sites and avoided too much of the heavy traffic. Admission fees were paid myself (I knew this before) but I always got good advice from my driver on what to see and do. It was a huge help to have a local on hand at all times. The highlight of the day was the rickshaw ride around Chandi Chowk which Sanjeev organised for me. I was brought to a few places for some nice shopping also. On day 2 we left early at 6.30 am for Agra Fort and the Taj Mahal. It takes about 3 hours to reach the Taj with a short stop along the way. A very good guide Shanzad from Agra showed me around both locations and helped find the best photo spots. Be warned the Taj is very busy so get there early or late, particularly on weekends. Because both driver and guide spoke clear English the whole experience was really good. We later went to see one of the places that marble is made and decorated. It was a little out of my price range but really beautiful. All that was left was the drive back to Delhi and time for a quick stop for lunch. two fantastic days in Delhi and Agra. The car was air-conditioned and very comfortable. Overall a fantastic experience and I will call the company again when in India and recommend to friends or colleagues."

Mr. Sanjay (the driver) and Mr. Hitesh (the guide) were at the hotel at 09:00 am sharp and took to the monuments we wanted to see. Mr. Hitesh was very knowledgeable and gave us all kinds of great information. He was also very patient as we took a ton of pictures and kept on posing at all the different locations.

Incredible_India_by_Car,Mike H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,The Only Company To Use,"From the moment we stepped off the plane we were greeted & taken to our hotel, & so began our journey & first experience in India. I simply cannot praise Incredible India by Car highly enough, they took care of everything in detail & no request was ever a problem. The owner, Mr Gulab Singh came to the hotel to greet us personally & to introduce us to our driver Mr Subodh & our Delhi guide, Mr. Ravi. Both were fantastic taking us to places we would never have found as lone travellers & nothing was too much trouble for them. Mr Singh even arranged our train tickets, driver & guide when we went to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. Again, we were greeted by Mr Rahul our guide for the day. Again, a very knowledgeable & able guide & helped us take some memorable photos. Upon our return to Delhi we were greeted agin by our driver. When the time comes to return to India there is only one company to us & that is Incredible India by Car. They are so professional, reliable & not expensive, & really know their stuff which made our trip so memorable. As I said in my title, they are the only ones to use. Gulab, thank you so much for all your kind help & assistance, you helped to make our trip perfect."

He took us to all the sights we wanted to see, and we were also able to take a Tuk-Tuk ride into Old Delhi with a friend he recommended.

Incredible_India_by_Car,MrsChivs,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"Agra Visit, Taj mahal and Agra Fort","The booking process was very easy and the owner very responsive to emails. We did not have to pay anything up front, just give the money to the driver on the day. I had planned to send an email the day before our trip to The Taj Mahal, but didn't need to as I received an email confirming the booking. Our driver was waiting at the designated place on time and the car was clean and comfortable. It was a 4 hour drive to Agra and mostly on the motorway so the journey was pretty boring. We had one stop at services on each journey where the driver went to get food, and we were left waiting having no idea what time he would return, which a little frustrating. On arrival just outside the Taj Mahal we picked up our tour guide, who took us very quickly and efficiently through the ticket booths and queues. Our guide was very informative and answered any questions we had. He also took lots of photographs of us at the TM. However, after leaving the TM we were taken to see the 'marble being made by the direct descendents of the workers that built the Taj Mahal' This was basically an overpriced marble shop and we suspect that there many of these in the area - each one giving a backhander to their designated tour guide. Once we realised what was going on we said a polite thanks but no thanks and left. We were also offered the opportunity to see 'beautiful embroidery being made' after visiting Agra Fort. We had to be quite forceful in saying that we did not want this and eventually they got the message. The trip itself was good for the amount paid, but the extra trips being offered spoiled the day a little for us. Driving in Agra by the way, is an experience in itself!"

Mr Gulab Singh was personally there on the first day at the exact time in the morning to introduce the driver Mr Girish Kumar.We can not praise Mr Girish Kumar enough - he was excellent. He stayed in the background and made every effort to make our trips successful. There was wifi in the tempo traveller (and we were allowed to take the mobile wifi with us during excursions) and there was plenty of bottled water kept in a mini-fridge in the vehicle.There were several road blocks on the Agra-Jaipur highway due to Gujar protests but Mr Girish very calmly took us through roads via villages to Jaipur without a single protest or feeling upset. We have used other companies before, including a tempo traveller for our stay in Delhi, but these two trips with Incredible India by Car have to be best we have ever had. Highly recommended."
