IndeChauffeur_Satbir_Singh,Sahil Haria,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,5 Day Tour of the Golden Triangle,"We had a great time with Satbir and his company! He was timely, always giving us the best tips on where to go, what to see, the best deals and always willing to accommodate us/our changes. To the extent the day before driving from Agra to Jaipur we asked if we could add Ranthambore - 5hours extra driving for Satbir and he was only too happy to Accomodate. Additionally when we couldn’t find a train from Jaipur to Jodhpur (to end our trip) Satbir worked his magic and got us a car (on the day) at cheaper than we saw online. Satbir is always happy, always looking out for his clients best interest and wants to genuinely make sure his clients have the best time on the holiday. Would definitely recommend his services and will definitely be calling Satbir for them once again when I go next. Thanks for everything Satbir"
IndeChauffeur_Satbir_Singh,Noah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Amazing travel experience through Rajasthan with our driver Kishan,"I booked a seven day tour through Rajasthan together with a French friend. During the trip we visited Agra, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Pushkar. Our driver Kishan always had our needs on his mind and adapted the trip accoringly. He would recommend us different activities and places where we could go and was always open for suggestions from our side as well. He really did an excellent job to make the best out of the time. He was always very friendly and helpful and also gave alot of insights into the Indian culture whenever we had questions. Furthermore, Indian roads can be tricky sometimes to say the least. However, we always felt really secure while Kishan was driving us. Our security was of highest importance to him.I can only recommend to book a tour with Sandrine and Satbir and expecially with our driver Kishan. He really made the whole experience very special!"
IndeChauffeur_Satbir_Singh,Antoine D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,The best chauffeur and friend for North India,"Today is the last day of our two week trip in Rajasthan. We couldn’t have hoped for a better guide than Jaiveer, he was not only an excellent driver, the best advisor when it came to visiting places and restaurants, but also an amazing company and now a friend. All those memories will be with us forever and we can not thank you enough for your help and services. Hope to see you again next year for more adventures !"

IndeChauffeur_Satbir_Singh,Gene H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Best India travel experience with Raj!,"It was my first time traveling in India and I am so glad and lucky to have met Rajesh. I spent two weeks with him traveling through Rajasthan (Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Pushkar, Jaipur, Ranthambore) and Agra. I couldn't have asked for a better driver and friend to show me around India. What I appreciate most about Raj is his honesty and friendliness, and how he went out of his way to provide me a truly amazing experience. From camel-trekking through the deserts of Jaisalmer, to going on a jeep-safari in search of tigers in Ranthambore, Raj goes out of his way every day to make sure you have the best experience and leave India wanting to return for more. Raj is such an amazing, loving, funny person. He really cares about you and is so passionate about what he does. He is very knowledgable about what visitors in India would like to experience, and he caters to any type of needs you have. If you want to have an adventurous day, he has a plan for that. If you want to have a chilled-out, mellow day, he has a plan for that. His service is top-notch and he wants you to have the best experience in India and leave India with a great memory of this beautiful country. Every day is a great adventure with him.Raj had so many great insights about the places we travelled to. From the famous monuments to the not-so-touristy places, he knows the great places and stories behind each place you visit. When Raj suggests you to go somewhere, or try some new experience, do it. Even if it's not part of your travel itinerary, give it a try. He really knows what he's talking about and has your best interest in mind when he suggests something. I really appreciate his extensive knowledge of the places he took me to and the experiences I got from them.Not only did Raj take me to interesting places, he introduced me to so many fascinating cultural experiences in India. Raj really opened my eyes up to the beauty of India. One of my favorite highlights is trying all the amazing Indian cuisine he introduced me to. He took me to try so many amazing local dishes from hole-in-the-wall restaurants in every city. From trying Indian sweets in every city, to buttery mutton curry in Jaipur, to $0.70 chicken biryani (the best biryani I ever tried) at a street-food stand... the list goes on. I was blown away by the array of mouthwatering dishes I got to try there. He showed me the real authentic local restaurants that specialized in the delicious foods that each city was famous for. Trust me, when Raj suggests you to try some local food, you have to try it. It's not going to be a touristy restaurant, it's going to be the real deal. There were so many delicious cheap eats that I never knew about and it really opened my eyes to a whole new world of Indian cuisine. I also met so many cool friends of Raj during our trip and had many memorable experiences with all of them. From meeting his joyful and friendly boss Satbir, to experiencing a traditional Rajisthani dance in the deserts of Jaisalmer with Mr. Chodu, to sharing a delicious egg curry dinner with Raj and his cousin Sachim and their friends, these are memories I will cherish forever.I traveled alone but am leaving India with a great friend. I can't wait to return to India to meet Raj again and travel with him. Thanks Raj, I will miss you. I'm very much looking forward to our next adventure together!"

He gave us really good advices on restaurants, massages, visits, not touristy shops... anything you need, he will be able to help you. Communication was very easy, his English his really good and he also speaks some French. Sandrine was very helpful beforehand.
