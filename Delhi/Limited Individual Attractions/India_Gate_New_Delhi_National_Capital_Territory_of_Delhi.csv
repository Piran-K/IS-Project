From India gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan are large open and green areas that make you feel a bit relaxed. India gate is definitely a must visit place if you are visiting Delhi. For a tourist it has the same importance as that of Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

India_Gate,Bala Krishnapillai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Iconic Indian Gate,"The famous India gate . It stands as a memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War. You will find a similar structure in Paris (Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile / Place Charles de Gaulle ) An iconic place to visit in the very early morning to avoid traffic congestion."
India_Gate,Sonia Makhija,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Not just a monument,"India gate is one of the most touristy attractions of India and Delhi. Remarks as one of the most important monuments to visit and feel the nation’s pride. Indeed its not just a monument or a gate its a feeling of Pride and looks mesmerizing at the time lf Sunrise and Sunset. Though it was much crowded when we visited during evening hours but the area is too big that you’ll definitely get to see an amazing view and get some good pictures. Along with the India Gate visit, you can cover Kartavya Path, Rashtriya Pati bhawan and Netaji Subhash Charndra Bose statue. Hence this is a must to add to your visit to India / Delhi."
India_Gate,Gustavo A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,I think the road leading up to the Gate is cooler,"It's an arch alright. Not much else to tell about it. It's nice to see but I think the avenue that leads to it from the Rashtrapati Bhavan (presidential residence) is a way nicer attraction. It's wide and very long, reminding us of the avenue from St. James' park leading to Buckingham Palace in London, which is not surprising since it was originally designed by a British man during the British Raj. You can see some hawks flying around too and people just resting on the grass. Do visit in December though, as the weather is sunny but temperate rather than scalding hot as in the summer. Plus, there are fewer people around."
India_Gate,Anika S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Famous Monument at New Delhi .,"This historic monument is must see for all - Children, adults ,tourists -from the point of cultural awareness .However during weekends and public holidays ,it can be really crowded ."

India_Gate,dr ganapathi bhat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,""" Nice architecture""","Nice architecture, by the side of the road.  A well planned one. More than one entrance, but exit is from a different gate. An open area, so plenty of light and breeze. People swarm the place like anything. Small hawkers sell tasty eatables inside. A safe place, photography is allowed. No entry fee. May visit once, 30 minutes maximum."
India_Gate,Natalie1204,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,Gives me goosebumps,I get goosebumps every time I visit. Returned to Delhi after a long time and noticed quite a few changes…for the better. Parking is organised. The food vendors are near the parking area and not in front of the gate. There’s an organised underpass to access the walk area leading up to the gate. Nowadays you can’t walk through but around. The annoying part is the photographers and  jewellery sellers constantly hounding you. There should be a fixed rate if at all. Was very impressed with the garbage atm. Great move

India_Gate,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Impressive memorial.,"THIS memorial towering nearly 140ft is a fitting tribute to the 84,000 British Indian Army soldiers who died between 1914 and 1921.It respectfully remembers those who lost their lives in conflicts from the First World War in France to the Near and Far East.Right from the first glimpse of the India Gate it dominates the whole area with presence and feeling.Just walking slowly towards the great arch gives every visitor a feeling of awe and the structure has been compared with that of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.It was very busy when I visited as part of a combination walk which also took in the nearby National War Memorial.I would recommend visiting both sites at the same time for a full appreciation of what is being remembered.The Gate was designed by the famous architect, Sir Edward Lutyens, and can be reached via the Kartavya Path, the main ceremonial procession route in New Delhi.This stretches some distance and I'd advise anyone tackling that, the Gate and the National War Memorial to ensure they have bottled water with them as there is no cover at the Gate or Path and only a few tree-shaded sections at the Memorial.The whole area is impressive and definitely worth a visit to pay your respects."

At least until recently when the area was reopened to the public.  Unfortunately, all I managed to get was a quick photo of the this forty-metre tall, Lutyens-designed memorial to India's fallen troops of the first world war from some distance."
