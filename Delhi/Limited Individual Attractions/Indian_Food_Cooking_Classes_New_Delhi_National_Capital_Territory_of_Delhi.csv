Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Andrew S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Want a REAL Delhi India experience?,"Guaranteed authentic Indian experience, a must-do!  We will cook with Preeti and Sanu every time we visit Delhi!  We were greeted by Preeti and family in their lovely home with marigold flower necklaces.  We used traditional knives and cooking ware and stovetop to cook our favorite Indian dishes.  The ingredients used are the same that every Delhi family use- beautiful spices, fresh poultry and paneer and milk.  Made traditional chai tea!  We felt very fortunate we were able to learn over one afternoon what generations of this family have learned cooking over their lifetimes- we felt like we were apart of their family and therefore a part of Delhi and India.  Highly recommended experience."

Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Glau91,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Cooking class in Delhi!,"This class was ran mainly by Preeti, with the help of her husband, Sonu. I booked online only the night before and we got a very quick reply and confirmation. We really enjoyed being able to cook in a very local Indian home, in their own kitchen and eat in the living room. Also it was great to walk around the neighborhood/ market to have a feel of this side of Delhi after the cooking class.It was lovely how we got a welcome garland each when we entered the house. Preeti also introduced us to all the herbs and spices placed in nice boxes/ containers before we started the class. We were taught how to cook so many dishes, they were plenty of food and was so yummy. I especially loved the masala chai drink for entree and the Kadai Paneer dish.Few things for consideration/ improvement: we had too much food, but did not learn to cook/ make any sweets. I think we could have cut down on some savories and so we can at least make/ cook 1 dessert, so we can complete preparation of a full meal. Also would have preferred the market tour at the start before the class, where we actually buy the ingredients for the dishes we will cook. But overall my husband and I enjoyed the class. It is always a good way to understand a culture through their food and visiting a home."
Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,martinagiacomin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,A Family Lunch,"Tha cooking class was amazing, fun and interesting. All our questions were answered and preparing personally the food for our lunch was super satisfying. We got to spend the morning with a real local family also speaking about culture and traditions. They are lovely and were very helpful also during the market tour. Highly recommended. "
Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Paulien L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Perfect introduction to North-Indian cuisine,"This was really the kind of class we were looking for. We learned the basic principles of North-Indian cuisine, which not only allows us to make the dishes from the class, but it also gives us an idea on how to start making other North-Indian  dishes. Everything was explained very clear and we could really get some hands-on experience, which will definitely help us remember everything. We also loved the warm welcome, the hospitality and the help in finding the right metro. Would definitely recommend!"
Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Philip B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Great cooking and eating experience.,"I booked a cooking class with Preeti a few weeks ago with some friends. It was an amazing experience that I highly recommend. We were met by her husband who took us to a local market to pick up some additional ingredients for our class. After a short walk from the market to the house, we sat for a few minutes to acquaint ourselves, then proceeded to the kitchen to start cooking. We requested the 8 course class which included masala tea, pakoras and main dishes. All the steps were easy to follow and we were instructed to participate in every stage of the cooking of our meal. The finished product was so tasty. We enjoyed the meal with our hosts like a big family. If you’re looking for a traditional experience then book this class. Tip…..if you’re not a big fan of spicy food please let Preeti know. Most dishes made were on the hot side for non-Indians, although it was perfect for me. Be specific with your tastes and you will not be disappointed. Enjoy!"

Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Jerry B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Wonderful Cooking Class for Just the Two of Us!,"My husband and I were in India for 3 weeks and we were so lucky to spend our last day with Preeti and her family. It was a marvelous experience to spend hours with a family in their home. We learned how to make 8 different Indian items and Preeti was able to accomodate our vegetarian needs as well as my own celiac issues. She taught us everything from chai masala to veg pakora, palak paneer, wheat/corn chapati and other items. They are a very engaging couple with excellent English. Their little daughter was adorable and we spent hours together. Her husband met us at the Uber drop off, and then walked us around the neighborhood at the end to see the vegetable market and then kindly waited with us for the Uber home. We felt well taken care of. And then Preeti e-mailed all the recipes and assured me she would help over WhatsApp if I ever needed it. 5 star day!"
Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Johann Daniels,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Zoom cooking class as good as a face to face class,I enjoyed discovering the different spices and particularly how to cook Chapatis. Enjoyed the food so much when in India the previous two weeks. So this online course has given me an intro on how to make some of that delicious food myself at home.
Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Helen Z,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Incredible authentic way to experience Indian cooking,"We had an amazing time during our private cooking class with Preeti and Sonu! We were warmly welcomed into their home with a wreath of flowers, and then we started on an 8 part meal - appetizers, chai, chapati, and main dishes. They switch up the dishes every time, so you can also put in special requests (I wanted to learn how to make saag). From this class, I have a much better understanding of the basics of Indian cooking now and am excited to be able to make some of my favorite dishes at home. While we cooked and ate, we were also able to talk with them about all sorts of things - politics, religion, marriage, and more. It was really interesting to learn more about how Indians viewed the world and geopolitical issues. Finally after the meal, Sonu took us on a tour through the nearby markets where I was able to buy some of the spices we cooked with and some dishware common for Indian food. Having him there as a local helped us get some good prices :).Thank you both for a wonderful authentic Indian experience! We felt so welcome in your home and can't thank you enough for the instructive class and stimulating conversation!"
Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Jamie M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Brilliant class and tasty food,"This was a great class which I would recommend to anyone hoping to learn about cooking Indian food and Indian culture. I booked this class by sending Preeti a WhatsApp message and it was really easy to organise a time and date for the class. Preeti then showed me how to cook several different dishes, explaining that what we were cooking was with seasonal ingredients. The food was absolutely delicious and it was lovely sitting and chatting with Preeti and her husband, Sonu.After the class I was emailed with all of the recipes and an offer that I could reach out whenever I needed to. Preeti has told me she is happy to amend the menu for any classes so if I have more time in Delhi I will certainly be coming back to learn how to cook some other dishes! Thank you Preeti and Sonu for a lovely experience."

Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Tatjana P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Wonderful afternoon,"On my first day in Delhi I planned to take a cooking class and have a nice meal. I booked this class and added a note that I would like to be picked up from my hotel (I expected to be too tired after a 24h trip) - my teacher Preeti reached out to me via Whatsup and we figured it all out nicely before my arrival. The class was great - an authentic home cooking experience in Preeti's kitchen - I learned a lot about techniques used in Indian cooking, learned how to make 6 dishes and masala tea from scratch and after the class I received email with recipes and an offer to ask for help if I get stuck. I even had a chance to take a walk through a vegetable market where I could not recognize more than 2/3 of the veggies. It was all a great fun."

Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Lauren Hewitt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Authentic Friendly Experience,We wanted a genuine Indian cooking class to bring recipes back home with us from our time in India and that’s exactly what we got! Preeti and her husband were so welcoming and even catered to vegans so we could enjoy cooking and eating the food according to our diet. The recipe pdfs afterwards were so helpful too. Can’t thank you enough!
Indian_Food_Cooking_Classes,Noah C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Great food. Great teacher. Gracious Host.,"This was one of my favorite cooking classes I have done: Great food. Great teacher. Gracious Host. Preeti is a great teacher, but more importantly she and her family are extremely kind and you can tell they enjoy hosting guests at their home. In addition to food, we had many nice discussions about a variety of topics.  They made me feel like family.  The menu is customized to your taste and skill level and leaves you with skills to cook a variety of Indian dishes. Every dish we prepared was tastier than the next. Her communication before the class was excellent and the price very reasonable for the level of service. I learned that her husband and father in law are also tour guides and can provide all types of travel services such as cars, hotels, etc. I wished that I would have known sooner since this would have made the rest of my trip more enjoyable and also more affordable than what my hotel arranged. Thank you Preeti and Family."
