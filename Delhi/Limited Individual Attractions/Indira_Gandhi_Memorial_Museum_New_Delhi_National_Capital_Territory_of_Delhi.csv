Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Brun066,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,I was deeply moved by this visit.,"In row, we visited the house of Mahatma Gandhi and that of Indira (they aren't far from each other). While the former doesn't show many items (although it's still evocative), the latter has complete documentation on the life and activity of this Indian Prime Minister (1966-1977 and 1980-1984). The rooms are kept in the state they were in; in particular the shelves of his books impressed me. And then the documentation by the newspapers on the main episodes of her life, and of her tragic death.I still had occasion to reflect on how many prominent Indian politicians (starting with Mahatma and Indira's son, Rajiv) were murdered.I was deeply moved by this visit."
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,AstroBloke,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"Worth seeing, but...","I have mixed feelings about this museum, which is in the house that Indira Ghandi lived in and where she was assassinated.  While violence can never be a way to settle political scores, I was put off by the cult of personality that has built up around the woman.  The way her political life was presented was far from a well-balanced one.And really, do we need to see the bloodied remains of clothes to comprehend the ugliness of political violence?"

What I found must compelling were the incredible photos of her life and her family, beginning when she was a little girl and ending with her as a grandmother.  The portraits of her really captured the essence of her life and you got a true sense of her as a person.  I also the loved the photos of her with various world leaders, especially those representing the USA.  And I enjoyed seeing the early photos of her son Rajiv up to his assasination.  This is a must see visit for anyone visiting Delhi.  However, you have to be patient with all the crowds visiting as well."

Be aware that bottled water is confiscated on entry and if its a hot day there are no cafes or street vendors on the embassy lined avenue to get refreshments- so hydrate well before you arrive. The glass avenue where she walked to her death (which obv. then had such horrible consequences) and Sari in which she was murdered -an exhibit too- are of course moving .

The blood stained sari which Indira Gandhi was wearing when she was shot by her own bodyguards is also on display. She had just gone out to cross the garden on her usual daily walk to address her people when her two Sikh bodyguards opened fire on her. The entire pathway where she last walked is clearly marked and the spot where she fell is covered with a glass frame and erected as a Memorial Site in her honour. I learnt a great deal about her life and her family and the tragic events that ended her life. I thought that the speech she made the day before her death was particularly touching and sad (see photo).There is lots to see and read in the museum and it is well worth a visit.It is situated at 1, Safdarjung Road and the nearest Metro link is the Central Secretariat.The museum is open between 0930 hours and 1645 hours on all days with no entry fee."

Then she wrote to her eldest son Rajiv Gandhi the following which shows her concern about the animals :"" From Prime Minister's House              September 7,1956Darling Rajiv, We have received a huge tiger's skin. The tiger was shot by Maharaja of Rewa only two months ago. The skin is lying in the ballroom. Every time I pass it I feel very sad that instead of lying here he might have been roaming and roaring in the jungle. Our tigers are such beautiful creatures , so graceful. You can see their muscles rippling under their skins. Such a short time ago he must have been king of the jungle - striking terror in the hearts of the other animals.I am so glad that now a days more and more people prefer to go into the jungles with their cameras instead of guns. It seems such a shame to deprive anything of the joy of living just for our pleasure.Lots of love,Mummy"""

Other contributors have gone in to the history of her life more but I feel you need to experience it for yourself, you will learn a great deal."

Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Nigel G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Extremely Interesting and Informative ,What a privilege to see the home of one of Indias greatest states-persons. It has been preserved as it was when Mrs Gandhi lived there with wide expansive windows offering great views. There are numerous items on display from her life and that of her family. Many photographs and newspaper pages on display. Her orders awarded by foreign states show her close relationship with both the west and with communist countries. The sari and bag she was wearing at the time she was shot are also on display. It is rare to get such a close view of the life of a Prime Minister. Walking out of the back of the house you enter the garden leading to Akbar Road - the way she walked when she was assassinated by her own body guard. She foresaw death by an assassins bullet - something she had said she was prepared for. A crystal pathway gives way to plate glass on the footpath - the spot at which she fell - a martyr to India. A time to reflect.. To celebrate the centenary of her birth there is an all weather photo display of the life of Indira Gandhi in the garden entitled 'Indira - A Life of Courage '. Many unseen photos - well worth seeing. All together a very impressive and well maintained memorial. Entry is free. Closed on Mondays. 
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Asko M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,A&R in New Delhi,There were so many people that you could not stop and enjoy the place. You just needed to walk in the queue and no stopping. Important person in the history of India. 
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,flowergirl58,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Another moving experience,We spent a couple of hours in the museum and going around Indira Gandhi's house where there were a lot of personal artefacts relating to her and her family and their tragic history. Again we had our wonderful guide Hemanth Reddy.
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Tony B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Memorable Visit,"We were told by our driver we may need 1 hour, that was a little out, we spent 2.5 hours and could have gone back but we were leaving the next night.  If you go allow at least 4 hours to fully investigate all the displays."
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Ema Datshi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,One of the finest museums I've seen in India,"I am, admittedly, absolutely fascinated by the role of the Nehru-Gandhi clan in pre- and post-Partition politics so of course I was going to find this museum interesting. I have been to a LOT of very poor Indian museums and am used to some pretty dull displays but this place is exceptional. The layout, the artifacts, the display boards and photographs are really well done. Honestly, I'm not really sure that you could make a bad museum about somebody as interesting as Indira Gandhi.The lines can be quite long, so it's not a bad idea to go early, especially at hot times of the year. It's a great excuse to visit a lovely part of Delhi that's easily missed if you're on the tourist trail.Observers often comment on the modesty of Indira Gandhi's bungalow on Safdarjang Road but let's face it, this is one of the fanciest addresses in town, the garden and grounds are large in a city where space is at a premium and the bungalow is, by local standards, absolutely enormous. It's not presidential in scale - go take a look at the Presidential palace and you'll see what I mean - but I guess what people really mean when they call it 'modest' is that it's all quite simple and lacking in the ornate trappings of power. It was also very obviously a family home - real people led real lives in this building and you can see it in the room displays.The photos of every day life are moving. The pictures of Mrs G meeting world leaders are interesting, but of course the big attractions - sick as it may sound - are the evidence not of her life but of her death. The blood spattered sari and shoes and the beautiful handbag fill one cabinet. Another display offers her son Rajiv's white trainers, and a few scraps of clothes. There wasn't too much else left after a suicide bomber blew him up.But perhaps the most moving part of the museum is the glass path in the garden that marks where she died. Love her or hate her, you can't fail to be moved by that particular tribute. Another reviewer has said that the death clothes make this museum unsuitable for children. I'd have to disagree. Just take care to guide yours past those spots if you think they might find the displays upsetting or disturbing.This museum never seems to be on the top tourist tips but it should be. The more you know before you go, the more you'll get out of this museum about the extraordinary life and death of India's first woman PM and only the world's second woman leader."
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Paul H,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,"Nostagic, but Sad and Scary","If you are a follower of the Gandhi Era, you would love visiting this place. As a foreigner, this place taught me a lot about early Indian politics and I was amused by the overall aura until I saw the blood stained torn clothes of suicide bomb blasts and murders. I honestly don't think they should be kept in a museum as children visit such places."
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,BONNIE M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,India's well respected Lady Prime Minister resided here and was assassinated here,"Residence of Late Indira Gandhi , the former Lady Prime Minister of India.Converted in to a  museum now  after her assassination. There are old photographs of Nehru-Gandhi family and other historical items. Her son Rajiv Gandhi's tattered clothing after his bombed assassination is also at the display. You can see her living quarters including her prayer room. Outside the house there is a small garden that marks where she was assassinated by her body guard. It is worth a short visit, security is strict here."
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Vaibhav Pal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Well captured and good presentation of her life and tenure,The way her life has been captured and presented is job well done. There a lot of pictures from the press that shows the different stages of her life and also highlight presence of various historical figures from Indian freedom struggle times.The picture presentation done in the lawn along with dates is a very good touch.The memory I would take away with me are the torn clothes and sports shoes of Rajiv Gandhi from his assassination in TN. Sad to see a person remains.
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Anil D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Must visit who admire our beloved Indiraji.,"This was my 2nd visit. I wanted to show this place to my spouse & kids. We visited on 28th Dec. A true historic place. Enjoyed the visit.I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars as I could not found a ""Pineapple"" made from diamond and emerald which was a gift from Oman to Indiraji. Disappointed as I desperately wanted to show it to my spouse & kids."

Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Timothy P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Worthwhile History Lesson,"Based in the House where Indira lived. Quite crowded inside, but it moved and there is lots of written history, plus you see the actual rooms where she lived and worked.The path she walked on before being killed is now sheathed in shimmering glass panels with a glass sheet covering the spot where her blood was spilled. Big external photographic display outside.Nice to see lots of Indians touring too."
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,gastronaut_11,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Extremely interesting,"Unfortunately it was a bit like being on a conveyor belt.

Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,JBPortlandOR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,If you are interested in history a must see,"Amazing that the deaths of 3 Indian leaders, Gandhi, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi all ended in assassinations.  Here you can see the place where Indira and Rajiv lived and where Indira was murdered.  The clothes both of them were wearing when murdered are on display in a tasteful way and the stories of their lives are told in the form of newspapers"

Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Ben W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Interesting but deep politics and history,"The building itself is like a preserved domestic dwelling that you can peep into the rooms to see how she lived and furnished the house.  There's lots and lots and lots of reading on the walls that tell you about her life, the politics etc.  It was interesting but I preferred Mahatma Gandhi's house as it was far more moving and, for me, a more interesting place to visit.  By the way, they're not related.  She changed her name to help herself in politics (was that a spoiler?  I don't think so!)"

Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,YinYang01,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,GOOD TO VISIT,"We went around the site itself and visited the ""museum"". Great explanations but we missed so much to see more Gandhi belongings as all is on photos. If you have plenty time in Delhi : you can go, if not : you can skip."
Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,gentbrugg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Peculiar period,"The presence of representatives of the Gandhi family in power authorities in India is a unique period in the history of the country, but  not in all respects clear for a foreigner. But if the entrance is free, around is situated a lovely park and close are several other  attractions, including Ghandhi Smriti, the tomb of Safdarjung that you have planned to visit, why not to take a look? Although, of course, the atmosphere of the house, including the room in which you can only look only  through the glass, isn't of particular interest. The only place in the garden, where two sikh-bodyguards  killed Indira Gandhi, her blood-stained saffron-coloured sari and burnt clothes of Rajeev during the explosion, deadly for him."

Indira_Gandhi_Memorial_Museum,Nellii M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,A museum to inspire,"While in Delhi catch the metro and visit a free museum.Indira Gandhi Memorial Museum will inspire and allow you to glance into the amazing  world of Indira Gandhi .Set within her house the personal items and rooms you can view show the personal side of her life. Everything is as it was when she lived there during a time of great change in India .To see the rooms where powerful world leaders were entertained and her personal office and belongings is a wonderful experience .As you wander through the museum a story unfolds both remarkable and also sad. Indiras sari she was wearing when she was assasinated is haunting to see,  along with her sons outfit he was wearing when he too lost his life . Gardens surround the house adding to the elegance of the Gandhi home. Outside the crystal path that Indira walked on that last morning honours this great lady. The final steps she walked and then where she fell to her death leaves you with a sadness but a special place to stop and think about  Indira Gandhi and feel the spirit left behind. I loved my visit to this museum and I left with a greater understanding of this family and all Indira worked for ...her love of India. A must see while in Delhi and easy to get to via the metro. I was truly moved by my visit to the Indira Memorial Museum in Delhi."
