Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,RPG625,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Stunning!,"What a place! Isa Khan’s Tomb and the surrounding grounds are breathtaking and awe inspiring. The history is rich and there are markers throughout offering a thorough bilingual description of the various points of interest within the complex.

It is very ornate with canopies, glazed tiles, lattice screens and a verandah around the octagonal shaped structure.. The sepulcher is located centrally under the dome. Our guide told us that during restorations in 2010/11 India's oldest sunken garden was discovered. Well worth the short detour to marvel at the structure."

Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,One_of_the_BOFs,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Neglected part of Humayun complex,"The area of Isa Khan's Tomb and Mosque has rather suffered from the main focus of the extensive renovation work having been on the main complex of Humayun's Tomb. Yes that is quite stunning and perhaps had to have the priority, but hopefully some more attention will be given to this area which predates it by around 20 years and has both architectural and historical importance. Still well worth a visit."

Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,Denzel2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Beautiful and probably inclusive architecture,"So most of us know that Humayun was driven out of Delhi by Sher Shah Suri and Isa Khan was one of his most powerful nobles. Everytime I visit this tomb, I wonder how did Humayun's wife or even Akbar allow his tomb to stay close to the grand edifice of Humayun being built close by. Probably our art was more tolerant then and even our rulers sometime. Visit early morning for serene calm time at the tomb but better pictures always post 4 pm if you can be patient with crowds and tourists."

This pre – Mughal era architecture & construction was  in early 16th century. As per historian's Isa Khan had fought against Mughals along with Sur Kings.It is very intersting to see the tolerance and accomodating side of the Mughal dynasty, as this tomb is now part of the large Humayun's Tomb complex. This tomb features a sunken garden design, which was the first in the Indian subcontinent and later copied & magnified during other Mughal era constructions.The complex also houses a mosque dating back to the same period."

Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,gentbrugg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,A strong impression,"Tomb of Isa Khan is located to the right directly behind the entrance to the complex of Humayun's mausoleum. It is dilapidated and has lost its luster, although still showing a grace and harmony of forms. But that's how it looks today, unembellished, with peeling plaster, produces the strongest impression. The building has lost its momentary beauty, but kept the spirit of a bygone era. There is a feeling, which is so lacking in Akshardam.In fact, the tomb of Isa Khan was built before the tomb of Humayun. Nearby is a miniature mosque of Isa Khan, built along with the tomb. It has partially preserved glazed finish of blue color"

Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,SueKot,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Emerged from Restoration,"We visit India every couple of years and Delhi often forms part of the itinerary. Part of our trip involves returning to sites to investigate how restoration is progressing. This was the case for this tomb which we were delighted to see had emerged from the swathes of scaffolding and plastic that had accompanied its work. Part of the Humayun's complex this is tiny by contrast and also in a different architectural form, albeit Mughal. Constructed in the mid sixteenth century, It is octagonal and set in a sunken walled garden. This setting apes monuments in the Lodhi Gardens which are similar.   There are canopies and a pillared verandah. A mosque is located across from the tomb. The location within the complex is to the right approaching the main gateway to Humayun's tomb which was built some 20 years or so later. It also tends to attract less visitors. "

It was built in 1547.  The octagonal form of the tomb has an unmistakeable stamp of  Islamic art.  It is very  graceful and its elegant clustering of chatris are praiseworthy.

Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,Noraatc,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,"""An asylum of paradise""","The Persian inscription on a red sandstone slab inside the tomb calls Isa Khan's tomb ""an asylum of paradise"". Do not miss this site: it is the closest to the entrance of the Humayun's Tomb complex. This tomb, which is twenty years older than Humayun's Tomb, is very interesting both historically and architecturally; the perfect symmetry of the tomb's octagonal shape and adjacent Isa Khan's Mosque harmoniously blend with the lush greenery of Bu Halima's gardens reminding visitors about the beauty of its past. The tomb is very ornate inside: pay attention to the well-preserved elaborate Persian ornament of the ceiling and the intricate carvings of the windows around the tombs. The signage boards explain the history and the architectural style of the tomb as well as go over the details of its meticulous restoration. The sepulchre is in somewhat dilapidated state, but the restoration work of this beautiful 16th century monument is ongoing and will surely bring results."

Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Friends,First Tomb with Sunken Garden,"The Humayun’s Tomb complex in Delhi, an UNESCO World heritage site , consists of several other monuments which predate Humayun’s tomb. Of them, the monument that presents a striking visual delight is the tomb of Isa Khan Niyazi which predates Humayun’s tomb by a couple of decades. Isa Khan was a Pashtun noble in the courts of Sher Shah Suri and his son Ismail Suri. His tomb was built during his lifetime (1547-48 AD). According to archaeologists, his is the first garden tomb in the Indian subcontinent which features a sunken garden. The monument is built on a higher base and the surrounding garden at a lower level. The concept of a sunken garden was adopted by the Mughals and can be seen at Akbar's Tomb and at the Taj Mahal This octagonal tomb has distinct ornamentation in the form of canopies, glazed tiles and lattice screens, and a deep veranda surrounding it, which is supported by pillars. These attractive blue tiles have still been preserved to a large extent. At the edge of the complex, across from the tomb, lies a mosque with noticeable mihrabs. Known as Isa Khan's Mosque,it was built at the same time as the tomb. Many of the architectural details present in these structures (such as the tomb being placed in a walled garden enclosure) can be seen evolved to a grander scale in the main Humayun's tomb."

Nice to visit this first and gain a sense of the later historical development of Mughal architecture. Full sequence might be Qutb Minar, then the Lodhi Gardens, followed by Isa Khan's Tomb and Humayun's tomb (right next to it), and finally Delhi's Red Fort - all before you visit the Taj Mahal in Agra."
Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,Sumit D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Friends,An excellent architectural beauty,"Isa Khan Niyazi was a nobleman in the pre-Mughal era. The tomb is a beautiful example of architectural marriages of styles which were imported to India and the local ones. The octagonal shape of the tomb is a novel concept not often found with tombs. Predating its more famous neighbour, the tomb lies in the World Heritage Complex for Humayun's Tomb. The area is known as Nizamuddin Basti, named after the spiritual leader Hazrat Nizamuddin and was considered blessed by him. One was considered blessed if one could find a burial ground in the basti. It is part of the reason why this medieval neighbourhood has several prominent tombs."

Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,ScotAwayFromHome,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Solo,Lovely building within the grounds of Humayun's Tomb,"I rather liked this sight, which is in the same grounds as Humayun's Tomb but 20 years older. It is a lot quieter than Humayun's Tomb, has equally stunning architecture and has a walled area that is ripe for exploration."
Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,MARGDARSHI,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Friends,India`s Oldest Sunken Garden With Tomb,"Isa Khan was a prominent member among the ruling Lodi family in Delhi.His octagonal shaped tomb is built in the World Heritage site of Humayun`s tomb  which came up later but had much of its inluences.Isa Khan`s tomb has some distinct ornamentation in the form of canopy,glazed tiles & lattice screens (Jaalis) influenced by Hindu architecture.Its walls contain fresco work which is highlighted by the circular fresco on the ceiling with its unique combination of multi colored florals & geometric patterns coupled with calligraphy adding a radiant glow to the ceiling.Restoration work by ASI in 2011 lead to the discovery of India`s oldest sunken garden attached to a tomb.This practice  was later followed in the construction of Akbar`s Tomb & Taj Mahal.Details in this tomb were later evolved with improvements in the main Humayun`s tomb but on a grander scale.There is a mosque built along with the tomb.The central chamber in the mosque is crowned with a large dome.The monuments may not look as impressive as the main Humayun`s tomb but is definitely worth a visit providing us an insight in to the pre-Moghul Indian Muslim  architecture."
Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,Biddy50,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Couples,Sadly overshadowed by its bigger neighbour,"This beautiful tomb is set within the site of Humayans tomb. A mosque and an octagonal tomb built in the Sur style are enclosed in Isa Khan’s walled complex. An inscription on a sandstone slab inside the tomb dates the construction to 1547-1548, which was during his lifetime. He died in 1548 at the age of 95. Surrounding the tomb is India's oldest sunken garden.One the day we visited everybody seemed to walk straight past this much older & recently restored site to visit the bigger attraction of Humayan's tomb. I would certainly recommend the diversion to admire the beauty & tranquillity of the site."

Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,DNAseI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Solo,Should not be missed,Isa Khan's Tomb is the first tomb building you will come across at when visiting Humayun's Tomb. It is peaceful and far from the hordes of people visiting the bigger attraction further on. A beautiful structure by itself and the certainly worth the detour.
Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,Satyendra Garg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Couples,"The only octagonal tomb in Delhi, next to Humayun tomb.","This is what happens when a monument is located next to a bigger and more famous monument. It gets overlooked.When people visit Humanyun tomb they are so fascinated by that world famous monument which is a World Heritage monument that they sometime ignore this beautiful gem of architecture. Like I have been to Humayun tomb more than a dozen times but always missed this beautiful attraction.When you enter the Humayun tomb complex, right on your side is isa Khan's tomb which is just beautiful. I have visited hundreds of tombs in the city but I do not remember any other octagonal tomb and which is so beautiful. This tomb is of a noble in the court of Sher Shah Sur and this was built about 20 years before Humayun tomb was built. The tomb is in the setting of beautiful gardens and on the western side of it is a mosque. Inside the tomb, there are a number of tombs, and the best thing one can see is beautiful ceiling and exquisitely beautiful jalis.Must visit for those who want to the see a beautiful monument."

It appears different than the other structures in the complex.  According to the plaque, it was built during the Lodi rule and is thus older than the other monuments in the area."

Isa_Khan_s_Tomb,Bornav,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Pre Mughal architecture,"Isa Khan's tomb is located in the same historical complex as Humayun's tomb. It is older than the Mughal monuments in the complex and was built during the Lodhi rule in Delhi, hence it appears different than the other structures. It is a beautiful walled garden tomb along with a mosque nearby. It has been renovated recently and now draws many visitors."
