Janpath_Market,Melanie R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Close to hotel (The Imperial) and busy small clothing market,Small local market with only clothing. Not really where you would go for typical items and more of a local place to buy clothing.
Janpath_Market,Debashis T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Not to be missed,"This market as I believe is mostly popular for decorating, antique and crafted items than dresses unlike other markets in Delhi. It is stretched around the outer circle of CP.It is popular among students and tourist alike. Some good footware shops are here. Only thing require here is bargaining. The more you bargain the better price you get for your desired product."
Janpath_Market,Soumyajit Saha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Janpath Market,Janpath Market is a very large market in New Delhi. People can come to this market to buy items at reasonable rates.
Janpath_Market,mo71ey,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Good little markets ,"We went here on our last day in India. Silly me didn’t realise earlier in the trip that you barter in India! This was a chance to redeem myself. We walked there from our hotel The Lalit, as has been mentioned people try to ‘help’ you they insist they aren’t selling anything they are just on their lunch break even at 10.30am and everyone works for the bank....don’t fall for it. We were polite and had a chat but made it clear we weren’t interest but appreciated their help. The actual markets were small but just outside of the markets there are some stalls there, I liked these ones and purchased 4 skirts at a good price. We arrived there just after 11 as the stores were opening. Worth a look "
Janpath_Market,WeDiscover8890,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Best area for tourist shopping,"By far one of my favourite places to shop as a tourist. Wide array of items available - particular great for home textiles, clothes, shoes, jewellery and souvenir items.Compared to other parts of Delhi there is more space to walk around here and it’s got a relaxed vibe, we didn’t feel the extreme hustle and bustle we did with other parts of Delhi."
Janpath_Market,Kamlesh Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Must Visit Place for Shopping,"In the heart of Capital city, this is amazing place to buy your daily wear clothes with moderate rate.The only thing you need is to do bargaining. The more you bargain the more you buy. From imported jackets to Coats. You may also find shops selling home decorating items. Bargaining is a must, do not buy anything for the 1st price. The place is great for people who know bargaining and are looking to fill the wardrobe for the season in min budget."
Janpath_Market,FreeIndianBird,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,small market but get trendy clothes & accessories,"It is in CP near LIC building you can get clothes, accessories, sandals in cheap prices. This market is for both boys & girls, famous in tourists for handmade clutches, purse, bedcovers, bags, chapal, kurta, dupatta etc.  Inside the market there is no food items but across the road there is good restaurants."
Janpath_Market,sasiwimon c,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Interesting Local Street Market,"Must visit this local marketing, you can find all Indian stuff here. But tourist needed to negotiate for much more 50% discount. "
Janpath_Market,WorldTravellerSoon,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Lots of hassle before you even reach this small market,"We stayed at The Park Hotel which is just across the street from Janpath Market.  The moment we exited the hotel property, we were constantly given advice by strangers.  They said the market was on the left hand side of the hotel (which is wrong); they said there were a lot of pick-pockets and it was not safe at the direction we walked to; they said there was a very safe tourist shopping mall and they could lead us there etc.  Our strategy was: we did not respond to or look at anyone who talked to us and walked straight to the market.  There were more than 10 people that talked to us within the 2 minutes we walked from the hotel to the market. Once you are inside the market, those people would leave you alone.  The market is quite small and people sell t shirts, handbags, souvenirs etc.  There is nothing really interesting.  We spent about 15 mins there.  I truly believe the business of those honest vendors and shops are ruined by those people who try to scam / lure you to their shops or tourist center."
Janpath_Market,NamitaPattnaik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"Perfect for accessories like earrings, necklaces , specs","Nice market which is small and good selection of clothes, earrings , home decor , necklaces , specs. Not many food options but its on Cannaught place so a lot of outlets nearby."
Janpath_Market,KittyKatCarey,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Great Experience ,"We went for souvenirs and it was great! We bought pashmina’s (genuine fake), clothes, jewellery and statues. All the stuff you want  to take back as gifts. Bartering can be fun and if one shop won’t the next one will. Enjoy the experience. The taxi drivers will tell you bad quality and try to take you to other “department” stores for good quality- which it will be but at a much larger cost!"
Janpath_Market,parul k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Good,One can find clothes and accessories at a reasonable price. But you have to be good at bargaining. Otherwise they can very easily make u fool.

Huge variety of merchandise and all at the same place so you don't even have to do much walking. I didn't think the shops were too pushy too. Enjoyed the shopping here more than Dilli Haat and Khan Market which were more upmarket and expensive. If you only have time to shop at one place, I highly recommend Janpath Market."
Janpath_Market,nuke1040,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Shop till you drop,"Best place for shopping of India souvenirs. I visit this place 4 times and always overwhelmed with the beauty of the handicrafts there. The table clothes, bed cover, all hand made with beautiful gemstones design.

The quality and price are both at its best!!!There are small kiosks selling all kinds of cotton clothes and curios which are sold dirt-cheap.There's lots of silver and artificial jewelry(highly recommended Kundan jewelries) studded with semi-precious stones available here. If you are Shisha Lover, there is a shop name “Flavors Adda” one will go crazy with the variety of flavors they offer.

Janpath_Market,martin_hyland,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Interesting experience ,As part of my Delhi adventure i needed to experience the whole market experience. There was a great variety of shops but a lot selling the same thing. However if you don’t mind haggling you can get some good prices. However you will get hassled and invited to every shop and you do become a magnet to street vendors. One chap tried to sell me a snake !!! Not sure how I’d have got that on as hand luggage 😀 worth a visit for the experience alone.

Janpath_Market,lordboots,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,The Tibetan stores are where its at,The local Tibetan markets are exceptional.   One of the things that we love about them is that they are honest and that's a true gem for this area.    We bought a singing bowl at 3 rupee per gram in weight.   This is a fixed price and we appreciate that.   We were able to examine the various products and found one that was perfect for our friend and the price was very fair.   We like fair trade.   Definitely recommend that you visit here.
Janpath_Market,francc,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,A Good Intro to a Market,"Mostly Garments but accessories , shoes, belts etc in the lane for both men n women. Used to have  more overruns and good B type garments but less so now. Mix of American street wear to modern ethnic wear. Shops on the main road a good range of local souvenirs and handicraft as well as soft furnishings etc. spotted some really well made export cushion covers for a steal. Hit or Miss for shopping but a fun activity anyway!"

Janpath_Market,Animesh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,Janpath & Coffee at De Paul's- A Must Do When in Delhi,"It's not just the market, it's the ethos of this city which has grown over the years, but somethings just don't change. Street vendors to showrooms, hustle bustle of the people in hoards, vendors shouting to attract passersby,  artefacts and artificial jewellery, you have it all here at Janpath. Janpath in Hindi language means Path for Public. From Indians to foreigners, from rich to poor, from classes to masses, everyone would have been to Janpath. From clothing items to footwear to artefacts and jewellery, you get it all- mostly export rejects or duplicates. If you go out here for shopping, please consider bargaining as your birthright. You may get an item at even 50% discount of the first quoted price. Cold Coffee of De Paul's is famous, so try not to miss it. Since it's an open market exposed to vagaries of weather, choose season, month and time of the day well for your visit."

Yes you have to haggle, and some of the goods are below par, but underneath there are some really magnificent pieces!The hand beaded items are really quite beautiful. I thought I would find more items like these on our other travels around other parts of India and didn’t buy them, but now I wish I’d bought more things there as I haven’t seen other pieces as beautiful."
Janpath_Market,enigmatic1989,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,"Cheap, trendy and full of variety!!","Have you ever thought of buying stylish clothes but don’t wanna spend too much, or are you fed up with the lack of variety of clothes or accessories? Janpath market is a one stop solution for all your clothing needs be it stylish, casual, formal, seasonal... you name it. They don’t give any sort of guarantee though, and be rest assured that the stuff is not goin to last very long but it’s nothing if not affordable. However, a word of caution, don’t buy the stuff on the first price they speak as the shopkeepers inflate the prices to extreme levels. Mostly it is almost half the quoted price but in some cases I have seen them quote a product at X price and sell it at about 1/4th of the quoted price, so beware!!"

There are hundreds of small shops in a row selling everything from old books to silver jewellery to fridge magnets. It is quite interesting and adventurous to walk on that street hopping from shop to shop. It is centrally located and is connected by well by metro with three stations in close vicinity. It is the perfect place to shop for gifts to take back home for tourists as well as bargain hunters. One side of the street is all shops and the other is cafes bars and eateries so you can hop on the other side for a quick meal after your are exhausted shopping here. Some of the notable stores are Deepaul's for its famous coffee, Silver World for real silver jewellery, Tantra for Tshirts and magnets etc. There are also hundreds of small kiosks and stalls selling artificial jewellery.

Janpath_Market,Fazul M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,The place to shop in Delhi,This is a smart row of shops that run for about 1.5km. It houses many many local traders that sells local goods from the cottage industry. The prices are extremely cheap but do watch out for quality. Do check a few shops first before making a purchase so that you get the best for yourself. Even though the prices are cheap that should not stop you from bargaining as you may be lucky to get a bit more discount but of course you too need to purchase some extra items. Its fair trade. Make time fornthisnplace to really appreciate what it has to offer. Getting there can be easy using a ride shating app like Ola. Have fun!

Janpath_Market,Travelingjohn123,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018,Good shopping,Nice shopping street and Tibetan market. Best place in the city of souvenir hunters. Beware touts trying to direct you away from street to ‘their shop’. They hunt as a pack and are very convincing. If they tell you walk in a different direction (without shops) think twice. We wasted 20 minutes on an obvious scam but figured it out.
Janpath_Market,Becky C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,The best place for souvenir shopping in Delhi,"I love shopping at Janpath Market! So many amazing deals for beautiful souvenirs. But you must be prepared to haggle because the first price will make you want to laugh and walk away. Keep it friendly and light hearted and you will walk away with some gorgeous items and great memories of beautiful India. Highly recommend! Tip: if you have a day in Delhi at the end of your tour, spend it shopping here as you will see many of the items in other cities for sale here for much better prices. Bonus is you don't have to carry your souvenirs around India...leave your shopping for the last minute!"

It is quite popular so over crowded. Prices are very flexible and you have to bargain very hard as some times prices quoted are 2-- 10 times of the prices depending upon your liking, foreigners, tourists,etc. Not good if you do not know the real value of things and art of bargaining. The things are mostly duplicates/ fakes."
Janpath_Market,AKARRR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Lovely street shopping ,"Really I loved this market as i found it very nice for Indian products shopaholic like me.

You can also stop for a snack or a cold coffee at DePaul’s. Operating since 1952, it is one of the oldest hangouts for the youngsters in Delhi. If you are looking for lunch, and have the patience to wait, Sarvarna Bhavan is recommended for finger licking South Indian. Fresco is recommended for an elaborate continental buffet. Happy shopping guys. Have fun."
Janpath_Market,RajeevAbuDhabi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Excellent place for Window Shopping,Janpath is my favorite Destination since I was in Noida in 1997 .

Janpath_Market,Angie G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Definitely worth a visit,"We were walking to this market from Connaught place and about 5 people stopped us and told us not to go down the street and that it was very unsafe for tourists- they all tried to direct us back across to a 'mall'. I was quite spooked as they were all very emphatic but my husband was much more sensible and pointed out that they were all trying to direct us to the mall via a tuk tuk.. we carried on and it is definitely worth a visit and was completely and utterly safe.Lots of touristy type shopping if that is what you want - shops, stalls, emporiums and some lovely Tibetan shops at the end.I am sure that we paid slightly over the odds for some things but I was happy with my presents and am not a great 'haggler'.Obviously there is a bit of persistence from some of the traders but that is to be expected in India and is part of the experience.Definitely worth a visit and do not be put off by the men who tell you that it is not a good area.A lot of stalls were not open until about 11.30 so do not go early."
Janpath_Market,HighHeelsPinkLips,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,""" Street shopping with bargaining ""","Janpath Market can be easily accessed by road or by metro ( take exit gate no. 6 or 7 of Rajiv Chowk Metro Station ). Various ATMs and banks lie in close proximity in case you are short of cash. Its a wonderful market suitable for street shopping of apparels, footwear, jewellery, handicrafts, show pieces and numerous local made products. The only thing you need here is the art of bargaining and ample time at disposal. Would recommend this market for clothing, jewellery and handicrafts shoppers especially. Cash is the preferable mode of payment but some shopkeepers do accept Paytm as well. Kindly carry a big shopping bag where you can fit in all your purchases as they usually wrap the items in thin polythene bags carrying which becomes cumbersome. Bought trendy gowns for mere 400 INR each, jewellery for mere 120 INR and a show piece of Buddha for 200 INR only. It is indeed a shopaholics' paradise! "

Unfortunately i discarded the receipt so i dont know the name of the store but its located about two or three blocks from McDonalds on the opposite side of the street. The store has a lot of sterling silver jewelry and weighs pieces to give a price, the shop looks clean and reputable but IT IS NOT! Very disappointing."

Janpath_Market,PookieTravels,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Pretty great,"These are tiny shops (Indian and Tibetan) and some street vendors, it seems to go on for blocks but after a while it all begins to look the same so you don’t have to do the whole thing.  Good bargaining, great prices."

Janpath_Market,Chris B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,Fun place to visit,"Janpath isn't too far from Connaught Place.  If you're looking for cheap gifts to take home, then this is the place to visit. The ladies here are pushy but nice - they have to make a living so accept that you can say no and walk away.Some of their stuff is nice but make sure you inspect it before you buy as some things can be stained or frayed.  Bargaining is de rigeur, not to mention good fun.  Don't expect top quality but the prices reflect that.  Always be aware of your surroundings and keep your valuables close; don't get too distracted by the goods on display as cars/tuk-tuks are always present and it's up to you to keep out of the way.Janpath should be on your 'Must visit' list if you want some good bargains."
Janpath_Market,tina s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Great place,This place was truly one of best markets I visited as it had good priced items and they were willing to bargain with us. There was a variety of handicrafts souvenirs jewellery everything that I was looking for. I found all things I needed in this place jus shame hadn’t discovered it earlier as not many places do lanterns lamps bags jewellery and souvenirs for reasonable prices. If you are buying jus double check it is sometimes cheaper to by from the side street shops there then the market stall it self as I bought a bell which would’ve been cheaper from shop then the stall it was exactly the same one. Most my shopping for gifts was done here. Highly recommend we also did our mendhi  there. There are food stalls there too so you can have a stop and eat.

Janpath_Market,eccythump,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Great inexpensive and not too much hassle,"Spent a few hours here wandering the markets. Found the retailers friendly, willing to bargain and not pushy if you choose to walk away. There were a few street ladies carrying babies begging and following us for a little too long but we kept walking and not engaging and finally they left us as we must have walked too far for them. We bought cheap men's tshirts for INR200 each  from the street stalls and then more expensive better quality tshirts with quality transfers for INR499 each from a tshirt shop on the street at the start of the market (they had cool Om and Ganesh symbols as well as oodles of other designs). Also bought some scarves and pashminas, beads, leather belts, little souvenirs and even a brass bugle!! You can get just about anything here, even a snake charmer pipe!!Was lots of fun and close distance to CP. Take a shopping bag as you will need it!Recommended. "
