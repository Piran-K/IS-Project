Jantar_Mantar,macedonboy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Astronomy,"Saw this back in December and forgot to write a review until now. These are 18th century astronomical instruments primarily for compiling the times and movements of the sun, moon and planets, and for predicting their future movements. These ones in Delhi were also built by the Rajput ruler Jai Singh II and are very similar to the Jantar Mantar in Jaipur, also built by the same dude. The difference between these and the ones in Jaipur are that these are terracotta coloured. The Jantar Mantar here is bigger but less well maintained than the ones in Jaipur. If I hadn’t already seen the ones in Jaipur, I would’ve given this a higher score. The entrance price is also quite steep if you’re a foreigner just to see astronomical instruments that no longer function."

It was constructed a few 100 years ago by the Maharaja of Jaipur to make accurate astronomical calculations. The main building is a sundial and it is quite accurate. The different buildings comprise of different ""yantras"" to calculate time, seasons, astronomical events etc. There is a lot of maths /measurementsinvolved and visiting with a knowledgeable guide would make your visit much more rewarding.Even without a guide, we enjoyed our visit."

The visit to this place was very disappointing. Nothing much to see. Maintenance is in a bad shape and many areas are out of bounds. Even the structures (Instruments) in Jantar Mantar do not carry detailed information boards for the benefit of visitors. I think it is being renovated so anybody planning to visit this place first see if it has been fully renovated. At present, a visit will only lead to disappointed.  "

I heard about this place since my childhood and had a great expectation but when reached, I found this place is avarage or below that. This is a collection of 5 astronomical instrument structrure made by Raja Joy Singh in 18th century. It required more researcha nd studies to improve this place. A demonstration of each instrument would a be a great help for visitors to understand this complex astronomical theory."

The 13 structures are large architectural astronomy instruments used to make accurate observations for the purpose of predicting solar, lunar and planetary movements.They really did not have any clear explanations on how the structures worked which is a shame as hubby likes this sort of stuff.Everything was so run down it was a waste of time pun intended."

Jantar_Mantar,Peter I,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Amazing Constructions,"I rather liked this place with its weird constructions, used to track time and the movements of planets.  Its situated right beside Jaipur's City Palace. The building program was initiated by Jai Singh II in 1728, with restoration carried out in 1901. There are a number of massive sundials each one bigger than the next which were built to give greater accuracy in telling the time. Its reputed that the largest one could tell the time with accuracy to 2 seconds. Impressive for the 18th century. Also check out the series of astrological constructions, one each for the signs of the zodiac. Without a guide to explain what's going on just enjoy loooking at the exhibits on a short visit and cross over to the City Palace."

Jantar_Mantar,Purvi P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Too hot to visit in May ! ,"U need to Guide to understand the nuisances of this place , otherwise it’s just place structures build for you. The way it’s made is absolutely mind blowing to know the time of the day here in India. Also the section which can get u information related to solar system and Nakshatras is marvellous. It’s not so well maintained . The Jaipur one is better with Marbles finish. The garden is clean however hope they keep it in better condition. "
Jantar_Mantar,Karthik Das,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Jantar Mantar - Architecture of astronimical proportions,"Generally people associate Delhi's  Jantar Mantar as one for peaceful marches and a protest site. Like its famed counterpart in Jaipur, this contains some architectural wonders of medieval times which required a thorough understanding of astronomy, solar and lunar calendars,geography and architecture ofcourse. Be sure to hire a guide who will tell you the significance of the choice of selection of the place, the many curiously shaped edifices which have some connection with either the Sun, moon, Pole Star or the Solstice and Equinox. An engineering and architectural marvel."

Jantar_Mantar,KANewYork,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Interesting astronomical structures,There is an entry fee and tickets are sold right outside the gates. Indians get cheaper tickets. The gardens are kept fairly neat. The building could use a bit more TLC.

Jantar_Mantar,Rezwanur R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Won't feel amused if you aren't into astrology,"I wasn't eager to visit this place but my friend insisted so I had to accompany him. There are some structures made to point out the direction of stars & other Astro related things. You'll get some good framing for pictures.but yeah, it gets boring after spending more than half an hour.At least I didn't enjoy this place much."
Jantar_Mantar,sumitkumar20993,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,An Astronomical Place,"At Jantar Mantar, I came with my some friends with a curiosity. I had heard a lot about Jantar Mantar from my childhood. When I was in Delhi first time, I planned for the Jantar Mantar with some of my friends. When we reached there we took tickets. There were two categories of tickets, one for the Indian and other for the foreigners. We entered in the campus of Jantar Mantar, the place was decorated with the green grass, flowers, plants, and trees. Inside the campus, there was the beautiful construction of a number of astronomical instruments. But all the instruments were not in good condition. There was lack of maintenance of these instruments. The Jantar Mantar is situated at the good location and in the centre of the Delhi. Here I knew the importance of these astronomical instruments. It was a plasure to visit here."
Jantar_Mantar,Rasheedur Rahman Shihab,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,Tourist Attraction,The place has a large tourist attraction in Delhi. A must visit place for all the tourists if you are in Delhi.
Jantar_Mantar,gargichat,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Poor maintenance,"This is a huge open air astronomical observatory. Was sad to see that this 250 odd years old structure, with many instruments, in the heart of the capital city, is suffering from poor maintenance. Some pieces are broken, others need paint. Slightly dismal overall. While the sign boards are adequate, there is a paucity of trained guides.The grounds are reasonably maintained, where people seemed to be having picnics on a Saturday afternoon. Rs.15 per head ticket might be a deterrent for hordes of people to don't in for the picnic as there was in places like India Gate.Just wish more care was expended for better preservation. And efforts given to create an attractive destination by the authorities, like live demonstration, maybe at a high cost. It could be an interesting place with these improvements."
Jantar_Mantar,John_Bristol_England,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Stunning architecture / instrumentation,"This park comprises a large number of astronomical instruments.  Sounds boring, but these are huge and could at first glance be taken for gigantic early 20th century artworks.In fact they are hundreds of years old, and still deliver good readings of time, date, and much more.There are signs in English explaining how they work, but I believe you would get more from these with a qualified guide.A great way to spend a quiet hour or two away from the noise that is Delhi."
Jantar_Mantar,Peter S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Interesting Visit,"We came here to learn something about how and why astronomy was important in the past. Unfortunately we got picked up by a ""Guide"" inside the observatory, just after the entry kiosk, who just wouldn't go away and who was difficult to understand. He had a Tourist-India government pass and just kept talking at us in difficult to understand English and wouldn't go away. We let him do his thing, then went round again at our own pace with time to read the descriptions, which thankfully had English translations.All the descriptions were comprehensive and clear about ""what"" observations were made and with which instruments. However, there was no information on ""how"" the instruments were used i.e. how the structures were used in detail, what precision was achieved, what instruments were placed on the structures, how were results recorded etc.We enjoyed our visit overall and my point above is not likely to be an issue for most people but, as an amateur astronomer, I had hoped for more detail to compare with how I go about my observations."
Jantar_Mantar,UtkarshMaheshwari,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,The ancient Science Museum,This is a place not less then an Ancient Science Museum. You will love to see the clock which is designed on the basis of the sun movements. Similarly all the structures are designed so scientifically that one must go and feel proud of our ancestors.

Jantar_Mantar,Shounak Patwardhan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Inspiring Ancient Astronomy Instruments,"It is quite amazing to understand how interested Maharaja Jai Singh II must have been in Astronomy to build all the instruments in Jantar Mantar. The explanations provided about the instruments are complicated but you can make sense if you read them properly. That being said, it would help a lot more to read about the instruments online in advance. The structures are huge and if you're visiting them on a sunny day, you'll see that they still work perfectly. The area is well maintained, clean and the garden surrounding it is pretty neat. Calm and peaceful surroundings. The place isn't too crowded but if you want even lesser people, visit it in early mornings."

Jantar_Mantar,Ema Datshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,The crazy red skateboard park,"I've been to the Jantar Mantars in both Delhi and Jaipur and I like the Delhi one the best. I think it's the deep red colour of the buildings that appeals, plus the general crazy 'feel' of the place.My husband always says this looks like a giant skateboard park. I don't think it matters whether you understand what's there or what it's supposed to do, it's just fun to wander around and soak up the atmosphere."
