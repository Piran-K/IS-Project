Jhandewala_Devi_Mandir_l_Temple,advabhishek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Must visit.,"This is one temple where despite ""comparatively"" limited resources, discipline is observed very meticulously. There a couple of more temples surrounding the main temple and the cleanliness is maintained very meticulously. The only turn offs are the narrow lanes and limited parking space. Beggars in the lanes are eye sores."
Jhandewala_Devi_Mandir_l_Temple,Anil K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Devotion Overrated,The temple has too many followers and is one of the best in terms of spirituality. Coming onto cleanliness it is same as other temple too much dirty.For a follower I would recommend only he has strong belief.For a Traveler I would not recommend as it same as other temples. Instead I would recommend Birla Mandir
