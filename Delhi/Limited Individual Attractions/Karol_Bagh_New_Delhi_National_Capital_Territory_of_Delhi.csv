Karol_Bagh,Bhanu Pratap Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Best Street Market,"Karol Bagh is one of the most expensive places in Delhi. Karol Bagh market is a bit crowded but must visit place for shopping lovers. You can find amazing street shops to buy good quality products at a minimum price.  If you are going to Karol Bagh by your car, then this might not be a good place for you until you find a professional parking space nearby. In my case, I use PARK+ parking which saves a lot of my time and stress."

Karol_Bagh,Glen Campbell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Bargain hunters dream area.,"I strongly suggest you practice bartering before you head into this area.  Generally start at about 10-15% and don’t go above 25.  Stay friendly and keep a smile on your face as you haggle.  You need to be really careful what they are trying to sell you.  Call their bluff every time.  Tell them it’s a 2nd or 3rd copy not first.  The price difference is significant.  For example a first copy watch might go for 2500, whereas a 2nd or third is only worth 1000 or less.If it looks remotely bad on first inspection you can be assured underneath it will be complete rubbish.This is a great area to go to for shopping and it has most things.  Very big on phones and technology, bags, clothing and absolutely massive on shoes (100’s if not 1000’s of shoe places)"

Karol_Bagh,Krishna,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,"Ajmal khan Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi","Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi, India is the largest shopping areas in Delhi. It has everything one is looking for. It used to be crowded and off late people were not willing to Come here because of traffic jams. Now the government has taken fantastic steps to decongest the whole area of Karol Bagh. Today the roads are just traffic free. They have provided parking lots in Sastri Park, Bank Street, Ajmal Khan Park (Lawn-1) where hundreds of vehicles can be parked. They have also provided free rides from parking lots to shopping roads. The uniqueness of this market is you get fantastic, reasonably prized goods for all like Kids, male and females. No doubt malls are catching up, but the kind of things you get here you don’t get in malls. If you have a wedding in family one can come here stay in good hotels reasonably priced  and finish his shopping like Jewellery, clothes, wedding clothes like sherwani etc, Beauty saloons, shoes, dry fruits, etc, it has many restaurants where one can have various type of food"

Karol_Bagh,Mari Leis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Great street market,"This area is special for shopping, and it has a great street market, as well as a very cheap department store. I love staying here, though lately the new city planning rules have been tightened and some hotel services are not as good as they used to be. It's called gentrification, I believe, and also a result of a recent hotel fire. It's unfortunate because it's one of my favorite areas."

Karol_Bagh,Iain Campbell,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Busy,"We stayed for 2 nights although we hadn’t planned to, we got caught out with lack of travel options following Diwali. The streets are very busy, there is not the same scale of approaches trying to sell you goods or services but it is still pretty full on. We found the metro really easy to use, the hotels and tuk tuk drivers may well tell you otherwise. Spice by nature is a safe choice if you want somewhere you understand the menu and English is spoken. We also went to a place where we couldn’t understand the menu, other than know it was veggie, and they spoke very little English. That place was actually really good too. We didn’t go to the market as it was a bit much for us having just arrived. Be very clear and firm with tuk tuk drivers. We did not find a single one that didn’t try to take us somewhere we didn’t want to go."

Several shops lined the streets, but it was the people selling things off the backs of carts, motorbikes and out of bags that really caught our attention. There was an excellent energy and vibe about the markets, but we were also glad to reach our destination as the amount of people moving and jostling along the main street got a little too much in the end.

Karol_Bagh,Caroline M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Perfect for people watching. ,"Very, very busy but a great atmosphere. The markets are bustling selling anything you could possibly ask for. Some high end shops but I will be honest, I did not venture in. "
Karol_Bagh,Pete B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Bustling,Everything you'd expect from an Asian market with posh empty shops behind. Karol Bagh is for shoppers who want a bargain and there are some fixed prices to be had. It is what it is but in this downtown part of New Delhi it's hardly pristine and there's plenty of tat.
Karol_Bagh,Petenac,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Amazing sights and sounds,"Wonderful, crazy, chaotic, noisy assault on the sense from all directions - thats how I would describe Karol Bagh. Amazing range of street and shop vendors, selling just about anything you could think of - prices very good (although be prepared to haggle) and of course quality can vary. Lots of food vendors too, including some established names like McDonalds. It is worth visiting just to experience the hustle and bustle of the place - fantastic!"

Karol_Bagh,Madhavi Dabeesingh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Karol Bagh,"From my own experience travelling over the years, Karol Bagh is the inevitable place to be when visiting Delhi. It's a happening, jumble packed residential/ commercial hub. A shopalholic's trip would be sadly incomplete if Karol Bagh does not figure on the agenda. It's an area where everything is under one big roof. You will find an amazing good mix of the affluent and back packing tourists as well as locals. My suggestion: draw an imaginary rectangle enclosing Pusa road, Gurudwara road, Arya Samaj road and Ajmal khan road. Loop in Ghaffar market, slightly on the outline. Shop within this contained area combing thoroughly all the arteries.Easy- walk all if them or enjoy the convenient and cheap stop- over rides from the countless bicycle/ auto rickshaws. The affluent will be delighted at the enormous variety of products the branded shops have to offer. You will be amazed at the panoply of leather and woollen jackets and blazers, top world brand skinny jeans, formal and stylish office wear, the best watches, world class pashminas. You will be dazzled for choice regarding shoes, bags, party clutches if you have a red carpet function ahead. Outlets for the latest iphones, gadgets, gizmos offering exciting hot deals are sure to surprise you. For prospective indian brides and grooms, Karol Bagh is sheer paradise. For those on tight budgets, plan wisely so you don't miss the swarming Monday markets. The shutters of all the branded shops are down then, accomodating multifarious hawkers. Export surpluses, absolutely cool stuff, is up for grabs. Karol Bagh has it all at your finger tips - luxury hotels, modern metro lines, shopping, fast food, multi- cuisine restaurants, services like travel tours, hospitals, banks, travel exchange, ATM's, wellness spas, just to name a few. I must mention the abounding roadside fruits and nuts stalls and sweet shops. Have a look. It's simply exhilarating. On the flip side, i have always found state- of- the art chemists, hairdressers and bookshops miserably lacking. Entrepreneurs take note! A word of caution during your trip: Be vigilant on your wallet and personal belongings. Better be safe than sorry."
Karol_Bagh,Abhijeetkini,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Shopping and good food,"When in Delhi, this is one the places you definitely must head to get a feel of the Delhi-life. Busy, crowded and just over whelming to the senses, Karol bagh has everything....shopping, food, clothes and so much more. Once you get off the metro station, just follow the straight road which gets crazier and crazier with the crowds swelling as you go forward. Do not miss Punjab sweet corner for their awesome golgappas and sweets and look out for the smaller street side vendors selling chats and something called the moonglet which is an omelette like dish made with chickpea flour and lentils. Also housed in Karol bagh is the iconic Roshan di Kulfi, a crowd favorite when it comes to awesome kulfis and chaat."
Karol_Bagh,aarti_rele,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Famous area in Old Delhi for shopping,"In case, you are really keen to buy lot of items for home ranging from furnishing to wall units, handicraft pieces, decoration items, seat covers, etc you must visit karol baug wherein you would get all that & that too at an affordable price after doing a laot of bargaining, You get very good dresses, shirts, trousers, sarees as well."
Karol_Bagh,wilsongirl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Bustling market area,"We have been visiting India on holidays every couple of years for the last 18 years.  We always stay in Karol Bagh.  There have been many changes over the years; initially all the roads were dirt and there were very few restaurants.  If you went out at night a torch was a must have.  The shops have become more upmarket and not so many people selling used clothing.Karol Bhag is our home from home in Delhi and we love it here, especially the bakers and the Thali restaurant that have been here since our first visit.An excellent location with hotels at reasonable prices and sightseeing is easy due to the metro on your doorstep.Overall one of our favourite places to stay in India"

Karol_Bagh,Raja P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Heavy traffic jam,Avoid coming to this place from your car. Its very jam packed with people and sellers. Just stroll around the streets for cloths and other things to shop. If a guy comes to you saying please come to our shop which is located inside a lane (not on the main road) then please avoid him as he gets commission for bringing customers to that shop and obviously the price quoted by the shopkeeper will be high and sometimes you wont even get what you want and the guy has simply dragged you to there. Lot of south indian restaurants.
Karol_Bagh,268yusufn,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,WHOLESALE MARKET,The market is known for Wholesale . Its once of the busiest market in delhi. The major wholesale market are GAFFAR and TANG ROAD.
