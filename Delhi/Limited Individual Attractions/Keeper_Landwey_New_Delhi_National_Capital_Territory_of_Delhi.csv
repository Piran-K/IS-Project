,,,,,"As a local I have many choices as to where to visit and I can honestly say when it comes to a 5 star experience be poolside relaxing, or indulging in some spa treatments you will find no better. The staff are welcoming, professional, and provide a service that is second to none. The Spa features beautiful decoration and relaxing treatment rooms. I really felt at home whilst there and the prices reflect great value for the top quality products used such as Thalgo which is really the best money can buy! Palbar Lhamo was my therapist during my visit for facial and she did everything she could to make me feel comfortable. I would highly reccomend her as she made the experience very beautiful.I would reccomend visiting The Umrao Hotel for any service it offers as it is above parr in every aspect. Elegance at its best."
