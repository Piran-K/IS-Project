Khan_Market,Dungarubba,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,An enjoyable few hours with lots of great shops and places to eat,"I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere here. The shop assistants were all helpful but didn't follow me around like so many others do in India. The Anokhi and Fabindia stores were both well stocked and large, and there was a great choice of cafes and restaurants as well as fresh fruit and groceries so I was happy. There was a lot more to see, so if you visit, allow plenty of time to browse and enjoy yourself. Parking was also good when we arrived at about 11am"
Khan_Market,GenX,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,NIce place,Beautiful place of the Delhi and useful with good market of all products .  here you can buy product at good price.
Khan_Market,ianwyj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Good for a wander and a meal,"I was staying in a hotel just a few minutes' walk away from Khan Market, and it was an easy decision to spend a couple of hours wandering around the area.  It's not a large market in terms of size but there appeared to be something for most visitors - fashion outlet, jewellery, electronic goods, money changers, bookstores, mobile phone merchants, and custom repairs all featured.  And I also managed to get a filling meal at one of the many intriguing restaurants, most of which had entrances on the inner lane."
Khan_Market,Brijesh shah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Friends,Place to Spend free time,"A place to visit in your free time , when you are in Delhi , I bet you will be having fun over there. You can have all types of best quality foods , shopping of all items and many more."
Khan_Market,ScubaJoJo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,"Little bit of this, little of that","You can find all bits and bobs here, kinda like an up market market. There are shops rather than stalls, some basic others luxurious.  Bonus - 3 pet shops!! Couldn't find a nail salon but a few hairdressers.  Lots of eateries to choose from. "
Khan_Market,Vanshika C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Friends,Fun day ,Today I visited this very beautiful cafe in Khan Market and had such droolworthy and delicious food here.They served the best shrimps and paneer tikka and otb bomb was my favourite drink I had so far.Must try!
Khan_Market,Ays Espiritu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Not what I expected,"A part of our tour in the city is a market shopping, so I expected to find a nice local market offering locally produced items. Khan Market also offers that but it is more for tourists or foreigners living in the area with a budget.A local staff later on told me that it is a posh and expensive market. Expensive indeed but not really posh. The place is already run-down.There are expensive, branded and high quality brands but the shops are really small. I enjoyed shopping for fruits though!I think the big shopping malls are a better alternative if you want to shop for branded and high quality brands conveniently. Or if you want to shop in a local Indian market, there are some place else."
Khan_Market,PowerPasta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Lovely wander,"Great place to wander and window shop. Some lovely place to eat here as well. Some shops e pensive, but quality is good."
Khan_Market,Smokey128,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,Best place to shop,"This for my Friend and I was the best place to shop in Delhi. The choice of shop was remarkable, the quality of the goods on offer fabulous and we did not find the prices steep for what was on offer. There are also a wonderful array of beautiful little coffee shops in the market offering little cakes and stunning coffee. Give yourself time to visit the entire market as it is quite large. "
Khan_Market,David S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Disappointing market,We visited this market - it was disappointing - the shops were too modern and very expensive and we found it hard to get a local meal. Try the India Art market about  2km away - more authentic.
Khan_Market,Maria P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Beautiful shops but expensive,"Really lovely shopping here - not a ""market"" more shops as in a higher class area.  Wish I could afford some of the gorgeous dresses."
Khan_Market,Reem,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"""A must visit"" Traditional Market","It's a traditional market where you will find textiles, tailoring accessories, street food, precious stones and other things.The place is crowded and polluted, make sure to wear your face mask and take care of your personal belongings."
Khan_Market,fozjon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"ou ""go to"" market in Delhi","we can pretty much buy everything we want at Khan Market. There are great grocery stores with western goods and many other shops that sell things, at least, that we as foreigners want."
Khan_Market,UKGlobalTraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,My favourite place to shop and explore ,"Loved this place .. loads of great shops - check our Good Earth .. great variety of places to eat - bakeries (sugar and spice being my absolute favourite) .. easy to navigate .. not as crowded as the others around Delhi and much more upmarket .. no hawkers .. no beggars .. and Tuk Tuks can’t go inside so they’ll drop you off outside .. they generally will tell you it’s all designer labels that you can get anywhere else which is total nonsense .. there are loads of interesting and quirky (quality and priced accordingly) stores that cater to men and women .. definitely visit, have a mooch, but something unique and have a coffe/cake/lunch and/or drink .. My favourite place in Delhi ... "
Khan_Market,Anoop Khullar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Business,Business Meet,"Coffee Beans and tea Leaf, Khan Market, Perfect place for a Good meal in between hours of Business, or evening, Casual seating, light music and a Good Small Menu serving Variety of Sanwiches,Pastry ,Beverages etc .Grilled Chicken and Cheese, Chicken Hawwain Sandwiches were very Good, Iced Cofee Latte , and choice of Coffees and Teas.rs 1200 for two.Recommended."

Khan_Market,racheb_10,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Business,Excellent food and shopping,We loved the Perch restaurant (great wine) and a Parsi option called Soda Bottle Opener Wala. Great shopping at Fabindia and Anhoki (clothes and home). Great bookstores. And much more.
Khan_Market,Didi M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Very orderly gem,Some people told me Khan Market was overpriced.  There's a wide variety from el cheapo to expensive (such as Amrapauli Jewellery) but it's your choice.  Khan is probably my favorite market for gift shopping and just wandering. The touts are not as intrusive and in your face as most other markets.
Khan_Market,RajeeS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,High-end market,"Love walking through the shops here. Nice cafes to stop for bites. Please go to Barisons, the book shop. It’s at the main entrance to the market, you can spend hours here. I’ve gone to Anokhi on several visits, and they’ve been very consistent with their poor service. They are such a put off, nothing changes there. Playclan has some nice quirky dresses and shirts, it’s a small set up but good service. Other than that, it’s nice to spend a free day at the market without the haggling of other markets. "
Khan_Market,Ghadeer2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,1951,"Khan market was Established in 1951. It is a U-shaped double story complexes. It was busy and crowded in the morning.

Khan_Market,HuntleyNewYork,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Not worth the visit ,It’s just a jumble of stores that don’t look all that great and don’t offer anything fantastic. Would not recommend. 
Khan_Market,speckles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN,"Incredible place.  Don’t take a car as it is hard to park. Just Uber or tuk tuk over.  There is a small apple store as well as many other cell phone and electronics stores, fabric and clothing stores, restaurants, at least three pet stores.  I was searching for a very specific cable to fit my headset into an airplane socket and after trying three places found SAI gadgets which had an assortment of cables and adapters.  They even tried to set up out to make sure it worked."

Khan_Market,Yhuang Tsaki,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Great place,A place aure to visit if one is in a mood to grab up nice and varied stuff from India. We can easily get nemerous kinds of stuff at cheap prices amd with a good quality.
Khan_Market,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Better shops and less hectic than a local market,"Khan Market is a retail and shopping district in the Rabindra Nagar area of New Delhi. The market is located in some of the most well to do districts of Delhi and unsurprisingly, the shops are ranked as some of the most expensive in India. Khan market is much more organized and cleaner than local markets. While expensive, it’s a great place to shop and hang out especially for foreigners looking for something less hectic than a local market."
Khan_Market,Sunil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Khan's market,The place is very old and you can find varieties of products in single place and you can buy clothes for quite cheap
Khan_Market,chikpick,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A good shopping experience,"Closed on sundays, this market is a well known costly market. At any time one can see many foreigners shopping mainly because of its location. All exotic fruits and grocery items are available. Also various expensive brand stores are there. Many restaurants serving alcohol and various cuisines are also located. In all a good place to shop, dine and stroll around."

Khan_Market,URP70,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Lovely market to discover surprising gift items,Beautiful market with most of the high end brands here but what i liked was small nook store where you could discover fancy gift items within your budget. found a few and bought some great gifts for friends and family. Also window shopped for pricey brands to see what is there in the market.

Khan_Market,Jasmine C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,While away the hours and shop in peace,"Nice place to get away from the bustle, still busy but you can pop from shop to shop very easy without any hastle, all the usual such a fabindia and anokhi, designers and grocers, shops selling traditional products also. It is pricier than street market but a much more chilled experience. Great restaurants and bars also. Easy to while away the hours..."
Khan_Market,BayareaMom,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Love this market!!! 👏👏👏👍,"I have grown to love this market over the years. In my younger years, I found it expensive, but as I am crunched for time on my India visits with family, I find this market addresses all my needs with very little hassle. Stores like Cottons Jaipur and Fab India have better stuff here compared to their other stores. I can say the same for food too."
Khan_Market,orielh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Underwhelming ,"I expected great things of this market, it having been recommended by a friend who lived in Delhi for many years. In the event I was disappointed. There are a handful of internationally recognised brands like Marks and Spencer, Bodyshop, W H Smith etc and lots  of other units selling food, fabrics etc. It was difficult to find good a coffee shop with wifi. It was an interesting experience but I'm open minded about whether I'd go again. "
Khan_Market,Alwaystravellinng,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,"Safe, less hassle and good food too",Not the typical Delhi shopping experience as no hawkers hastling you and time to relax if you need a quick bout of retail therapy. Shops are probably more expensive but good staff and good range of products. Make a couple of hours and conclude with a quick dinner as an alternative to the hotel. 
Khan_Market,Robert K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,All in one - easy to get everything.,"Meals, gifts, clothes, you name it you will find it here. Things may be more expensive but the convenience and time are worth the additional cost."

Khan_Market,Sanjeev Takyar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Chaotic market,"Overhyped, overpriced, market with no easy parking, jams inside the market, not enough space for walking, the restaurants on first floor have very steep staircase, and barely one person can walk at a time in these stairs, otherwise good for shopping with designer stores and abundance of restaurants, plus point, you get all imported stuff here in food but check the expiry, the shopkeepers are not courteous."
Khan_Market,sharjeelcool,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Good,I must say this is definitely one of the best places if you want to indulge in some shopping.it has so much to offer
Khan_Market,David Keane,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,THIS MARKET IS SO COOL.,"I spent a rainy evening prodding around the small allies full of shops selling clothes and different cloths. The prices were expensive for India but it is still cheaper than the West. One reason to go is the quality of the gifts will be better than cheaper markets I believe. There is a cafe there with movie posters which makes a lovely latte and toasted cheese and tomato sandwich.My friend got a haircut for 150 Indian Rupees and it turned out great, A great place to goto."
Khan_Market,curious_and.curiouser,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,The place to see and be seen,"Very hipster place offering more upscale shopping and F&B, think Anoki, Fabindia, Good Earth etc. Adjust your budget accordingly and you'll be in for a good time. Saw lots of well-heeled folk arriving in the evening in style in big expensive cars, looks like Khan Market is the place to see and be seen, definitely the go-to spot for a great night out. If you're looking for more down to earth shopping, go to Janpath Market."
Khan_Market,Manava,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Hang out,"From food to shoping everything is here. Good brands are there. Delhi clothes, kudtas all you get.  This place is modern and cool.

Khan_Market,mkhaki2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Great variety of shops if you have limited time in Delhi,"This is my one stop shopping and dining place in South Delhi. Behri Sons is a must stop for books and it has an impressive range, including some obscure titles that my Toronto friend saddles me with - I always have trouble finding his titles in Mumbai and Kolkata - here I was 7 for 7 for his and 10 for 5 form me (I ended up buying way more that I was planning to!)Excellent clothing stores, prices are high, but you get what you pay for! There's even a Fabindia store. Good choice of restaurants.  Make sure that you are clear about prices in the fruit stores. The one I walked into I bought fruit that is hard to find in Toronto. However, a box of Jamun, 1 kg of fresh dates and 4 custard apples cost me almost CAD$30. It is always the ""helpful"" shop assistant that piles up your basket, and I suppose I was not diligent enough. It's just that one does not expect that they would stiff foreigners in an upscale shopping mall."

Khan_Market,Julia G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Couples,Not much to do there aka the bureaucrat’s market,"The market is small and posh, full of expensive clothes shops and cafes. It is not a good place for travellers who are looking for a real Indian bazaar experience. It is only a nice place if you want to have a good coffee for lots of rupees, otherwise it’s a waste of time. BUT we really enjoyed a stationery around the corner and a man who works there, check it out. "

Khan_Market,Gurpreet S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Amazing place for eating and shopping,The pet shops here are well stocked and the clothes shop named - Banjara - is good. Do bargain a little. Azam’s shop for non veg in the rear lane is the most economical place to eat while standing in the street or else for taking along the packed food. Their Seekh kababs are mouth watering and superbly reasonable at Rs170 for a plate. Khan market offers the best in terms of exotic fruits and vegetables .
Khan_Market,LPBfromSunsetBeach,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Lots of Shops,A good place to do some shopping in New Delhi. Something neat to see in every little nook and cranny. Fabindia and Cotton are among my favorite clothing shops there.

Khan_Market,travelgoods,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,1 place not to miss on a visit to Delhi!,"Who would have thought a odd looking alley way with dogs lying around, a couple of men sitting outside chatting can hide such a rich array of fashion, eateries, and specialist stores.On the outside the market is surrounded by little stores all around the edge selling everything from fragrances, electronics, handbags, pet goods, ( a colleague bought her dog shoes in the market) and the most amazing Home stores. The pastry and cake shops deserve special mention and these rival the best shops around the world. The inner passage plays host to some of Delhi's top fashion designers and well as some of the best restaurants Delhi has to offer. My personal recommendation ""The Town hall""  If you were not looking you would walk straight past the little white door on the yellow wall, almost int he center of the market. Do not judge a book by its cover, walk up 2 sets of stairs and be blown away by the amazing, decor, and food that will take your breath away in presentation as well as taste. Do yourself a favor, pop into Khan market for the evening. Go early enough to do shopping before dinner. Make sure you have a reservation to avoid disappointment especially on the weekend. End the evening off with a decadent slice of cheese cake from ""The Cakery""Delhi you continue to surprise!!! Khan market, I will be back, I have at least another 40 types of cheesecake to try."

Khan_Market,Carlton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Great area to spend an afternoon or evening,"Khan market is loaded with food and shopping options that make it a worthy visit for locals and visitors alike. The options are varied, so having a rough plan of what kind of food you want may help narrow down the options. The Big Chill for pizza and ice cream as well as Bahrisons Kid’s bookstore are our favorites, but there are plenty other tempting options including bakeries, barbecue, a beer cafe, and more!"
Khan_Market,Tamara B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Great Shopping or Afternoon Tea (coffee),"Incredible area for shopping as there are many hi-end shops such as Fabindia, local designer shops, lots of coffee and pastry options along with bargain places for shawls, shoes and jewelry.

Khan_Market,TYPSUKR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Business,Popular Shopping Center,"It was raining when we visited, so we didn't get to spend as much time as I would have liked. The stores here clearly cater to an upper-middle class clientele (including one of the only two Starbucks I saw in New Delhi). Some of the stores are fairly traditional (i.e. selling books and paper products) while some others, particularly the restaurants, could have been something that you'd find in the United States. Neat to visit, but be sure to do some research (about the various shops) before visiting to make the best use of your time."
Khan_Market,PFTraveller62,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Shopping Area,More of a shopping area than a market. A mixture of trendy local shops and western ones like  M&S lingerie and Hamleys. Was looking more for markets selling local clothing. Noticed a few local restaurants and bars typically on the second floors.
Khan_Market,newyorknytrip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Trendy Shopping Centre,"Khan Market has been, and continues to be a premier shopping centre in New Delhi.It has it all, be it elite restaurants, eateries, quality meatshops, or high end stores selling a plethora of goods ranging from attire, footwear, bags,and accessories to daily necessities. It does not end here-the inner lanes and bylanes are filled with stalls selling fashion items at affordable rates.Additionally, Khan Market's Lok Nayak Bhawan is a one stop destination for fancy lights and fittings which are available at competitive rates.To top it all, it is a popular and elite shopping area where one can see everyone sporting the latest fashion trends! Indeed an interesting place to visit in New Delhi."
Khan_Market,gauth333,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Crazy....Don't know for what,Located in Luyetn's Delhi area  the market is highly over rated. Place has cramped parking space and there is traffic jam almost always during peak hours. There are some good eating joints and shopping places but almost every where stuff you buy are overpriced. Layout of the market is not extraordinary. I would not consider this a must do when visiting Delhi but it can be a place to splurge out extra cash if you don;t know what to do with 'em.
Khan_Market,The Lodge at Manor Barn,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Over rated ,"Don’t bother with this place as it’s distinctly average . A parade of low grade shops with the odd high end one mainly sun glasses , most odd .Back street restaurants which felt very touristy. Give it a miss "
Khan_Market,Elizabeth V,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Very over rated,"Supposed to be a collection of shops and restaurants.  Shops were cheap and tacky (belonged on Blackpool promenade) apart from Marks & Spencer lingerie shop.  Restaurants were also over-sold and dirty.  Disappointed and wished we hadn't visited.  Packed out with tourists who seemed to be gawping/window shopping, and not helping the local economy."
Khan_Market,Carole J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018,Fun mix of locals and tourists,"A haven after the hassles of tourist Delhi.  Great book shop, and good local eateries.  Beware tuk tuk drivers who tell you it is closed!  "
Khan_Market,my2cents2day,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,The spot for great series of restaurants,At first we were looking for a market but really we found a Restaurant strip without habituel touts harassing you every 3 seconds like Connaught AreaAnd we discovered in our opinion the spot named The Chatter House.It has a large sign in alley way and is located on the 2nd floorLet your eyes and taste buds figure out the rest... what a menu and what a chefPs im writing you 3 days after going..It was really perfect and safe.When you finish there go to the Big chill bakery for desert...around the cornerMy2cents

Good for hangouts in eveningYou can enjoy shopping here specially boutique, books and some crafts etc. However, the stuffs are quite costly here"
Khan_Market,Vinod A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Great food,It is always a pleasure to visit this restaurant and enjoy authentic Chineese cuisine. Their consistent standard of food and service keep taking us there off and on whenever we are in mood to have Chineese food. Great place. Only negative point is the location on 1st and 2nd floor. Otherwise good ambience !!
Khan_Market,Cain R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,A vacation from the vacation ,"Love this area.Everything's so familiar here.You don't get chased by drivers and sellers.You can find whatever food you're looking for or buy whatever branded goods you like.This has low key and high key locations in a very compact area.Coffee shops, bars and restaurants are plenty here and it's pretty clean.We were tired of all the chicken and curry and vegan food so we came here for a break.So great place to have a breather."
Khan_Market,ChelzeannK22,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Boutique Shopping in Khan Market,"If you have stepped foot near Chandni Chowk, Khan Market will feel like a breath of fresh air. The scene is much less chaotic and is packed full of small boutiques just begging for attention. Big Chill seems to be the ""IT"" place to grab food, I didn't have time to stop in to eat but there was a line of patrons waiting for a table, which always seems like a good sign! "
Khan_Market,francc,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Great and Wide Selection ,"A large collection of shophouses offering everything from premium fresh fruit andvegetables to trendy cafes and restaurants , slippers to tailors , brass souvenirs to designer labels. A good feel of what local daily shopping is for upper middle class delhites ! Lots of well priced and interesting locally made gifts to be bought ! Many Good Cafes and Restaurants. A generous amount of car park lots too. "
Khan_Market,MvdK01,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Luxury shops but dirty area,"I don’t get it. Khan Market is having all kinds of really high end shops and restaurants and yet the area is crowded, not organised, and it feels uncomfortable in the evenings. This place needs an urgent make-over to be able to compete with the shopping malls who have the same shops and restaurants, as those are usually chains."
Khan_Market,aquabell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Upmarket shopping restaurant and tailors,My second visit to Delhi and i again found myself drawn back to Khan Market as it just has everything. Jacket made at Grovers. Shirts for my husband and myself at B Rai and sons. Lovely toiletries shower gel etc at forest essentials-and Karma. Great restaurant. Try the cocktails and mac cheese croquettes at Sly Granny. Great modern indian food at Baar Baar a pop up restaurant from New York. 
Khan_Market,Sonali M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Great shops and ambience,"Khan Market is always bustling with people. It has a great variety of shops, ranging from those unique to the market to high-end designer wear. There are clothing stores, jewelry stores, make-up , skin and hair-care stores, bookstores and more. There is also great variety and quality in the eating places, from Indian food to Chinese, Italian and more.Townhall is excellent for food and ambience, The Big Chills restaurant, cafe, and cakery all have amazing food, drink, and desserts."
Khan_Market,Gan S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,One stop visit,"Has just about everything you need. Lots of high end and international brands. Chich cafes and artisan grocery stores complete the menu. Parking is a nightmare especially on Sundays. Surroundings, as with the rest of Delhi are dirty and unkempt. "
Khan_Market,Evie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Total quality and no traffic!,"We went to Khan Market specifically to have a massage at Spa55, which was totally fabulous, but the whole experience was a delight to walk this chic and very up-Market market! There is no traffic inside the market which makes a nice change and all the offerings are very high end and beautiful! Don’t expect a super bargain in Khan Market but do expect tasteful and quality!"
Khan_Market,lutl88,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Upmarket part of Delhi to eat/shop,"Corridor of dining places and shops, presumably for white-collar crowd. Kebabs and cafes were excellent. Besides that, nothing remarkable."
Khan_Market,FredYin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Posh - by Delhi standards ,relatively expensive but good quality shops. Not a big area so maybe spend 1-2 hours is enough to see the whole thing.
Khan_Market,Dev,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Must taste once,The Mughlai chicken and mutton items are very delicious here. Once tasted definitely you will come back again. Slightly expensive than other restaurants.
Khan_Market,megpage2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,Bit confusing but a pleasant place to visit,Told its a must do for Delhi shopping. Store fronts are quite narrow so you need to know your local brands to want to go in. Luxury brands same same as anywhere else. Loved how the stray dogs hung out just near the petshop door. Khan Chacha saved the market rating for me
Khan_Market,anjan m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Highly expensive shops,You get good choice and quality stuff but it is an expensive market. Restaurants are classy and serves excellent international menu.
Khan_Market,Christopher B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,The Great Escape: Of Your Money,"I never fail to visit Khan Market on my visits to New Delhi! I love the cheese cakes, chocolates, books, high-end food markets and cosmetics! I like the fancy shops, bustle and just plain fun!"
