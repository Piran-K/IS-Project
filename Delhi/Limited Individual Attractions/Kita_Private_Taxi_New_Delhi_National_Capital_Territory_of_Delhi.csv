Kita_Private_Taxi,JerseyResi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Amazing Golden Triangle Trip - with Kita Taxi / Driver Services,"After getting multiple quotes for Golden Triangle Road Trip decided to settle for Kita as their rates for Taxi with Driver services were competitive. They were quick to respond and clarify any questions during the booking process. I didn't wanted to be tied up with a fixed schedule and wanted flexibility at all time with respect to what to see and where to go. Kita assured that it will be the case.Upon arrival at the Airport, different car in the same category came to receive me which I was not thrilled about as I had specifically asked for Innova. Kumar who I was coordinating with, patiently listened to my concern and ack'd the mixup. He requested if I can use the other car for the first day and he can arrange for Innova next day onwards, which I obliged. Sure enough I had new car and driver next day.The driver ( Sunil ) was a very cheerful person with lots of local know about and stories to tell. He too was exceptional with his service and was very flexible with timings. There were days we started early and ended late but he was happy to stretch the day as needed. He was a careful driver and drove within speed limits giving a sense of security in the foggy driving conditions of New Delhi. This was important to me as we had small kids traveling. Throughout the trip, I kept in touch with Kumar updating him on how the trip is going and if I needed to tweak anything in the schedule on the fly. Kumar was happy to accommodate every small request I made.Overall, Kita, specifically Kumar, ensured that I had a pleasant trip and adjusted to my requirements throughout the trip. I would rate Kita highly as they understand customer needs and will go above and beyond to make sure they are satisfied with the services provided."
Kita_Private_Taxi,Dino,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Great trip thanks to a fantastic driver,"My trip to Agra did not start as I had intended and I am lucky that was the case as I met Kumar of Kita Private Taxi...I had intended to catch a train to Agra from Delhi to see the Taj Mahal which I thought was a good idea. Spoiler alert -  it probably was not and in any event all the trains for the day were full. That is how I ended up meeting Kumar and he turned was feeling like a lost cause into a magical trip to not just the Taj Mahal but all that Agra has to offer. Kumar is an incredible character who throughout life has worked to build long-term relationships, meaning he does not try to overcharge an individual because they are a tourist and instead wants everyone to come and visit India again. Kumar truly goes ‘above and beyond’ in everything that he does and cannot do enough to make his customer’s trip as special as possible.I highly, highly recommend if you are ever in Delhi or are interested in booking a driver to visit the Golden Triangle and beyond.Thank you, Kumar."

Kita_Private_Taxi,Carlos LC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Solo,A big thanks to Mr. Kumar from Mexico,"This review is long over due but I personally have to commend Kumar for his wonderful service. Not only is he an ideal trusworthy companion to visit and travel around India, but he is a remarkable human being and a tremendously joyful individual. He will be there for you in your time in India and he will do his best to make sure you have a comfortable and unique experience. Most people would say that you shouldn’t trust a turism guide when they want to take you places not within your schedule but Kumar has nothing but worthwile surprises to show and you wont regret stoping over by one or two during your trip. I spent 5 days traveling with him and a friend of mine and it was one of the most memorable experiences of our time in India. I wish him all the best in life and I will definitely be seeing more of him if I ever go back to India. If your are looking for some one that will make you feel safe and looked after, trust that Kumar is the most adequate for the job. I am truly honored to be able to call him my friend."

Kita_Private_Taxi,happydays356,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Tour of Golden Triangle,"My husband and I have just completed a ten day tour of the sights of the Golden Triangle with Pramod Kumar. This was our first trip to India and we could not have asked for a better driver/guide.  PK is polite, manerly and a very experienced driver who negotiates the often chaotic roads of India with skill, taking into account his passengers comfort and safety at all times.  His 20 years working as a driver certainly shows.  He is always punctual and his car is spotlessly clean inside and out.  PK imparts his knowledge of his country and the places visited with enthusiasm and passion as well as giving advice on safety issues such as touts, organising excellent restaurants and accommodation.  PK is very easy to get along with and nothing is too much trouble for him.  We very much enjoyed listening to him talk about his family and stories of past trips.We had organised this trip independently, however after discussing our trip, we took his advice which allowed us to celebrate Diwali which was an amazing experience that we will never forget.  For our next visit to India we will certainly be liasing with PK in advance and seeking his advice.We highly recommend PK as your guide/driver and can guarantee you will not be disappointed.Thank you PK for making our first trip to India such a memorable experience and look forward to seeing you soon.Ewan and Fiona"
