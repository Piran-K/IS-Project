Kuber_Tours,Uday K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Golden Triangle Tour.,"Kuber welcomed us with great hospitality when we joined our friends for a day trip to Taj Mahal. They were going for a two week tour with Kuber already for the second time as the first was such a great experience.Already before traveling, he was of great assistance in planning and arranging our travel. Once we traveled with him, we enjoyed his calm and safe way of driving - we felt so secure even in crazy Indian traffic that we slept most of our ride in very early morning to Taj Mahal.He would arrange for everything we needed: find a shop for shoes shopping for one is our friends, get tickets before going to Taj Mahal, when looking for needles for the Saree, he called his wife to find out where to get them and went with us to get them.He is simply such a friendly, calm and helpful person who always is in a good mood, so you can really enjoy travelling with him!If we go go back to India, we'll definitely travel with him again!"

Kuber_Tours,Curious793442,,,,"A friend recommended Kuber Tours. I travelled alone and wanted someone trustworthy and reliable. Kuber is both an excellent drivers and all concerns were put to rest. He took care of me, made sure I was fed, but above all he showed me so many different sites, both expected and unexpected. We had wonderful insightful conversations, great food, the Taj Mahal, and he didn't even complain when I asked him to take me to the Elephant Village, a sanctuary close to Jaipur, which wasn't planned at all. All in all 2 awesome, perfect days. Thanks a million Kuber!"

Kuber_Tours,Inka Darmawan,,,,"We (six 20-year old girls) took Kuber Tours to see the Golden Triangle (Delhi, Agra, Jaipur) for the first time. Before going into the trip, we were all quite anxious about the travel arrangements, long drives on highways, and safety. However, once we met our driver Vikram (who was amazing!) we knew it was going to be a fun safe trip.Vikram took great care in us. He showed us the main touristy attractions as well as local shops where we got the chance to hold a 120-year old scarf, make textiles, try on traditional Indian wear, look at beautiful jewels, and learn the process of making jewelry. It was more than we could have ever asked for! Not once did we feel unsafe. Vikram was always on time and always greeted us with a smile. He is also a human form of Google Maps! He knows how to get everywhere! When we drove around cities he would inform us of the building's history and get great advice throughout the duration of the trip!We looked at many tour companies before choosing Kuber tours, and most of the other ones were large companies with multiple drivers mainly concerned about their profits. But, that was not the case with Kuber tours. I highly recommend that you choose this company because you will not find better service anywhere else! I will certainly use Kuber Tours again!"

,,,,,"I did the Golden Triangle with 5 other friends in three days (Delhi, Agra, Jaipur). We had a great time and Kuber and our driver, Vikram were great in making this trip as wonderful as it was. Kuber Tours was recommended a friend and we would definitely recommend it to others. As a group of six young women traveling together, we were concerned about safety and also getting to experience so much in so little time. Vikram was a great driver, he was very responsive and was always waiting outside when we left places. He also took us around to places outside of the itinerary since we had a lot more time than we expected. He also bought us amazing food and drinks on the way and gave us tips about the places we visited beforehand. We trusted him to plan out our schedule of where to go and eat and we were able to see so much in so little time. He also told us about the history and stories locally which was interesting and he took us to some textile and jewelry shops that we enjoyed. Vikram also called to check in after we left which was very kind. Kuber was also very responsive and trustworthy in the beginning- I researched many tour companies extensively beforehand, but many of them were overpriced or we didn't feel we trusted them. The big ones on Trip Advisor would charge extra for airport transfers and wouldn't let us use an Innova for 6 people, forcing us to pay extra for a larger vehicle. The pricing was very reasonable. I am really grateful that we found this company from a friend. We had an amazing, safe, memorable experience and will be recommending to our friends and family."

For the first 16 days, we engaged Kuber's Tours to take us on our pre chosen route.Arriving at Delhi airport, we were duly met by the lovely Vikram. He was to drive us many miles over the next couple of weeks, from Delhi to Mandawa, Jaipur, Ranthambore, Agra, Chandigargh, Shimla and finally leaving us in Chandigargh once again.He was knowledgable, personable, obliging and happy to go out of his way to make our trip the very best he could. e.g., when I showed knowledge of the step well near the Amber Fort, Jaipur, he later in our tour, deviated slightly to take us to the biggest step well in India.Indian traffic is horrendous but one quickly realised Vikram is very experienced and knew exactly what he was doing. He practically became a fifth member of the party.....although he drew the line at sharing a quick bite at a ""Subway.""!!When Air India badly let us down by cancelling an internal flight to Delhi, Vikram organised train tickets for us via a contact in Delhi. In addition to all this, we received a number of phone calls from Mr Kuber himself who was checking to make sure everything was satisfactory.If ever we went to India again, we wouldn't hesitate to us this company.Thank you, especially Vikram."

We especially liked his open, interested and human nature - we had a lot of great conversations and had a lot of fun together. Altogether we can recommend Kuber as a chauffeur without any restrictions. THANK YOU for everything, Kuber!"

The guide and tour was extremely good, very flexible (appreciate this!) and for that he deserves a special thanks. Mr. Kuber is such a warm personality and highly motivated guide (recommendable!). I truly enjoyed his company and recommendations. The atmosphere was so special and it really felt like home. All respect for Mr Kuber who does a great job there; a true sample of excellent tour guide! Many thanks again and we recommend Mr. Kuber to everyone!Luis and Inês"

Kuber_Tours,DanaAr89,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,The best driver for the best experience!,"We had the pleasure of having Kuber as a driver for our 1 week tour of the golden triangle in India. We started in Delhi, where he picked us up from the airport and from there, through Agra and then Jaipur, he took great care of us. Kuber was so knowledgeable about all the places and the culture, we were always fascinated by his stories. The time spent in the car was also full of fun as Kuber is a very funny person, as well as very smart and we had very interesting conversations with him. We also had lots of laughs and spent a really great time all together. We will always have this trip in our hearts and hope to visit Kuber in Nepal very soon! Thank you our dear Kuber for the perfect experience :)"

We were referred to Mr Kuber by our homestay host because of good reviews. Mr Kuber is a very polite and friendly man that you can have a long talk with about India. We felt safe traveling in his car to the various destinations in Agra, and the price was also reasonable. He was also flexible and made stops when we asked for things (e.g water, ATM, ice cream). Highly recommended!"

We were travelling as a family which included a child and 2 elderly people. Got acquainted from Mr Kuber via Tripadvisor and without any hesitation i contacted him via Whatsapp and his responses have been so swift with advising me on what best itinerary we can have. I am so overwhelmed by the service obtained from Kuber Tours as well as by the driver assigned to us - Suresh sir and Mr Sudeep Gaur, business partner of Mr Kuber. They offer really professional service, very attentive to our even minor requests. I would without doubt request anyone who wants tailor-made tours ranging from hotel booking, travel, guide service....to book via Kuber Tours....To summarise, India is an amazing place to visit and the warmness is reflected in day to day life of the people and Kuber Tours is the EPITOME reflecting the kind of service one expect.....good job sir and keep the passion burning..."

Kuber_Tours,Kuber P,,,,"Thanks to Kuber we enjoyed the holiday of a lifetime exploring Rajastan and the cities of the Golden Triangle. We contacted Kuber via email asking him to propose  a plan for a two week holiday in India. He responded immediately giving us a detailed itinerary. He picked us up at Delhi airport and dropped us there two weeks  later. I think we were very lucky because he proved to be an experienced and attentive escort, a great driver, enjoyable company, a man of good humour and I'd  almost say a good father. He was always in time with his immaculately clean car and I could always feel absolutely safe although traffic there is very different from what we are used to. He hired very experienced local guides for us who were endless sources of information. Kuber was also great help in advising us practical matters like how much tip to give them, where to eat out, where to buy local souvenirs, etc. When travelling he was ready to talk about his country so day by day we managed to understand what we saw much better. During the two weeks we saw so much that it will take some time to digest it. I can only recommend him to anyone and I hope to go back and discover another state of India and Nepal one day with him!"

Beautiful country landscape with sunset along the way. Next day morning, When I got to Taj ticket office, there were already some people in queue. Gate was open at sunrise. The view of Taj monument is spectacular. Agra Fort is also a great to visit. I was surprised by its grand size. Mr. Kuber is the best driver. He is professional. The vehicle is also very clean."
