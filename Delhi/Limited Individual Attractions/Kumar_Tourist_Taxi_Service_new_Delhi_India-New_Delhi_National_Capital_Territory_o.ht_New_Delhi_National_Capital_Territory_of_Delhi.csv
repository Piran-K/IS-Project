Even when we were shopping, he pointed us in the right directions.  He drove all around New Delhi and Old Delhi.  And the following day took us to AGRA to see the Taj Mahal and back.  The Kumar Brothers also added a guide in AGRA who escorted all the way in and gave us some great information about the site.  The guide in AGRA gave us the does and don't and took us through the gates without a wait.  Then the 3 hour ride back to Delhi, Mr Singh pointed out all the local sites and had some interesting information about the areas.  Mr. Singh was the best of the drivers of the Kumar tourist Taxi service.  The company were very responsive on WHATS APP.  Picked us up and dropped us off at the Airport.

Kumar_Tourist_Taxi_Service_new_Delhi_India-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_o.ht,winsess,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Excellent Service Except the Tourist Trap,"We hired Kumar tourist taxi for 15 days, we start our trip from Delhi to which we were accompanied by their tourist guide Sonny to some sites in Delhi, sonny brought us to store which sells very expensive saree and fabric by yards, price is almost 3x or 4x than the other store. Then we proceed in Agra where we meet their guide Ali, he showed us Agra fort and Taj Mahal. He brought us again to local stores which are fixed price and very expensive, we checked the internet the cost of jewelled wall carpet and we found out that the store is more than 5x expensive! Ali even recommend us photographer in Taj Mahal which we agreed and in the end of the trip the photographer give us price of INR 8,000 for 80 hard copy and 2 cds. We felt we were trap and we request to Kamal (our driver) that we no longer need any guide to the next destination. We went to Jaipur, we visit Neemrana Fort where we enjoy our lunch there, we roam around city palace and hawa mahal on our own. Kamal requested that we need to have a guide in the jaigarh fort and amber palace since it is too huge, we agree to hire the guide. Our tourguide in Jaipur is highly recommended, he did not  push us to visit 'tourist' store and very knowledgeable about the history of amber palace.We visit Jaisalmer, the quiant golden city of India, we fell in love with the place. Every villa/haveli's facade here were intricate and well made of sand stones. We asked Kamal to send us tourguide since we already tired and we want to maximize our day visit in this lovely city. Our tourguide showed as the impressive jaisalmer fort and its own Jain Temple, we were in awe when we saw the place. He even showed us the some beautiful haveli and brought us to silver factory where we bought few intricate peices and some ethnic handicrafts which we find price a bit affordable.In jodhpur, we managed to visit Clock tower, Umaid bhawan and Mehrangarh Fort and Museum on our own with the help of Our driver Kamal. Kamal send us to Maharani textiles where we buy a bit expensive shawls and bed linens, this store fabricate their stories being the supplier of hermes, mulberry,kenzo etc. Udaipur, our last stop, we love the cleanliness of this city. We did sidetrip in Chittogarh where Kamal himself became our instant tourguide, he has a bit knowledge on the area. We also went to Ranakpur Jain Temple. And our last day, Kamal send us our guide Uma to walk around the city palace, lake and the garden.Kumar tourist taxi is very reliable company, I hope their tourist guide will no longer bring their tourist to very expensive stores. It will only give a bad name and reputation to the company. Nevertheless, we enjoy India with Kumar Tourist Taxi."

Special mention on driver Harish who has been patient to drive us to places and guided us by prioritizing the sight seeing for the day. It would not have been so pleasantful without him. He spoke well in English and Hindi. He was always with us. He took complete ownership of our stay in the 3 places. he guided us smartly through how to plan our day, good food eats, guarantee places to shop, how to deal with nagging guides at monuments. we have visited around 16 monuments in Delhi, 2 places in mathura, 2 places in Agra, jaipur and places on our way to jaipur aswell. There were instances where he suggested places which were otherwise not in our list, and they turn out to be good. He also asked us to call him in case of need anytime in an unknown city. It was such a relief!! It is particularly important because cab and driver issues can be small but they can ruin the upliftment of your vacation.Our family would totally recommend Harish ji with Kumar Services to anyone across the world. He would make it a hassle-free trip for us."

He understands customer's needs.  His drivers are good and they treat customers well.  They always arrive on time.  Above all, Kumar Taxi Services rates for all sizes of taxis are very competitive.
