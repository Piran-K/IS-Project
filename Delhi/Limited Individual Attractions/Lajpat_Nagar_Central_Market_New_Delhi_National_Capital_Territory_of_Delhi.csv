Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,rajesh u,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Business,Pulse of the city,"Shopping areas tell us about the pulse of the cities and Lajpat Nagar is no exception. It's a must for any visitor. For the Indian tourist it's a great bargain, a place from where you carry back goods. You also carry back the idea about what commerce can do! For the visitor from the West it's more interesting. A melting hub of humanity, in all shapes and attire, bumping into each other, striking out the perfect deal. The salesmen selling shirts selling for less than a dollar to shops stocking the most expensive ones. All in harmony. The small streets are a taken for granted by the locals but are a tourist's delight with the sheer variety of wares, the colorful arrangements and the beautifully lit up atmosphere.Must spend an hour. Enjoy the street food. Walk and soak in the atmosphere. It's a must."

Affordable beautiful clothing and local street foods,"I mostly went to Lajpat Nagar central market for two things: shopping (especially traditional Indian clothes), and eat the famous chat right at the entrance of the market during the evening hours. The clothes are decent and cheap. Bargaining skills can come handy. While there are clothes on deal on the street market, there are also permanent shops that have clothes of higher quality. They are of course a bit more expensive.  There is also one amazing stationary in lajpat nagar if you are into art and stationary. Place is crowded with locals, and for me that a positive aspect. "

Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,Morgan W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Travel with a Local,"I would not advise a tourist to visit the bazaar alone because it is a huge rabbit warren of twisted streets that do start to look alike. Make a list before hand, so you don't miss out on anything you were planning on buying. Prices are usually good, but some vendors expect bargaining and others do not. The brick and mortar stores have fixed prices.Sturdy walking shoes are recommended, too."

Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,SandeepSaha1967,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,South Delhi's answer to Delhi-6?,"It's a market where you get everything from a needle to a house. The only catch is that for a beginner or an infrequent visitor, you don't know where to go for what. But that's where the charm perhaps lies as you navigate the many lanes and talk to the push-cart vendors for directions.In chaos and disordiness, it vies with the famed Chandni Chowk and even has its legendary chaat and snack joints of its own. On the options, the price range, the chances of getting your price, the variety of things on offer, one could not ask for more.The administration has made several hesitant attempts to bring order, but the theory of entropy finally always prevails - everything will ultimately reach its higher order of randomness."
Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,Atm530,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Two extremes of the Market,This market was good to experience people watching but not for my needs for things were either too expensive or too junky. The merchants were not as helpful as other parts of India.  I bought at one shop and found things 4 times cheaper in other markets. The chain stores on the other hand in LN Market were helpful and midrange in prices with fairly good quality products.

It was out of the box for me and couldnt control myself frkm having more..What my perception was that Afghani dishes were not apicy and bland in taste.

Some were but not all.Staffs - very cordial and courteous and they have a smile on their face which makes you smile too...Its a small but cosy and comfortable restaurant in Lajpat nagar.Would definitely recommend it to all...

Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,Vaibhav S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Desi Shopping Hub in the Heart of Delhi ....,"I've been to this place several times with my family, recently I was there on the last weekend, although this was not in the actual plan and we were to visit only National Science Centre in Delhi but as we were done well in time, my wife just initiated the thought of going there.We visited the place and first of all had a wonderful lunch out there just across the road in front of the market ...cann't remember the name but it was just a street food counter and we enjoyed the vada pav and tawa pulav ( this was amazing ). Afterwards, we entered the market which was like vally of dreams for my wife, huge number of shops with ladies apparels and footwears and that too with a heavy scope of negotiations.So, if you are a shopping freak you must visit this place in Delhi. And believe me you won't be left out hungry as there are so many street food options available.The only concern is the parking, if you are lucky you will get it otherwise they do have street side parking also available, but I feel the best way is to reach over there is by using public conveyance in order to have a tension free experience. But just load your pockets if you are going with your wives :)"

Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,Shopkhoj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,Inside the anonymous Amar Colony furniture market in Delhi,"When my German  friend first told me about the furniture market in Amar Colony , I was actually dismissive about the very idea.  Amar Colony is a congested area in South Delhi. It is known for shops for  bridal wear dresses that are available at very reasonable prices .Who would go to Amar Colony for furniture , was my  thought . I was aware of the   MG Road furniture shops in  Gurgaon and the Kirti Nagar furniture market in West Delhi.But  Amar Colony in South Delhi ?Where on earth could that be .We soon  made enquiries and found our way . The approach to the market is quite difficult  , as  we found out when we were on our way there . This place is right in the heart of the Amar Colony residential area where there are  lots of small row houses . It is  a congested  area with very little parking space. Even the roads are narrow . Two wheelers, small cars, big cars, pedestrians and dogs are all moving along the same narrow road.   It is by accident that we found this  Delhi shopping market . There is no signage .  Dusty dressing tables and cupboards  were on the roadside. A single chair was being given the final polish at the  end of the road. There is a chaiwala ( tea stall vendor) dishing out innumerable cups of tea. I must say that we were not prepared for something this huge. It is  about  2000 square yards of open space . It is like a huge courtyard . The furniture shops are at the back end of the courtyard. There are unfinished furniture pieces by the hundreds all over the place. We make our way in through a narrow passage  where  loaders were busy ferrying furniture pieces in and out .  Cupboards, chest of drawers and  work desks are some of pieces  that were stocked here .They were all unfinished pieces , waiting to be polished and delivered.As we proceeded further , we  spotted the row of shops. They are not  really distinct furniture shops but rather  they are a single stretch of shops, each having a defined space ,approximately 25’ by 10 ‘, covered with  plastic sheets for   protection from sun& rain. They are temporary shelters, so there is no permanent roof over these shops.  There is a kind of walk way that would lead you to all the shops . The walkway is also stored with furniture.  There is a  common area behind the  shops for polishing and providing the finishing touches to the furniture pieces..  As we started walking and checking out the shops , we found several  antique  cupboards ,chest of drawers , stools, settees, center tables, bar stools, sofa sets, beds , dressing tables, coat hangers and treasure chests  . There were tin posters and brass idols , brass elephants , statues  ,lanterns, antique telephones and a myriad other items. What an amazing experience in the heart of Delhi.  Let me leave you with the following images ,,,"
Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,lataw13,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,A good market to roam in,This market is pretty good for most things. It’s a good one to walk through as you’ll get a bit of everything in terms of shopping and food.

Every latest trendy cloth can be found here at the best prices! Moreover, there are a lot of food options for the tired shoppers to indulge in. "

Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,YatriForever,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Cash & carry.,"Visited this market after several years. Despite of demonitisation, its still a cash culture here. This is yet another legacy market of Delhi, around for six decades or more, catering to the middle class economy.There's bargaining, but is much less than what I've seen in the past. One should have a purpose to be here, you need to know your target items and shops, else time will fly. Best to go here in Uber or Ola or Metro, parking is a huge issue for self driven cars. We were here looking for curtains and other living room soft furnishing. There are ample options for decent food. However, I wouldn't rate this matket as a tourist attraction for first time visitors to Delhi, particularly for those who are from other metros and big towns of India. "
Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,Peeyush P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Shopper heaven,"A very crowded place, with very little space for pedestrians. Parking is also a nightmare at most times. However, if you brave all these little obstacles, the visit will be worth it, since this market is a delight for shoppers. Almost everything is available here, fitting every budget. While the pavements are full of excellent bargains, there are also large showrooms for expensive branded items with large range of choices. For those looking for apparel and footwear, especially of the budget variety, this market is one of the best places to visit. Even if you don't purchase anything, the browsing will be worthwhile. Also, you will not go hungry while shopping, since there is enough supply of yummy street food, from ram-laddoo to Chinese chaat and everything in between. If you crave branded fast food, just visit the food court of the 3Cs mall."

I've been to a few in Delhi but I enjoy this one the most because while there are crowds it is not as overwhelming as others but still retains the energy, it has excellent road side good options particularly in the momo department, and most importantly the store managers are not aggressive. While there are bigger and more famous markets, come to this one if you want a local feel without the headache. "

Lajpat_Nagar_Central_Market,AweInclusive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Shoppers: Put This On Your To-Do List Now,"This place is a sight for sore pockets. For realz.After being scammed at other locations when trying to find nice Indian attire, it felt so good to walk into an exciting location with a ton of variety and MARKED PRICES!This market has everything. Sis and I walked around for hours exploring clothes, jewelry, shoes, and accessories. The vendors also arrange tailoring! My sister bought a dress and the vendor walked us to the next street over where tailors were set up with sewing machines and the works. He took her measurements and when we came back 20 minutes later, her dress was finished! And the tailor didn’t charge, so I guess they have an agreement with the vendor.We also found a row of guys doing henna. We got our hands done in the most beautiful design and it lasted for a week. We made sure to do the henna near the market closing time so that we had finished our shopping and didn’t have to touch anything. There are tons of rickshaws, bikes, and taxis around, so you won’t have an issue finding a ride when it’s time to leave.In addition to shops, there are plenty of restaurants including chains like Burger King, and a few ATMs scattered about. We wished that we’d have found this location much earlier during our travels. It would have saved us literally hundreds of dollars on souvenirs!Although many of the shops have souvenir type items, there are some fancier clothing, jewelry, and décor shops as well. Basically everything for anyone! We loved it!"
