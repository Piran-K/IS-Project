Lodhi_Garden,Sonia Makhija,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Must add to your delhi trip itinerary,"Since we stayed in Taj Ambassador New Delhi, Lodhi Gardens was quite close to our hotel and was on our list to go for. Hence we went right in the winter morning around 11 am and had a great time. The garden is not just a garden its a beautiful place to have some me time, family picnic sort of time, relaxing and aaway from City chaos especially Delhi traffic and pollution. It has monumental structures hence serves great backdrops for photographs as well. It was not too crowded as well and if you love a bit if history, architecture and peace then this is must to add on your list to Delhi."
Lodhi_Garden,keith h,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Beautiful Lodhi Garden.,"If you are looking for a respite from the hustle & bustle & pollution of New Delhi a visit to Lodhi Gardens is the perfect destination.  Whenever I am in Delhi I always pay at least one visit to the gardens & I generally make a day of it by firstly visiting nearby Safdarjung's Tomb prior to walking round to Lodhi Gardens. Afterwards I either take a tuk tuk or walk to the beautiful grounds of Sunder Nursery.    Lodhi Gardens are situated in a quiet , up market area , not really far from central Delhi. If you are feeling like a good walk you can walk all the way along Janpath from Connaught Circle to reach there. Otherwise , take the metro to Jor Bagh or Khan Market & it is a short walk from either. If you go to Jor Bagh you can visit Safdarjang's Tomb en route.   The gardens cover 90 acres & are extremely well kept & patrolled. Large expanses of grass are punctuated by mature trees ( some labelled ), numerous walkways & paths , flower beds & numerous seats.   Tombs & structures from the Sayyid & Lodhi dynasties are notable . Also the Athipula bridge which spans a lake near the garden entrance on Subramanian Bharti Marg. The bridge dates from the reign of Akbar & the lake features a high reaching fountain & many geese & ducks which have the use & safety of a large , fenced compound.   The gardens are very popular with Delhiites & you can see many families enjoying a visit with picnics , some with pet dogs. Also it seems to be a popular venue for couples to get videos made of themselves in their finery.    Ladies walk around with baskets of children's toys for sale , balanced on their heads & if you are fancying a hot drink there is usually a roving chai wallah to be found.   Near the Lodhi Rd entrance you will find some glasshouses & flower beds & a great cluster of flowers in terracotta pots.   Lovely place to visit - stroll about , sit on a seat , soak in the vibe."

Lodhi_Garden,Payal G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,The best comes free,"Generally the Lodhi Gardens stay off the beaten track for tourists visiting Delhi the first time. However, these gardens should be on the must visit list for anyone interested in history and architecture as they house several monuments from the myriad pre-Mughal Islamic dynasties that ruled Delhi. Some of the relatively restored monuments include the Aathpul, Bada Gumbad mosque, Shish Gumbad, tomb of Muhammad Shah Sayyid and the fort like tomb of Sikandar Lodi. These gardens have served as the location in many movies and picture shoots. However, due to their expanse they still offer a great place for unwinding (in the daylight). It's a five minute walk across the road from the splendid Safdarjung tomb and about 10 minutes walk from the Jor Bagh station on the yellow line. And the best thing - it's free of cost for one and all."

Lodhi_Garden,Rohit Gera,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,A garden that beats New Yorks Central Park,Lodhi Garden is a lush green garden where one can sit for hours and rest. It has huge trees; buildings and structures that are historic. There is water body in it having a lot of ducks. It is also a bird sanctuary. It has a 2.5 km jogging track. It is neat and very well maintained. Toilets are very very clean.Parking is limited. If you are an American or European you must visit this park for the love of greenary. Take some pictures. Would not have seen so many flower types. There is also a Rose Garden inside. Must visit if you are in Delhi. Avoid sundays if feel claustrophobic in crowd. Enjoy nature.
Lodhi_Garden,SanjeevMal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A beautiful monument cum park in the heart of Delhi,"Lodhi Garden attracts walkers, joggers, photographers, tourists, picnickers and people wanting to spend time close to nature. It has some monuments, including a mosque and tombs from the Ibrahim Lodhi era. One can see the beautiful blue tiles in some places in the Sheesha Gumbad and the Bara Gumbad the later also has some beautiful calligraphy on its walls and ceilings. The trees and flowers are well maintained and walking paths are well laid out. Lodhi garden is especially good in the winters and autumn season.Parking is a problem and on a non-working day, one can park in the lanes near the Lodhi Garden. The nearest metro station would be Jor Bagh and Khan Market. Cycles for hire are available at the Jor Bagh metro station."
