Lotus_Temple,podrozniczka60,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Baha’i temple with stunning architecture .,"The Lotus Temple is also known as Baha’i House of Warship. This is a very worthy destination while visiting Delhi. The entrance is free but you get to be screened at the gate. Fairly busy and crowded. The large area is fenced in and very nicely landscaped. The foot traffic is guided and regulated. You have to deposit your shoe in a provided bag and subsequently in an underground full service well organized locker. The architecture and design of the temple is both simple and stunning. You have to be prepared to stand in a very long and slowly moving line to enter. The auditorium sits 1300 and welcomes you to sit down for a moment of meditation. Booklets in Hindu and English are provided and your to keep. Np pictures are allowed to be taken inside. Visit also the information center at the opposite end of the property.Do not expect bathrooms in the information center, there is a separate building with toilets on the way from the temple."
Lotus_Temple,Carlo F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Interesting place with for an interesting concept,"Never been before to a Bahāʾī temple, honestly discovered their existence very recently. A place to visit, a sense of freedom and quiet all around you, very well taken care of. Mind the fact that you have to remove the shoes to enter and that no food or cigarettes and similar are allowed in; maybe this could be written somewhere in big format outside the side ... otherwise, it gets too late ...  a place absolutely not to miss if you are in the area and worth returning."
Lotus_Temple,DrValliappan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Solo,"Lotus Temple with 9 petals per whorl in 3 whorls attracts world's attention as it is non-religious and stresses on ""Silence is P","Bahai Temple aka ""The Lotus Temple"", in Noida Area on the outskirts of New Delhi, is a place of Peace Worship that demonstrates silence can be peaceful and powerful. It is a place open to all religions. In absolute silence of visitors, scriptures from Budha and Bahai are read out or sung and the acoustics inside the lotus dome make it vibrate through one's body, mind and soul. It is closed on Mondays. Open from 8 AM-6 PM (April to September) and 8:30 AM -5 PM (October -March). No entrance fee. Only requirement is silence. No Photos inside the temple and cellphones on silent mode. Foot wear to be removed and put in a bag provided, which can be deposited to a counter on the way in, a token issued  and the bag can be collected at the counter on left on your way out. Visitors from all countries can be seen visiting this place and weekend visitors are more. The longer prayer times are 10 AM, 12 Noon, 2 PM and 4 PM. visitors are not allowed for these sessions and Bahai followers participate. It is better to visit after 10 AM and before 12 Noon as visitors are usually less. Then, it gets crowded. Visitors are requested to queue up, remove foot wear, maintain silence, no photos inside, mobile silent etc in Hindi & English and each session for visitors last 10 minutes inside the dome. That way 6 batches per hour fill the hall inside the dome. Inside of the dome resembles a church with sunken pit for stage, with just lamps lit. No figures or pics of God or Light through a window pane as in a Synagogue. That's why it is appealing to all religions and domestic/ International visitors. Some say the Lotus dome is based on Australian structure at Sydney (Opera House). This structure is based on Lotus Flower with 9 petals per whorl, in 3 whorls, totalling 27 lotus petals."
Lotus_Temple,Anand Sethi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Excellent Tourist Spot of Delhi,Excellent. Must visit while your stay in Delhi. Should be on the top list. Entrance is free. Go early morning to avoid the daily public rush as it can get very crowded during the day any day of the week. Very picturesque place and you would love to take lots of pictures. One of the most beautiful tourist site.

Lotus_Temple,PANDEY JI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Beautiful ,Marvel of Modern Engineering.Beautiful Bahai Temple.Very well managed and maintained.Observe silence in the sanctum.
Lotus_Temple,Natalie1204,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,Beautiful feeling of peace within.,It’s commendable how clean they manage to clean the place. Personally I found a lot of peace once inside the temple  - I wish people were more mindful and considerate of others though. It’s absolutely free to enter which is one of the reasons why hundreds throng to it. It’s very organised. They take your shoes in a bag and you walk into the main hall bare feet. It’s a stark white room - very peaceful and a great place to reflect and meditate. Loved how calm and connected I felt in there. You Photography is not allowed in the main hall and silence is requested here. There’s no rush and the volunteers allow you to spend as much time once inside the hall. It’s recommend to visit this site in winter as it’s quite a long walk before you reach the inside and it can get quite harsh in the Delhi sun.
Lotus_Temple,Neelam Rawat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,Peaceful and clean,"You easily commute to this place - there is no entry fee - a lot of food options outside.This place is a bit crowded during weekends but weekdays are best time to visit.It's very peaceful and we'll managed, you can carry your stuff like, mobile, camera, wallet or water bottle there is no restrictions.I find this place suitable for photography and hanging alone as it's very safe you can also visit with your family or friends !!Must visit at least once !! Enjoy !!"
Lotus_Temple,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Striking building.,"THIS Bahai House of Worship offers the visitor a string of contrasts.Perhaps the most striking is the fierce heat of Delhi on the outside with the cool interior of the Lotus Temple where people come to meditate and pray.Intriguingly there are nine pools which help play a significant role in the natural cooling system of the prayer hall.The temple itself, constructed in the shape of a lotus flower with twenty-seven petals, rises more than 100ft and can seat 1,300 people inside.There is strictly no photography, no videoing and no talking allowed inside and this is watchfully enforced.When I went the gardens leading to the temple were in beautiful condition with gardeners everywhere weeding and clipping.It was a long walk to the main structure so there was plenty of time to admire the Frangipane trees, lawns, shrubs and flowers along the way.When I finally arrived I loved the pools and their reflections which you could both view at water level or from a terraced area above.My body reacted with pleasure at the sharp drop in temperature when I went inside and sat down on the marble seating.There was time for a little thought beneath the soaring ceiling and I found the whole visit very refreshing.Make sure you have bottled water with you as the heat can be fierce."
Lotus_Temple,KodoDrummer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,Present day marvel,"This lotus house of reflection and prayer, was designed to cater to India’s four major religious groups, all recognizing the lotus as a major symbol. Be prepared for long lines to enter and to take off your footwear to enter the temple. No photo taking allowed inside the temple."
Lotus_Temple,NVKOnTheGo,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Maintenance of approach road required,"20 years ago this temple was so well maintained and had a good charm to it. However in a recent trip the maintenance was found to be not up to the mark. People were made to stand in lines for their turn to get into the meditation hall where we are supposed to be silent. However the volunteer managing the lines was chaotic and shouting all the time. The area outside the the temple premises has also deteriorated due to too many homeless people wandering about and we saw tons of them drying their clothes on police barricades. The approach to the place looked shoddy, the walk to the temple was endless in the Delhi heat, the line mismanaged. The only peaceful thing was sitting in the meditation hall finally. Wish there was more upkeep of the surroundings."
Lotus_Temple,Aaditya Paudel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,The Bahai Temple of Worship | Lotus Temple,A must-visit temple devoted to Bahai.  This architecture is based on the sacred lotus flower and is built like one. Closed on Mondays though.

Lotus_Temple,Lakshmi Biradar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Solo,"Enchanting ambience, attractive lotus shape building structure.","The Lotus Temple is amazing and architecture which Lotus flower shape. It one of the tourists attraction in Delhi. The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad ""petals"" arranged in clusters to form lotus flower shape. It has huge hall which holds the capacity of 1000+ people. It's meditation hall with enchanting ambience where everyone is welcome regardless of the religion. From the main gate one has to walk atleast 600 meters to reach this temple. During covid lockdown visiting Tim's was changed. Sunday is holiday."
Lotus_Temple,Footloose,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Passable if you are in rush,"Visited in July 2022 with family. No entry ticket required. Architecture is beautiful however in heat of Delhi (we were visiting at 10 a.m.) walking bare feet is no fun. One needs to deposit their shoes and walk up to the temple. The very thin and damaged coir covering on the path barely protected from the hot floor underneath. Totally get it that the bare foot policy is to keep the place clean, but adequate arrangements must be made to ensure that people do not have to hurt themselves from the excruciating heat. Not a highlight of Delhi trip, but pay a visit if you get a chance."

Lotus_Temple,Michaela B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Couples,"Good information centre, beautiful space. Too busy to appreciate its tranquility ","The visitor information centre is excellent and informative and the gardens and Temple are beautiful. Sadly, the inherent serenity of the place is lost as it is overwhelmed by the queues of tourists milling about.Approaching the Temple itself, you are asked to remove shoes into a bag they provide. Then you queue to enter the Temple for a few minutes of silent contemplation. Then move out of another door. There is not much more to see from inside. Just appreciate the gardens and the Temple from a distance!"

Shaped in the form of a spectacular lotus with white petals, it makes for a break-taking sight and attracts countless visitors throughout the year. Unlike most other places of worship, this temple or Bahai House of Worship does not allow ritualistic ceremonies and has no fixed pattern to conduct worship. A glorious symbol of oneness, this place of worship must be on your itinerary when planning a trip and booking your hotels in Delhi.The Lotus Temple is a Bahai House of Worship, also known as Mashriqu’l-Adhkár, opened to the public in December 1986.

Lotus_Temple,Rob Nesbit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,might as well have a look,"The Lotus Temple is a Baháʼí House of Worship. Notable for its flower like shape, IE...that would be the Lotus shape... it has become a prominent attraction in the city.Went on a Thursday., and even on a day like that the crowds were still around.......mass amounts of people paying respect or just having a gander like myself.But having said that the crowds were on the move all the time, and it was well spaced out and had a one way system in place, so there was really no wait along the route to the temple, and the wait to get inside was very short.Inside was nothing special, very plain, but from the outside the temple does look pretty impressive, and YES it does look like a Lotus flower.Entry is free, and one has to take off their shoes before they approach the temple..........can leave the shoes in a bag to be collected when finished....A desperately hot day, but was interesting enough to see......I guess.....not much else to see in this city so might as well have a look here..."

Lotus_Temple,Sharad_Ind,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Architectural marvel but visit not worth if you have to wait in long queue,"The weather was hot and my visit experience was made worse due to weekend. There was a long queue of people waiting to enter the premises. The structure looks stunning with lush gardens surrounding it. There is no entry fee but you cannot take eatables inside. Water bottles are allowed. You are allowed only to take a round of the building from outside as the gates are locked for public entry. May be this was due to the huge crowd gathered.The only place where you can have some relief from the scorching sun is the little shade outside the closed building gate. There are no benches to sit. You may sit on floor though before making all the way back to outside.Avoid in summer especially if you are travelling with family. If you are still too keen, just look it from distance and that will be good enough.There is no decent option outside for a quick meal. The snacks being served outside by the street vendors looks unhygienic and unhealthy in such weather. Paid parking is available."

Lotus_Temple,Vivek,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Family,Rude security staff.  Don't visit,"Place is good but security staff is very rude. Food is not allowed inside. Visitors will come to know that food is not allowed only at temple entrance gate so it's disappointing.  Security staff throw food in dustbin . Also the way security staff tells visitors that food is not allowed inside is very disappointing and rude. Seen visitors arguing with staff because of security staff rude behaviour. Women security personnel is very rude. If some visitor is short tempered, then visitor person will definitely argue with security staff because security staff is very rude. Security staff can tell and guide people in more polite manner. 1 star for rudeness of security staff and I will never visit again. If someone wants to lose their self esteem, then they can come as security staff will make you realise that you are just nothing for them."

Lotus_Temple,Skeney57,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Bahai Beauty,Stunning white marble temple and the effect with the setting sun was pretty special ! Pity the air quality was bad though .A constant movement of worshipers & tourists and the place was packed ! Well worth the look with lovely gardens surrounding the temple & the markets across the road were also interesting.

Lotus_Temple,annehA4231CL,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,stunning architecture,My son had been here before and recommended to us. This time he had his two year old daughter. The design is reminiscent of the Sydney opera house and the pools around it are so delightful. A very calming and spiritual place. We arrived early in the morning and access in was easy though it got much busier as we were leaving. It is free to get in. The temple is very striking. It was difficult managing a two year old so would not stay long but a pleasant walk through the grounds.
Lotus_Temple,naveen siromoni,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A true spiritual experience,I have visited this place way too many times as its in my city and close to where I live. I have actually seen this being built when I was in college.Location: closest metro station is the mandir stop just after nehru place. The bus terminus is Nehru Place. Its a 5min walk from bothFacilities: Its very basic minimum with no shops  yes they have clean restroomsAmbiance: Set in a huge garden that is best viewed in spring. The construction is just brilliant. Its a lotus shape but more modern in its shape. The white marble is not heavy to look at but gives it its elegance.What to do there: Enter and just find a spot on the floor with carpets and sit and listen to your self. Its magical as it works its way into you. Just free your mind and the rest will follow. Its an amalgamation of all of the religions so there is no one focus except peace. its a must visit but I just hope at that time there are no bus loads of school children as that some times is a bit distracting

Lotus_Temple,Russell,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Very Interesting and Very Busy.,"My wife and I visited the Lotus Temple as part of a Golden Triangle tour with the TripaDeal group in February. We visited on a Sunday in the afternoon and it was extremely busy......so much so, the queues were too long for us wait and enter. So our visit was purely a long look from a distance!Similar to the Sydney Opera House, it is hard to imagine this architecture in India. But it is very beautiful and well worth a visit. The gardens were quite nice as well."

Lotus_Temple,Youri van den Hurk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Interesting and atypical temple,"If you’re interested in visiting an atypical and beautiful temple in the middle of busy New Delhi, the Lotus Temple is the perfect solution.When I first visited I had no idea what religion was behind the temple but when I informed myself I was actually really interested. The Baháʼí Faith is a religion teaching the essential worth of all religions. Which means they created this temple for all people to come together and have a peaceful moment. Inside the temple you are allowed to meditate and have a moment for you self but you can’t perform any rituals related to your own religion.The atmosphere is minimalistic and clean and although it might be crowded it is a really peaceful experience and a beautiful piece of architecture."
Lotus_Temple,Richard B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,A beautiful temple and a beautiful faith,The Baha’i faith is a beautiful harmonious world view that espouses peace and love and equality.

Lotus_Temple,Lisa W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A modern marvel!,"Any building that is designed in the shape of a lotus flower has got to be visited, hasn't it? The answer for me is yes, but while the North celebrates many ancient mughal masterpieces, this is a little surprising. Constructed primarily of concrete and clad in Grecian marble, open to all religions, modern and contemporary in design, solar panelled and the winner of many architectural awards, it feels a little random against such ancient jewels.There are no altars or pulpits inside the Lotus Temple, the interiors are devoid of any statues, pictures, or images as well. An eye-catching feature of the temple is the nine pools of water located around the petals. I expect it probably looks spectacular lit up at night."
Lotus_Temple,Pooja,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Excellent ,"It's truly a very beautiful  form of architecture  it's like a small heaven... There so calm n silence  there in temple.....
