Which is a small refugee colony for Tibetians in Delhi. Inhabited for a few decades now it is home to these people. Tibetians are the most peace loving people in the world. The place exudes a charm of its own with lots of restaurants serving tasty Tibetian food even Korean food. Shops fulk of artefacts, Tibetian jewellery, food ingredients for Tibetian cuisine are plenty here.  Mostly visitors are college teens and shops selling garments and shoes to their taste are here.Overall it was a lovely experience and to top it all food was great.God bless Tibet."
Majnu_Ka_Tilla,charlessthomson,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Little piece of traditional Tibetan heaven,This is probably the most under rated tourist destination in Delhi.  Over the years the Indian Tibetan community has learnt to become very innovative and this colony has become a cluster of amazing fusion restaurants from Asia but mainly Tibetan.  You can easily spend the whole day here.  Lots of varieties of shop and three buddhist temples too. Given its proximity to Delhi universities lots of students visit here and there is a thriving cafe culture.  Not sure what to eat then I recommend finding either a Tibetan or Bhutanese or Nepali thali.  In the summer another great thing too is because all the building are three storey with narrow pathways you can avoid the sun for most of the day too.  Definitely a unique and wonderful destination.
Majnu_Ka_Tilla,Ms.sumi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,For the love of Thukpa and trinketsüòÄ,"Get down from Vidhan sabha metro station pronto and get moving. Autorickshaw ""bhaiyajis""will be standing just at the exit gate waiting for you üòÅ,get along one auto it just takes 10Rs to take you to your destination. There is this flyover bridge you need to cross that before you get one step  closer to your mini Tibet. Yes go on an empty stomach and slurp your way away with a large bowl of chicken, pork and buff Thukpa(i personally love Lhasa restaurant, it's not fancy at all so for person who prefers comfort can hit lhasa restaurant).Get amazing trinkets at amazingly cheap price, come across maroon clad robe monks in cool sneakers, the famous Lhaping just 10cm away as soon as you enter the market, get your hands on hot steamed tingmo, visit Buddhist temple, fashionable clothes on every showroom corner...list goes onP.S(not I love you üòÅjust to remind you to try the Rabbit toffee believe me you can even eat the wrapper it's surprisingly tasty)"

Struggling to retain its identity. ,"Manju ka Tilla , a small settlement for Tibetans is a very popular place to buy Tibetan handicrafts and eat simple and sumptuous meal. Over the years it‚Äôs become very very popular with college students and foreigners who visit the place to buy Tibetan handcrafts etc Like many other places , it‚Äôs slowly becoming too modern and is beginning to lose its Old world charm. It‚Äôs a welcome change to see some new coffee shops offering juices and good coffee. But one hopes that common sense would prevail and MT as it‚Äôs called would retain its charm. But it‚Äôs certainly worth a visit. Easily accessible by metro and then a shared e rickshaw. "

Majnu_Ka_Tilla,John B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,A bit of Tibet in Delhi,"This may not be to everyone's taste as a place to stay, although you'll find great deals on hotels and restaurants, but it's a fascinating place to visit. Majnu ka Tilla (officially called New Aruna Nagar Colony, Chungtown, and Samyeling) is home to the Tibetan community in New Delhi, not too far from the Red Fort. There are shops, stores, restaurants and temples in what is essentially a small town of about 2,500 people.Sure, the nearby park is a bit messy and the Yamuna River is in need of cleaning up, but even so, it's worth a visit to get away from the bustle of Delhi and do a little meditation, visit the Sakya College, pick up some thangkas, and enjoy a treat and some coffee at Ama Cafe."

People here were really friendly, so  much so it's sparked an interest for me in all things Tibetan "
Majnu_Ka_Tilla,Krittika M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A Hidden Gem,"Another detailed review coming up!As a resident of Delhi, I have travelled to Majnu ka Tila several times and wanted to add a review of the place as a local. Aruna Colony, popularly known as Majnu ka Tila is a refugee colony for Tibetans in exile. As you would wander along in the colony, you would come across several portraits of the Holy Dalai Lama and merchandise with the quotes Free Tibet. That is because this colony was started as a camp for people who fled Tibet during the 1960's.The primarily attractions of the area is it's main square, i.e. Gumpa Square and the restaurants that serve authentic Tibetan, Nepali and Korean food. From an architectural point of view, the most interesting place is the Gumpa square which has two monasteries and two temples. This is the primary gathering point for locals and as you walk through the square, you would often come across the elderly sitting and talking and children playing around. While in the square, please don't forget to eat 'LA-PHING'. It's a tibetan snack made out of flour, tofu, garlic and spices and is quite delicious. It is served by locals sitting outside the monastery and is a definite recommendation to anyone visiting MKT.While moving around in the colony, there isn't much to see. Most of the colony has small, cramped houses built one over each other. Every few houses you come across stores selling stationary, clothes, boots etc., but a lot of stuff is imported from Nepal and isn't overtly cheap too. There are also several shops that sell day to day snacks etc, which are worth a visit if you know the culture.Definitely visit this place if you're looking to try something new for your next weekend plans. Would recommend to travelers looking to eat authentic tibetan food, but might not be worth all the extra travel, especially if you're staying in South Delhi.Places to See : Gumpa Square, Tibetan MarketThings to Do: Shopping, Eating"

You can also find mainstream cafes here. Local delhi people look like tourist here.Lafing, a tibetan snack is a must try and the stalls are unmissable in the main square.Cafes to try are ama cafe, yamuna cafe, kham cafe.For korean cuisine go to kori's.

The moment you enter Majnu ka Tila you'll find Gurudwara which is a holy place for the sikhs. Moving further into the Tibetan colony you'll come across Tibetan monasteries. This place is located in Delhi but is subtly different from Delhi. Not only an calming experience but this place also has no dearth of food and shopping options. You'll find places like Tee Dee, AMA Restaurant, Dolma House, etc. serving authentic Tibetan food in the comfort of Delhi.

Having been in Delhi for about 30 years I did not get a chance to see this miniature Tibet right inside the city, though I have been to Tibetan Monatstries all over the country including Leh, Sikkam and Arunachal Pradesh.My work took me to Majnu ka Tilla Tibetan settlement. What I discovered in the process is an amazing world. They have , not one, two Tibetan Temples, one for the Gelug sect and the other for Nyimga sect. They have Settlement Office, dealing with issues of the settlers, they have beautiful market in serpentine lane, beautiful eateries, a Primary school and lots and lots of Tibetan things, including a hospital and medical shop. You find pictures of Dalai Lama everywhere. There are Tibetans living there who came from Tibet way back in 1959 and the Tibetans who have never been to Tibet but want to be there. Altogether a good experience. Those who love things Tibetans, food and other things will find it a rewarding experience."

Majnu_Ka_Tilla,Derek E,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Peace and quiet at Delhi Tibetan Colony,"I can't imagine that the Tibetan Colony in Nth Delhi has changed much in the past year. My stay there was for 2 nights at the Wongdhen House hotel where they served delicious momo, the well known food from Tibet. At the very reasonably priced hotel I had a large terrace with a superb view of the Jamuna river meandering by. I might add here that I think it would be extremely unlucky not to find a room if you just arrive on the off chance.But the best part of it was the peace that even the market did not disturb, where haggling is not necessary in order to buy something, so different from almost every other market in the sub-continent. So to sum up, even though getting to the colony can be a little stressful, it is a perfect place to chill out and recover from the excesses of traveling around India, and experience the peaceful Tibetan culture."

This place is so surrounded by mixed reviews that I finally decided to  go there and experience it once. So curiosity led me there. I wanted to see Tibetan way of life , people, some glimpses of its culture. Believe me , I was not disappointed. This place is next to the Sikh Gurudwara and it has a Buddhist temple inside. Perfect example of religious tolerance. But entry gate is a real deterrent !  There was filth strewn around and foul smell emanating from it. But,  once inside, there is another world. Well kept shops, cafes and restaurants defy the logic that why the merchant community does not  unite and do something to get the authorities keep hygienic environment ! We dined at The Himalaya Restaurant. Delicious food, Nice interiors, courtious staff and a big screen to watch the sports events ,coupled with pocket friendly menu with so much variety . What else can you ask for to have good time? Then outside, I bought a pair of stylish Canvas shoes for myself which was a real bargain. I really had a great time with my Son equally impressed by the place. He is young is. In his 20 birth year and I think it is an affordable and happening place with a little dose of history for young people to spend some time and have fun."

There  are Buddhist temple as well as a gurudwara situated in Majnu ka tila showcasing the religious tolerance of India which otherwise remains oblivion to Indian news channels . Anyway, the food choices are mind boggling over here so I settled for traditional ones like momos. It‚Äôs a good place to spendfew hours if you are new to Delhi and want to explore Buddhist and Tibetian culture ."

Majnu_Ka_Tilla,Shivani Rastogi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"mini tibet in delhi - shop, hop, eat, repeat!!!","A walk on the Buddhist side of life: Delhi‚Äôs Mini TibetPicture this: winding alleys, cool breeze blowing in your face, faint echoes of Dalai Lama‚Äôs preaching, graceful Tibetan ladies in their traditional attire selling momos in the courtyard, vibrant colours, unusual smells, the serene soft music made by the prayer bells. A smaller, condensed version of Dharamsala‚Ä¶while it may be a world not many will relate to, it does not fail to enchant!Delhi is a goldmine for history buffs, and I love it when some of our favourite spots come with a quaint bit of history attached to them. Majnu Ka Tila, also known as Delhi‚Äôs mini-Tibet, is one such place. It opens up to you a small world so splendid and exquisite that you just don‚Äôt want to leave. HistoryIf lores are to be believed, this North Delhi area is named after a Sufi mystic, a ferryman who rowed people across the Yamuna as a service to god. He became so wrapped up in spiritual musings that people began to call him Majnu, after the legendary lover driven to near insanity. The locality is also set atop a hillock, thus the tila in the name makes sense as well. Majnu Ka Tila also has a Gurudwara, which is one of the oldest extant Sikh shrines in the city and was named after him. Around 1960, after the Tibetan uprising, refugees set up camp in this area and since then it has become the go-to place for all things Tibetan. Along with the Gurudwara, there is also a Buddhist monastery in the bylanes and the general vibe is one of tranquillity.The EntranceSo off we went, one sunny afternoon, to peruse the mysteries of Majnu ka Tilla, which turns out to be a stone‚Äôs throw from Delhi University‚Äôs North Campus and is easily reached by the Delhi Metro. A Buddhist-style gate stands amid grey, three-storey structures, packed close together. Tall buildings on either side make the narrow alley so dark it‚Äôs as if the sun never makes it here. I feel we‚Äôve stepped into a different world, far removed from the urban chaos of Delhi. Shops on either side sell only exotic Tibetan jewellery, Buddhist artefacts and crockery. Ahead, the alley opens into a bright courtyard facing the monastery.As we walk towards the monastery, the alleys open out to a little space in front of a red and yellow building with decorated pillars and flags flying atop it. It also has the dharmachakra between two deers. This building is the office of the cultural centre and the monastery stands to its left ‚Äì a structure similarly designed with the same symbols, albeit taller. Like a little town square, the open space in front of the monastery and the cultual centre is filled with people. There are snack counters, vegetable vendors mingling with people who have come to offer prayers at the monastery or simply sitting around.What struck me when we reached the colony was that there were  vibrant prayer flags hanging from every nook and corner of these narrow by-lanes, seemingly inviting us on a mystical journey. Each flag has a different texture and its own story. Five elements of nature ‚Äì land, water, air, fire and sky merge in these flags. Powered by sacred mantras, they purify the air wherever they are hung as the wind spreads the positive energies in the atmosphere.The Foodie TrailWe decided to sample local Tibetan food and try a delicious snack locally known as ‚ÄòLaphing‚Äô which the locals almost pronounced as ‚Äòlaughing‚Äô. Laphing is originally a Northern Chinese cuisine known as Liangfen, which literally translates to cold noodle. This dish travelled to Nepal with Tibetan and Chinese people who later settled in Boudha.It is basically, potato starch and mung bean combined together to form dry gelatinous  pan cakes, which are rolled and cut into bite-size pieces, and are enclosed with minced soya bean and garlic vinegar, soya sauce, sesame oil and red chilli sauce creates a spectacular cold snack. Laphing can be consumed dry or with cold soup. We tried the dried version as a starter and then ordered for Laphing soup. It is potato starch and mung-bean-jelly noodles, (just like the dry version, just cut in shape of flat noodles) heaped w/chillies, chilli oil, soy sauce, scallions & mouth-tingling Sichuan peppercorns. It's an interesting, delightful dish--spicy, cold & slippery. Watch out for the heat from the chillies, it‚Äôs strong yet addictive. Total cost Rs. 110.Coming to Majnu ka tila and not eating momos would be a sin, so we headed to Tee Dee, which is at a few minutes distance from the Laphing Counter. Tee Dee at Majnu Ka Tila is an authentic Tibetan affair. Although Tee Dee is a small place, it definitely stands out for its authentic home cooked food. The restaurant serves Tibetan and Chinese food. The place can comfortably accommodate over 40 people and has a bright and sunny feel to it. It is done up in a traditional Buddhist manner with loads of laughing Buddhas and dragons. Though their menu comprised of a variety of Chinese and Tibetan offerings, but we settled for a portion of their steamed Chicken momos as well as Mutton momos. And to wash it all down, their famous Apple Beer was the preference. The flour coating of the momos was just apt, not too thick to obstruct the flavour. The chicken and lamb mince was soft and juicy and packed full of flavour. I would have liked a little more filling to make them the best momos. The Apple Beer, was non-alcoholic and different from the usual fruit beer, it was the perfect accompaniment to all the piping hot delicious dimsums. Total cost was just Rs. 300.We loved exploring the bylanes and doing some shopping here and there. After browsing for a while and promising to be back again for more shopping, we headed to our next destination, which was located at the end of the lane, the famous Ama Restaurant. Located few minutes of walk away from Rigo Restaurant, the Ama Restaurant is another popular Himalayan Cuisine restaurant in the area. The place is well-known for its authentic Tibetan cuisine. The food here tastes exactly like home cooked food. Give Ama a try once. You will not be disappointed. Here we ordered Lemon Chicken (soft), Chicken in Butter Chilly Garlic Sauce and to polish them off we had their Egg Fried Rice along with Tingmo. The Lemon Chicken was just nothing like I have had before. Tender morsel of chicken tossed in a very thick lemon sauce, topped with bell peppers, green beans etc. the lemon sauce had a very pronounced citric taste of lemon and this tinge was a welcoming surprise for our palate. Chicken in butter chilly garlic sauce was another hit, the chicken was juicy and soft and the white cream base butter gravy flavoured with ample garlic to which diced bell peppers were added, was just finger licking good. The egg fried rice were delicious as well. Tingmo is a steamed fermented bread, unlike all other breads I‚Äôve tried before. But it was love at the first bite! It has a unique taste of its own, and went perfectly with the two dishes. Total damage for such delectable food was merely Rs. 550.Though we were almost full by then, but we wanted to venture more and try Korean cuisine and so we headed to this beautifully done up caf√©/restro called Kori‚Äôs. Little did we know that going to this place would turn out be the worst decision ever. So for the Korean part of it we ordered their Bulgogi Bibimbap, and to keep things balanced we ordered their Chocolate Pancakes along with Ice Caf√© Latte. The Ice Caf√© Latte was more like warm, diluted hot chocolate gone bad, it was just average. The pancakes were a total shocker, rectangle shaped extremely undercooked something, (as they certainly were not pancakes, either by looks, ingredients or taste) served with two tiny cups filled with chocolate sauce and nutella each were apparently their chocolate pancakes. We had high hopes from their Bulgogi Bibimbap. The word literally means ‚Äúmixed rice‚Äù. It is served as a bowl of warm Korean sticky rice topped with namul (saut√©ed and seasoned vegetables, which unfortunately in this case was just shredded cabbage) and gochujang (chilli pepper paste), soy sauce, again here the soy was missing and the chilli paste was very less in quantity. A fried egg and sliced bulgogi (beef/buff) are added on top. The egg and the buff slices were very dry and chewy. The entire experience was horrendous and we left everything. I do not recommend this place at all. The total cost for this pathetic experience came down to Rs. 500.Though we were stuffed by now, but just because we had a very foul taste teasing our palate, we decided to head to one last stop for the day, The Coffee House, which is located in the basement of Kham Gangdrug Complex. It‚Äôs a cute little caf√© with a vibrant funky feel to it. we tried their famous Mud Cake. A warm huge square of a piece of this deliciousness was the perfect choice. The chocolate cake was very light, airy and had a crumbly texture. The delicious cake was topped with a shiny delectable chocolate ganache. It was just pure bliss. The only thing, I would have obviously liked more ganache as compare to the volume of the cake. Price was this goodness, Rs. 75.The veritable ‚ÄòMini Tibet‚Äô is indeed what it claims to be: a small sample of Tibet. It showcases a convincing replica of authentic Tibetan food, culture and tradition."

We spent about 7 nights in total here through December and January . There are wonderful western cafes and restaurants, wholesale jewellers, traditional vendors, etc. Everything you want can be found here!The hotels are often overbooked - so arriving late night mean forfeiting a room. Be careful! The streets are super windy and there is so much to take in. I was able to bring back some lovely Buddhist practice items as well as more traditional gifts such as yak wool shawls (for men and women!).  "

Majnu_Ka_Tilla,Srishti J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016,Little Tibet tucked away in Delhi,"I recently went to Majnu ka Teela in North Delhi. It is primarily a Tibet refugee camp, where people's first language is still Tibetan. You can see monks pass by, and the monastery. So if you want to taste authentic north- eastern food, this is the place for you. We went to Rigo's for tibetan food.It was pretty amazing. We also tried the street food. So if you visit this place eating ""Laffing"" is a must. The place also has cafes serving Naga cuisine. You can also buy spices that are used in north-eastern cuisine here. Other than that, you have variety of gift shops that sell amazing tibetan knick-knacks- including clothing and decor. And everything here is very easy on the pocket.So to sum up, if you are visiting Delhi and want to experience something entirely different than the Delhi you know, then this is the place for you.P.S- please do not order your regular chinese food at the restaurants here. Try something new, it will definitely do you good!"

Also, here you can find many small-n-big shops of garments, artificial jewellery and Buddhist statues to place in your homes. Though, you might have to ask the place as it is in the by lanes of Ring Road near ISBT (Kashmere Gate). The place looks like mini-Tibet with the crowd of it, but trust me it's Indian from soul."

Majnu_Ka_Tilla,Ruby S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"The Little Tibet of Delhi, a bit expensive though.","Majnu ka tilla is an appropriate place for shopping and indulging in authentic Tibetan cuisines. As soon as you enter the main lane and walk for a while you will reach a courtyard which has a temple. The temple has quintessential Tibetan look and feel, it reminded me of my visit to the Dalai Lama temple in Mcleodganj. If you are lucky you might get to see them performing their prayer rituals as well.Majnu ka tilla is a great place to shop unique items and junk jewellery. They have road side shops as well as proper stores where you can purchase typical Tibetan stuff for your home.Though it a street market but it is not inexpensive. The uniqueness of items comes with pretty good prices. Highlights for me were prayer wheels, dream catchers, prayer flags, masks, idols of Tibetan deities and solid perfumes. They had some unique shoe collection as well. Majnu ka Tilla houses many restaurants which serve authentic Tibetan food which mainly includes dimsums and thukpa. We ate at the Asian Kitchen and it was an okay experience. Later we got to know that Rigo is great place to eat but it was too late then as we had eaten already. After shopping and eating we decided to head back. It was a different experience and I quite liked it. I might not go back there again unless I have a purpose, but if you haven‚Äôt been there even once then it is worth a visit."
