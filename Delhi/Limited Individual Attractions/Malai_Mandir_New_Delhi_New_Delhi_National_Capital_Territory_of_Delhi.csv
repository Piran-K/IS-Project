Malai_Mandir_New_Delhi,NakulGrover,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Family,"Clean, Peaceful & Divine!","Malai Mandir is one of Delhi's most beautiful temples. As soon as you enter, there is an atmosphere of peace and harmony all over the place. You can buy some flowers and candles from the shops on the left. Ladies can pamper their heads with beautiful gajras that have great fragrance. I am glad that I have attended one of the ceremonies here where Lord Kartik is bathed and redressed in the morning. Half of Malai Mandir is placed on top of a hill from where you can enjoy the handsome view of the adjoining areas like Vasant Vihar. Sometimes there's a peacock to make your experience at Malai Mandir even more enchanting. You can spend some time doing the Navgraham Puja by taking nine rounds of the Navgraham centre on the ground floor. Also, you should visit it on festivals like Ganesh Chathurthi, Diwali and Kartik Puranima. It's so colorful and lit with beautiful lights. Muraga, Muraga, Muraga!"
