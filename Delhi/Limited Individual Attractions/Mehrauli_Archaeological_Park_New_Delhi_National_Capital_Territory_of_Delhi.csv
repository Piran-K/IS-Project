Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Madhulika L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,History in a wilderness,"This vast green space in Mehrauli, very close to the Qutb Minar (which you can see from the park) is home to some very interesting and important historical monuments. These include the medieval step-well known as Rajon ki Baoli; several unidentified tombs; an interesting horse stable; the tomb of the Sultanate era ruler, Balban; the mosque and tomb of Jamaali-Kamaali, which dates back to Humayun’s era; and the tomb of Mohammad Quli Khan, refurbished and added to by Thomas Metcalfe to create a holiday home. There are other historical structures, from lone walls to domed pavilions (Metcalfe’s ‘follies’) and a boathouse that was originally a dovecote. Recent changes mean that there are now several manicured lawns, hedges, benches and even a couple of outdoor gyms added alongside some of the paths around Jamaali-Kamaali and Quli Khan’s Tomb. The area leading from there to Rajon ki Baoli, however, is more wild, with relatively untouched trees and dirt paths. No entry fee is charged. The park is open between sunrise and sunset."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Wanderlust Family,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Friends,So rich in history & beauty,"Rich in history, the architecture is so detailed & beautiful the craftsmanship is unbelievable: One of my absolute favourite places to visit. Went fair beyond any of my expectations. A must visit."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Noyo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Beautiful monuments being lost to time,"This park is super rich with history, best if you go with a knowledgeable guide who can add context. I would advise to go in a group of 3-4 people if you're not a Delhi local. Women should not go here alone, especially near sunset or sunrise, as some unsavoury people may roam around nearby. Do dress conservative.Entry is free. One of the park exits leads to a road that reads to the Bhool Bhulaiya (not really a maze, just a big multi arched rounded tomb type structure worth visiting). You can find it on Google Maps, it's a few minutes away on foot. The ASI or some trust badly needs to conduct maintenance here."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,ashrafi85,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Off the beaten track...deserted park filled with crumbling ruins of days gone by.  Not recommended to visit on your own.,"I had read about the step wells and tombs in Mehrauli archaeological Park and wanted to see it after visiting the Qutub Minar.  It was difficult to locate the place using Google maps as there are no proper sign boards to guide you to this site.  Our driver who had lived in Delhi for 15 years and taken tourists around had never even heard of the place. After circling around the area twice we found it.It's a strangely deserted, overgrown, run down sprawling place with old ruins and tombs scattered all over it. We had to park the car near a garden/park and go further and deeper into the archaeological park on foot.  Luckily our driver was equally curious about this place and escorted us.  Thank God he came along as it certainly didn't seem a safe place for two women to be alone especially as it was late evening and the sun was setting.  Plus there were some unruly youngsters hanging around the tombs and Agrasen ki Baoli who seemed to be using the place to have a drink or two surrepticiously which made us feeel uncomfortable and unsafe. The Rajon ki Baolli, a step well was worth seeing as was Jamali Kamali an old mosque in red sandstone where the sufi saint cum poet Jamali is buried.  There is a large courtyard and although the prayer hall of the mosque was closed the arches leading to it were beautifully inscribed with Urdu calligraphy.I wouldn't recommend this as a must see place.  It is in a semi jungle like area with pathways leading to the different structures.  The sign boards are not very easy to follow and basically the place has not been maintained.  Not many tourists come here.  So I would advise ladies not to venture here alone. Better to go in a large group."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Historically rich but badly maintained,"Every few years the archaeological park gets a face lift but poor maintenance and general apathy makes the place dirty and buildings crumble. The most important monument in this park is the tomb of Balban and his son. Balban's tomb is the first Islamic arch in India. To the east of Balban's tomb, lies a ruined rectangular structure said to be the grave of Khan Shahid, Balban's son, whose original name was Muhammad, who died fighting against the Mongols near Multan in 1285."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Brun066,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Wide difference between the beauty of the monuments and the way in which they are kept and presented,"After visiting the Qutb Minar area, we hired a motorickshaw to reach the nearby Mehrauli Archaeological Park.We immediately understood that this is the only way to get an idea of ​​the park, as it is very large, their monuments or ruins are scattered over a large surface, and also it's rather lonely; therefore it doesn't appear particularly safe.But even by motorickshaw, our visit was not very fruitful.First of all, the driver led us to only two (probably the most important) monuments of the area, claiming that the others could not be visited. But even these two monuments didn't give us much satisfaction.The Jamali Kamali Mosque was in fact closed, therefore we had to limit our visit to a look at the exterior, including the arcade with beautiful decorations.Rajon Ki Baoli (ie the stepwell) was also closed; but in this case, being the closure constituted by a fence, you can admire its splendid features.But even in this case, the monument had a neglected aspect: in particular the body of water at the bottom was littered with floating plastic bottles. This despite the fact that at the (closed) gate there were two keepers (in addition to two policemen), who evidently did'nt believe it was their duty to collect the strewn bottles.But there has been even worse. Having manifested to our driver the amazement for this so deplorable state of the monument, he replied (textually): ""if you pay me, I will clean it immediately"".It is clear why I cannot give this attraction a high rate."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Jane800,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Disappointing,"Dirty, covered in litter. Lacking proper signage and information. Buildings rather neglected. Not easy to find."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Payal G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Treasure hidden in plain sight,"This is a gem of a historical site hidden in plain sight in Delhi in close vicinity of the Qutab Minar. A short walk from the Qutab Minar metro station (walk rather than pay ₹50 that the auto drivers charge new visitors). Main entry is bang opposite Adam Khan's tomb. This site has been used by the different Empires of Delhi and has tombs, step-wells, mosques, pleasure palaces, stables, rose gardens and offers a superb view of the Qutab Minar. Restoration work is on in several buildings and structures. While it is not yet chargeable, sufficient information has been provided for the explorers. Best a daytime activity of 2-3 hours. Carry water as nothing is available inside. Surprisingly clean toilets were there.One can look up following places on Google before visiting:1. Balban's tomb2. Jamali-Kamali tomb and mosque3. Quli Khan's tomb4. Rajon ki Baoli5. Metcalfe's folly6. Metcalfe bridge7. Horse stables8. Various Mughal era tombs and boat house."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,vipin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A must visit place in Delhi,"I came to know about this place through lonely planet India magazine. To reach there i followed google map and reached somewhere close to it but unable to locate it. Finally i found it with the help of a helpful local person. The final few hundred meters indicated by Google Map is to be covered on foot not even by two wheeler. So the best way is to go up to Ahinsa Stal and the entry to the site is just opposite to it, just by the side of Gurgaon- Mehrauli highway. This entry leads to a parking place and accessible by 4 wheelers. Once inside there is so much to see. Mosque, Lawns, Tombs and a step well also. They are all connected by unpaved trail. So wear good footwear. The whole area is tree covered and well shaded from sun. Carry your water bottle."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,One of the best free things to do in Delhi,"The Mehrauli Archaeological Park is an area of archaeological research has is just being renovated by the Archaeological Survey of India. What the organisation have done so far is pretty good and it’s still free to enter. The site has been used by various empires that have ruled from Delhi from prehistory, through the Rajputs and Delhi Sultanates, right up to the British Empire.Even though the site has not been laid out perfectly for tourism, much of the major attractions can already be reached by well paved walkways. Some of the best things to see include the Tomb of Mohammed Quli Khan, the Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb, the Tomb of Khan Shahid, Masjid Sohailwali or just wandering around the well kept gardens and grounds of the park"
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Sounak Poddar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Lost Marvel,"It is hard to find out this site in Mehrauli to Gurgaon road, and that is a shame. Wonderful place to visit. Need Two Hours of time in hand to completely visit this place. Would be better if you find a guide or someone truely knows the history behind it."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Sunita S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A hidden gem in the city,It is a marvel how this 100 acre heritage site is invisible on the Mehrauli Gurgaon road.  You would need a historian to guide you through the different periods in our history.  Perfect for a two hour ramble on a wintry day.  We took the Delhi Heritage Walk guide..
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Sunil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Lost Gem,The place has it's own history and its next opposite to great quitb minar but hardly few will recognize and thosnpalce can be well maintained by Delhi 
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,VikAni0816,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Nice place but no maintenance,It is a nice place but totally neglected by the authorities. It is just opposite to Qutab Minar Metro Station and very close to Qutab Minar Complex. You can consider the height of negligence when you do not find even a board to help visitors identify the place.Very secluded place with shoddy people around and some people doing drugs within monument premises.

Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,shreya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,The Hidden gem,"Many may not have heard about this hidden gem of Delhi which is very nearby to the Qutab Minar. Its like a hidden gem for photographers, history & nature lovers. A must visit if u are visiting or planning to  Qutab Minar."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Mila Rostova,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,One of the best places in Delhi,My favourite place in Delhi. Gives amazing view on Qutub Minar as well. I wish it was taken the better care about though because the old monuments seem quite unprotected. And also Balban's tomb was separated from the main park with the wall and the gates kept closed though no lock. Doesn't save it at all from the locals but for sure keeps it away from the visitors who would enjoy this jewel of the Delhi's architecture belonging to pre-mughal times with owning the first arch in the history of Indian architecture. 
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Digamber Rathore,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,A hidden treasure of Delhi,Best place for long walks and for treasure hunt for photographers. Sunset time is suggested for visit with a view on Qutub Minar.
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Being Dilliwaala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Abode of history,"Spanning almost a millenium, this region has seen it all. From the times of tomars to chauhan to sultanate to mughals to british and now independent India. A hidden Gem."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Jovial Holiday,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Hidden Historical Place of Delhi,"Archaeological Park is a natural place where you can find the largest collection of religious monuments, for example, Rajon Ki Baoli, Jamali Kamali Mosque, Tomb of Balban, Tomb of Quli Khan and etc. Mehrauli Archaeological Park' nearest metro station is Qutub Minar."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Dr. Richa Malhotra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Business, Heritage Walk through Delhi Sultanate Sites ,"One full day devotee to explore this huge spread of roughly two hundred acres and hundred sites. We went there on a cloudy day with occasional drizzle. Beautiful place best to visit in winters. Wear comfortable light shoes and walk but better would be cycle heritage trail.  Monument of Slave,Khaljis,Tughluqs, Lodhi dynasty, Mughal empire and British rule. My favourite being Rahon ki Bawali, Jamali Kamali and Zafar mahal. Specimen of evolution of the fusion of local elements with  Islamic architecture in India,  gets demonstrated here. An amazing place - explorer's delight. I will come here again ..........."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,bmaciel87,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,One of the gems of Delhi,"Spent around 2 hours in the park. As a solo traveller, I always care for my safety and was not disappointed. There's a guard in every big building. Take some snacks and just chill!"
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,DeppityDawg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,"worth a visit, but don’t take the “shortcut” to Qutub Minar","It’s on the way to Qutub Minar if you walk from Qutub Minar metro station (take the pedestrian overpass upon leaving the station and walk north on the left side of the street). The entrance to the park is signposted, but the guard on duty will probably try to discourage you from entering because he assumes you are looking for the Qutub complex. There are several interesting structures to see. Some of them have information panels. Make sure to walk all the way to the end of the trail and out of the park into Mehrauli village to see the second stepwell (Gandak ki baoli), which is used as a diving pool by local kids. Then double back into the park to see the rest. But if you see a signpost saying “Qutub Minar”, don’t take it! It’s a shortcut that takes you directly into the adjacent Qutub complex, through a closed (but not locked) gate, but the security guys will freak out if you arrive that way. Maybe in the future they will improve the integration of these two sites, but for now it’s best to exit the park onto the main road and continue walking to the Qutub Minar ticket office."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Lisa T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Need better care and signages,"Due to its close proximity to Qutub Minar, we decided to also visit Mehrauli Park. However, our driver did not know the way to the entrances and the locals that we stopped to ask didnt know either. It took us quite a while to find the entrance. The park sprawled over a vast area but there was no indication how far the attractions are. But the walk was pleasant and the place is less crowded. I do think the stepwell should be visited and several tombs are pretty amazing.Unfortunately some of the ruins are graffitied and in state of disrepair. But still worth a visit."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Eva V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Nice for a quiet walk,We walked around for almost two hours in this beautiful park exploring the archaeological sites and the gardens.

There is litter everywhere and an eerie, creepy sense to the place which has scattered homes in fields belonging to locals who didn't help us out much. "
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Sudipta Shaheen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Nice Place,This is not a very well known place in delhi. But trust me you will not regret. Must visit with your family. Best to visit during winter. You can spend you your whole evening in this place. It is a very well maintained place.
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,mak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Callously maintained....and no conviction to preserve the heritage of mughal emperors. UNESCO should surelying rein in.,"UNESCO should withdraw it's recognitions as the present authorities showing pure apathy towards this as they have biased , narrow and bigotry view for these heritages. Instead of maintaining the 7th year old masterpieces their ego driving them nuts and squandering public taxpayers money on artificial museum. ...UNESCO wakeup and please save these invaluable masterpieces."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Hazel S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Lots to see but poorly maintained ,The rose garden is well kept but unfortunately the tombs and mosques are surrounded by rubbish.  Disappointing.  But the park gives some respite from the noise outside.

Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Nishant,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Donot forget your DSLR/ Pleasurable visit on a Sunny winter day.,"Visited on 27th Jan. It was rather b'ful sunny day here in Delhi. End of January is more of a chilly time. 4 out of 5 for maintenance, construction underway for a public toilet inside the premises. Vast open lawn for a perfect picnic in a group. Leaving out the Kings Baoli water reservoir, everything was perfect to look back into history. Two to three hours would be more than enough to hitchhike this park.DONOT forget to take your DSLRs with you."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Jitendra Bhatnagar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Classic example of how to discourage tourists,"The park presents a picture of apathy and total neglect. A thousand years' magnificent historical monuments are allowed to rot and whither away. Guides are conspicuous by their absence. Due to poor signages, one has to blunder along and feel happy when he locates an interesting monument. The place is not advertised at all. No wonder even most locals have not heard of it.Filth is found even in the two baolis, which stink. Basic facilities like toilets do not exist. This when the country is trying hard to rid of open defecation. Such a site in the western world would have been fiercely marketed and attracted millions of tourists earning billions of dollars.With all its handicaps, THIS ONE OF THE MANY MUST VIST PLACES in National Capital Region.(But for the lack of facilities, I would have given it five stars.)"
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,igolfCA,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Could be very interesting but needs some work,"We had a little free time after visiting the Qutub Minar so decided to give this park a look as it was so close. Upon entering, it was obvious that basically no one was there. Admission was free, so there was no reason not to explore. It appeared to be an archaeological treasure trove.There are lots of ruins and structures of all kinds in various stages of decay. The grounds are not well kept, and there are no facilities that I could see. Some of it was quite interesting with a lot of history, but I was put off by the lack of upkeep in many areas. One thing that I particularly wanted to see was the step well. Oh my, was it nasty! The water at the bottom was filthy and full of trash. That ruined it for me.If the park is cleaned up and made presentable, this could be a wonderful place. Until then, I wouldn't bother"

Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Sarmad Hussain P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Calm and beautiful,It's just behind the Qutub Minar. You can ask the auto wala to drop you at Jamalai Kamali. There are several historical Monuments located at a single place. It will take more than half a day to explore the entire place. The entry is free. The surroundings are clean and well kept.
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Jotannah,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Archaeology and graffiti in one place,Some amazing archaeology and architecture but somewhat spoilt by the cultural vandalism of a society that thinks that throwing rubbish all over the place and graffiti on their monuments is fine. The stepwell is worth a visit as you can walk all around it shame there are loads of plastic bottles in the green water at the bottom. With a small amount of care and attention it could be a really lovely place. As it is if you can see past the dogs pigs graffiti and rubbish then there is a treat in store.
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Kamlesh Sekhon,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Exploring ,"There is a lot of history, not many visitors.It’s right next to Qutub Minar, yet not developed by ASI. Maybe the Aga Khan Trust will next target this, once it’s developed it will be a beautiful heritage walk.Right now, it is more of a lovers walk/haunt."

There's also a British Dovecote and a glorious rose garden. It's right next to Qutab Minar and you can catch the metro to Qutub Minar Station. It's a 500 metre walk. The park is free but has no facilities. Lots of couples and families strolling or picnicking. Great break from the chaos of Delhi. "
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,mouseadventure,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Gem of Delhi,Enjoyed this park immensely. A bit difficult to find but well worth the hunt. We seemed to be the only tourists there. Very interesting being that the Qutb Minar site is right next door. The archeological buildings were beautiful. Highly recommended. 
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Edward T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Out-of-the-way Delhi,"Mehrauli Archaeological Park is adjacent to the well known, and much visited, Qutb Minar. However few persons visit it. This is a pity because the park contains several very interesting sites, in particular the Kamali-Jamali Mosque and the Rajon ki Bain. The latter is a dramatic baoli (step well). One reason the park has few visitors may be that finding the entrance is not easy. The entrance is unmarked. Admission to the park is without cost. Once inside, the paths to the various monuments are well marked. At the Rajon ki Baoli, one of the security guards, who spoke good English, showed me several features which I would not have found on my own. He seemed pleased when I gave him a tip of INR 100."

However they could easily adapt this park to connect the site via a haven of peace. No tourists at all, some interesting ruins and a wonderful baoli (dirty as most of them). There is apparently another one just beside, in Mehrauli village, but we were deterred by children beggars."

Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Marc K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Worth seeing if you're in the area,"I get the scenario - you're researching India to see if the all that money is worth it, all the hassle of visas, where to eat, where to stay. You've seen a nice picture and thought do I visit here. Yes, you do. I had an afternoon to spare so after a short drive I ended up in the Mehrauli Archaeological Park. Here's why it's good value. First off, the pictures don't do it justice, you'll get some amazing pictures for whatever social media outlet you want to brag to all your friends about.Second, it's an intriguing archaeological site, with a fair amount to discover.It's not all great however, it's completely unregulated, health and safety would have a field day in that place - plus it filthy - at the bottom of the steps is a well, literally covered in s**t. I made it 3/4 of the way down before the smell was too much.All in all, pretty good. I spent 15min here before I moved on."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,The Travel Curry,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Neglected relics of history,"Close to the glorious monument, Qutub Minar lies the Mehrauli Archaeological Park, a huge historical space in neglect. Spread over a vast expanse, these beautiful monuments and artifacts barring a few, stare into nothingness, unkempt and not-maintained. The walled city authorities too did not find it worth to protect or care for these. A free entry to the walking trail, rocky under-constructed pathways and dark, dirty, smelly monuments in bad condition are a proof of the same. Its an easy to reach place but not really noticed, because its not highlighted or advertised anywhere. I have stayed close to this place for four years but never came to know abut this hidden gemWe passed two entrances twice but did not realize those were the entry gates. One of the entry gates is 1 km away from Qutub Minar metro station. A narrow kuccha road through wilderness leads to the archaeological park. We chose not to tread on the path since these kind of secluded paths are unsafe, full of criminals and uncertainties.The second entrance gate is near the Qutub Minar roundabout. Google also lead us to Mehrauli Bus terminal. However I am not sure if there is any entrance to the park or not. The part has a parking space. But I still do not have an idea how to dive to the parking because I am unsure of the roads. (I had taken an auto from Qutub Minar metro to the gate near roundabout that costed me Rs.50). Rest there are two step wells (which were closed when I reached), Jamali Kamali mosque and tomb, rose garden, Lodhi era well, Mohd Quli Khan tomb, tomb of Balban and many such tombs/monuments. The entry to monuments closes at 5:45pm. So visit accordingly. Advisable to visit in winters or spring season as the place tends to be very warm and humid."

Lush Green Meadows, with benches to rest is a photographers delight. Adding to the enthusiasm, is walking through the narrow lanes in the forest with baolis and tombs on either side. The park is scarcely crowded as very few are aware of the place. A must visit till it becomes another of those tourist spots."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Amolak Rattan K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Historical Place needs Preservation,As an art lover you can observe plenty of glimpses of old heritage of Indian History . The architecture is worth admiring and is derived from Persian motifs . The Baoris are symbolic of water harvesting and preservation . But the place is neglected and needs preservation by local agencies and organisations who love and appreciate History and Art . The park is a nice place to relax .Amolak Rattan KohliFormer Governor of Mizoram
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,safar1107,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Neglect of history,"The Park is ill marked on road signs and difficult to locate. Approaching Qutub Minar from Gurgaon, the entrance is on left of MG Road just before the Qutub. The Baoris are beautiful, but very badly maintained. The area has some Tughlak period tombs also. The park is maintained somewhat, but the inside roads are not good for cars. Visited around late afternoon and local people advised us to go away while daylight lasted. Disappointed."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Amit Chandra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Perfect picture of India’s architectural prowess. A must-visit!,"Of the numerous architectural prowess that Delhi boasts of, Mehrauli Archeological Park is one of the most exciting. This place is beautiful with plenty of ancient architectures from the times of Mughals. Visit the place to behold the flourishing Persian art, architecture, and rich heritage preserves, which happen to be a gift from the imperials. Besides Qutub Minar, the Mehrauli Archeological Park has plenty of fine architectures which is perfect for a day tour. Raja ki Baoli and Tomb of Lodi make the highlight of this place located just 900 meters from Qutub Minar. Another fine place in Delhi that you must visit."

Entrance to this park is free and one has to cover lot of ground on foot to see the different ASI protected monuments inside this park. This place has many historically significant monuments built during the rule of Khalji dynasty, Tughlaq dynasty, Lodhi dynasty of Delhi Sultanate, Mughal Empire and the British. We found a rose garden at the entrance and beautiful view of giant Qutub Minar in the distance. We walked through many narrow pathways across manicured lawns and across woods(we saw pack of pigs roaming) to visit the beautiful Jamali Kamali Tomb, dilapidated Balban Tomb, Rajon ki Baoli(the stepwell monument), Quli Khan Tomb etc. The morning cold weather was perfect for this walk around and we enjoyed this park visit."

Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Nidhi S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,Discovering Delhi's history by foot,"I started exploring different places in Delhi with a friend by foot couple of years back. We haven't been very regular thanks to our work commitments but fell in love with the idea of exploring Delhi on foot and exchanging our history knowledge and learning much more.Today I discovered a gem, Archeological Park Mehrauli. There is so much to explore in one area. Though it is right on the main road, right opposite Qutub Minar Metro station, but one does not get to know the expanse of the place unless you go. A small gate just off to where the nurseries are will take you in. There are couple of parking areas inside the park. One can easily spend a day around the park looking at various monuments and having a small picnic too as there are few well manicured lawns to check out. The park has the Balban Tomb, Jamali Kamali mosque and Tomb, Rajon ki Baoli, Ruins of Balban. The area is around Qutub Minar, so if you are up for some more walking you can go around and there is Madhi Mosque and Qutub Minar a walking distance of 5-10mins from the park. I would recommend to go with a bit of reading up about the history of Mughals, Tuglaks and Baha'i to make this a rewarding trip. History can be so much fun when explored with friends and family...happy learning and exploring! "
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,ragamala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,A great alternative to some of the better-known Delhi sites.,"Although the Qtb Minar complex is well-established at the top of the Delhi tourism attractions, the nearby Mehrauli Archaeological Park is little-visited but provides a welcome and relaxing alternative. In around 100 hectares of gardens, the Park contains many interesting monuments, including tombs, mosques and step-wells."
Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Shounak Patwardhan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,Wonderland Of Ruins,"The park neighbours the Qutub complex yet there is a stark difference in the amount of people in the two places. Mehrauli can be almost empty depending on the time of the day but there are some interesting monuments and ruins scattered all over the area, notably the Jamali Kamali mosque and Tombs (The security guard at the mosque is friendly and can act as a guide in that area), Tomb of Balban, Quli's Khan's Tomb and the Rajon Ki Baoli. You can easily spend around 4 hours here. If you are short on time, you can skip this part of the city. The park would have been beautiful in its heyday. I wouldn't advise going alone here especially after dark since some areas looked shady to me. Keep food and water with you since there's nothing available in the area. And be ready to hike a bit if you want to really explore the park. Entry is free."

The Baoli is in very good condition and very well maintained. You can walk up and down the floors via narrow winding stairwells - that add to the adventure. At the top and to the right is a small mosque, from the top of which you get a fantastic view of Qutub Minar behind Mehrauli village. If you don’t want to do the long hike from Qutub to the Baoli, you can also access it from the Mehrauli village side (close to the post office, behind Mehrauli Bus Depot). Highly recommended. "

Some of it has nice manicured lawns and flower beds, some of it is scrubby forest. The pathway through is well laid out and surprisingly well signposted. It is scattered with ruins from various periods: tombs, mosques, the remains of a town. The Rajon Ki Baoli is particularly impressive, alongside the cluster of monuments that surround it. A ruins buff could easily spend most of an afternoon exploring. The downside is finding the way in! There is an access from the paying part of the Qutab Minar. I found my way in by going down a small and dusty lane near to Palawan foods in Mehrauli village. While in the park, you might want to watch out for the pigs. There seems to be no refreshments available, so visitors may wish to bring their own water."

Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,gentbrugg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Two in one,"In principle, it is a necropolis like ""city of the dead"" in Cairo because it consists mainly of funerary buildings, such as  mausoleums and memorial mosques. Other similar sites in Delhi are already built out, but this was turned into an archaeological park. And now it looks not so sad, because in many places covered with trees and greenary and partly resembles the real park, the real beautiful park. Here you can walk, but keep in mind – be sure there are the two-legged and four-legged inhabitants in the park, and they will make your outing fun and memorable. But not only they, but also those of the funerary buildings of different eras of the history of Delhi. Now about 20 mosques and mausoleums given in relatively good condition, are able to provide visual interest for tourists. Even without a nearby Qutab-Minar, which of course can be seen almost everywhere. So you get two in one."

The accompanying structure is made of red sandstone and granite and the tombs are side by side in white marble in a room with latticed filigree work.Truly a delightful walk and worth meandering through a slice of history.Take one of the numerous guides around the Qutub to explain the history of the place."

Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,loltraveller2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Amazing ,I  had a bit of trouble finding this place as there were no signs. It is about 1 km from Qutub Minar metro station on the left hand side of Anuvrat Marg. You walk down a laneway and you're there. It is very big and you can't possibly see everything in one day. I found the park to be well maintained with lots of shaded areas where you can sit. The rose garden needs a bit of TLC. I wandered all over the park and the only time I felt slight threatened was when a pig crossed my path. The monuments looked well looked after and the only time I found a heap of rubbish was in an area of squatters which is bordering the park. It is one of Delhi's areas where you can find out about history but also just relax.

From here you need to walk for less than 5 minutes on a dirt road and slight turn right to the entrance of the park and you'll see the first attraction of the park : Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb.  There is only very friendly guard which will help you to take picture and show around the mosque and lead you to a secret place of the mosque with a small fee.From here you may explore the park further to other attractions i.e Rajon Ki Baoli, tomb and mosque.There is no entrance fee and very less tourist come here hence it is not advisable for ladies to explore the park on your own (based on my own experience)."

Mehrauli_Archaeological_Park,Delhigrapher Sawan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,"The Haunt, The Ruins and The Beauty","If you think you have seen all of the Delhi, think again. Mehrauli Archaeological Park lies very close to the Qutub Minar metro station yet is not on every tourist’s map. Even the auto-rickshaw walas are not all completely aware of the place and the first ride took us to Mehrauli bus-stand.  What is even more surprising is that the entire park stretches on to 200 acres and lies adjacent to the Qutub Minar World Heritage site and still is not popular enough. Known more commonly as the tomb of Jamali Kamali, Mehrauli Archaeological Park has much more than that and is a must visit place for the photographers, history enthusiasts and experience seekers. To make things interesting, the most popular of the attractions, The Tomb Of Jamali Kamali, is haunted. Beat That.Consumed by ruins dating as back as the medieval period i.e 11th century A.D to the 19th century, the place contains the ruins of Lal Kot that was built by Tomar Rajputs. Moving a little ahead in time, Mehrauli Archaeological Park is the house of the Tomb Of Balban, Tomb Of Khan Shahid, Rajoi Ki Baoli, Gandhak Ki Baoli, British Agent Sir Thomas Metcalfe’s Guest House and of course the more famous Jamali Kamali. Apart from these ancient relics, Mehrauli Archaeological boasts of vast greenery and few mosques as well.The Mehrauli Archaeological Park has no sign-board naming the place, instead, a rusty vertical signboard with instruction welcomes you. As you dwell into the path and take the first right curve, you will reach the Jamali Kamali and thus your visit begins. Do not give up on the messy, unmaintained surroundings or the human encroachers settling inside the area. Try to look into all directions to have a clue of what tomb or relic to visit next.Mehrauli Archaeological Park might be the only place of historical importance in New Delhi where entry costs you nothing and a worthwhile visit calls for food to be carried along. What came as a surprise was that every monumental structure had at least two security guards at the place. The place requires a long walk that can go on for the entire day. If it is your mission to visit every of the attractions, a tiring day is on the cards.The place befits a photoshoot and carrying a camera along is recommended. Choose a pleasant cool day for a better experience, summer days can ruin your experience."

Mehrauli, next door, is open access and ignored by the tourists and enjoyed by the locals. Some of it is in quite dense under growth. The Delhi smog adds a romantic mist."
