Mughal_Garden,Anandarup,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023,Very overcrowded - not a good experience,"We went on Sunday for the 4pm slot and the place was very very overcrowded. Instead of being able to enjoy and see the flowers, we were jostling with the crowd for most of the time. The concerned authorities should really do some capacity planning and only allow the number of people whom they can manage. Limiting the number of people allowed to enter will also let them enjoy the majestic place in a much better manner. The whole joy was lost in the massive crowd. Very very disappointed with the experience.Few points to note - Cars can be parked in the whole of the North Avenue (we had parked in the Museum parking on the Mother Teresa Crescent and walked from there). Phones are allowed inside. No one checked our ID cards. I feel it will be less crowded during weekdays or during the morning hours (but not sure)"

Mughal_Garden,A Choudhury,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 â€¢ Friends,Wonderful Garden,It is open to the general public only for a short duration in February - March every year. The garden is simply amazing with beautiful flowers and greenery all around. Definitely worth a visit.
Mughal_Garden,skagarwal74,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,Simply Marvellous,"After a month-long effort to book my online ticket, I got successful in getting a slot just before the closeout of Mughal gardens for visitors on (21st Mar) this season. A dream come true..Though I was trying unsuccessfully since a month, I was really happy to get a last minute solo entry ticket for 20th Mar after the slots were booked a week back. The entry is free and no money is charged anywhere.You are asked ID details etc. and ticket is obtained on your mail.I went through Central Secretariat metro station which is about 2.3 Kms from Gate 35 which is the entry gate for Mughal gardens. (North Avenue Police Station for google map to avoid any confusions)Your ticket (Mobile or paper) is scanned and you are allowed inside but you have to leave your belongings behind. There is no spot ticket, only those who got online ticket are allowed. There is no deposit room and even water bottles are to be thrown in the dustbin here. There is yet another security gate where IDs are checked and sanitisers are to be left behind.Now the real attraction after the necessary procedures. After all its the Rashtrapati Bhavan of India and a wonderful & beautiful place..There is a herbal garden and Bonsai plantation at the entry which is just ok. The Main Mughal garden is just after.A real beautiful garden full of colourful flowers, fountains and our Tricolour Fluttering high on the top of the dome of Rashtrapati Bhavan in the background. Simply Marvellous !! Mobile snaps are allowed inside. So its a great time for photography.You will find mineral water with disposable glasses at the exit, also the washrooms. An hour which is the allotted time is sufficient for going through the Mughal gardens."

Mughal_Garden,Janix500,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A must visit place,"As almost everyone writes about the flowers and they are beautiful. I am going to write a few lines on other issues that may help people.1. Reaching- by metro - use Central Secretariat metro station on yellow line and take exit 5. Hire an autorickshaw (bargain but) @ Rs 50 they will be happy to take you there. Will take max 10 minutes to reach. Then walk for about 100 meters- Driving/Taxi - reach for North Avenue police station. Plenty of parking- By Bus - take bus to Central Secretariat. Buses come here from most parts of city directly.2. Facilities - very well equipped. Wash rooms and free drinking water (safe and in disposable glasses) easily available. There are a few places to rest if you want to relax. I could see 3 places of medical assistance. Ambulance also at standby.3. You can carry small bag (but no eatable/drinks), no large cameras etc. Mobiles can be carried and photography largely allowed.4. Do spend time at the herbal and bonsai gardens that get missed by a lot of people. Really as good as flowers.5. Stalls for refreshment available after you exit the garden. Ice creams, snacks, biscuits, soft drinks etc available. A couple of other stalls for memorabilia and other stuff made by workers of Rashtrapati Bhawan.6. For a quicker entry do register online at  Rashtrapati Bhawan website.Enjoy your trip"
Mughal_Garden,rohitagarwal55,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Beautiful Garden,"Mughal Garden is situated inside the Rashtrapati Bhawan (The President of India's house) and remains open for general public from February to March every year for a month (appx.). This is a beautifully maintained garden. You are not allowed to carry even a water bottle inside the garden but you will find enough arrangements for the same. Basically, it consists 5 segments. After entry, your will find herbal plants first, then bonsai garden, then musical fountain, then main mughal garden, then rose garden and at the exit, the final garden. You need minimum 2 hrs. to visit the place fully. The route is designed in such a way that once you will enter, you have to visit all the places. At the exist, they have an arrangement of snacks (paid) where you can have small meals like samosa, kachori, burger, sandwich, chole kulche, ice creams etc. A sovereign shop is also there which accepts payment from cards. You can buy some articles from there. To reach there, you can take an auto from Central Secretariat metro station (if going by metro). It is advised not to visit here on Sunday as you will find a big crowd here. If you have no other choice, try to be there by 10.30 am so that you can enjoy your trip before it becomes much crowded."
Mughal_Garden,Maggie101962,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Disappointing ,","My friend was keen to visit as she had heard good things . The visit was disappointing, the plusâ€™ is its free and thatâ€™s  where it ends. It was overcrowded with strict rules on how to navigate the gardens and yet at the same time a feeling of utter chaos.The flowers and plants were okay however large sections of the gardens were closed off. I would recommend Visiting early to avoid the crowds."
Mughal_Garden,Durgesh K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Excellent Horticulture Display,"We went to Mughal Gardens, situated at Rashtrapati Bhavan (Indiaâ€™s President House) complex, on 16th Feb 2020, Sunday. It was quite hot during the afternoon, but we reached at around 11 am and thanks to GOD we were having online booking so we directly knocked at the entry. Since the entry is free during Udhyanotsav, held every year during Feb-March, almost everybody heads to this place. The management just couldn't handle so many people. Moreover they don't allow you to carry any bag. Even small sling bags were not allowed and were required to be submitted in a cloak room which again had a huge queue.As far as the place is concerned, it is beautiful. Huge number of colorful tulips (reminded me of The Netherlands), roses and other flowers are there so it is very beautiful. Musical Fountain show is just awesome, Herbs garden is just wow.Overall a good experience.Tips:1. Get online booking done and save hours. The booking opens 7 days in advance.2. Avoid visiting on a Sunday (specially in afternoon). It sucks to stand in a queue (not even a proper queue) for hours.3. Mobiles and men's wallets are allowed in the garden, otherwise and except these you can't carry any thing inside. NO NEED TO WORRY: Cloak Room facility is available out side free of cost.4. Don't carry any water bottle there as its freely available.5. No camera allowed.6. Monday closed."
Mughal_Garden,Mansi G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 â€¢ Friends,Good but avoid Sundays,"Tips: 1. Get online booking done and save hours. The booking opens one week prior.2. Never visit on a Sunday afternoon. It sucks to stand in a queue(not even a proper queue) for hours.3. Don't carry a bag, avoid even a small carry bag. Carry only mobile, id and cash. Even a comb will not be allowed.Experience : We went to Mughal Gardens on 16th Feb 2020, Sunday. It was quite hot during the afternoon around 2pm when we reached there and we had to stand in a queue for 1.5 hrs, a queue that extended to quite a big stretch on the main road. Since the entry is free, almost everybody heads to this place. The management just couldn't handle so many ppl. Moreover they don't allow you to carry any bag. Even small sling bags were not allowed and were required to be submitted in a cloak room which again had a huge queue.Overall not a good experience. Even after entering Mughal Gardens, there was so much rush that I felt a stampede could happen anytime. As far as the place is concerned, it is beautiful. Huge number of colorful tulips(reminded me of The Netherlands), roses and other flowers are there so it is very beautiful. But the entrance is very dusty.Advice to management: Stop ppl from entering the place when it becomes unmanageable."
Mughal_Garden,Shubhro Mitra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 â€¢ Couples,Rashtrapati Bhavan gardens ,Mughal Garden was one of the old Delhi gardens that was must see as it was in the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Indiaâ€™s President House) complex and was amazing for Roses way back in the 1970s era. The garden is still nice to once see but was disappointed to see that the quality of Roses not really up to the mark. There were new flowers like Tulips that has now made its appearance and other flowers and with the backdrop of Rashtrapati Bhavan it looks rather nice. Crowds have grown but managed well. Itâ€™s open only for 5 days in a year. This year (2020) itâ€™s open between 6-10th Feb

I visited during weekend, hence there was rush. You need to walk continuously from entrance to exit. No place to sit and relax, except for one or two rest places. Entry is free. Lot of things to eat at the exit gate. "
Mughal_Garden,Cheenu J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 â€¢ Family,Must-visit when it's open...,"Just so-so beautiful and well-laid out. What makes it special is that it's open for only a month between Feb-March and forms part of the Rashtrapati Bhawan complex. Gardeners are working round-the-clock to tend to the plants. We had gone especially for the tulips which had been imported from Netherlands. Alas, they had all been removed just a few days before as they had started wilting!! It was quite disappointing!! The best time to visit these gardens is when they open as all flowers are in full bloom. By March, they are on the road to withering away..Very well-managed complex and good parking also available. I had made an online booking (free) as hardly any queue here."

Mughal_Garden,Manas R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 â€¢ Family,Color splash,"The garden never gets old, even after adding thousands of visitors everyday. You will definitely appreciate the meaning of floral splash here."
Mughal_Garden,keith h,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Solo,Rare Chance to Visit.,"Although I have visited New Delhi on a number of occasions I have never been here when these gardens are open. I saved my visit for my last day here & duly rolled up at gate 35 at the end of North Avenue Road. I had pared the contents of my rucksack down in anticipation of the intense security, enhanced, no doubt by the ongoing Kashmir conflagration.  Having subjected myself to an airport style baggage & personal going over, I left my bag at the cloakrooms & finally penetrated the inner sanctum.  First up was the herb garden, a neat but fairly un inspiring collection set in neat spuares with intersecting paths. The bonsai collection was more interesting, housed in the open on stone shelves. Next came the musical garden, a phalanx of fountains performing to a background of strident music ( bit cheesy ).  However, now came the best of it. First The Mughal Garden, a vast expanse of vivid green grass, water channel's, fountains, paths, topiary trees & brightly coloured flowers set in geometric pattern's. From here one progressed under a stone pillared pergola through a rose garden to what, in my mind, was the finest part of the gardens. A circular garden with a central pond & fountain surrounded by ascending concentric flower beds & grass to a circular perimeter pathway backed by a wall which hosted astoundingly tall dahlias to a height  of 8ft.  All the flowers were of amazing vigour & intense colour      After this, I exited via the public toilet which was a disgrace. Put to shame by any of the free public convenience's around Connaught Circle.  A mass of security at all points, mainly female, I noted."
Mughal_Garden,gauth333,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 â€¢ Couples,Must visit if you are in Delhi during Jan -Feb,This place is open only during certain part of the year to the general public. You can book a ticket online and the costs are nominal. I visited the place in the month of Jan. The garden is very nicely maintained with a huge variety of flora. I particularly liked the bonsai collection. It takes about one and half hour to see this attraction. We went on a weekday and there was ample parking space nearby.
Mughal_Garden,Rasputin21,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Solo,Worth the hassle,"For three years I tried to visit the Moghul gardens without success not being able to navigate the unfriendly website.  This year I rang the number provided and someone in the PLO section advised that this year I was able to visit without booking on line - hurrah!I arrived on a Thursday at Gate 35 North Avenue Road carrying minimal items in my bag.  I was directed to the bag scan and when it exited the machine, my bag was thrown somewhere in my vicinity without anyone even looking at me!  Politeness indeed.  I was then directed towards the bag security where a pimply, bumfuzzed faced youth in Hinglish advised me to ""leave my bag there!"".  I emptied my wallet, phone and spectacles, leaving my camera (fingers crossed) in the bag.  I then had to run the frisk gauntlet.  While they were OK with the items I had in my hand, they were unhappy with the tissue in my pocket - that was confiscated!  Heavens help me if I needed to blow my nose - perhaps I would have to learn to do it Indian style with my fingers and flick it somewhere!The gardens were designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and inspired by the Mughal gardens of Kashmir.  The gardens spread over 15 acres and are open to the public for a limited time each spring.  Local people are bussed in from surrounding towns and villages.  Local primary schools also attend in large numbers.  What also struck me was a large number of young people (mid-week) who should have been working rather than taking posed selfies in the gardens.The herbal garden (mostly dead) was followed by a very poor bonsai garden with sad and dusty plants.  On to the musical fountains - which are surrounded by beds of dahlias and pansies and under a canopy of trees.  Very lovely except for the loud and jarring Indian music which did not match the elegant water spouts.Up stairs or a ramp for the main event - the Moghul Gardens.  This year Tulips were to dominate the display.  10,000 were brought in from the Netherlands.  However by the end of February most were spent except for for the yellow ones.  Roses abounded and well labelled.  Other flowers were phlox, candy tuft, daisies, pansies hyacinths and alyssum together with ornamental cabbages and dahlias (both single and extra large shaggy headed).  Everything was very clean and the water canals were kept clean by an army of maintenance workers.  Cannas were growing and would soon provide an array of bright colour.  The layout out although Persian geometric, includes British elements of hedges and flower beds.  Topiaried trees complete the effect.  Although selfies are supposed to be discouraged the bored police women took no notice.Following on from the Moghul gardens is the Long Garden.  This runs along a central paved path under a red sandstone pillared gallery.  The gallery is supposed to be covered with flame vine, and bougainvillea - but as there were no flowers it was too early for them.  The borders along the Long Garden are beds of roses and white Tulips with a wall of single dahlias.  By now the battery in my camera was seriously depleted and I wanted to retain the opportunity to photograph the Circular Garden.  Entering from the Long Garden this is a magnificent site with an amphitheatre of flowers leading down to the central fountain the the circular walkway a wall of single dahlias.  You need to be tall to see over the edge of the circle down to the different layers of flowers and stopping is discouraged by the vast number of people and children trying to push pass on the narrow pathway.Exiting this floral delight you then face a number of stalls selling Rashtrapathi Bhawan souvenirs and of all things compost.  A little further on are stalls providing water, ice cream and and other foodstuffs.  A long walk in what could could be scorching sun on a sunny day, to the bag retrieval - also manned by bored young policewomen  more interested in their own gossip rather than service.  Again my bag was thrown at me out of my grasp, so I just stood and stared at the policewomen until one decided that she would push it to just within my grasp!  There were no foreigners other than myself during the time I was there and around mid-day a group of elderly Americans arrived."

Mughal_Garden,Dashers2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Couples,Spectacular!,The entry even though free is a challenge. Please do not take anything other than your phone and wallet if you wish to enter easily. The initial gardens may not be that attractive and maintained but the bonsai garden and the final tow gardens are absolutely spectacular. A shame that they did not allow the camera.

Mughal_Garden,ward27342,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Solo,A Flower Oasis,"In the heart of Delhi this is quite unexpected. I ventured on a fine Sunday morning and walked from the Central Secretariat Metro (although there were plenty of Tuk Tuks in evidence). After a slow paced 30 walk (it helps if you come out of Gate 1 which is nearest the Gardens) I arrived at the Gardens and dutifully joined the queue which was surprisngly quick at 11.45 or thereabouts. I dutifully followed the crocodile of visitors through the Herb garden then the Bonsai Garden and the fountains, finally the formal Gardens themselves. It was breathtaking once you entered the main garden not just the variety and colours of all the flowers in their many hued finery but also but also the sheer volume of visitors who had come to take advantage of the February opening. Inside there were water and rest stops but they were at the begining and end of the walks welcome nonetheless. I left the gardens at approximately 2 in the afternoon by which time the queue was then down the length of Church Road so quite a wait I would suspect so the advice would be to go early. There was a separate entrance for online booking, something I had missed before I set off, something future visitors could take advantage of"

Mughal_Garden,lamedicca,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Family,Mughal Gardens,"These gardens are an absolute must-visit. You can see a wide variety of flora. There is also a herb garden and a bonsai garden. The circular garden with the fountains in the centre attract a lot of attention. The musical fountain could be better coordinated with the music and the choice of music could be better. On the whole, a wonderful place to visit."
Mughal_Garden,jaincherry,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Family,Beauty in the Heart of the City,"These beautiful gardens surrounding the Rashtrapati Bhawan are a must-visit at least once.  open to general public for only a months or so, visit these gardens with your family and enjoy the beauty of a variety of flowers. The beautiful tulips in splendid colours are sure to catch your eye. The circular gardens with the fountain in the centre are another beautiful feature of this garden."
Mughal_Garden,CsSharma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Couples,Beautiful and best maintained Mughal Garden,"Mughal Garden is one of the best maintained garden at Rashtrapati Bhavan. It is thrown open to public during the period 6th Feb 2019 to 6th March 2019. There are two options for visit this year. The first one and most convenient is the Online booking and getting a visitor entry pass upto 10 no. of people online and second is direct physical entry, but one has to face long queues. The online booking is two hours slot starting from 9 AM on each day except Monday, when the garden is closed. During Udyanotsava, there is free entry otberwise, there is an entry fee of Rs.50/- per head.The garden is well maintained with separate sections such as Bonsai section, medicinal plants,spiritual plants, rose garden and the main mughal garden. There is a big musical fountain also within the garden. This year one can see a great varieties of tulips, large number of Rise plants in various colours such as omnipresent red, white, yellow, green rose,two colours rose and a gigantic machina rose.There are plenty tiny orange trees worth seeing.The oranges are of very small,  maximum size is of lemon size and mostly the size of glass ball.There remain huge rush in prakar hours, but in early morning at 9.am and evening hours are less crowded.
