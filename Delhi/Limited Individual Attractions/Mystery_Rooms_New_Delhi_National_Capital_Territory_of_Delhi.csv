Mystery_Rooms,akansha3804,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,My experience,My experience inside the mystery room was great. It was a real life escape challenge. The only thing due to which I deducted one star is the price. The cost is too high for each person also and the extra time cost is also very high. 
Mystery_Rooms,Vipin Kundnani,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Not sufficient time,When in any game the time described in 1 hr. then why do you sell extra time to complete the remaining part ? I mean if you already know the game length is 75 minutes then why you given 60 minutes ? You sold 15 minutes time for extra Rs.500. Or you should shorten the length. I mean Rs.900 each ticket for 1 hr. is not enough for you. You play tricks to charge extra during the game.
Mystery_Rooms,manavahlawatxd,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,One of the best experience!!!,"Look , mystery room is a nice concept if you want to spend good time with your friends. Just go for it !!! "

Mystery_Rooms,maninder1107,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Great Concept,"The experience was really great however, it is a bit costly. If they would have given 1.5-2hrs at the same price it would have been more reasonable. I visited the mystery rooms with my friends at Rajouri garden."
Mystery_Rooms,812ros,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Abduction,"The theme was perfect, though the locks were not that good. Even after knowing the right code it took 10 mins just to open the lock which is waste of time. Also, the Hints were not that good. Most of the hints we got were the things that we already completed."
Mystery_Rooms,nidhi55333,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Family,review,its too expensive as per games the prices should be kept reasonable such that it will be called worthy visit and time should be provided as per difficulty level as after half completing the task you ask for money for extra time required
Mystery_Rooms,vatsvaaruni,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Family,concept is ok.,Too costly for the given experience. Overall New one for Indian folks. Small kids don't enjoy it. Gud for teenagers

Mystery_Rooms,kushagra0410,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,The props were broken and that single prop wasted our 20 min,The props were broken and it wasted our 20 min then when we told them they were arguing with us that we broke it
Mystery_Rooms,yashasgarg5,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,"Terrible, feeling cheated","One of the main clues was broken which wasted 20 mins of my teams time, when the hour got over they didn’t have us extra time because of the broken clue and said that we will have to play for 15 mins extra"
Mystery_Rooms,anan0ymus,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Excellent mystery,A wonderful experiennce. I went with my friends there and we enjoyed a ton. My best 1 hour in november.Thank you so much mystery rooms.
Mystery_Rooms,Namrata C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Unique Experience that passes by way too quickly,"Given the details of the puzzles, there is no way it can be done and more importantly, enjoyed, in 60 minutes. It’s such a flash of events, that one does not get to enjoy the storyline properly. Perhaps, if the time limit were increased to 2 hours or even 90 minutes, it would be a more fulfilling experience for the participants. Hope the organisers take this feedback into consideration!"
Mystery_Rooms,shreyakandwal9,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Bad staff service,I honestly love mystery rooms but i was tremendously disappointed today and i doubt i will revisit. I love the cp mystery room and decided to visit the rajouri franchise as well. The place has a nice aura around it but the staff was very unprofessional and had no value for the customer. The way while  communicating to a customer was horrible. At a point the staff was scolding us while  we were playing the game for asking the appropriate hints.I hated the experience!!!!!They didnt even give us the game we were looking for.The cost on Saturday and Sunday is 900 per person and on weekdays it's 600.Ps. If I wanted to get scolded today I would have stayed home.😅
Mystery_Rooms,FlintFlopper,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Really good experience,Really nice and tense experience me and my friends had alot of fun Looking forward to pay a visit again
Mystery_Rooms,CreativeD_YT,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,First escape room,"Having watched many escape rooms, this was actually my first time ever attempting an escape room myself. It was a lot of fun trying out The Hurt Locker as my first escape room. I would recomend The Hurt Locker as your first one too as its not that hard but still only 35% of people make it. Good luck!"
Mystery_Rooms,sakshambajaj0903,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,WOAH,Great experience. It was fun and mind blowing. It was quite challenging. Me and my friends really enjoyed

Mystery_Rooms,sejalsinha,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Employees there were not at all welcoming.,I dont know about other branches but the Rajouri Garden one has really really rude lady inside the mystery rooms who is supposed to explain us the rules and stuff. Receptionist was sweet but the one who has to explain and control everything was so unwelcoming as if we were her enemies. Really bad services she was very ill mannered.They just try to gain more and more money first from the tickets and then if you dont complete your heist they convience you to pay a lot more to continue it.The themes were well planned but the way that lady was behaving is not worth spending that much money. No respect for customers .
Mystery_Rooms,Riya3nair,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,The CP one is better.,"Rude staff, abduction mystery room was based on GK and maths and was not mysterious at all. They were delaying the steps even though we had already gotten them right. This was at Rajouri "

Mystery_Rooms,naturelover2211,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Family,Great fun,Superb fun for all age groups as well as complete outing for families..easily accessible location..just staff needs to have  little more professionalism in briefing of game  which one is playing and their behaviour to enrich the whole experience
Mystery_Rooms,maadhav0101,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,Okayish playing silent legacy,"The experience was okayish playing silent legacy, the cards answer was given to us by the game master, however it wasn't correct according to the printed instructions, upon ending we asked the explanation and she said we did mistake however it was game master who showed us the solution. Similarly a couple of more puzzles and their answers didn't make sense. I've played almost every other games but this was really disappointing. "

Mystery_Rooms,layogaruna,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great experience.. but little too expensive,"I believe 500 per head is more than enough, if there is a group of more than 5 individuals. But they charge 800 per head on weekends.Experience is good apart from that, but it is little too expensive."

It was my sister's 16 the birthday, an we couldn't think of a better experience on her special day. The mystery was very well planned, and was suitable for all age groups.

Mystery_Rooms,DSMANHTSSA,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Unacceptable service.,"First of all, when we first arrived, they were rude from the start. They scolded and disrespected us time and time again. When we went into the escape room, the handcuffs were too tight, cutting off my friends circulation. And they just said ""Why should I help you? I should let you die, you're a prisoner."" Aside from that whole mess, they kept on making perverted comments asking us what our punishment was for failing the escape room.  This is unacceptable."

The story-line of the games are interesting and you need to work together as teams to get out. It challenges your brain, skills and team-work. Do visit with your family or friends and you might come out with a deeper bond with them."
