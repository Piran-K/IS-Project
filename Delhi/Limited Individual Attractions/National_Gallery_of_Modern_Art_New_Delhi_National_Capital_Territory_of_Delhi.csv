National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Maneesh2700,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Good for Art Lovers,The is undoubtedly a place where all art lovers should go. Especially we should our kids there to make them aware of our art heritage. Though I wish the collection was a bit more vast
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Madhulika L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Superb display of modern Indian art,"At only Rs 20 per Indian adult (children up to 18 years of age can visit free) and Rs 300 per foreigner, this museum is a must-visit if you’re keen on modern art. The museum premises spread over several buildings that are part of Jaipur House, a palace initially built for the Maharaja of Jaipur, back in 1936. Some of the subsidiary buildings house administrative offices and so on, but the art is mainly in the New Wing, inaugurated in 2009. Here, you can see an excellent, chronologically arranged, of modern Indian art, beginning around the period that saw ‘Company Art’: from there, right up to the present day, there are dozens of stunning artworks, with some scattered sculptures here and there. Many of the greats are here: Amrita Sher-Gil, Abanindranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, KK Hebbar, MF Husain, Satish Gujral… and many more. There are several almost iconic paintings in the collection, which spreads over three floors (staircases connect the floors, as do wheelchair-friendly ramps; there are also elevators between the floors). Note that photography without a flash is allowed, as long as you aren’t taking photos of yourself or of other people. To understand the displays better, you can also opt for one of the guided tours, starting every hour or so, that are conducted. These are bi-lingual, English and Hindi, and are done for groups: if you have paid for the tour, you simply join the group starting next. Do remember to go out into the grounds of the museum and check out some of the sculptures on the lawns. There’s an especially striking metal tree (with utensils as the ‘leaves’) by Subodh Gupta which is truly memorable."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,AirborneSpoon,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Solo,Very Dissatisfied,"When I'm reviewing places in India I try not to compare them to similar places in the West because it's not fair due to the differences in their operating budgets. But inorder to give the Western readers of this post an honest review and a starting reference the two must be compared.  On to the Modern Art Museum. This museum had many examples of Modern Indian art stretching back a hundred or so years. The art was colorful, unique and came in many different mediums. I found the art very interesting and in some cases very similar to Western Art, Cubism came to mind.  The interior of the museum was very poorly layed out with no flow or any particular reason that I could figure out. Unfortunately, like most other museum's in India this one was in need of a total make over. The paint was chipping off, the carpets and walls were dirty and the paintings at time appeared to be hung by simple hooks that Americans would by at Home Depot or Lowe's hardware stores. To top it off but I expected this, no snack bar and the gift shop was horrible. Are there no quality gift shops in any Indian tourist site? I just want to buy a guide book, post card and magnet."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Rush401,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 • Solo,Modern art,Not so great experience! Only one building with art and few sculptures..the rest is all shut..considering we have a so many artists through the centuries. Atleast make a attempt to show and display more works..
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Day well spent!,"I spent a winter afternoon strolling through the galleries at NGMA. There are a number of galleries with varied exhibitions. The permanent gallery features paintings by Raja Ravi Verma, Rabindranath Tagore, Amrita Sher Gil etc. Each piece of art is a visual delight while a few give points to ponder.Two temporary exhibits that stand out in my mind are Satyajit Ray & Upendra Maharathi. I didn't know much about the late Mr. Ray; so it was an education for me. & the late Mr. Maharathi's works are stunning!NGMA has a parking outside & is huge; so wear comfortable shoes & be ready to walk a lot."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Steve Falqowski,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,I thought they have more interesting works,"This is the biggest art gallery in India. Staff was very helpfull, but art shop has just a little thing to sell. All pictures look the same. It was ok, but nothing special."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Nadia I,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Wonderful visit,"It was raining on one of the days in Delhi, we decided its a good day for a museum.The wing that was open, had many beautiful pieces made by using different styles. There are guided tours , which we did not know about. First one at 11 am.Next we visited Maharithi Exhibit in Jaipur house, that was out standing. Glad it was raining that day, because we would have missed it.There is a ticket for 600 Rupees , that covers both buildings."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Nikki S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Great museum,"We had a great visit to this museum. It is a very interesting collection, and I learned a lot about the history of Indian art. There was a lot of construction and getting into.rhe museum was initially confusing, but it was definitely worth a visit. We weren't allowed to bring bags but they did let my son bring his sketchbook and a pencil in (although he really wanted to bring more supplies since he loves sketching art at museums.)"
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Tarique S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Mecca of the Connoisseur of Art,"National Gallery of Modern Art at the time of its inception (1954) was compared to the 'Venice Biennale"" by one of the leading newspaper of the country. It has surely come a long way since then. With its colossal collection of Paintings, Sculpture and Photography by some of the finest and renowned artists of India, NGMA is definitely 'The Mecca' for art lovers. Situated at the central Hexagon near India Gate inside the premise of Jaipur House, this museum is a must visit, I would say. The museum has been set up expertly into four floors, each displaying illustrations by different artists of different period. As you walk on each floor, appreciating the oeuvre by different artists, you get educated as how the Indian paintings got evolved from miniature ones to larger than life size paintings. The museum exhibits myriad genre of Indian paintings ranging from Buddhists, Hindu mythology, Mughal, British era, modern day paintings and abstract painting as well.At the time of my visit to this museum, the bottom most gallery displayed the photography by Nimai Ghosh, who captured in his camera, some of the memorable moments from the life of Satyajit Ray (Oscar Award Winning Bollywood Director). The second floor had collection from pre to post independent era. The third and the fourth floor was gracefully exhibited by modern day and abstract paintings. Sculptures have been placed in a very beautiful manner on second and third floor. The entire museum has been set up beautifully in a much uncluttered style and the lights have been used with absolutely perfect tone and intensity.Adjacent to Main Museum building lies the Jaipur House which is used to showcase the work of different artists from time to time. Presently, the Hall is exhibiting the great work of Upendra Maharathi and the exhibition has been named as ""Shashwat"". Maharathi was a true Gandhinian and had immense faith Buddha. His 112 feet long work of art depicting the life of Gautama Buddha is also on display.Conclusively I could say that this place is not just for the connoisseur of art but for the amateurs too as it is very educative and very enlightening.Important Info:1. The museum is opened From Tuesday to Sunday from 10 am to 5 pm.2. Free Parking is available in front of gate no 3 of Museum3. The entry fee for Indian citizen is INR 20 and that for foreign nationals is INR 500.4. A guided walk is organised every day at 1130 am, 01:30 pm and 3:30 pm. This guided walk is free of cost. The guide helps in understanding the museum and the art in a much better way.5. Photography is allowed inside the museum, but one can use only mobile phone cameras and not the professional cameras. Be sure to switch off the flash of your mobile phones while clicking photos. No selfie is allowed inside the museum. 6. Locker facility is available free of cost inside museum.7. Museum Shop is situated right at the entrance of the museum."

National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,ghoomboom,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Good Gallery of contemporary Modern Indian Art,"Situated on the C-Hexagon of India Gate near Shershah Road, this gallery is a great collection of works of modern Indian renowned painters like Raja Ravi Varma, Nand Lal Bose, Amrita Shergill, M F Hussain etc. The Gallery is spread over three floors and many times there are exhibitions also organised here. The campus is big and beautiful and exhibition building is only a part of it. I think it has an Auditorium also. There are many stone sculptures put in the gardens in the campus. Very quite and serene atmosphere. The ticket for Indians is only Rs 20/-. One may visit this gallery if interested in the works of contemporary Indian painters."

National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,DOMINIQUE L,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,TO BE AVOIDED / FOREIGHERS HAVE TO PAY A RIDICULOUS ENTRY FARE,"I am a French Citizen. I have been to India more than 10 times.I had to pay for visiting this museum a, hefty amount of 500 Rps while Indian citizens just pay 20 Rps : I consider this is very unfair to charge so much firstly for what the museum has to offer, secondly and mainly to make such discrimination for foreign visitors.I know that some other sites in India do the same discrimination against foreign visitors, but this is not a valid reason especially taking into account that the National Gallery of Modern Art is not at all a prime site to visit. I have been in more than 180 countries in the world ; very few countries apply such discrimination fares against foreign visitors; and then they do is in a much smaller ratio. Furthermore, photos are not allowed iInside ; I would consider when paying 500 rps, which by the way is expensive even for european standards, I should have the right to make photos.I felt therefore very very badly welcomed in this museum. Of course, there are many things to see in India ; that is why I went to India many times but I feel very uneasy and not welcomed nicely in this country due to this kind of treatment of foreign visitors.'Incredible India' (the motto of the Tourism office) ; Yes incredible! : 'incredible' is the treatment of foreign visitors !!!!!"
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,JenMSim,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Great Experience of Modern Indian Art,"My husband and I visited this museum and took a guided tour with the museum's Assistant Curator. I would highly recommend this tour, as the Asst Curator provided a deep level of context and understanding than we would have experienced on our own. The temporary exhibits were very interesting and well curated, especially the current show at the Jaipur House. Highly recommended to visit if you are exploring museums in Delhi."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,George C,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Discriminatory prices,If places charge tourists outrageous entrance fees compared to locals (500 vs 20 rupees) then deservedly they will lose tourist custom.  They certainly lost mine. 
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Andrei Dorian G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,Works of Modern Indian Painters,If it's to hot outside or raining and u had enough of classical Indian art you can admire in here work of modern Indian painters such as: Amrita Sher-Gil or the Mumbai Progressive Artists Group with very impressive pieces from M. F. Hussain. 
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Being Dilliwaala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,A journey through more than 300 years of Indian art,"With free guided tours at 11 am , 1:30 pm & 3:30 pm, NGMA offers a journey unparalleled.  From miniature painting to oil paintings to sketches, it's a time travel opportunity. Take time to notice and asses each art work and experience how the society changed with time."

National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Katie C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Cash only,"We had this as a stop on our tour of Delhi, but were sad to find the ticket office was cash only.  We didn't have enough cash on us to get in, so we were walked around the sculpture gardens to at least have a bit of an experience here.  The galleries looked lovely through the windows, and I'm so sad we weren't able to go in.  I do think this is a good stop, but be sure to bring plenty of cash!"
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,IckFick,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,Beautiful collection but poorly managed,Being a recently new arrival in Delhi I thought I should become familiar with more sights and museums. The NGMA is not too far from my place so I walked there on a Sunday late morning. It’s a bit confusing as there are several entrances but only Gate 3 is for visitors. Then you must walk towards the back of the property to New Gallery where I had to wait for a ticket salesperson. Once inside there is no map or explanation of the gallery. But there are great collections of interesting ‘modern’ Indian art. One main issue was lighting. Many of the pieces have glass but not the good kind. The cheap kind that reflects the poorly placed lights in every display. This is ironic because they make a point of telling you not to use flash with photos but the lighting is terrible. The collection is pretty amazing tho. After New Gallery I was told to go out and turn left for another exhibition but there was next to no signage and no personnel so I gave up and left. It’s a pity that the managers of the gallery have no interest in properly preserving and displaying such amazing art but only promoting themselves. Invest a bit into this place and it is incredible. Instead there are too many underpaid ‘guards’ and crappy lighting. But still go and see it. 
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,vidushi jain,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Delhi visit,"This place is a delight to visit as it has various modern arts. This place is amazing for art lovers as it has many sculptures made of bronze and other  materials. So, you can visit this place with friends and family and have fun.. "

National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Anny454,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,A brilliant morning!,"I was taken here by my guide at the start of two days discovering the arts & crafts of India.  Initially a little reluctant, I quickly saw that this gallery provided an excellent introduction, showing clearly how external cultures impacted on indigenous art.  The modern building on several floors is light and airy.  Some of the lighting is too intrusive, but on the whole pictures are well displayed.  I am now a fan of the work of Jamini Roy."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,240kundang,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Paintings Gallery,If you like old paintings. This place is good.

National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,aditi d,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Good collection & great tour!,"The collection at the NGMA is impressive and has decent information displays. However the highlight of our visit was a guided tour by Arko Ganguly. He is very impressive and it was one of the best art tours I have done across the world. He used the painting as a lens to walk through the history of India. The sculpture gallery is worth a visit too. So do visit first for the tour and then again to soak the art in. Thanks, Arko!"
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Victor,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Excellent collection,Quite a learning experience. Pretty inspirational to be honest. Hopefully they will have the Jaipur house restored soon for the other 17000 paintings in storage right now.
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Rubes J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Excellent insight to historical journey,We went here on a Sunday and joined one of the free curated walks lead by assistant curator Mr Ganguli. He passion is infectious and one would not have gained as much but just walking around. The tour was almost 2 hours but it went very quickly and covered all floors. We were really able to see India’s journey through the history of art. Definitely recommend if you like art and sculpture. 
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,ndocking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Wonderful. Excellent value for 500 rupees ,One of the best modern art galleries I have been to . The most engaging and knowledgable assistant curator and the free guided tours are a must. You leave having an understanding  of Indian history and culture through the eyes of Indian artists. Brilliant few hours here 
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,2torontotraveller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Art from 1850s to Now,"This is truly an Art Museum.  It has a building that houses paintings from 1850s  to present time.  The building is very well laid out as it has 3 floors with the main floor starting at colonial times and the top floor ending at current times. Unlike a lot of Modern Art museums that hold large abstract paintings, the majority of the paintings are relatively small and would fit into your living room.  The basement of this building holds special exhibits.There is a building beside the main building that holds scruptures.  Most of these are very nice.  Since the exhibitions are well laid out I could get sense of how art developed in India.  I would recommend going to this museum.It costs 500 RS to go to this museum if you are a foreigner and you need to pay it in cash."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,The Rissala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,SUPER TIME!!!  GREAT COLLECTIONS.,THE STAFF IS GREAT. THE COLLECTION IS WELL PUT TOGETHER AND GREAT.  Great place for Indian art and art lovers to study and watch real art . well put together and a must for all students 
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,"Don't go by the name, it also has historic paintings","I visited this place for the first time in my life (58 years old), despite being a born Delhite. Modern art is not just about colours splattered on sheets or walls, it is far beyond and this place has it - paintings, statues, murals, stone craft art, metal craft art etc.It has paintings of renowned painters of India as also statues crafted by brilliant artists."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Marc K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,"Museum is OK, but the Museum guide makes this place 5 / 5","I had an afternoon to spare in New Delhi so I decided to see what they have to offer in the museum modern art.I'll set the scene very quickly, from the outside the place looks great, as you slowly get closer you realise you're heading into what looks like a college campus. As I arrived (and getting charged 25x price of locals - about £5) I was in. Initially, I didn't have high hopes for the place, until I realised I came at the same time as the guided tour, it's then when my perception of this place changed.The curator of the museum knows his audience, we didn't know the artists, or what on earth the pictures meant. He gave an interesting and relevant history of the art, from early Indian works, through to when western civilisation came and beyond, cleverly linking each piece of random piece of art on what I wouldn't take a second glance at and really making me think about it.We only got through about 3/4 of the ground floor before it was over. Then we were left to explore the rest of the place for ourselves.Like many of the reviews here - visit this place for the curator. He loves that place and after the tour, you'll probably love it too."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Little Wandering Wren,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,A shambolic delight,"Initial Impressions are poor. Opening times have been changed to 11 am, this is not reflected in their publicity. The English tour which is supposed to be at 11 am finally gets going at nearer 12 Noon, and is hijacked by a group of students from a local college of Fine Arts. There is a flood in the shop. The cafe, toilets and general lighting and facilities are disappointing for India's premier modern art space.The special exhibition on Indigenous Australia is wonderful and encourages me to persevere, and at this point out give the staff a special mention especially our enthusiastic tour guide. You get the impression that everyone here is doing their best they just need some investment into what could be an amazing place.We can see renovations are taking place outside in the palace out the front and our guide tells us there are special challenges placing art in historic buildings, the reason the modern art gallery was built.I would strongly recommend all visitors take the tour to understand what the Museum are about, how they define modern art. You will not be disappointed. Alone just wandering in, you might be."

He took us to several parts of the exhibit and shared with us a very well prepared and simply fascinating commentary about the artworks. Even the least academically prepared would enjoy this visit. We enjoyed it very much. The museum has paintings and sculpture by many of the main representatives of 20th century Indian art and before. I learned about many important artists and their language, Amrita Sher-Gill, Haren Das, Raja Ravi Varma, Bhinod Mukherjee etc."

Mandi House or Central Secretariat. A Uber/Ola should cost around 60 to 90 Rupees.There is an entry ticket of Rs 20/- for Indians and Rs 500/- for Foreign nationals.The Art gallery spans basement ground and three floors. Fully air conditioned and good arrangement to sit on each floors.The Paintings and artefacts are mesmerising. Many of them are so vivid that they transform you to the British or pre British era.I visited along with my 10 year old son, initially apprehensive that the kind might find it difficult to enjoy the art. But contrary to my expectations he was the one who enjoyed the most.To top it all if you are looking at the leisurely weekend trip you can first proceed to CP for a sumptuous meal before heading here. We had our Lunch at ""Kake da Dhaba"" Their butter chicken is to die for... and it prepared us for the two to three hours the art gallery takes to be relished properly."

They had a dozen or so of her works hung together, but the lighting was poor. One had glass and no matter where I stood, I couldn’t get away from the reflections. A few others had glaring misdirected lights in the way. The building is nice and if you go in summer go early because the AC doesn’t reach to the 3rd and 4th floors where the most modern, and most interesting to me, works are located. "
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Kat_Dev_Indra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Great collection of art,"A place very modern, well curated and representative of  the history of art leading up to the contemporary. Not very crowded but that has to do with the position of art in Indian mind space.That day when we were visiting the entry gate were changed. There was delayed opening but the staff was very helpful and somewhat apologetic.We went on the organised walk, which was worth the wait. Thanks to the museum staff who did the guided walk-in  art style and history was explained wonderfully. Made our visit worth the effort.The collection is wide, so please have comfortable shoes and lots of time on hand. The museum has the unique style of the Indian Government establishment...with the disorganised material, poor maintenance, a very basic kind of cafe/canteen which appears surefire for picking infections at its level of hygiene.The architecture is grand and does justice to a monument housing india's artistic treasures. But then there were packages strewn around or stacked on the walls...enjoy it as India' belief in managing physical things. A different sense of aesthetics.The parking is only for government  or modern high castes of government officials. if you are ' 'private' then no parking...well those are the modern shudras so why bother!That's living art :-)The museum is an attempt to represent Indian Art in a Western museum format...but falls way short of that because of the general way government runs such institutions- do not compare the establishment because it is confused as it serves the modern rulers - Indian government and tries to compete with international museums... The result you would see.Recommend you keep your focus only on the paintings...do not worry about the peripherals or the system.Because the Art collection is marvellous and captures centuries. Definitely visit at least a couple of times.A request to authorities... Government  museums generally have free entry. "

National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Animesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,"Artistic, Classic, Impressive: 12,000 Sq Mtrs Exhibition Space is one of the World's Largest Art Meusum","Located in the heart of the city (Outer Circle, Hexagonal C of India Gate), this is the place for the art lovers and artists. The complex has a number of buildings housing exhibition halls, administrative offices, cafeteria and the lawns outside having marvellous sculpture. This is ideal to go out, savour the art and sculpture in all its forms and come back as a satisfied soul. One of my favourite places in Delhi but I have complaint with self of not having been able to visit it more than once. It is the premier art gallery under Ministry of Culture. The main museum at Jaipur House was established on 29 Mar, 1954 with branches later at Mumbai & Bangalore.

Of course we are as far in as the charge a lot more but that’s why we are here to spend our money. It’s a great collection of Indian modern Art a lot of which I had no idea it existed. The colonial. Era is White centric, British. My favourite part was the interactive portion from an Italian artist."

National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Shanth148,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,An outstanding permanent exhibition of Indian Art!,"We were most pleasantly surprised to see an amazing array of Indian Art over nearly 200 years...starting from the East India Company- the paintings of Thomas Daniel which have captured the Calcutta of old, and the Hoogly and the surrounding places....really shows us after 200 years what it must have been like in those days.Then the Tagores, Raja Ravi Verma, Amrita SherGill, Jamini Roy, Nandalal Bose and a whole plethora of Indian Artists of that Era; as well as a lot many others by British Artists.Then the Bombay Progressive Artists Group....really lovely, one must have a look.Finally there is a new section of the likes of Panniker, Anjali Ela Menon, Subodh Gupta, Prabhakar Kolte, Biren De, and a whole host of wonderful artists. Felt awed and so happy to see so many illustrious artists up front. Apparently in 2009, Sonia Gandhi had opened this permanent exhibition.A must see for all!"
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Nigel G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Stunning and Thought Provoking,"The entry wing of the building was holding a special exhibition to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Dhanraj Bhagat. Some sculptures are impressive but his felt pen efforts to my mind are simple doodlings! I fail to appreciate the art value in the work. Moving on to the main building. What a magnificent collection.  The Head Study by Rabindranath Tagore is said to be a geometric image in the style of Escher. Very impressive. Abstract work by Jyoti Bhatt is colourful and activating . I stood and pondered it for a while. Works by G R Santosh are absolutely captivating . He titles one work "".............."" - challenging and powerful for a title. The work embraces in abstract form the female reproductive system in art. Maybe that's just what I see, but clearly the work of a very talented artist. A similar egg abstract work is just as compelling. Ompakesh work 'green to yellow lotus' - again stunning and vivid. Manu Perekha's 'evening in Benares' is impressive and loaded with detail. I love this work and could admire it for a considerable time. There is a whole wall devoted to ink works of F N Souza - his seated woman 1984 is powerful and illustrates the enormous potential in black and white. Landscape of Goa by Nirmal Kapoor is also worth a mention.There are a few old masters related to the colonial era.Pyne's 'Moon Bath' is appealing and colourful, the work draws you too it. IGoing on to sculpture. A definitively thought provoking piece is by Navjot Altaf, 'Palani's Daughters of Pieces - I'm so at a loss without a commentary, but it's rare to see sculptures with fully recessed vagina's, unless it is intended to depict the birth of the pieces resting between the open legs of Palini. Would love to discuss this work with the artist herself. Jankirams 'Christ' is monumental and dominating. Great piece of work. Lots of sculptures outside. No cameras but can take photos with mobile phones. Deposit cameras at entrance. Absolutely stunning collection of Indian art. Allow a whole day if you are really an art enthusiast."

National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,callumx,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,A large collection of contemporary art from the 19th Century onwards,"The National Gallery of Modern Art hosts a large collection of art (mainly paintings with a few sculptures). The main building is used to host rotating exhibitions, and the modern annex buildings display the gallery's extensive permanent collection. The gallery is spacious, pleasantly air conditioned, and has a very relaxed atmosphere. A wander around the gallery shows how painting styles in India have developed, initially drawing on European influences, but then developing unique Indian flavours. I happily spent a couple of hours soaking up the culture. As ever with modern art, some paintings are exquisite and others banal. There is something here to please everybody."

The cafe however is a wasted opportunity.  It is a big cavernous space with little furniture and only offers chai and packets of biscuits. It was grubby. I cannot prove it but am certain that the vomiting and diahrrea I started later that day came from thst cup of chai. I was severely ill. Be warned! 3 stars only because of the chai, otherwise 5."

It starts from the start of the modern period in the 19th century all the way to present day. They have paintings from great stalwarts of art like Amrita Shergill, Nandalal bose, Jamini Roy and contemporary artists... I am sure many of the paintings would cost a lot in the art market. It's a great place for an art outsider to get acquainted with modern art. They have lockers for your things, an RO for drinking water, and the loos were in very good condition as per museum standards. A good place for a day out. It's good for a day out."

National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,gentbrugg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,New pages,"For me it is one of the mandatory places to visit in Delhi. In India there is only one similar Museum - in Mumbai, having the status of branch of the Delhi one. However, it seems to open soon in Bangalore next branch, but not yet.  If all else – by the way, in principle, almost all surrounding neighborhood - looks already written and turned page in the history and culture of India, but here in this building, built as the residence of the Raja of Jaipur, are being written the absolutely new pages. I mean contemporary art exhibitions for which the museum among other things is designed. Although there are permanent exhibitions – as improvised (like sculptures in front of the entrance) and thematically verified. There is also a miniature painting, as elsewhere in India, though still with an emphasis on Mysore, Calcutta and Tanjoor art school, but far more important from my point of view is, for example, the Department of ""Academic realism"", presenting Indian art from the unexpected for the Europeans side. Or the exhibits that give an idea about the school of  ""Bengal Renaissance"". Separate exposition is dedicated to the works of European artists, then to the works of Rabindranath Tagore and members of his family. And this is only a small part among the nearly twenty thousand units of storage."
National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art,Daniel S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Great older paintings from local artists,I am a fan of the older paintings. The drawings and prints fascinate me. This is a must see. I would get a driver to drive you there. The main issue there is no water is permitted in the facility. This makes the visit a short one for foreign visitors that need bottled water. One cannot even go to the door and get your own water and drink. This needs to be fixed. There is a cafe outside of the gallery. Too bad one cannot enjoy this place a longer time.

Divided onto four floors plus two additional galleries, the collection is both manageable and accessible.  The knowledgeable staff really helps you appreciate the evolution of two and three dimensional art in India.  I fell in love with Amrita Sher-Gil -- what an amazing array of work she produced in her short life; Jamini Roy's work was a delight, and their small but amazing collection of art and sculpture by BC Sanyal, shows why he was the Baba of Indian Art.  Except for an especially well behaved school group, I had this cool, well organized gallery virtually to myself for my 3-hr visit.  Definitely worth a visit."

The best bits are by no means very modern. It also houses miniatures of the 10th century. The 3rd and 4th floors of the New building have really very nice paintings and are well worth seeing although also date from late 19th century to the mid 19 hundreds. But these works are the best. Floor 3a and 4a House very large and indeed modern works that one cannot make head or tail of. I spent a lovely afternoon there away from the Delhi din and traffic noise.
