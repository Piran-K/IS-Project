National_Gandhi_Museum,Michaela B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Free and informative, but missing something in terms of customer appreciation ","Free entry and plenty of staff around to guide you around the exhibits. We found the acoustics within the building (and mask wearing guide), difficult to hear and understand clearly. An inspirational and amazing man.... interesting exhibits with interactivity BUT for us, being able to travel around at our own pace with a QR code for an audio guide would have given us more satisfaction and the museum a higher score."

The dweller Council of learning Museum in India & a knob of other museums have merged this approach, lately, however, we have yearned for museums across the country to follow suit, wsorth it!"
National_Gandhi_Museum,Tarique S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,GLIMPSES OF THE LIFE OF A GREAT SOUL,"Gandhi, a man who is revered all over the world for his philosophy of 'Ahimsa' or 'Non Violence'. Man, who taught the world that no matter how tough the battle is, it can still be won by love. He took up no arms, still defeated his opponents. Lived simplest life with some of the greatest philosophical thinking. Man, who eradicated untouchability from our society and left an indelible mark in the history of mankind. Such was Mahatma Gandhi and this humble Museum has tried its best to bring forth some of the glimpses of his life.The Museum is built on two floors, the ground and the first floor. As you enter the main building, you find a larger than life size bust of Mahatma Gandhi to your left and an exhibition hall to your right, where presently the photographs of Gandhi‚Äôs Life in South Africa has been put on show.There is Library on the ground floor which has around 40,000 books in English and other Indian languages, like Urdu, Hindi, Tamil, and Guajarati etc. The collection of this Library have been divided into two sections, viz. ‚ÄòGandhiana (including freedom movement) and ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô. The ‚ÄòGandhiana‚Äô section includes books, journals and documents by Gandhiji, on Gandhiji, his philosophy, ideology and those on the history of the Indian Freedom Movement from 1857 to 1947. The ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô section includes books, journals and documents on subjects other than those covered under the ‚ÄòGandhiana‚Äô. No membership fee is required for consulting books. The access to library is free for all.As you climb the stairs to reach the first floor you will come across an abstract by Nobel Laureate, great writer and a poet, Rabindranath Tagore, which he wrote on Gandhiji. On the first floor lies the ‚ÄòCharkha Museum‚Äô. Charkha or ‚ÄòSpinning wheel‚Äô, became a symbol of freedom movement and also played a pivotal role in ‚ÄòSwaraj‚Äô movement. It represented a desire to achieve self-dependency, self-responsibility, self-respect and self-realisation.‚ÄòCommemorative Gallery‚Äô on the first floor exhibits many of the belongings of Gandhiji and in ‚ÄòMartyrdom Museum‚Äô, the blood stained cloth of Gandhiji has been displayed. It was the same cloths that Gandhiji was wearing when he was assassinated by Nathuram Godse.There are few things in the museum which are indeed amazing and adds extra charm to it. Like the recreated heartbeats of Gandhiji which can be seen in the form of ECG and can also be heard on headphone. One can listen to the original voice of Gandhiji on a handset of telephone. The ‚ÄúWalking Stick‚Äù of Gandhiji is also on display. It is the same ‚Äúwalking Stick‚Äù which Gandhiji used during the great ‚ÄúDandi March‚Äù in 1930. Two teeth of Gandhiji extracted by Dr Barretto at Nagpur has also been kept on display at this museum.This museum doesn‚Äôt just displays objects but also teaches the much needed philosophy for the present time. I would definitely recommend this museum to people of age groups.Important Infos:1. Free Parking is available inside the main campus of the Museum.2. The Museum and the Library are open from Tuesday to Sunday between 10 am to 5:30 pm.3. There is a small souvenir shop in the main building where you can purchase show pieces and books as well.4. A Tea/Coffee stall is also available near the Parking bay.5. Photography is allowed inside the main building.6. Public Convenience is also available inside the main building."

National_Gandhi_Museum,Wendy w,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A national Museum,This house is quite small for large bus loads of people to go through. Situated in a quiet neighbourhood I actually feel sorry for the people living around here to have so many bus loads of people invading their street. Mahatma Gandhi is very well respected by Indians hence this museum showing different photos & memorabilia of his life. Because of the amount of people climbing up 3 levels of this house combined with extreme heat I didn‚Äôt really enjoy this museum.
National_Gandhi_Museum,Gala2812,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,The good learning experience,"Nice museum in the quite governmental quarters. The area is well-maintained and neat. The museum tells about Mahatma Ghandi, his life and beliefs. There's an intercative part on the second floor that would be a fun place to go, especially for kids. It shows Ghandi's ideas in a simple but impressive manner as well as gives introduction to the cultural background. On the first floor there's a hall to watch a movie about his life. The house is pretty big but Ghandi was said to occupy just one room and you can see his everyday life was very simple. The garden around includes some nice landscapes and the spot where he was shot during the public meditation by one of his former friends. And yes, he's got to say the words of forgiveness to the shooter. I would say its a great place to visit in Delhi to get closer to the modern history India and life of one of the most outstanding humanists of the world."

Once inside there is lots to take in. Displays are set out clearly written in Hindi and English. Spinning history and politics found  in ‚ÄòThe Spinning Gallery‚Äô, ‚ÄòCharka‚Äô, caught my attention.

National_Gandhi_Museum,DonnamjCan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Interesting ,"Popped in here for a 1 hour visit and was able to see the highlights. There is a lot to see if you are interested in the life and teachings of Gandhi and want to see pictures etc of his childhood, some of his talks, where he last walked, where he was assassinated. If you want to take the time to read everything than you need a couple of hours. For us an hour was more than enough as the pictures are quite repetitive. There is a fairly large states re on site that sells cloth (clothing etc). This is a typical museum site and has a lot to read and many pictures to look at. Not great for young kids. "

National_Gandhi_Museum,Fazul M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Life of a Man,"I have come across the great man named Gandhiji where the term Ji denotes respect. Most of my reading largely centred around the independence of India. The museum was really an eye opener as his single mindedness actually begun in South Africa and later on his return to India that moved up multiple notches until the day he died; shot by a fundamentalist. The museum takes you back to his formative years, his way of life, legacy and most of all what he stood for. Most impressive that makes us look like less than mere mortals."

Visiting the site where Gandhi spent the last 144 days of his life and to read his sayings alongside historical photos was the most moving experience of our tour of Delhi and Shimla. At this beautifully maintained and such peaceful centre, we spent two hours studying the simple belongings of a humble leader and watched a truly moving video recalling the manner of his passing on 30th January 1948, before retracing his last steps in the garden. Highly recommended place to visit when in New Delhi."

I don‚Äôt think I jumped any queue or missed something but was ushered through the gates like others by a uniform guard and had the usual security check. The main building was very busy when I was there and there is a lot to read and look at. The garden area was pleasant enough but there was only the gift shop after. This was not on my main tour so relied on my own day trip using the Tuk Tuk taxi. Great fun and pretty cheap if you can do a deal with a drive for a number of hours.

I ended up spending about 3 hours there (I'm one of those people who likes to read all the wall text at a museum). There is so much to learn about this inspiring man and I left saddened about his ultimate assassination but uplifted by his amazing outlook on life and how he actually walked the walk instead of just talking the talk. I found the statues and the replica of one of his ashrams in the garden equally compelling.

His resting place is across the street and his residence is elsewhere.  This is on older building dedicated to his work and has the March Statue and model of the house he lived in out back.  There is a lot of information of his work and life here.  It's a great building in itself.  No fee and they wouldn't take a donation ( many places wouldn't). 1 hr is probably enough time.

I always knew him to have been a great man, but digesting the simple, but powerful, exhibition of his thoughts and deeds was a truly moving experience that reinforced many beliefs that I hold dear. Sadly, modern day society is distinctly at odds with the enlightened teachings of Gandhi.Perhaps the best investment of time that I've ever made."

National_Gandhi_Museum,Geoff F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Wonderful. One of the best museums,"In may cities, there are places that are essential. The Gandhi Museum is one. It is not large, but clearly lays out the main elements of the man and his life and can take at least two hours to follow completely.What comes across is the beautiful serenity and simplicity of one of the great men of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century in complex situations. He saw through the political chicanery and just said what was right and just. He may have had some impractical ideas, but the beauty of the man shines clearly through the whole of the museum. It can reduce grown men and women to tears."
