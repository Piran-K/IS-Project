National_Museum,Tushita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,A must visit place for Delhi Trip,"It is the largest museum in India and is considered as the hub of Indian art, culture and history. It has over 200,000 exhibits including sculptures, manuscripts, paintings, and other artifacts that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization."
National_Museum,Shubham Mishra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,History comes alive at this place.,"The best place to visit and experience the history of many civilizations and how they got advanced as time passed by. If you are a history junkie, this experience can be intoxicating for you."
National_Museum,Sudesh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Good place to learn history ,This is a good place to visit that you learn about. Spend more time than you can gain more. You need half a day minimum if you need to explore all. 
National_Museum,Madhulika L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Very impressive collection,"The National Museum spreads out over two floors of the massive National Museum building near India Gate. You enter from Gate No. 3; just before you enter, there’s the ticket counter (charges are Rs 20 per adult for Indians, Rs 500 for foreigners; no camera fee is charged for private photography, though a flash is not allowed). Past security, you turn left and go towards the main museum. On the way, a path leads towards a relatively recently inaugurated annex which includes, among other facilities, a cafeteria and a souvenir shop.Free guided tours begin from the main foyer of the museum, on the ground floor, at fixed times, and are regularly announced. On our latest visit to the museum, in May 2022, we only wanted to visit two special exhibitions, so we skipped this tour, but if you have limited time and only want to see the highlights of the collection, this is probably a good option. The museum has many galleries spread over two floors. There is lots of truly breathtaking stone sculpture, in particular, that I have always admired, from ancient and medieval India. Harappa, the Gupta Empire, the Mughal Empire, the great Southern kingdoms of the Chalukyas, Cholas, Vijayanagar, etc: all are represented, and many more, with artefacts of many different kinds. There’s plenty of painting, everyday goods, furniture, clothing, and other objects from all eras of India’s history. There are also some fine collections from overseas, including East Asia, and a recently inaugurated Central Asia gallery.In addition, the Museum holds frequent special exhibitions, which are invariably carefully curated and worth seeing. The ones we saw in May were an exhibition on Kashi, and a fabulous one, comprising of some 200 paintings, of Company Art.The museum building has toilets on every floor, drinking water, benches at strategic locations, and—a big draw with the kiddies—little DIY stations in the main corridor, beside the windows, where you can do everything from making paper necklaces (like the ones shown on famous old stone statues, materials and instructions provided) to colouring illustrations of museum exhibits. Our eight-year old had a lot of fun making a necklace. Beyond that, there’s also a little post box, with postcards provided that you can write to yourself and slip into the post box to send.All in all, a very good introduction to India’s history and heritage. I do wish they hadn’t gone overboard in some places with the electronics; in the foyer and around, for instance, some wonderful statues have been pretty much obscured with obtrusive electronics displays in front of them. If you live in or around Delhi and can visit the Museum frequently, I’d recommend exploring this over several visits. There’s so much to see, doing more than (say) three galleries at a go can make it too much to absorb at one time."
National_Museum,hiren1974,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Excellent Heritage,Awesome history of india . very good relics collection . There are couple of issues though . We went on a sunday & as per google & print on the ticket the museum needs to be open till 8PM but they just pushed us out at 6PM . how much ever we proved the people were not ready to listen . on complaining they said complain the the manager but the said gent was not available  & monday being holiday we could not . There are a lot of great stone sculptures outside & the sorry state of affairs is there are monkeys seated on them & peeing on them. Is this is the way our country is taking care of our heritage & that too in the national capital.
National_Museum,Rush401,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 • Solo,National museum ,This is our national museum! Was disappointed. Many halls were closed!like the buddha exhibit. Gems exhibit..the authorities should step up and improve and add more exhibits. We have such a rich history and heritage. Yet we do not display and show to the public..
National_Museum,Malik,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Solo,"Pathetic museum, nothing really to see.","Not worth visiting the place. Ome of the worst museum I've ever visited. Presumably, the British stole everything and they have nothing to display. It has a bunch of clay bows, coins and plenty of statutes of, I guess, their deities in all forms and out of all kinds of materials.There were only a couple of visitors besides me."
National_Museum,ytlouise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2020 • Friends,Relics from an ancient civilisation ,"Set up in 1949, this National Museum houses over 2 million artefacts from the ancient civilisation. On display are the Relics of the Buddha (5th to 4th BCE), unearthed in Uttar Pradesh. Outstanding specimens of Buddhist Art, illustrated through almost 100 exhibits in stone, bronze, terracotta, stucco and painted scrolls. The artefacts represent Buddhist arts of Nepal, Tibet, Central Asia, Myanmar, Java and Cambodia. Many of these relics stimulate a sense of devotion, dedication and love for humanity. I am eternally blessed to have personally seen the beautiful Buddhist Art in New Delhi. I remain deeply humbled by the teachings of Gautama Buddha. "
National_Museum,A Choudhury,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Solo,Must Visit Place,"It has a huge collection of sculptors, coins, paintings, etc right from Indus Valley Civilization to modern history of India nicely distributed among different galleries. For someone who is interested in the history and culture of India, this is a must visit place. At least 3 - 4 hours are required to go through all the sections."
National_Museum,archit,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,"Maybe it's interest dependent, but frankly I found the curation quite lacking","I've been to a few museums around the world, Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands being my favorite so far. The National Museum of Delhi was on my list for some time and spent a Saturday here with a friend, its quite covid safe and fairly empty. So was, in my humble opinion, the heart in it.Why this Museum needs an overhaul 1:I love museums because they put you in the middle of a world, it can be imaginative, inspiring. The National museum of Delhi felt like it was me in a lot of rooms, rummaging through artefacts.Excavations of pots, pillars, sculptures since 5000 BC arranged as a disconnected set of artefacts across about 12 departments.Why this Museum needs an overhaul 2:We are thriving in the 21st century between technology and connectivity. The biggest Museum in Delhi deserves a good medium for audio guides - they immensely compliment the experience and are barely any expense or effort to provide consistently. If you do it like I did - you might end up toggling Youtube and the HopOn India App QR codes which are sporadically placed and usually unrelated to each other.I wish I could contribute in some way to improve India's biggest Museum"
National_Museum,SRKTB,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,largest museum,"Situated on Janpath, includes varieties of arts and crafts, you can find 2 lakhs objects both indian & foreign"
National_Museum,JoyBose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Solo,One of the best museums in India with several sections,"This is one of the best equipped museums in India. Opened recently after covid lockdown. It has several sections on 3 floors. On the ground floor is the harappa civilization section, with lots of pottery, ornaments and other artifacts. There is the sculptures section from maurya, Gupta, kushana and other dynasties. There is an amazing bronzes section showcasing South Indian, Jain, Buddhist and other bronzes. There is a breathtaking section on ivory, one on Buddhist arts, one on miniature paintings. There is even one section for bling people, where they can touch and feel the exhibits and read in Braille.First floor and second floor have more sections, such as maritime museum, ajanta arts, Mysore art, coins, history of Indian script, north eastern culture, musical instruments. There are other sections too, some of which are currently in renovation and will be opened soon. Outside the main building, there are exhibitors related to ashoka dharma sermons, one traditional  temple cart and so on. Entry is rupees 20 for Indians. Lots of renovation work still going on. There is a mobile app to guide through the museum. There are toilets on each floor and also a canteen. It's a must see for whoever is interested in Indian history and culture."
National_Museum,Dharmesh Mistry,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,National museum Delhi,We planned this family trip with my family on a Sunday morning .We reached this place by Delhi metro . The nearest metro station is Central Secretariat. Museum opening timing is 10:00am and it closes at 6:00pm. The entry fee for the Indians was INR 20/-. They also provide audio guide for INR 150/-. Displayed  artifacts were beautiful and interesting because there is also a short description about the article or an idol.
National_Museum,KJain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Loved it!,"Being a museum lover and sucker of history, and India which is so culturally rich and has centuries of history, this is the place I always wanted to see and recall history classes. Statues, paintings, jewelry, architecture, and many more things from different eras in our nation. Love it!!"
National_Museum,Abhishek Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Wonderful place,"This place has some wonderful things of the past.Collections include artifacts,coins,swords,jewellery,manuscripts costumesand many more.There are some exhibitions.You need a full day to visit and see all articles in details."
National_Museum,PBlyth,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Small and Poorly Maintained Mueum,For a national museum this was disappointing as it is poorly maintained and staffed with minimal exhibits although it does have some items of interest. Do not expect anything on the order of the British Museum or the Prada or the Louvre. There is one room where there are models of some of the more interesting temples/buildings to be found in India. Does have clean bathrooms.
National_Museum,Alan B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Interesting but old fashioned museum,"The museum has a very interesting collection.  The section on ancient civilisations in North West India was of particular interest to us.  Some galleries were closed for refurbishment when we were there but that didn't spoil our enjoyment.  It is a relatively old fashioned museum and I don't think most children would find much to engage them.  All written descriptions are in (I assume) Hindi and English so if you are English speaking it is fine.  A good audio guide was available wihthin the ticket price and I think was in rather more languages.  The entry is expensive by Indian standards, but moderate by european standards.We got the cheapest meal of our whole trip in the cafeteria.  The food was good and tasty, but think slightly scruffy transport cafe in England not smart bistro and you will be fine."
National_Museum,Iamnewhere,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,"Interesting Museum - a bit run down, needs restoration","very expensive for foreigners but nice collectionsvery, very bad and dirty smelly toilets - avoid them !!!!!the museum is partialy closed and needs urgent renovation"
National_Museum,AstroBloke,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"Wonderful collection, building needs some TLC...","This museum contains some wonderful exhibits highlighting India's cultural and archaeological heritage.  But the building itself needs some TLC and is poorly organised and signposted.  The audio guide is very helpful although it does tend to blather on at times.Note that westerners are charged significantly more than locals to enter, which we found to be not uncommon in India.I hate to mention this, but the toilets are a disgrace - squat toilets only, and no toilet paper provided.  It's really not good enough in a national museum."
National_Museum,AZCasualTraveler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Nice Museum Exhibiting Many Art and Ancient Artifacts,"The National Museum of India is a fairly large building with three (3) levels:  ground floor, first floor and second floor.  The Museum has a large variety of different types of displays:  Archeology, Anthropology, Arms and Armor, Asian Antiquities, Art, Jewelry, etc.  A visit to the National Museum helps to give us some insight to the culture and history behind this country of India."
National_Museum,Liz-SD,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Poorly maintained with half of the galleries closed,"The audio guide is good, but it covers only half of what is on display. Some great sculptures but not well displayed."
National_Museum,RicherTrips,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Deserves more visitors,"Most of the organized tours don´t include a visit to this Museum, wich is a shame. The building may need a renovation, but the collections are incredible, covering 5 thousand years of History. At the entrance you can get the audioguide and go to your own pace. It´s a pitty the jewelry collection was closed at the time, but the many sculptures, paintings, ivories and coins are good for a 3 hours visit.Photographs are allowed, but the glasses reflect so much it´s difficult to get a clear picture."
National_Museum,Bela,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Closed today,Disappointed as it was closed in d second half of d day due to 26 jan Had really hoped to c too many exhibits but...There Is always next time
National_Museum,scs-953,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Needs to make it world class ,"Visited the National Museum after 15 years. Nothing much has changed. They have new toilets. ! The collection of antiques and Arti Facts certainly deserve better display. The audio guide , is a welcome addition. They need to provide a guide Map along with the tickets. And high lights unique collections on display. We can learn a lot from other museums in the region. The Mysore and Tanjore collection is worth visiting. Only wish they would use non reflective museum glass to display paintings. "
National_Museum,abrahamsuji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Magnificent collection,Easy access by public transport. Archeological treasure of India is displayed in the place. Must visit. 
National_Museum,macedonboy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"Some great sections, some unworthy of national status","I thought the National Museum was a bit of a mixed bag. The entrance fee is okay by European standards, but by Indian standard it’s really expensive. The entrance come with an audio guide. Some of the commentary were very good, while other bits were ridiculously repetitive and the same could be said for the exhibits. Some of the sections were excellent, while other parts were distinctly average. The stone and bronze sculpture sections, miniature paintings, the Mauryan and Gupta sections were all very good with equally good commentary in the audio guides. The special exhibition on Chinese religious artifacts was exceptional and leads the way in what the museum could do. The rest of the museum was very average or closed. As an example, the Ajanta section was nothing more than reproduction photocopies of the paintings from the famous cave temples.Overall I enjoyed the visit, but I had to minus one star for some of the sections that in my humble opinion are unworthy of being in a national museum."
National_Museum,Joe,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Oh dear,"If this museum had been in a small provincial city, I would have been kinder in my review, but this is India's national museum, and as such it's embarrassingly poor. Very little to engage us, and badly displayed. All a bit too dingy. Money is always going to be an issue in India - I do appreciate that - but if you want tourists to come and see what you have to offer, you really need to do better than this in the capital city. No wonder there are so few tourists here! Send your curators to the superb museum down in Pune, and get them to bring back some fresh ideas."
National_Museum,"DGK, UK",3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,For a national museum not very exciting!,"Unfortunately for a national museum of a country such as India much to be desired. The display of the artefacts is not always clear and logical and their presentation that of the 19th and not of the 21st century. Ticket price for foreigners is high but the ticket office charged our credit cards, after requesting, the correct exchange rate. The museum does not allow any small bags in, and these had to stored at an outside shed which is not well signed to visitors. The Cafeteria is outside again in another shed, used primarily by staff, but the museum guards allow you in and out. A kindly man served us a nice coffee in which we paid only 30 rupees each. We spent at least a couple of hours there."
National_Museum,Sunil,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,National museum ,The national museum is quite huge and it has a good collection of art and handicrafts architecture and can find ancient sculptures. It's a good place to get knowledge on the sculpture 
National_Museum,Indiana_Jonesse,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Large and Incredible,"Truly incredible. Most of their exhibits on the first and second floor are sculptures that are ancient with different gods, stories and the dates. On the upper level is more paintings. The place is really large and their collection is very impressive. It is worth a visit. The admission fee for foreigner is 650 rupees. "
National_Museum,Sue M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,"Don""t waste your money and time!","I'm not a museum buff but, my god, it was boring.  Not cheap at £7+ and half if it is closed.  Only worth it if you like paintings and coins!  Sooo disappointed.  "
National_Museum,Christopher H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,Time stands still in this pathologically dusty establishment,"After spending 1000 years in one of the rooms I began to feel like a piece of the exhibition myself, dishevelled and neglected. I just wanted to kill some time before my flight, but left wanting to kill myself. However, did see a painting of people collecting and cooking cow poo in a pan."
National_Museum,sagrawal99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,A tour to cultural and heritage of India,"This is a place every Indian must visit.National Museum ,New Delhi.An amazing experience.Established in 1949,this beautiful airconditioned building has museum,with several galleries as well as a conservation laboratory.The museum has more than 2 Lacs art objects representing 5000 years of Indian art and craftsmanship.What a collection!!I have seen so many museums worldwide,and I can say,its one of the best!!3800 objects of Harappan civilization were eye opener!!Pottery,seals,jewellery,tools and a complete grave with a female skeleton wearing bangles from Mohenjodaro exvacation sites were stunning!Rare sculptures from 3 rd century BC,Statues from oldest temples of India ,which we never knew to exist,Rare Ganga and Jamuna statues from 2 nd century BC,which adorned the gates of a Bihar temple.Our learned guide took us to every antiquity with great minute details.The rare thrilling attraction were the Relics of Gautam Buddha(5 th-4 th Century BCE)unearthed from Kapilwastu-Piprahwa,(UP),A portion of the gate of Saanchi stupa,Images of Buddha’s footprint!!Another section which immensely attracted me was of Indian Miniature paintings.Around 17000 paintings from the period 1000 CE to 1900 CE are housed there.Manuscripts of Shahnama and Baburnama are there.Where else can you find live portraits of Miya Tansen,Jehangir and Shahjehan!!Worth visiting!Not to be missed!!Take guided tours which happens after every 2  hours."

It contains many interesting artefacts and information about the early civilization of India. But do note that the entrance fees is not cheap at INR650, almost USD10. Still it is worth a visit if you are a history buff."
National_Museum,Katie C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Nice Visit,"This is a great place to come to escape the heat and take in a bit of Indian history.  Unfortunately a number of the galleries were closed during our visit, but the galleries we did see were lovely and full of interesting artifacts.  The gift shop had a great selection as well.  Well worth a stop during your tour of Delhi."
National_Museum,Dr. Richa Malhotra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Business, A great place to behold Indian Cultural Continuity and Change   ,"A great place intellectual, educative and entertaining place   to interact with Indian culture.It showcases the richness of Indian diversity and unity since the prehistoric times. It has huge archaeoligical, art, sculpture, painting, coins and manuscript collections. The most amazing is the Harrapan / Indus valley collection - a bucket list item.Mughal miniature painting section simply is mesmerizing. For The collection here can boast of having 2,00,000 and above artifacts  in this museum. Though it appears  history but actually it is heritage - the legacy of untiring human endevour  & relentless resilience.  I will come here again............"

Totally worth going to.  The diamonds are amazing, not to mention the emeralds and safires.  But it is the diamonds tat take your breath away.  The main exhibitions are excellent as well.  Not too crowded, easy to et around and well organized and marked.  I liked the Harrapan part best ..."
National_Museum,TheFlipView,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Decent place to spend 3-4 hours,"The place show cases artifacts from various states and cultures within India, where one can easily spend 3-4 hours. The place is well maintained and a must-visit in Delhi, especially if you have children between 8-14 years as it has articles from various eras, including the Indus Valley civilization. It can be further improved and made more interesting with better labeling, an audio-visual guide and better eating options. Also, some sections seem to be closed as work was going on."
National_Museum,Mark A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Good museum in need of repairs,"Some of the exhibits in this museum are very impressive.  However, I cant help but feel that the exhibits are let down by the poor maintenance of the building.  There are broken exhibition cases in many rooms.  Poor signage and a staff who are pretty indifferent to their work.  Its a shame, this country has so much art and history, and this museum fails to exhibit in a good light.  I can only hope that with India's booming economy, they can find the resources to fix the problems of this museum."
National_Museum,Aline Hirano,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Nice visit,"As usual in main attractions in India, the fee was pricey for tourists (650 rupees), but worth it. The facilities are nice and clean and the ehxibition was large, really didatic and there's audio guides in many languages."
National_Museum,Lawyer/Exporter,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Jewels! ,"We went to visit the Jewellery Gallery which was replaced by a special exhibition of the Nizam's Jewellery collection. It is absolutely astonishing with huge diamonds , rubies and sapphires surrounded by not so huge ones and made into beautiful jewellery. There were not many people there and you can easily see all the pieces in your allotted 30 mins or so. If this was anywhere else in the world, queues would be around the block. If you are in Delhi before the 5th May, then go. I understand the usual  collection is wonderful too"
National_Museum,susanwalsh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,It needs work,This museumopened in the 50s is rather gloomy. There is a good collection of sculptures.

The jewellery collection is absolutely stunning and the famous ""Jacob Diamond"" worth 100 million pounds is something that will surely gonna take your breaths away. Other jewelleries of rubies, pearls, diamonds and gold will make your jaw drop. So National museum is a must visit if you are in town during this period to witness the annual display of Nizam's Jewels.This is also a great hub for those who are interested in ancient history. Artefacts of Indus Valley Civilisation which are as old as 3700 BCE are also on display. There is a lot to explore in this MuseumImportant Infos:1. The entry fee for Indian Adults is INR 20 and an extra of INR 50 to witness Nizam's Jewels. For Foreign Tourist fee is INR 650.2. Park your car in designated parking only as it is a tow away zone.3.

National_Museum,bjerkseth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Incredible india,"Every time, usually once a year I am in India, and I make an effort to visit the National Museum. The artifacts are in thousands, from the Harappa Period 5,000 years ago, to the Raj when British ruled. The museum is really nicely renovated, and has a very good electronic guiding system. There is Hindu artifacts, and Buddhist, even a Buddha relic, which is adored by Buddhist visitors. What impressed me most at this trip was the new Jewelry Section. It makes the riches collections elsewhere in the world look like cheap baubles. Cabinet after cabinet with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and pearls. The sizes are incredible, hundreds of carat diamonds, and don’t start me on the emeralds. For any jewelry interested, a visit here is a must. I was simply stunned, and was thinking Incredible India.

National_Museum,Aethelred,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Go see the Nizam's jewels as long as they are on display!,"and it is interesting that this is the official title - ""The Nizam's Jewels"" indeed, so how come the Government of India has them now?  Much can be said about the drawbacks of the Princely States, and much is, but that Hyderabad under the last Nizam was better administered than during much of the later decades cannot be in doubt.That said, here is one of the rare chances not only to see the famous Jacobs Diamond and up close (I think it's way better than the Koh-i-noor), as well as the rest of the jewels, including the best emerald collection in the world.  In fact, one gets so close that one wonders whether at least the Jacobs is not real - security is good (and friendly, as was said) but is it tight enough for THIS?  When we were there, there were no lines, nor timed exhibition admittance - cloakroom, museum entrance, vault entrance, all worked right away.  Amazing!  Anywhere else, this would be a major draw.  Beautiful, beautiful - do go!"

National_Museum,2012sunilmumbai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,The Nizam’s Jewels exhibition. An unbelievable awesome sight. ,"We went to see this unique exhibition which is on until 05 May. One pays extra for the exhibition entry. Extremely tight but polite security staff; unlike what you experience abroad with those intimidating types. They are helpful. A guide is available if required. There are a set of panels with detailed explanations on  the origin and photos of the Nizams, the jewellery worn in those days by men and women, and also how they are made. Take time out to read each panel. In the vault strong room, the jewels are exhibited. Excellent display of each piece. There are captions alongside. Above the display are select photographs of the royal family wearing various jewellery items. Theoretically, we can stay only 30 minutes per person. The centrepiece is the famous Jacob’s diamond displayed on a rotating base. Photography is permitted without flash. No videos. No handbags are allowed, if you take it, you will have to exit upto main gate where there is a deposit locker area. This is an exhibition which you must not miss if you like jewellery, history,  and heritage. Study carefully the craftsmanship of each piece and how they sparkle as you move. Unforgettable. Unbelievable. "

National_Museum,gauth333,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Awesome collection....,One of the best museums in India. Entry costs are nominal. They have an audio guide which costs Rs 150 and it is worth taking this guide. The museum has a huge collection of remains from Indus valley civilization. Further they also have stuff from almost all the dynasties that have ruled the sub continent. Guess it would be a great place to gain knowledge for people studying Indian history. For art lovers this place boasts of exhibiting a largest collection of miniature paintings in the world. For people interested in Indian languages they have compiled and laid out the roots and branches of almost all letters of the main languages spoken in India. This place was under renovation when we visited hence the armoury was closed else we were told that they have the swords of some of the kings who ruled the sub continent states. It takes about 3 hrs to rush through the collection.

Irrelevant prices for foreigner tickets RS 650 against RS 20 for Indians. Zero value. Wastage of time. Will not recommend any foreigner to visit"
National_Museum,kkraus,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,"Enjoyed wandering, wish more exhibits were open","There were displays of art, coins, and sculpture from early Indian history, of which I knew little. Many of the exhibits, however, were closed for renovations. Some galleries were very tired. I also would have liked more explanations of the historical setting from which the pieces came.The fabrics exhibit showing woven saris had gorgeous pieces."
National_Museum,NikaJunie,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Lovely Indian Art,"Founded in 1949, the National Museum now contains over 2,000,000 artifacts, mostly pertaining to Indian art, archaeology, and history, although there are pre-Columbian and central Asian artifacts as well. There is a conservation lab and small bookstore where you will find publications not otherwise available. Because some displays are currently being redone, a few galleries will be closed."

Is has almost all the things from all the periods that you might have learnt in history.It has coins of most of the periods. It has the famous dancing girl of Harrapa, which we mostly saw in our textbooks, various miniature painting are alse present. Various Indian scripts are also present. The place is definitely worth giving a visit. It's open on all days of the week except Mondays. The nearest metro stations are Udyog Bhawan and Central Secretariat."
National_Museum,xlne,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Not what I was looking for in a National Museum,"This review is difficult to write.. because while the museum is indeed very well set up and would undoubtedly be an enjoyable experience for art and relic lovers, I did not find it interesting at all as I didn’t expect the National Museum to be just another art museum. In the capital of the country, bearing the title of National Museum, I would expect it to expound on the growth of a nation. I would expect it to detail how everyday life changes from the early days of the land to the advent of the British to achieving independence, not to mention everything in between like Ghandi, The Partition, etc. I’ve visited museums all over the world and have always enjoyed their stories of nation-building. Thus, I find it strange that I am unable locate a single museum in India that share its progress from the past to the present, and I cannot believe that I am the only person who is frustrated by this void. Why is one of the oldest civilizations in the world not telling their story?"
National_Museum,2torontotraveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Not What I Expected,We spent about 2 hours in this museum.  This museum was not what I expected.  I had thought that it would be a history museum.  Instead it is really an art museum.  The art also doesn't appear to be in any order so I couldn't get sense of development.The art is also presented in old fashioned ways such as glass cases or on stands up against the wall.  As a foreigner I had to pay 650 rs to get into this museum.  The good news was I could pay using my Visa so I could conserve my cash.  It did come with an audio guide which did help somewhat.  The museum is very popular with school groups and there are resources that explain the art pieces to the children.  The part that I enjoyed the most was the circular  garden in the center of the museum.This museum did not give me the background I so wanted to better understand the sites I had seen around Delhi.  Hence my disappointment.  You would be better looking at these sites with a licensed tour guide.From the outside the museum appears to better than what it delivers.  The outside of the building is attractive with a huge ancient cart and nice fountain.  However I would spend my money looking at the actual historical sites that are in Delhi instead of this museum.
National_Museum,Passport38568801960,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Very nice collection,"It's not a very big museum but has wonderful collection of artefacts. We loved some of the objects a lot. Indus gallery is great. We never saw such a vast collection of miniatures ever anywhere else. It's on a main road so very easily accessible. One can walk to many other different places from this museum like art galleries, India Gate etc. Worth to visit."
National_Museum,Rajesh Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,The art of time travel within hours,"It has just been 38 years between my visits to this building but lot of add-ons since then in terms of weight, height, grey hair :) But this is a place where time has literally stood still.In just a building is showcased the work of thousands and thousands of artisans who strived over centuries to create masterpieces that now speak volume to us about the rich and illustrious past of India. Each artefact has a story to tell. A tale to narrate. A journey to showcase. This is one place where you shall find the gems from the Indus Valley civilization times right down to this centuries known creations.In the Indus Valley section, the bronze statue of the dancing girl and seals gave me goose bumps as they took me back to the times when I was seated on the wooden bench at school gazing at the images of these very displays in my history book. It was as if time had stood still.The maximum time I spent was in my tryst with the Nataraj statue. The more you stare at it, the more it communicates to you and the more you discover newer subtleties in it. How the creators thought of those sublime purities and how intricately they could create such perfection.This is a place which is a 'MUST VISIT' for all kids, big and small. If you are a student of life (which we all are), this place beckons you. Come, learn, spread the learning.They have an interesting audio guide available at the reception. This enables you to understand the artifacts in more detail as the narrator takes you back to the very time they were created and showers you with information to soak in.During our visit, strangely the Mughal era floor was closed for renovation. That was a big loss for the kids. I remember seeing great displays there 38 years back. Maybe next time.   It would great to see an initiative wherein the visitors can be asked to participate in a quiz where good prizes can be doled out. This will ensure better retention of the wealth of information there. And maybe a 'Treasure Hunt' for the visiting school groups could be a great idea. All these can be doled out to private operators to run but will go a long way in spreading the richness this building holds.Come over, fasten your seat belts and start on a fantastic journey back into time."

National_Museum,MrWil_low,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Disappointing - and what a shame,"To start the good bit is that there is some stunning stuff in here from the famous dancing girl bronze from Mohenjo-Daro (which I have wanted to see since I was at school) through to beautiful sculptures and paintings.  This stuff is world class.  The sad bit is that the museum so lets down its exhibits.You begin with a discriminatory entrance fee for foreign nationals - although this does come with a complementary, if cursory, Walkman commentary.  There are some free guided tours too and these might be a better bet.  Either way you will need something to get any value out of your visit as the captioning and interpretation are minimal and often limited to what an artefact is, how old it is and where it was dug up.  There seem to be a lot of staff, and not just guards, but what they've been doing since 1949, is a mystery.There is a well-concealed shop.If you like Indian art and archaeology and are willing to persevere with the Walkman this is a worthwhile hour or so.  I wouldn't go with children as they will be bored rigid by the deadpan ""cabinets of stuff"" approach."

Established in 1949, it is one of the largest museums in India, managed and governed by Ministry of Culture, India. One would require two-three visits to see and comprehend the entire set of exhibits if interested in Indian history and cultural legacy. Admissions are open between 10 AM till 6 PM on all days except Mondays (weekly off) and on national holidays.The lighting, display windows/shelves have been improved over the years, and now give a modern feel. There are well maintained washrooms on each floor, and a souvenir shop on the second floor. Ticket rates are minimal and there is hardly any queue- which reflects waning interest of masses in such an intellectual activity. The exhibits can summarized as- Coins, Vedic Scriptures, Architectural/Art Pieces and variety of articles ranging from pre-historic era to modern works of art. It is a must see attraction."

National_Museum,Cyril1979,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Comprehensive museum,"The museum is large, quite rich and informative. Most of all I liked the Gandhara sculpture hall and the exhibits of the Mughal epoch. However, at the exit a security officer scans you - searching for stolen exhibits. I would call it not caution, but paranoia. The administration of the museum is evidently guided by the presumption of visitors' guilt. I never met with such rudeness at any of the museums across the world, be it London, Paris, Moscow or Singapore."

Every room has stunning pieces from the long and varied history of the places that make up modern India. Exquisite statues, fine cavings, breath-taling jewellry. These will not disappoint.Everything is helpfully labelled. We took the audio tour too, which added a little to our understanding of what we were seeing.There:s no story here, though, no coherent connections between the pieces that tell a story of India and/or its peoples. This is an art gallery with a historical perspective. Also conspicuous by its absence was acknowledgment of Islamic art in India:s artistic history.Not to be missed."
National_Museum,fromagebleu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Best museum in India. Don't miss this.GIve yourself at least 2 hours.,"This was a surprising highlight of our Indian travels. A modern museum with so much to see, well displayed in clean, well kept rooms. We didn't leave enough time for it all so had to hurry through the last bits which was disappointing as the exhibits just got better and more interesting as we moved through. The audio guide was excellent though sometimes the numbers were a bit hard to find. An absolute favourite was the jewellery section - OMG - if you're a fan of some fabulous rocks, make sure you leave time for this amazing display. Then there's the Buddhist art, the miniature paintings, the ceramics... .so much to see and every single piece is worth a look. If I ever get back to Delhi, I'm coming back here!"
National_Museum,TIGGERALA,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Great collection,"I love museums and the collection at the National Museum was fabulous and eclectic.  Collections include Harrapan Civilization, Buddhist Art, Indian Miniature Paintings, Coins and Scripts, Decorative Arts, Jewels, Central Asian Antiquities, and others.  A few of the galleries are closed for renovation.  Sadly, like many museums in India, there is a great need for repair and preservation of their collections.  The showcases lights are full of bugs, the “silk” is moldy or dirty, there are pieces which have fallen over on their pedestals, lighting is sporadic - some areas half of the bulbs need replaced.  The air conditioner and fans work in some areas, not in others.  At one point, there were workers pounding on a wall taking out the doorway, they placed a sack over a 7th century statue...cement and mortar flying all over.  Many of the miniatures are placed in frames on the wall - these look as if they could fall easily.  We loved the collections, the site needs a bit more work and loving attention.  The entrance fee here is 650 rupees which included a guided 90 minute audio device - you have to deposit photo id at the counter.  The auditorium was in use for the several schools who were there."

From the moment I stepped inside, I was blown away by the extent and the beauty of the collections.  Like most of India, the number of ancient artifacts was overwhelming.  Every room was filled with so much that was impressive. After some point, I just couldn't process it anymore.  Most of it is very well displayed, some exquisitely so.

The layout of the museum isn't always easy to follow and some areas were under construction.  Very few pieces were behind glass, so it was great to get up close to the pieces and have a really good look.  At the end there is a section of exhibits you can touch and we thought this a great idea for children and adults a like to feel just how great these crafts men and women were at their job."
National_Museum,Prowander,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,Interesting museum ,Good collection and worth a visit.  Layout is not the best with construction going on in many parts of the property.   Seems like the concept of finishing a project before starting three new projects wasn’t considered as a possible option.  Cafe at the museum is a complete dumb.  Definitely not even close to international standards for similar types of museums.

The museum does a great job of explaining specific eras in the history of the Indian subcontinent. Some of the exhibits date back to 2000BC. Easily some of the oldest artefacts I have seen. Sure there are far larger and better museums but I could easily spend 4 hours in this one. The carvings and statues and the rich history associated with them could be explained better. But if you have the audio guide with you, you will learn plenty. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this one and don't mind going back."

In our opinion some of the ground floor rooms with the classical stone sculptures are among the finest and the offer on second and ,even more,  first floor are less interesting. In any case the museography is very dated and the information relatively limited but this remains anyway an interesting stop."
