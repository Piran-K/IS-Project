National_Rail_Museum,PANDEY JI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Noice!,"You always feel like a child when visiting a Museum.The museum is well kept with hundred of exhibits inside the museum building and dozens of railway coaches, engines and other rail related equipment on display.You can buy tickets for toy train, joy train and a diesel engine simulator.You can easily cover the museum in 3 hours."
National_Rail_Museum,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,On track for an interesting time.,"THIS quirky site has quite a bit going on from a museum and loads of trains and rolling stock to a chance to rattle round on a little track yourself.Don't make the mistake I did which was to pay for my 50 rupee (55 pence) entry ticket and walk all the way inside only to find that I needed a separate ticket for the little ""Joy Train"". I had to walk all the way back, get a 20 rupee ticket for that and then walk back again to the trains.There are any number of locomotives and carriages to look at as well as unusual things such as special vans to carry animals such as sheep,I'd happily come to the museum by tuk tuk which is so easy to do once you've calmed your nerves about going through Delhi traffic.Wandering about I found the first locomotive to be built in India and station clocks made in London as well as a turntable area.Inside the museum there were some incredible early black and white photographs of trains in action and a display of dozens and dozens of railway plates and badges.Maps showing visitors the site, what they can see and where it is were very handy because the area to explore is a long oblong and stretches away a lot further than you'd think.There is a souvenir shop which could do with a wider range of things to buy, a cafe, toilets, water points, an archive and an auditorium in what is a very well run site.I happily spent a couple of hours there and would definitely recommend anyone in Delhi to pay this museum a visit."
National_Rail_Museum,Sangram Mohite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,A must visit for Rail Enthusiast,"National Rail Musuem, New DelhiA must visit for Rail enthusiast and for kids who want to explore the history of Railways. Located at Chanakyapuri are, besides the Embassy of Bhutan, there is ample parking space. Entry fee is Rs 50 from M-F & Rs 100 on Sat-Sun.Souvenir shop was below expectations and there was hardly anything which one would like to buy. Rail Musuem covers the History of Railways from beginning to British India and present .Exhibits in the premises are well maintained and informative"

All the information related to Indian railways is available in the museum. Train rides are also available that can be enjoyed by kids as well as young and old ones. A  number of old locomotives and coaches are also available to explore. Overall a nice place to visit in Delhi.
National_Rail_Museum,Voyage231161,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Simulator activity overpriced and ourdated,The museum is good but the simulator activity which they offer for 300 rs  per head is highly overpriced. The technology used is outdated and staff is highly unprofessional. This activity is Not worth the money.
National_Rail_Museum,Fran-Svk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,ok,"ok, as railway engineer i had to visit local railway museum, right? so i did. even good if you are not a railway fan. so go there. it opens its gate at 10am, so i was very first visitor that day."
National_Rail_Museum,ShivaniR,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Very Unhygienic Place,"This place is very poorly maintained. There are no sanitizing stations anywhere in the museum. None of the faucets in the ladies restroom had water. The 3D steam stimulator coach ride, the ride with the VR headsets is all left unsanitized after use. They make you use the same VR head sets, shovel, steering wheel etc. right after other people have used it, nothing is sprayed or cleaned. The whole museum is very very unsanitary. The souvenir shop is shut, so you can't purchase anything. The toy train ride is the only decent thing in this museum but even that is in quite a dilapidated state.  Go before 11am to avoid the crowd. Parking is convenient."
National_Rail_Museum,Sachin Rathore,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Wonderful Place for Kids,"बच्चों और परिवार के साथ एक शानदार अनुभव के लिए आप दिल्ली में चाणक्यपुरी स्थित राष्ट्रीय रेल संग्रहालय अवश्य जाएं। शांत वातावरण में स्थित यह संग्रहालय आपको भारतीय रेल की ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमि में ले जाता है। अंग्रेजों के जमाने से लेकर राजघरानों तक के रेल इंजन और डिब्बे देखने के साथ आपको दुर्लभ तस्वीरें देखने का अवसर मिलता है। साथ बच्चों के लिए छोटी सी छुक-छुक गाड़ी में सैर करना अपने आप में एक मजेदार अनुभव है। अंदर खानपान का भी बंदोबस्त रहता है, लेकिन कोरोना के कारण फिलहाल बंद है। Parking place is available outside the premises. Ticket rates are high on Weekends and National Holidays."
National_Rail_Museum,Roochie1986,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Always a great place!,"Due to COVID, the crowd is moderately less. It ain't so less that you feel scared being alone but neither crowded. The train rides are the charmers. It was the second visit of my six year old (last was when he was 4). This time he had ofcourse a lot more fun and was able to put his experience into writing after coming back. He also drew engine after coming back. He was excited to see rail tracks and engines. I did not go into much teaching mode or making him learn any names of train. While my 19 month old was just happy to run around. We took him in the pram and during the end of our visit made him walk. Don't miss the indoor display on first floor. Can bring own food and enjoy a relaxing picnic with family. 2.5 hrs is good enough time to spend there. One can also head to Khan market post rail museum for better dining experience."

National_Rail_Museum,SAROJ8585,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,CHUK CHUK RAILGARI,National Rail museum is located at Chankayapuri in New Delhi.It is a unique museum and has collection of over 100 real size exhibits of Indian railways.The museum is spread across 11 acres of land.A toy train run around its sites.
National_Rail_Museum,Debashis T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,The Best Rail Museum,"I had to Nagpur’s Narrow Gauge Rail Museum, which is also good in its capacity. However, this one in Delhi being in National capital is the biggest. Though it has everything one should required to know, but the entry ticket is on a very higher side. Two different types of ticketing systems. On weekdays for adult it is Rs.50/- whereas on weekends and Holidays it is Rs.100/-.For child upto 10 yrs it is Rs.10/- and Rs.20/- respectively. But for one of its kind experience, don’t be regret for paying this, especially if you have child/children. Toy Train Rides(two different types) one inside the train other on top of the train to digital quizzes about railway and a vast information about the railways surely give you joy and improve your knowledge."
National_Rail_Museum,FreeIndianBird,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Worth visit,This place is in chanakyapuri and have entry ticket for kids  & adults too. Will recommend to see this place once so that we can know the old train and their structure. Interested place for kids as there is toy train and you can take ride in it. As usual crowded in weekends so go on weekdays.
National_Rail_Museum,AstroBloke,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,I just loved it!,"Other reviewers have mentioned how this is a great museum for kids.  Well, this 61 year old kid just loved.  Admittedly, I'm a lifelong train enthusiast so i may be a little biased.There are indoor displays showing the development of railways in India and a great collection of locomotives and carriages outside.  The cafe provided a good light lunch - the lack of options was made up for by the model trains running around the tables :-)  The gift shop had very limited range, unfortunately.Entrance was cheap, with no premium for westerners.  It's not near public transport but is easily accessible by tuk tuk."
National_Rail_Museum,Seamus53,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,A little  gem,"Had a few hours to fill on our last day in Delhi so we visited this museum.  Easy to get to by Metro then a tuk tuk. Entry only cost 50 Rupees and there was lots to see.  There was an inside display showing a history of Indian Railways,  then lots of trains outside,  including a working model railway.  Great way to spend a couple of hours. "
National_Rail_Museum,Varun Goyal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Best Rail Museum,"A great place to visit with family and friends, especially for kids. It has a great collection of trains belonging to different periods and different countries.The toy train & Joy train ride are very enjoyable.Must See –Miniature India, First floor, Indoor Museum.A small cafeteria and souvenir shop also is present.Location is very accessible, nearest Metro Station - Sir M Vishveshwaraiah Moti Bagh, Pink LineParking – Available."
National_Rail_Museum,Abhishek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Good for parents with small children ,The Museum is well maintained and gives an insight of various Trains that have developed over the ages....Joy ride is nice and must be done...Toy train ride is useless.
National_Rail_Museum,Sunil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Rail  museum ,The museum is more into rail. The museum is very nice and you can find the most train and ancient train exhibition.Nice for kids and and families 
National_Rail_Museum,RStourist,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Exceeded our expectations,"A 2 hour excursion into the history of Indian Railways. The exhibit and information centre is quite detailed and fun even if you're not a train buff. The actual engines on display are also quite good. Do try the joy train (ticket extra), its nostalgic! Visit on weekends is double the price, so plan accordingly. Washrooms are available and fairly clean. The gift shop can be improved as the items on sale are very limited and not much for kids to select."
National_Rail_Museum,mgoel04,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"mesmerizing experience, kids loved it",amazed to learn about history of india railways.we enjoyed toy train ride.must for everyone who loves train ride
National_Rail_Museum,Victorianlad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"Tells the story well of railways, the lifeline of India","I visited on a Saturday, arriving not long after the opening time of 1000 to find lines of schoolchildren waiting to enter for some function.Admission was a very cheap Rs.100 on weekends but on weekdays that is cut in half.The exhibits indoor hall is terrific with a model railway of 'India in miniature' but more importantly scale models and explanations of diesel and steam locomotives, explanation of signalling, the booking office, technological advancement and far more.The Joy Train and smaller Toy Train were fun to travel on.I agree with TA reviewer Two_Tankertonians that some retired locos and carriages are rusting or decaying.  There may not be many volunteers.Nonetheless it was great to see an Alco loco from 1957, number 17000 and many stream locos, railcars and carriages.There is a restaurant, a limited stock take away cafe and a souvenir shop plus clean toilets.Overall a credit to Indian Railways, the second largest employer in the world and a great way to travel."
National_Rail_Museum,Two_Tankertonians,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Well worth a visit. But the big story isn't told.,"I loved this place but I think so much more could be made of it. I'm sorry that I'm posting a generally negative review. I don't want to discourage you from visiting. Yes, go there and see the fantastic engineering which built the country. But I want the management to hear that they need to up their game. And I realise that India has a million projects with a far higher priority, but one day, when prosperity permits the indulgence of upgrading the museum many exhibits will be beyond repair. They're steel; they rust.Coming from UK where dozens of heritage railways recreate the past and tell a story the NRM is just a random, but huge, collection of locomotives and rolling stock. The imagination that built the machinery and the tracks to use them is clear but there's no context. Preservation, and eventual restoration, require an army of volunteers and a lot of money.  My guess is that most exhibits are 'prettied up' on arrival and then little more is done to them.  I fear that the wonderful outdoor exhibits are doomed to deteriorate.There's a small indoor museum with some great displays, exhibits and artefacts but randomly presented.  I expected to see the amazing story of the amazing Indian railway and how it grew and the country grew with it. ,Anyone interested in railways will find the place fascinating and will enjoy the visit but this is a valuable and irreplaceable National resource which deserves better."
National_Rail_Museum,GailWyness,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Trains,"Went during the week and in the midst of visits by a number of school groups, who seemed more interested in us and selfies than the trains. That aside, it’s a nice museum with an interesting and unusual collection of trains"

National_Rail_Museum,sahil24,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Well maintained place,"The museum itself is very well maintained. The place is very informative. All the old engines were kept in impeccable condition. Entry tickets are moderately priced.Room for improvement is in the simulation area. Tickets are overpriced and not very great. We went for the diesel locomotive simulator,  where we were not guided well. We were on our own and could not do any justice to the simulation. Its better you yourself understand it, beforehand on the video playing outside first.The wagon simulator with a VR was good though."

Great value souvenirs- only 100 rupee for small coffee mug, 50 rupee for metal key ring. Worth paying 100 rupee for the toy train ride but sit on the last carriage to avoid fuel fumes."
National_Rail_Museum,Krish3534,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Nice place,National rail museum is the one of the best place to visit in Delhi. If you are interested in trains or you have a children of 5 years and above. Can take a combo ticket so that you can cover all the raids and simulators. It will take 4-6 hrs if you want to visit fully. Take some food and water with you as there is only one restaurant. Miniatures train is attractive.

National_Rail_Museum,Dipankar D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Expanding knowledge about Indian Railways!,"I have lived in Delhi in the past, and have visited numerous times, however, I had no clue about the National Rail Museum, which is situated in Chanakyapuri. Without any doubt, a visit to the museum is a must for one and all, as the museum provides immense knowledge about the Indian Railways and its history. I was literally awestruck to see all the exhibits, including real models of engines, and miniatures. The sight is simply awesome.The museum covers ground area of about 11 acres and the entire complex is simply superb with lots of lush green lawns and trees. The museum, I am sure, is one of its kind in the country and we all Indians must be immensely proud of it. The 11 acres land comprises of an indoor gallery having six display galleries inside, and a large open area which simulates a railway yard, and a toy train track, which goes around the yard to provide better views to the visitors.The museum is open from 10.00 AM till 17.00 PM and it remains closed every Monday and all public holidays. Ticket prices are also very reasonable. The history of Indian Railways dates back to mid-nineteenth century. The first rail network started from Bombay to Thane in 1853. Slowly, the Indian Railways over a period of 100 years, developed pan India network, becoming one of the largest networks in the gauge network of, broad, meter and narrow gauges. Toy train ride is an awesome experience. The 1:8 scale train is nothing close to the massive compartments, nevertheless, you can get on it. The train is designed to haul adults and children. It travels a slow pace so that you can enjoy the views of the rail yard including different types of engines and passenger compartments displayed all round. There are miniature tunnels from where the train passes and the experience is simply mind boggling. Another attraction is the Rail Garden. One of the most popular attractions for people of all ages. It really brought lot of fond memories of my childhood when I used to travel by train and be awestruck at the trains passing by during my journey. The steam engines, the passenger trains, diesel engines, freight trains and the electric engines. Indoor gallery is another very interesting. The remarkable display of miniature trains, is a unique combination of historical collection, train models, interactive games, modern simulators and cutting edge communication system displayed. The indoor museum is divided into six sections and it covers all important aspects of Indian Railways, like, the signalling system, the civil engineering, the design of locomotives, the traffic control system, etc.I personally implore all Indians, irrespective of their age, to visit this museum to understand how Indian Railways is managing a very complex network across the country. Once you visit the museum you, I am more than sure, will have a completely different view about Indian Railways and you will surely develop respect and feel proud to be an Indian."
National_Rail_Museum,Alok Ranjan NHPC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Knowladge with enjoyment,Very good for parents of 5 year old to 15 year old children.

Same entry price for both nationals and foreigners and the option of a full meal or simply a light snack is a welcome addition that many places lack. Some fun can be had too on the Joy Train, a miniature narrow gauge train that brings you through the outdoor exhibits. There's also an informative indoor interpretive centre making this the perfect attraction! "

I will definitely be back - yet again!!"
National_Rail_Museum,ParthaSarathy K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Well maintained Museum and lots to learn about trains,"If you have a train lover in your family then this is place is must visit in Delhi. We bought the tickets for Simulator rides and the Joy ride.  Diesel Simulator ride where 3 people can go and control the Diesel Engine. You can ride till the fuel remains in the tank. Nothing exceptional about it but kids would enjoy. Unfortunately, the steam engine simulator wasn't working and we couldn't try that. Next was the simulation on how the Railways have evolved. This was a good one. Only problem is that they don't have proper headsets if you wear glasses. The person who fits you with the head on 3D instrument is a bit rough with your glasses, so be careful of that. The other things are in the Museum are well organized which you will find in any other Rail Museum. Same case with Joy Ride which is available these days in most of the places associated with trains.  They have a group quizzing option screen. If you have time to kill, you can try that out."
National_Rail_Museum,Feroz A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Ok to waste some time here,There was quite a few trains and there was also a miniature tunnel boring system. There was even a train museum and quite a few trains on display. The souvenir was a total let down having very few items. 
National_Rail_Museum,ronit gaikwad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,An amazing museum of original Engines and Simulation of Locomotives,"This place is one of the finest and must visit places in Delhi. The museum contains all types of locomotives, coaches and railway wagons of the Indian Railways right from the British era to the modern day versions of electric locomotives and spacious coaches.The best part is the locomotives are wonderfully maintained and the best part is these guys have also hung up an information board pertaining to each locomotive and the various coaches and wagons right in front of them which gives the visitors a good idea about the locomotives as well as about the wagons that were used. This is in the external area while the actual information museum is located in an auditorium.The information museum contains all the information regarding the Indian Railways right from its inception. The information includes the various types of signaling systems, including a manual simulation of how trains change tracks, the various types of signaling systems in use right from when railways started to the current generation signaling systems as well as the future. The museum also has computer terminals which run short quizzes for the people and children.Apart from this, there is also a Joy train which will take the people around the area where all the locomotives and coaches are kept. There is also a Diesel Locomotive simulator and the area also has a nice cafeteria for enjoying some delicious snacks. All in all, this is a really awesome place to be visited with family and especially kids which would give them a ton of information regarding the Indian Railways."

The audio guide (by scanning QR code on phone) facility is very useful and enriches the experience. One can easily spend 2-3 hours if the weather is not too hot (as most of the artifacts are in the open). The experience can further be improved if they provide proper audio guides and can arrange audio-visual shows. The toy trains are also quite ordinary and could have been much better."

National_Rail_Museum,1Gaurav,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Amazing,"Very well maintained....children and adults both can enjoy- it has three simulation rides which are an amazing experience and should not be missed no matter how long is the wait time- these are worth it.....in the open they have three more train rides- toy train, joy ride and a real steam engine train coach (the steam one is only on wednesday and friday)- all three offer a great experience....the place experiences heavy rush so reach early so that u get tickets for all rides as they have limited tickets especially for simulation rides....u can carry eatables"
National_Rail_Museum,Jaspreet Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,nice,i was in delhi to apply my philippines tourist visa and i have 2-3 hours before the appointment with philippines embassy so i decided to go inside the rail museum and its was the best option for me to kill the time and explore there too and to be honest i really enjoy there and its really value for money.
National_Rail_Museum,Maria Marsala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,I wish I were a child again,"First, their are trains that you are allowed to take pictures in.  And the number of trains and the types of trains is amazing.  Good lunch at the cafeteria.  As an adult I loved all this history of trains, something I'd never see in the US, as our history is so young next to India.  This history will be boring for children as it's a lot of reading.  There is a train ride around the rails outside.  I recommend that you go on them first so that you can choose which trains to visit, since there are so many.  And I loved the funny flower pots so much that I'm looking to make my own."

National_Rail_Museum,Douglas B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Lots of old engines and a fun ride for kids,"Went during the week and in the midst of visits by a number of school groups. This wasn't an issue as they were mostly interested in doing the fun train ride. Didn't look that much fun to me but they seemed to enjoy the short trip. The museum costs Rs50 for Indian and Foreigner adults but extras for various train and simulator rides. I just walked around the outside area which has a fair number of old engines and some coaches with explanatory boards. One is not allowed to go inside any of them. A nice walk but of limited interest of one doesn't like trains. There was a second minuture train ride for smaller kids and a rather sad model train set outside. I didn't go inside any buildings to see if there was anything else - and no signs encouraged me to do so. There was a cafeteria and a gift shop - I didn't try the former and don't recommend the latter unless you want a key ring, t-shirt, badge or old book.A pleasant enough way to spend an hour when the weather is not too hot but not something I'll repeat."
National_Rail_Museum,chidambaram k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Tourist attraction,"For anyone interested in trains and railways, this is a very good place to visit. The history of railways in India is very well depicted. So are models of train coaches, old steam engines, etc. For ones interested in technical details like trach laying, tunnel boring, etc., there is plenty to learn. For children, there is a 5-6 minutes joy ride on a toy train. One can spend an hour very easily here. "
National_Rail_Museum,CigarIndian,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,"interesting exhibits, some in disrepair; mini trains are the highlight","This indoor/outdoor museum is a bit disappointing given the rail heritage of India. The Indoor exhibits are interesting, with a lot of detail on the history as well as the mechanics of railways. However, the outdoor exhibits of rail cars and locomotive engines was a bit disappointing in that many of them seem to be in mediocre condition, and the grounds are not kept in the best shape. The highlight for my daughter was the mini train ride. Worth an hour or two if you need to find something to do....."
National_Rail_Museum,Sauneh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Good museum but very bad staff ,They do not allow any adult for kids as young as 4 for the simulator rides. These rides are in a huge dark room and have controls to manage and the staff wants the children to do this alone. The staff is very rude and told me that a 4 yr old can ve left alone in a dark room alone! They want the parents to buy the ticket as well. While that is not an issue. This is not informed at the time of buying a ticket.Very bad experience.
National_Rail_Museum,Chhavi L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Only good for kids under 10yrs or history enthusiasts ,Though its decently managed.. but Mostly kids or railway history enthusiasts would enjoy it. Or you are in big group in picnic mode with nothing else to do.. otherwise its not worth it. 
National_Rail_Museum,Alok2108,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,A very educative and interesting museum,This is a very interesting place for anyone who wants to have a first hand experience of how the railway industry has evolved over the years..there are real coaches and engines exhibits from over the years and are well kept...the place is well spaced out and the exhibits are really interesting...they tell you so much about the indian railways and how it evolved over time...there is also a museum inside the years which has other interesting exhibits and models related to the railways...one has to spend time there so that you can grasp and understand the information...its also a good place for family outings specially for youngsters as there is a model train for the kids to travel in and there is a fairly decent café where you can sit and enjoy a good meal...overall a good place to spend a weekend..
National_Rail_Museum,Rajat_jims,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Perfect for kids outing....,"Got my memories refreshed...What better to do on a weekend winter sunny day..Better than going to a mall .Weekend tickets a little expensive.Tickets:-Tips:- no need to take toy train for rs 200Buy joy train ticket for rs 50/ adult and 20 for kids apart from your entry ticket.There is a entry ticket pass , rs 200 for 2 adults + 2 kids which covers entry ticket.Excellent for day outing.... Trip lasted 2 hours ...Avoid any food inside. Better to go to cp or pandara road for lunch.  Good for sunny day get together..."
National_Rail_Museum,KayP,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Not for a full day trip,The only attractions are the simulated engines. Since entry inside the exhibited coaches is prohibited it is less interesting to see it just from outside without a view of the inside. Slightly overpriced for the number of attractions. Can cover it in 2/3 hours.
National_Rail_Museum,Deeps,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Great Sunday outing!!!,"If you don’t want to visit mall this weekend and want to explore outdoor place then you must go this place.Museum is Clean well managed place. If you are going on your own car parking charges is INR 20 per hour.Parking space is less if u are going on weekend then get ready to wait for 15-20 min , you have to wait for any car to leave first.After parking need to take entry ticket will take your more 15-20 min time. Entry ticket will cost weekend charge inr 100 per adult / inr 50 in weekday (joy ride toy train ride will cost more multiple of INR 100s) .Once u get tickets go inside explore , read information if it’s ur cup of tea, if u r going with child they love toy trains and if going with old age group they must remember there childhood after watch old trains. Inside museum is also great, you can munchin here also cafeteria is ok ok. Will not take more then 2 hrs."
National_Rail_Museum,richagoel15,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Refreshing Change for kids,Went to Railway museum after a long time. It was a very nice change from the fast life of Delhi.  It is a good place to spend time with the kids. The best attraction is the Toy train. You should definitely board on that.  It is also having a small playground for kids where there are swings and slides. You can bring in your food to have a small picnic. 
National_Rail_Museum,tarun9369,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Nice outing with family : national rail museum,"Nice place to visit specially in sunny Delhi winters..the national rail museum is in Chanayaka puri which is very easily accessible and also is less crowded...If you are going on weekends or public holiday , please take care to reach early as waiting time at ticket counter is minimum 30minutes. The tickets can’t be purchased online ...don’t know why...where is digital India now?Also they have one counter window most of time...Good to see the history of Indian railways...nice place to enjoy for both adults and kids ...place for all age group.One can take joy train or toy train ride.... Cafeteria is good but has limited food options and also food quality can be improved...This is my third visit in last three years with family as everyone enjoys going there...Nice place to visit but again take care of long ticket counter ques on weekends and holidays"

National_Rail_Museum,Ankur M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,A heaven for Rail fans,"One of the best Rail museums ever seen in India. The National Rail Museum located in Chankyapuri, Delhi definitely shows you about the rich heritage and evolution of the Indian Railways. You can find almost all the types of rail carraiges as well as locomotives used by the Indian Railways here, be it from the pre- indepence era or the vintage, you get to see them all. It's definitely a great place to visit for both elders as well as children. This place has definitely a lot to offer offer to rail enthusiasts. The museum is open all days of the week except Mondays.Tge tickets cost INR 20 for adults and INR 10 for Children. The nearest metro stations are Lok Kalyan Marg and INA."
National_Rail_Museum,Vasudha S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Avoid the 'night show',"So they have allowed night entry at the National Rail Museum in New Delhi in the hope of increasing footfall. The night package includes entry, light and sound show and dinner. Sounds interesting. But Wait!Only entry...no joy rides in the night. No ride on the toy train, no simulator access, no playing on the engines parked there. One can only walk through the museum,Light & sound show...is really some musical fountains. Totally missable.And the dinner at the cafeteria is a very basic affair with paltry vegetarian options.So, Delhi Tourism..great move to keep the museum open at the night and we were very excited to catch the night show. But it needs more to keep the disappointment at bay. Please revisit the package offerings!"

Well maintained and curated museum.   I think kids love this place.  Many local families were here today and the kids were climbing all over the trains outside despite numerous signs saying there is a 500 rupee fine for doing so.

Simulation rides were above my expectations :) The only thing that took away a single star from my review rating was food quality of the cafeteria. Food was like below par and I didn’t liked it a bit. The only suggestion from me is DO NOT Eat their and carry your own food.Apart from that you would enjoy Rail museum and you can easily spend 3-4 hours there.

National_Rail_Museum,Ridhima_at_ease,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,learning history with fun,"The museum is situated in a nice silent area surrounded by embassies. the parking is free and available right outside the gate. The place has many outdoor models train as well as retired coaches put on display. Apart from the toy train (which is functional and permitted), the children would be very interested to mount the display models of the train which You should be careful to avoid. This is a well-crafted museum so don't let the children play hide and seek here as you will be heavily fined. There is an indoor gallery too which has miniatures of the train and written history of our great Indian railways. read carefully as post the tour one can play the quiz in one of the computer kiosks! there is a souvenir shop too. The place has a restaurant where Indian dish should be preferred, although it's not an elaborate restaurant with menu card. in the end, dont forget to give feedback in a computer and smile to give your photograph!"
