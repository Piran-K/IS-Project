Nehru_Park,Renu2,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 â€¢ Friends,Nehru Park,"I had been to Nehru Park as a child on school picnics but after that it just became  place that one passed by but never entered. A few days back a few friends decided to visit the park and we had so much fun. It is one of the few places where you can get away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi.  It has something for everyone. There is a track to run on. There are lovely plants, trees, flowers, rockeries and undulating lawns. There are benches to sit on. We also saw vendors selling tea and coffee inside the park. The park covers a large area and therefore never feels crowded even when there are multiple school groups that are there on picnics. I recommend this park highly. It really will rejuvenate the jaded and tired urban dweller in you. "
Nehru_Park,TheCreatist,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Very well maintained,"Its a beautiful, perfect green oasis in the middle of the hustle bustle of Delhi. Located in Chanakyapuri, its a great place to come with your family or friends. Kids will love it. So will health enthusiasts. Good place for a picnic."
Nehru_Park,Madhulika L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Something for everyone,"This vast park stretches all along one side of the diplomatic enclave in Chanakyapuri, and is one of the biggest landscaped parks in Delhi. There are several gates scattered along both sides of the park, so you can enter (some gates have designated free parking inside, others do not) wherever you wish. Entry is free. Inside, the space is a mix of areas: there is a jogging track, lots of walking paths, wide lawns which are dotted with picnickers during good weather, groves of trees, and more â€˜wildernessâ€™-like sections, where the tree cover is more dense. There are hillocks, some with statuary or installation art, others with easy climbing walls for children. There are benches scattered around here and there, and ice cream carts parked near the gates. The best thing about Nehru Park is that because itâ€™s so huge, a lot of activities can be held simultaneously without people getting in each otherâ€™s way. The last time we visited, we wandered through only about a quarter of the park, and came across two musical groups rehearsing, one dance group practicing, and several people picnickingâ€”as well as a cricket match in progress near a rope bridge which spans one wide ditch. None of these people were even within sight of each other; itâ€™s a great place, therefore, to go for a large picnicâ€”you arenâ€™t likely to have trouble finding space!The park also hosts some interesting concerts, food festivals, and other events during the autumn and winter, which mostly command an entrance fee for the event itself. One last tip: if youâ€™re a tree lover, do take the time to visit Nehru Park. It has some stunning trees, including some magnificent silk cottons, an unusually robust stand of chir pines (which actually bear cones), some beautiful groves of Bismarck palms, red cassias, and more. For a good cross-section of Delhiâ€™s most representative trees, Nehru Park deserves a mention alongside Sunder Nursery and Lodhi Gardens."

Nehru_Park,travelerraghu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 â€¢ Couples,A good neat park,This park is named after Jawaharlal Nehru who was the first prime minister of India. The whole park is green and is well maintained. The perk is neat and tidy.
Nehru_Park,AnneML63,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 â€¢ Family,South Delhi's Green Spot,"Visiting Nehru Park after a long lapse was a pleasant surprise. The park remains rather well maintained (although there were some mini trenches work, not always properly signalled so beware!). There are some open air fitness equipment in different spots. Another novelty for me where the water boots (although unoccupied at the time of visit). The park is certainly best visited when there are no picnic crowds, which means about every day of the week, except Sundays. There could be some further improvements such as signalling to people where they are in the park (where is the nearest exit of water booth or toilet). Unfortunately, many visitors leave a garbage trail after a picnic or a stroll (wrappers, bottles etc) while there are sufficient garbage bins around. There were also a few stray dogs around, but they seemed tamed and more interested in a nap than disturbing walkers or joggers. Walking with my daughter, we attracted some glare from the few other passers-by and the inevitable ""where are you from"" question from local people. So I would recommend women to walk in pair or more or go at time of higher affluence to be on the safe side. Compared to Lodhi (or Lodi) park, there is little outside the landscaping of the park to entertain the visitor (outside events like music concerts at some time of the year). Anyway, a safe haven in congested and polluted Delhi."

Nehru_Park,Douglas B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Couples,Large park but not the most interesting,"Nehru Park struck me as a park more for those living in the area than for tourists. It is a large park with lawns, walking/jogging paths and a small hill and plenty of trees. However, it has no historical buildings within the park like at Lodhi Gardens which makes it a little less interesting. Also the water features were not working and had essentially no water despite being about 1 week after heavy rains - this may reduce mosquitoes but also means no waterbirds. I may return to Nehru Park but would want to combine it with visiting more in the area - otherwise I would go to Lodhi Gardens."
Nehru_Park,madhav n,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 â€¢ Solo,minimal effort,"Delhi is being ruined by skyscrapers. Had town planners remained faithful to an earlier vow to refuse permits for such monsters,the city would have been far more livable. Businesses would have sprouted in satellite cities around the capital, and Delhi would have remained a charming place rather than the traffic and infrastructural hell it presently is. Nehru park is still untouched,perhaps because it is adjacent to the diplomatic area and would exite global censure if overrun by buildings,for example the way  land intended for the airport has been by the developer. Upkeep is minimal but even this little is enough for a great spot to take a walk in the evenings or to picnic on winter afternoons"

Nehru_Park,MamaBearOz,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Delhi's Lungs,"I've just spent a couple of weeks visiting with friends in New Delhi and it's their habit to regularly walk in Nehru Park. Given the state of the roads, the congested traffic, and the pollution, a walk in a park is a must-do activity for health and well-being. Nehru Park is a great venue for walking, jogging, doing yoga, meditating, or picnicking. A couple of rounds of the park is about a 5km walk and early on a Sunday morning there are few people to get in the way. The gardens are lovely, with ample pathways, lots of trees, a zillion squirrels, and beautifully laid out flower beds that are well maintained. There are also plenty of water features in the gardens but each of these was dry, which was a real shame. This might be because water is in short supply, or a seasonal thing, I don't know, but empty ponds look very sad. There is also plenty of rubbish lying around, despite there being plenty of bins. Littering is a shameful Indian habit that is overlooked by most people (even though the same people complain about the rubbish!). So, if you visit, take your rubbish home and pick up someone else's, too. The major lack is toilets. There are toilets and one set is clean, but the other set is not so well maintained. The good set has just one cubicle for women. Given the number of people who use the park, this is a serious lack. It contributed to our decision to go early in the mornings."
Nehru_Park,Nathalie7077,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 â€¢ Family,Delightful park in the city,"A quiet place for reprieve in the city, this park has something for everyone--running trails, gazebos, benches, picnic grass areas, and exercise equipment.  Located off Shantipath in Chanakdapur near the diplomatic enclave, this location has plenty of space for groups and families alike.  While the grounds are well maintained, the fountains and pools have clearly seen better days, and are a bit run down or empty.  If the sight of dozens of couples noodling around the park and on benches doesn't bother you, bring the kids for a walk or play on the grass.  One thing to be aware of is that ""Hijras"" (transvestites) like to visit the park and badger guests for money."

Nehru_Park,Nishit7,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 â€¢ Friends,Lots of festivals,"Nehru Park is a popular destination in the winter for music festivals, concerts, food festivals, and the like, so keep an eye out for them."
Nehru_Park,musafir_nonstop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 â€¢ Family,Clean and well maintained..,It is situated on the main Panchsheel road.. It has a good collection of flowers and trees.. There are little mounds and rocks aslo with the inscriptions.. Since this park is well maintained it serves as a perfect place for picnics..

Nehru_Park,Ronald_jelle,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,"I went here for a walk, but not what I had hoped....","I went to Nehru park, it's near the Embassy area, so the air here is relatively clean and so is the park... but.... It doesn't have much, there are trees, there are some flowers, but not much and well I couldn't find anything for my young children to play with (and neither could our taxi driver). We walked for about 25 minutes through the park and yes it is green... but it is nothing like Lodi gardens... Lodi really has more to offer, the monuments, there is actually water in the pond and well here the park seemed mostly filled with Joggers, lovebirds and also people that were bothering me (wanted something from me, which never happened in Lodi gardens). Added to that Lodi also has the restaurant, something I couldn't find here either, so for me it was the second and last time. For those who don't have to spent months in Delhi and just want to go to a nice park, go to Lodi... It really has more to offer and is much nicer!. Nehru park is green and has some color... but it just isn't as nice... an average park."
Nehru_Park,TravellerPetals,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 â€¢ Family,A Delight to go there anytime,The park is neat and clean (at least whenever I have been there) and the crowd is matured. People are usually having picnic's or families coming together in large numbers as there is little decency left in this park - unlike the vulgar behavior in other Delhi parks. 
Nehru_Park,Sarah_Kaushik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 â€¢ Solo,A great park!,Its a really nice park for strolls. This happens to be one of the very few parks where events like Palette Fest and Jazz Fest take place. 
Nehru_Park,wpg01,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 â€¢ Couples,Named after an idiot.,"Other than its terrible name (after the person who helped create the dirty corrupt mess all around), this is a large and pleasant park. Worth a stroll if you're in the area."
Nehru_Park,anandsrivastava,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 â€¢ Family,Lovely winter picnic,"After a few foggy days, it was a bright and sunny winter day. We went to Nehru park for a picnic and had a wonderful time.The  park  is large and well maintained.      Just a few suggestions: there was a large group  playing Tambola for which they were using a megaphone. Megaphones should not be allowed.Disturbs the peace and serenity.      Considering that one has to pay Rs. 5/ for the use of toilet, it should be odour-free.                                                     A.K. Srivastava"

Nehru_Park,AlpShi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 â€¢ Family,So much green space - who knew,"A tourist visiting Delhi might completely miss this lovely garden, but if you have a few hrs to relax this is the place to go.There are a variety of outdoor exercise equipments (does not need electricity) for everyone to use. While you exercise, enjoy the flowers in the garden in front. There is a lot of green space for kids to play and a walking/running track.I would certainly recommend this as a change from all the historical monuments, just to experience what Delhi has to offer in the middle of all the traffic."
