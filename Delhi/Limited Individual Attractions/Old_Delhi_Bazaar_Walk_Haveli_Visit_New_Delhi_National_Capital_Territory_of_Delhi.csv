Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Sarah B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023 • Couples,"Amazing tour, food and hosts!","We had an amazing experience with Raj and Dhruv! They were extremely accommodating with our groups tight schedule, and made the booking process super easy. Some of our group had been to Old Delhi previously, but Raj’s historical and anthropological context shone a new light. We were able to try some delicious food, and completing the tour at Dhruv’s family home was a delight. The food there was delicious, and the hospitality top-notch. Our only disappointment was having to rush out to deal with flight issues - we’d have loved to continue our visit! I would absolutely recommend this tour to anyone wanting to experience Old Delhi in an authentic yet manageable way."

Truly a one of a kind experience with Dhruv to rooftops, alleyways, mosques, and temples with stops to sample amazing food along the way. One of the best adventures I have had in any city."
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,kevinandsarah521,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Must experience this!,We had a great time and visited areas of the city that we never would’ve gone on our own. The tour guide was wonderful and we really enjoyed ourselves. I totally recommend this if you’re in New Delhi!

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Jon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Taj Mahal & Agra Fort same day return experience from Delhi,"This trip to the Taj Mahal was a dream come true. The schedule is very flexible based on what you want to do, and how long you want to stay places. The whole process is very smooth, and makes your day going to the Taj Mahal easy. The driver was extremely accommodating and did his best to make me comfortable on the drive(about a 3 hour drive each way). When you get to Agra you stop, and pick up your personal tour guide to take you to the Taj Mahal. The tour guide makes the process of getting to the Taj easy, and then accommodates to what you want to do. My tour guide gave me great information I wouldn’t have got on my own. On top of that he took my pictures, and knew all the great shots to take. I would have never got these great pics traveling there on my own. Overall I highly recommend booking this tour to make your life easy, gain knowledge you wouldn’t get, and take pictures that will last you a life time."
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Vger1972,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Highlight of the trip.,"Dhruv Gupta was by far one of the best guide I had the pleasure to meet. His experience, it is a disservice to call it tour, is amazing. The food is marvelous, the places you visit are unique as the guide :-)"

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Jon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Old Delhi Food Tour,"The Old Delhi food tour led by Dhruv Gupta was phenomenal! The food was amazing, the experience was great, and Dhruv was outstanding. Dhruv did a phenomenal job informing me during the tour, and showcasing what Old Delhi has to offer. I highly recommend taking this tour with him which will lead to lasting memories as he takes photos for you throughout the tour and shares his knowledge."
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,zracoon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,"Outstanding tour, like going with a friend in Delhi","This tour was outstanding, though I almost don't think I should call it a tour.  Up front the tour guide tells you there will be no tipping, he just wants to be your friend in Delhi taking you to some great places, and he was sincere.  Even when he took us to the spice market and we had opportunity to buy spices, the vendors said that because he won't take commission on his tour, we got 20% off! (and this wasn't a scam, a different tour I went on took us to the same store the next day and no discussion was had regarding commission and the people on that tour paid more).  The food through the whole tour was great and safe (I did not get sick), and overall it was a great experience."
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Mary H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Phenomenal tour especially for those new to Delhi or India in general.,This was one of the best tours I have been on in any city I have visited. It’s completely immersive but we never felt overwhelmed because Varun was always looking out for us. The street food was amazing - nothing you could find in a restaurant here which made it even more special. Ending the tour with a home cooked meal at Dhruv’s home was the icing on the cake. Definitely do this tour - it’s an incredible value for what you get to experience.
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Jon B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,An incredible way to see Old Delhi,"Our guide Raj was incredible. I found myself in Delhi solo and he made Old Delhi come alive, and really gave us an insider’s look! We got to see several incredible temples, including a large Jain temple and India’s largest mosque. The food was excellent and getting to visit an original Haveli on the inside was really a pleasure. Highly recommend!"
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Pablo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,Best tour of my life,"I've traveled quite a bit, and taken many tours, and this is BY FAR the best one. It's an opportunity to experience old Delhi in a relaxed way, crossing the local-tourist invisible barrier and getting and exposure to daily life I had not imagined was possible. Do yourself a favor and book it; you won't regret it."

A must when in Delhi,"We had a unique insight in Old Delhi, with its hidden paths, its economic relevance for entire India and its culinary offers. Raj was a great and extremely knowledgeable guide. Born and raised in Old Delhi he knows everything about the functioning, the people and the history of Old Delhi. I can only recommend to do the tour and would do it again. I’m sure Raj has even more to say about his Old Delhi."

Along with unique foods we learned some of the history and culture from a quality local. Grab some friends, take the metro and enjoy the sights and sounds of Old Delhi."
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Lauren,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,A Delhi must,"Would highly recommend. Varun provided detailed and thorough anecdotes throughout and along the way addressed our group’s particular questions with care. There is no way we would have been able to experience anything close to what we experienced if we had planned it ourselves. We passed several other tour groups on our way and several of them followed us to the food spots because they saw how professional our guide was. When you go, wear your walking shoes and be ready to move quickly so you can get the full experience!"
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,pasnas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Highly recommend this Old Delhi Food tour,"It was a freezing cold Delhi day today! I was not sure of taking a walking tour - but how wrong was I!Wonderful early morning trip was in store for us. Varun's ease and jovial manner not only put us at ease but our two children couldn't wait to be questioned and have their curiosity beckoned!Old Delhi is a very complex, myriad and small lane structured area. It is highly advisable to walk with a person who is knowledgeable and would advise on where to go for the surprisingly delicious treats!It was a privilege to walk through these lanes of history and savouring the delights of places which are family owned for decades.Thank you to Varun & Dhruv for organising this for us. And we would highly recommend this tour to anyone who may be interested in exploring Old  Delhi."
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Natalie S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,"Wonderful & authentic introduction to Old Delhi food, people and culture","I did this tour on my first morning after arriving in India, and it was the best possible way to start the trip! Dhruv guided me around Old Delhi like he was my “big brother” for the day (as he put it!). We visited a local Hindu temple and mosque, ate at trusted street food vendors (can confirm, no tummy issues afterwards), took a rickshaw ride and chatted to local business owners, finishing with a home-cooked meal at his family home. Dhruv knows everyone around the place, so he takes you under his wing. By the end, you really get a sense of the amazing community in old Delhi. I was a bit nervous before the trip about travelling solo as a female, but Dhruv made me feel right at ease. I highly recommend this tour to anyone! :D"
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,juliemwalker40,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Once in a lifetime experience,"We had a great small group (6p) tour with Anju! The tour started a little slow on the outskirts of Old Delhi, and we were a little uncomfortable interacting with the residents that Anju introduced us to (felt a bit exploitive like poverty tourism?). But after a while it was clear she was well-known throughout the community and really genuinely showcasing the sights, food, and interesting people of Old Delhi. We learned a TON, saw places we never would have gone on our own, rode on rickshaws and cattle carts, and ate delicious food (and no one got sick). Sometimes it could be hard to hear Anju or keep up with her in the crowd, but it wasn't a huge problem. We saw several different kinds of Havelis and had a delicious lunch at the end. I can't imagine exploring Old Delhi on our own without being intimidated or getting lost. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Delhi! It was definitely a highlight of our time there."

I never felt rushed or unsafe in Old Delhi. It’s such a mesmerizing place, filled with people on their daily tasks and journeys. We tried delicious snacks and also chai tea; and topped it off at a lovely Haveli home where we experienced the kind hospitality of the host and a delicious home cooked meal. The time few by so quickly."

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Gerald B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Amazing Old Delhi,Very good tour with Varun guiding us around Old Delhi. A most amazing place - the life of a city out on the streets and laneways. A must see. It is a test of all your senses. Varun took us places that you would never go - culminating in a meal in a haveli. The only way to experience Old Delhi.

Very rarely in life are my expectations exceeded as much as our amazing day with Varun were. We felt honoured to be shown the real sights of Delhi from a local who not only knows but loves his city. The history was fascinating, the food was out of this world and we felt completely looked after the whole day. This is more than a tour, it’s a sensory experience that will take you straight into the heart of India, and make you fall in love. Special thanks to Varun for being such a wonderful, knowledgable, kind and welcoming host, we won’t forget you!"

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,deepti,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,A mesmerizing tour of Chandni Chowk,"We spent a lovely morning exploring the streets and lanes of Chandni Chowk. Our tour guide Mr. Raj was full of interesting stories and anecdotes about Chandni Chowk. We visited the Fatehpuri Mosque, the Spice market, the flower market, Mirza Ghalib's house and several off the beaten track spots of Chandni Chowk. We also sampled delicious local food including pooris/chole and halwa. The tour ended with a home cooked meal at Master Ji Ki Haveli.

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,crashlander8,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Perfect Golden Triangle tour to Agra and Jaipur with Dhruv,"As a first time visitor to India, Dhruv made my experience doing the Golden Triangle, Delhi, Agra and Jaipur smooth and very stress free and very enjoyable.  The local guide he arranged in Jaipur, Mahadev was especially superb. Druv was very responsive to questions (at all hours) and last minute schedule changes at my behest.  All in all, he’s excellent and I would highly recommend."
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,crashlander8,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Great overview of south New Delhi for first time visitor to India. Would definitely recommend Dhruv Gupta,Dhruv arranged a full day tour for two of us in south Delhi.  We hit all the highlights but the guide also made some other suggestions based on our interests.  Ms Parveen (the guide) was very accommodating and knowledgeable of Delhi history and just extremely nice to spend the day with.  Highly recommend both guide and Dhruv.
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,experience77,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,A morning well spent in Old Dilli,The reason I signed up for this tour was to get a feel of old delhi from a local. And that’s exactly what I got. Raj walked us through alley’s of old delhi and contextualised the buildings with stories. We had an unforgettable breakfast of Chole Puri Halwa and home made lunch at Masterjee ki haveli. To top it all Raj captured the moments in his camera and shared a photo album of the visit.
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,TomoHoku,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,Harmony in our Journey,"It was indeed as “Gold” as it can be! Our trip had to start from Kanpur due to some family functions, but Dhruv made it possible with so hassle at all, with all the comfort - luxury car, water, toilet papers (yes!) , snacks, fruits, and of course, the greatest hospitality by our driver, Surya. Rides were all smooth, and at each monuments we got to meet wonderful & knowledgeable guides who made our time so much more memorable. I felt a great teamwork of this company - from the coordination, driving, guiding, decision making, accommodating, everything! They are all very attentive on what we like, and try to customize depending on our preferences! It’s like a great symphony orchestra with a talented conductor and musicians - what a beautiful harmony :) And, speaking of harmony: Throughout India, I was able to feel the beautiful harmony in different cultures, different colors, different food, and different people, thanks to Dhruv and his on site team, we were able to have such fantastic time. I have been in India for many times, and I can say from the bottom of my heart, that this tour company offers THE BEST EXPERIENCE that sure last as the most amazing & priceless  souvenir to take home.Thank you Dhruv :) Thank you Surya :)"
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Crickette,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Old Delhi Hospitality & Terrific Tour,"Educational & entertaining tour of Chandni Chowk with Dhruv (who grew up & still lives there).  Dhruv is a magician who made one of the most congested areas of the world feel welcoming and accessible.  From religion to retail, scrumptious food to murmurating hobby pigeons, ruins to haveli, he showed us more facets of Old Delhi than we could have imagined.  He showed us how to discern the still-existing bones of humongous mansions behind the facades of their endlessly subdivided units, evoking the ghostly beauty of a few short centuries ago.  Wonderful bonus:  Dhruv is an excellent photographer who takes copious pictures so you don't have to and he shares them with you for free!  Take this tour in the morning and see the Red Fort and Jama Masjid at your leisure in the afternoon.  Highly recommend."
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Dawn F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Rave review about Raj Dhar's tour of Old Delhi,"This tour was OUTSTANDING. I have been on many tours and in many different countries but this tour was exceptional. Raj Dhar leads a tour that is inspired, authentic, interesting and truly heartfelt.  He is a lovely person and really connects with his guests with his genuinely friendly and warm manner. He welcomed our group into Masterji Kee Haveli for a delicious lunch as if we were his long-time friends. He is an exceptional host and guide. I cannot sing his praises loudly enough. Bonus - he takes great pictures throughout the tour and shares them on the same day. I would give him and 10-star rating!"

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Seniorbird,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Hugely enjoyable and informative half day tour of Old Delhi,"Greatly enjoyed this half day walking/rickshaw tour of Old Delhi. Raj was incredibly knowledgeable about his home patch, including the socio economic aspects of life there. He had lots of great stories to tell and little snippets of information you won't get anywhere else. The tour itself was comprehensive in that it covered food, bazaars, archtecture and history.  Raj knows all the characters in the alleys and streets and we felt completely safe as two single ladies on this tour.  It was an honour to be invited into the beautiful old haveli home of one of the founders of the company for a delicious home cooked lunch to finish the tour. I left feeling like I knew so much more about life in Old Delhi . Of course, we were invited to buy spices and speciality tea, jewellery and shawls at some point on the tour, which my tour companion was grateful for as she needed gifts to give back at home, but there was no compulsion to purchase anything. At the end of the tour Raj arranged our onward transport and negotiated a price for us with the auto drivers which was appreciated. He's also a crack shot with his camera and took photos of us throughout the tour, which he shared with us online later that day. It's nice to have photos of myself as I'm a solo traveller and so never have any photos of me!  Thank you Raj and Dhruv for a great experience! "

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,TomoHoku,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Best Experience in India,"“Peace Begins with a Smile” is my favorite quote by Mother Teresa, and I bring these words everywhere I travel. Today, Varun, our “brother” for the 4 hour walking tour welcomed us with a great smile! And he continuously made us smile by showing the true culture of everyday lives in Old Delhi - all five senses were awakened the whole time with amazing local food, exciting stories, historical knowledge, funny jokes. and most of all, great hospitality. Brother Varun made sure that we were all safe in the very crowded & narrow streets, yet gave us a chance to freely explore at our comfort levels.At the end of the tour, we were invited into the beautiful Haveli, like a family. With the best chai and best home-cooked Indian food, I remember what Brother Varun said in the beginning of the tour “you could find heaven on this earth.” Maybe the heaven is where you are surrounded by good friends and family, with warm hospitality, and appreciating different cultures with smiles.It was easily my best tour experience in India. And it’s all thanks to Varun and Dhruv."

I have many stories tied to moments from our time wandering the markets, sampleing street food and taking in sights all over the place. From the crowed spice makret to the tops of buildings for a bird's eye view and lots of allyways inbetween - this is an expereince not to miss and Dhurv is the guide you want to show you the way. He points out the little things happening around you like the father and son stringing beads to make malas. You'll enter temples and mosques through ornate doorways. You'll get a feel for what the old Haveli's could have once been.And you'll end the tour so full of the many street foods you've tried and fuller yet from all your eyes, ears and other senses have taken in."

Our wonderful guide, Raj, was lovely, and took us to places we would never have found on our own to eat the most delicious local food which safe and prepared right in front of us. Raj was so knowledgeable, and taught us about the history of Old Delhi and showed us so many unique and wonderful places. We then went back to Dhruv's beautiful home, where his wife cooked us a meal that was one of the best things I've tasted in my life. Dhruv and his wife were very welcoming, and we had the best day. We couldn't recommend this trip more for experiencing the best Old Delhi has to offer from a local's perspective."
Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Jongtu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Easy to see why it is number 1.,"Raj was extremely professionally and knowledgeable throughout the tour. He was happy to indulge my questions and to even deviate the tour if we had already been places. With him we were able to see a lot of Delhi I had no seen previously, we were able to chat to the locals, and even cook some food at a street vendor. Going back to Dhruv's house was something extraordinary as well, seeing a traditional Indian home that has been in his family longer than my nation has existed is surreal. Also the food I had there (the cauliflower and potato) brought a tear to my eye (no word of a lie, if you are reading this review please send me the recipe). It was a great experience and very evident why it is the number 1 cultural and food tour in Delhi."

He made sure we had a place to sit when we got tired, and we were never wanting for food and drink. We’re so glad this was our introduction to Delhi. If you’re thinking about it because you're reading reviews, you should definitely book this tour. We’d do it again in a heartbeat. Thanks, Varun and Dhruv, for an unforgettable day!

My afternoon I spent with Varun was my first in India and it was an excellent introduction to the country, it’s history, culture and more specifically Old Delhi. The tour was well thought out, detailed, humorous, personable and most of all, fun! Certainly one of the the most enjoyable walking tours I’ve done. Highly recommend for all travelers that are looking for a local feel."

There is so many delicious street foods to try along the way, so make sure you come hungry! But then after walking around the area, you also get the pleasure to visit Dhruv’s BEAUTIFUL & historic private residence in the middle of Old Delhi where his wife cooks you a delicious traditional meal. This experience is full of culture, history, and a whole lot of food to keep you more than full for the rest of the day - what isn’t there to love about an experience like this?!"

There were so many varying surprises around every crook, cranny, and staircase. From the spectacular rooftop pigeon flights, to the skilled gem and silversmithing, to the quiet and intricate jain temple and so many more sites along the way this was truly an experience. Finishing with the historic haveli, it was an oasis of classic charm with a tasty meal as we reflected on our day. It was amazing."

His local insight and knowledge was as valuable as it was fascinating. Always patient and ready to answer questions he gave us a real insider’s view of Old Delhi and its thriving, bustling and seemingly-chaotic community… which all seems a little less chaotic as he explains the inner workings of it all. Truly a memorable tour from a fantastic guide.. and the food was amazing, too.. particularly the end of tour meal in a traditional haveli. Highly recommended!!"

My tour guide Anju was SO knowledgeable, kind and such a fun person to hang out with. She taught me SOOO much about Indian culture and I would do this again in a heartbeat.I am actually planning my next trip to India because of Anju. I cannot recommend Masterji Kee Haveli tours enough. I saw wild sights, tasted incredible food, was privileged to serve food at a Sikh temple and really experienced and learned what it is like to live in Old Delhi. The history of India is painfully beautiful and I absolutely admire and respect the culture of this incredible country. Thank you Anju for the priceless gift of knowledge and experience. I will carry your passion for life and living with me wherever I go."

Immerse yourself in the craziness and colour that is Old Delhi with a guide who is born and bred in the area. We could never have covered so much ground without him! Raj catered to our interests and made us feel connected to Old Delhi rather than distant tourists. Probably the best food tour we've ever done."

I don’t think you can state that you visited Delhi if you did not walk Old Delhi. It was everything and more than expected. My local expert Anju was amazing - showed me places I would not have ever even think existed, introduced to some local Old Delhi people and their stories, ensured I had an opportunity to try different street food (writing this review 2 days after my tour - all good - even though many will warn you to be careful, the ones we tried were safe), and so much more. It was definitely not your typical tour “look left, look right, look up”. You DO get to walk and ride Old Delhi as a local. I think it was one of the most amazing experience I ever had while traveling. I did travel to over 75 countries. A MUST DO when in Delhi."

The tour provided the opportunity to try some amazing food! The breakfast was a real experience,  and absolutely delicious. It was so good to talk with the locals and learn their stories.I especially loved trying the food that was being cooked on the street and interacting with the men that were cooking and preparing the food.Old Delhi is a labyrinth of winding alleys, interesting temples, and friendly people. Visiting the spice market and hidden flower market in Chandi Chowk were highlights.Lunch in one of the private homes, a beautifully restored Haveli, was incredible and  my favourite meals in India!Raj was an outstanding guide, very informative, and an excellent photographer, recording our adventure for posterity!This tour is a “must do” the next time you’re in Delhi ."

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Carl W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Delights and insights Old Delhi,"The food was amazing - so much food! So often I have a ton of questions when I’m in a new place that go answered, however today I could ask anything from spices to pay scales in the market and we had delightful conversation. So interesting to visit with a shop owner  who you would never guess owns hotels in America - yet throughly enjoys this market life here where his career began, to a young lady who owns her own shop and had to dress as a boy in her younger days in order to navigate the “man’s” world.   The  incredibly ornateJain Temple was astounding!  The whole experience was not just an excellent value, but so educational. This immersive experience was not a “poverty tour”, we saw again and again how people were successfully providing for their families with lots of grit  and ingenuity. The photos Dhruv took of our group were an incredible gift in and of themselves. It was so very very nice not to have to worry about paying or tipping here and there as our guide took care of all of that. I can’t recommend this experience high enough! This adventure added so much authentic richness to my India visit."

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Eastman,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Mom and daughterphotogrpahy tour.,"If I only had one day in Delhi, this would have been enough. Dhruv lead us down Old Delhi's chaotic roads and winding side streets with ease and comfort only a local can posses. From the early flower market visit, to the bustling spice and paper markets, we saw it all. When the drizzling rain got heavy at times, Dhruv would vanish us into some hidden mosque or temple or delicious street food hideaway. He had stories for everything and we learned far more than we set out to. I cannot recommend this tour enough!!"

Dodging cows, rickshaws, motorcycles, we climbed up hidden staircases to view flower markets and speak at length with dwellers in this ancient hive. We ate street food and watched hundreds of loads of cardamon. water chestnuts, marigolds, and bananas disappearing on mens backs into the alleys. From a street full of wedding finery and an ancient Jain temple we experienced the full history of this ancient neighborhood.We ended with the privilege of being entertained by lunch in a private exquisite havelis. The warm welcome we received everywhere with our local guide unlocked the many secrets of this chaotic adventure."

Varun introduced me to delicious street foods that were safe to try (as well as protips on what to look out for in choosing street food). He also introduced me to everything I wanted to know about India, from its culture to Hinduism to its history, I left the tour feeling enriched and better learned about the country! And most of all, he's very friendly and personable. I felt at ease with him and was glad I had him to show me the ins and outs of Old Delhi. All in all, a 5 star experience!

Dhruv took me away from the beaten track followed by all tourists to see ""his"" Old Delhi, the city he grew up in and where he lives.

Old_Delhi_Bazaar_Walk_Haveli_Visit,Anne P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Summer day in Old Delhi,"Had an amazing day going around Old Delhi solo with Anju, who really knew the ins and outs of the old city. It was excruciatingly hot, but they provided water, electrolytes, and delicious candies to make sure I was comfortable throughout the day. The tour is truly more of an insight into the every day life of Old Delhi, trying food, popping into locals homes and stopping by the shops and people the guides have gotten to know over the years. Like everyone I’ve met so far in Delhi, everyone was beyond welcoming, asking you to refer to them as a ‘friend’ and bringing you for lunch in Dhruv’s home. Really loved the tour, and have even gone back to some of the stops along the way… I still haven’t had a better lassi elsewhere after 2 months in Delhi (guess you’ll have to go on the tour to find out where)On another note - I’m vegetarian and have a severe peanut allergy (oil as well). They were super conscientious of it and made sure to check in with all of the vendors to confirm!"

Guide customized tour to what we wanted to see and spent extra time with us. We saw copper, sandalwood, jewelry, temple, spice market, and more. Food was delicious, safe—best cauliflower I have ever eaten (at end of tour)! Would love to do this tour again with others as there is so much to see in Old Delhi. The Muslim and Hindi influences were incredible. Don’t be afraid to ask for bathroom breaks, water, etc. I hope to do this one again!!"
