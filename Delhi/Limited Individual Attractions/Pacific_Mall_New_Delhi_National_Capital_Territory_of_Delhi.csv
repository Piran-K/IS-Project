It has large selection of dining, shopping and entertainment joints to keep you entertained and well fed. It has most of the big brands in house. Only downside is I was unable to find a pharmacy in the whole mall. "

Pacific_Mall,Jam4ika,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful mall,"This Mall was chosen by us for early shopping in India. Why? Because there is a SPAR supermarket (hard to call it a ''hypermarket"" because it is not that big) where we buy all food to take back to Russia. We picked this Mall from others because it is really nearby the metro and we made only one change in the metro (to go back to the Railway Station/ Airport Line). The mall is very posh and beautiful with plenty of good shops. We visited it in the morning so there were almost no people. Food court isn't cheap but there are lots of choices from momos to pizza! Toilets in the Mall are clean. I even found toilet paper there! Can you imagine this???? All in all the impression of the mall is very positive: good location, clean, esthetically decorated and spasious. The only problem is that it is not correctly marked on Google maps (it placed nearby some other station)."

Pacific_Mall,punz jain,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Will never go again.,It was a terrible expirence. I went there with my 4 year old son and my wife. Very bad traffic jam due to no parking availability in the mall or nearby area. Mall is located on the main road but close to very dirty sabzi mandi. Entry to the mall was very crowded and the security ppl were helpless or untrained ( probably they were tired trying to explain visitors the whole day). Crowd was also not very great. We managed to get parking half km away on main road ( doubt in for vehicle being parked at wrong place).cirstly went to the outdoor park which looked great. Ticketing policy wasnt great as they watch to buy atleast 5 rides for 500 in a combo. 3 rides were not a part of combo and 3 were not working. The worst part about the park was there que system and operators.i m sure any of the operators arnt even 4th class pass because the handeled kids such a bad way. They could not mange parents who very trying to board-unboard kids on rides out of the mis managed que. I really got furious. 2 things which really left me crazy were  : 1. On a merry go round ( slow speed) the operator changed  places of kids without stopping the ride and the parents wanted it.2. On some other ride.A que of children was made inside the fence in the ride area which was so dangerous. Any mishap is not far away. I would seroiusly want to mall authority to check this and have his licence suspended till the owner is able to get right staff.Wasted one ticket after all this. To top it all I hardly saw any parent questioning them on the same!!!We went inside.  Mall was gud but not many stores as they have only 3 floors. Very crowded. Not recommended to go on holiday.Dissapointed..

Pacific_Mall,Vibroxx,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Best in West (Delhi),"Skirting in downtown West Delhi is every shopper's paradise. The massive Pacific Mall is the most happening and the largest shopping center in west Delhi and is multilevelled that houses a whopping 200 plus stores including many international brands. Even if you aren't interested in buying anything, a visit to this immense retail center is a must. The Pacific Mall also contains numerous entertainment facilities, such as bowling (Bluo Express), a movie theatre (PVR) and several kid-friendly attractions, inside and outside of the mall. Has a massive food court to satisfy your hunger needs. The best way to get here is to take the metro to Subash Nagar Station and this mall has also got a big parking. The Mall (and everything within it) opens its doors from 11 a.m. to 10:00 pm daily and food courts are open till 11:30 pm. You don't have to pay to wander about, but certain attractions in the mall will charge admission."

Pacific_Mall,Whaaatislife,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Best Mall in West Delhi,"Pacific mall is one of the best malls in West Delhi. Almost all the good brand are available in this mall. The parking is huge as well and recently the parking has become free of cost.My suggestion would be to avoid going there on the weekends as it gets quite crowded.They have also started setting up Flea Market in the open area of the mall which is a crowd pleaser. Moreover, they have a kids zone outdoors with a few rides and attractions for the kids which makes it a hit amongst families.They have a huge food court with a lot of food options to choose from.This is my go to place for shopping!"
