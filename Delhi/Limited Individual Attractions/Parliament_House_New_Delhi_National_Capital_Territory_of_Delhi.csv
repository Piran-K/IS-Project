Parliament_House,podrozniczka60,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Beautiful complex but no easy access. See it from the outside,It is a distinctive and magnificent building complex. A true classic in its style and architecture. Best to see it externally. Between the intense traffic and the place being heavily guarded the direct access is practically impossible. Admire but from the outside
Parliament_House,NVKOnTheGo,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Better view on TV screen!,The entire area is cordoned off and so we were not allowed to go anywhere near the building. The view from a distance didnt do justice to its grandeur. The visit was so poor that the BSF posted there even shoo off cars dropping the visitors. Things should be managed better and tourists shouldnt be shooed off like stray cattle!
Parliament_House,skagarwal74,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Nice evening visit,The best way to reach here is to get down at Central secretariat metro station and walk down. The view at night is beautiful after the buildings are lit.
Parliament_House,sanjayvora45,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Circular in shape,"Edwin lutyens had designed this building in 1912, and construction was completed in 1927.

Parliament_House,annehA4231CL,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Evening visit,"We are arrived at about 6 in the evening and it was a quiet time to view the magnificence and scale of these buildings. We noticed a sign that a light show was to start at 6.30 pm and this covered the buildings in various hues of colour making it all the more striking. it is certainly one of the main sights to see, the grandeur of the architecture from colonial times and so at odds with the drama of other parts of the city. "
Parliament_House,jjcoffman,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Enjoyed the architecture,"While in the area for India Gate, our driver drove us by so we could see the beautiful building. The flowers and areas near by make it a lovely spot. "
Parliament_House,NafeeTA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Architecture worth Viewing,"We didnt have much time on our hands so we just viewed it from the outside. However, the whole place is designed so majestically, very easy viewing on the eyes. It is very close to India Gate, so worth taking a stop to get a view if you are near that area."

Parliament_House,Dan L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,The Sansad Bhavan,"This is an impressive building, equally as impressive as the Rashtrapati Bhavan the former housing the Parliament and the latter, the President of India. It was constructed between 1921/1927. As with many other buildings and attractions, we had to be satisfied with a drive past on 7/10/19, barricading and armed security everywhere. Apparently it is possible to obtain a general entry pass if the House is not in session. Grandiose."
Parliament_House,israr mansuri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Nice,Indian parliament is one of the best place in India to know our history and lovely place it was .located in sansad Marg New Delhi 
Parliament_House,A R Kohli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,India’s Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha both Houses of Parliament,"This is an architectural beauty and a circular building. British had made it in 1920s. Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, members transact business here for discussions and former making laws for the Indian democratic Republic.

Parliament_House,theflyingdoctor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Tour group drive oast,Security is tight in this area for understandable reasons. Buses are not allowed to stop so 5his is only a drive past. Fascinating to be at the centre of the world’ largest democracy. 
Parliament_House,Linda Y,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Sansad Bhavan,"Designed by British architect Herbert Baker for the Legislative Assembly, construction of circular Sansad Bhavan was completed in 1927. Today it houses the Indian Legislature, including the President, the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). Historically the building is important because it was here that the Constitution of India was drafted. You’ll have to settle on viewing from a distance as sandstone railings prevent visitors from getting too close. On the day I visited, the road was still blocked off from the January 26 Republic Day celebrations."
Parliament_House,kattullus,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Circular building feeling quite modern,Interesting circular building being a light coloured contrast  to the other official red sand stone complexes in the area with their formal majestic style.
Parliament_House,JEAN B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Large impressive building,Parliament house is a circular building where the Indian Parliament meets for sessions and functions. It consists of an open verandah with 144 columns and is surrounded by large gardens which are fenced off by sandstone railings. It’s architecture along with the other government buildings nearby is quite impressive. It was designed by the British architects Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker in 1912-1913. It is located in the north western side of the Vijay Chowk. We couldn’t get access the day we went as there were lots of police around moving you on because they were preparing for a special occasion. It is quite a large area to walk around all of the government buildings. It is open 11 am to 5 pm but closed on Sundays and Mondays.Depending on where you are it is easily accessible by tuk tuk or rickshaw (remember to haggle price as they do try to charge foreigners at least double what it should be.) Central Secretariat is the nearest metro and if you like walking India Gate is not too far away.
Parliament_House,Ethelberga H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Only Good For a Drive By,"The Indian Parliament buildings Upper and Lower, are inaccessible and you cannot get very close. Our taxi mangaed to stop on the road side so we could take some pictures of these British Raj buildings but police are there to move you on. The buildings do look interesting but as you cannot go inside the visit seemed a waste of time."
Parliament_House,Annette A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,"Interesting buildings, very spread out over huge grounds","These government buildings are well worth seeing. You won't get very close, as security is tight, but the The Sansad Bhavan is the name of the House of the Parliament of India. This building contains the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha located in New Delhi for both lower & upper houses of Parliament & is quite spectacular in size and setting amongst the grounds you can see from the road.The architecture of the Indian Parliament is impressive, and has history dating back to British era.The fountain in the midst of the main road plus the gardens and green areas of lush grass, make for a pleasant look at Delhi, after the normal street sights.Recommend to drive by & take a ""look-see."""

Parliament_House,TrevB56,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,great buildings,the symmetry of these buildings is pretty impressive - the two main buildings are like mirror images and even the ornamental pillars with the black ships atop fit into the symmetry. Usual opulence that you find for parliaments across the world - hopefully not as wasted on the local politicians as it is in some countries :-). Can see the Presidential Palace from here which is another massive complex of over 300 rooms (bet they have a cleaner lol)
Parliament_House,Rasheedur Rahman Shihab,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Prominent Building,One of the few prominent buildings in the National Capital. I always have a dream to come to this place regularly by becoming a Member of Parliament.

Parliament_House,Kumar S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,Parliament House,"The architecture of the Indian Parliament is impressive and has history dating back to British era.

Parliment house is a nice architectural building and there are many other political buildings and nice gardens and fountains  nearby to be viewed
Parliament_House,Paul R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,"Grand, colonial leftovers","The Parliament and surrounding buildings sit in an area of broad boulevards and expensive views in New Delhi, where they were built as an administrative district for the British Raj. Along with the India Gate archway at the other end of this long, broad road, they do present an imposing scene with historic significance as well as a stark contrast to the chaotic and claustrophobic jumble that makes up much of the rest of the city. It's worth a look for a few minutes as part of a tour of the sights, but I would not categorise it as a must unless that specific aspect of history is your particular interest."
Parliament_House,Mehdi_Farrokh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Parliament House,Parliament House is just a regular governmental building and we just visit it from outside. India has much too see and we could not reach all by visiting this one inside.

The tight security will prevent you from going close to it but , if there is a special permission obtained to view the proceedings it will give you the goose bumps ! "
Parliament_House,Kim K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Impressive buildings built by the British,These impressive buildings can be seen from a number of different sides when driving through New Delhi.

Parliament_House,AndyMcGonegal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Imposing Buildings but Generally only Seen at Distance.,"The most imposing of the buildings is the huge round Parliament building.

Parliament_House,jonahNJ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,The distinctive round building,"This building in some ways reminds me of the Pentagon in Washington D.C.  The obvious differences are that that Parliament House is the meeting place for india's legislature and is round; the Pentagon is the headquarters for the U.S. Military and have five sides. However, both have a unique shape, flat appearance and are centers of power in their respective countries. Parliament House is located near a lovely fountain that is a centerpiece in this complex of government buildings. However, much lije the Presidential Palace in Delhi, visitors may have limited time to visit this area, but it is worth a brief walk or drive around to check out the center of India's government."

Parliament_House,Aman K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Parliament house,"The Parliament house is more beautiful than the extent. It's beauty can attract anyone more. But the point of attention is that due to security, you will not be able to get in. It can be seen only from the outside."
Parliament_House,Anamika K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,The indian powerhouse,The place where the country gets controlled. Visit this place only to add places in your visit list.

So when you visit india gate don't forget to look a peek.

Parliament_House,gentbrugg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Endless repeatability,"I can't say that  I really liked the Parliament building (Sansad Bhavan). Rather, this endless outer colonnade (there seem to be almost one hundred and fifty columns) gives the building a kind of monotony. Considering that the size of the building is quite large – nearly 200 meters, the endless repetition of one element really bores down the eyesight. For my taste, this is the least successful work of the British architect, shaped the appearance of the official center of the city."

Parliament_House,MikeFJones,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Parliament House - For Local History Buffs only!,"Not a very recommended stop to stop by, Parliament House is a relatively new area built around 1920-30. Mentioned maybe in some tours, but not a real touristic spot: You cannot go inside nor even walk around it. You will be only allowed to see it from the distance, and shot won't be so good as you may think. Recommended only if you are nearby India Gate or Canopy Monuments. Avoid spending more than 10 minutes on this place and move to your next spot."

You find a no-honking zone, widespread greenery, nice to look at buildings and just few people. It´s the complete opposite of old Dheli, and one can enjoy the tranquility and space. You can walk to the Gate of India from here."
