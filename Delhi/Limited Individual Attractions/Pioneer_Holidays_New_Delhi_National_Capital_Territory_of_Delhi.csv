Pioneer_Holidays,Jamie S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023 • Business,Taj Mahal day trip and tour of Agra sights by car,"Had a great day long tour of the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Mini Taj. Our guide Faizen was very knowledgeable and his explanations added depth to the tour and really brought the attractions to life. He also turned out to be a pretty good iPhone photographer so despite not paying extra for a DSLR photographer we left with some pretty good photos. Only area I would have improved was to be given the choice to visit the marble and pashmina shops. Although there wasn’t any pressure to buy, we would have liked not to have endured the sales pitches. Overall did not detract from the experience and I rated Faizen very highly - he was fantastic."
Pioneer_Holidays,Alex,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023 • Family,Exploring Agra with Nabeel & Aamir,"We had an amazing time exploring Agra with our tour guide Nabeel & driver Aamir.
