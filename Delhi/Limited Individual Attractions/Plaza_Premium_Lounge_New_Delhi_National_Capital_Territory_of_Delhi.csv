Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Betsy D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,An air of calm in a hectic airport,Crowded but a good oasis while waiting to fly.  Many food choices. Good Wifi.  Comfortable seeing.  Worth a visit.

Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Ajit KS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Great place for a good relaxed lounge,Good lounge with very clean facilities. Sanjay and his team did a very good job in ensuring that the place was well kept.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Akash,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Very bad lounge,This lounge is worst. No attendees. Also they have specific bank card acceptance policy. It has been shut at T2 DELHI for almost a year.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Parit Gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,I notice they are improving on each visit,"I have been using this lounge very often now and i find it upto the mark each time.At present Lufthansa and Singapore Lounges are not operational, so this is the only lounge that all people are using. Since it has higher footfall now than before so the company has started upgrading the F&B services. Now i see that they are serving better quality alcoholic beverages and also food."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Debadatta P,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Solo,Bad food. Uncomfortable,Bad food. Noisy environment. No foot rest. No massage or spa facilities. Travelling through Mumbai was so much better as the lounge there is top class.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Ankit M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,"Great hospitality, decent food","Delhi domestic lounge has 2 sections and luckily I was carrying Diners that gives access to the more exclusive section. We were a group of 5 and we were greeted by guest service officer Jitendra Gautam, who arranged for a table for the group. Usually no one really cares who is coming to the lounge, so I was touched by the gesture. Since we were with a kid, he helped us by serving the food and drinks at our table, saving us trip to the buffet. Overall a nice and comfortable experience while waiting for the flight."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Prasad_Siriwardena,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Solo,Average place,Good to relax during long waits. Foods are good   Reasonable ambience. Little congested. Staff are average. Average place need to improve
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Herman V,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Business,Most dissapointing airport lounge I have visited,"This must be the the worst lounge I have ever visited. No wine, only hard liquor or beer. Apparently because they have a problem with their liquor license (that's the excuse from the staff). There is nothing premium about this place."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Steve C,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Worst lounge ever. Reflects badly on Emirates.,"This is the lounge in Area A. Its one of the worst lounges I’ve ever had the misfortune to enter. No beer, no gin, no wine, very little food choice. Air Con was freezing. Entry granted on the back of an Emirates Business Class ticket. Emirates need to seriously think about not using this lounge. September 2022."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Tinkybelle,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Solo,Do yourself a favour and spend the money on some nice food elsewhere.,"I spent less than an hour in here. I had read the reviews (after booking) and didn't bother rushing to get there early. Let's start with some positives. The man at reception was quite friendly and welcoming. It's a relatively peaceful lounge and was not too busy today. There was no wait at the bar (it was a weekday). There were some cans of carbonated drinks in a fridge you could help yourself to as well as some non-fizzy drinks including water which were in glass dispensers. The view of the planes is quite nice. You can check the flight/gate info on a board near the reception desk. Okay, now let me tell you what I didn't like. The barperson didn't really greet me and looked almost surprised that I had appeared. She did not say a word to me and simply poured my wine in the same way you would fill a jug of water (as fast as possible) without a smile. It felt quite impersonal and almost as if the customers are a bit of a nuisance. I went to get some hot food and it just looked so unappealing that I just picked up a biscuit instead. There were loads of empty tables which were not cleared. Leaving so many glasses uncollected is an accident waiting to happen quite frankly. It also gives the impression that nobody is managing the place. I went to use the toilet but saw there was a long queue. Surely it should be easier to use the toilet here than out in the main departure area. Anyway, I felt I had totally wasted my money but was pleased I used it when I was on my own and not with my family (which would have been a colossal waste of money). I didn't think there was anything that interesting for kids. There is a much better area for them to play in the main hall. This lounge has potential. Whoever manages it should really read the reviews and just start dealing with the issues. I personally will never go there again (even for free, it's not worth the energy I expended taking the lift to get there)."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,J Barton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,Stay for one night if you can afford it.,"If you can afford to stay even for one night, do not hesitate. This is one of the best hotels in India with spectacular, dream like views of the Taj. The staff are exceptional and made all the arrangements for my family to visit the Taj Mahal; they made it so very easy for us and organised complimentary transportation by golf cart right up to the East Gate. This also gives one  protection from the enthusiastic street vendors who line the road leading up to the Taj. My only gripe was their flagship restaurant Esphahan, which I thought was a let down in terms of quality and quantity of food,  and left me with a sizeable bill which I thought was not justified."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Shazil Turey,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Friends,Mr Rinku,Best lounge with good staff especially Mr Rinku one of the best person in T2 lounge helping and kind hearted Love the all food provided by plaza premium lounge Happy with service and quality ❤️

Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Rouland F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Solo,Nice lounge,The T2 plaza premium lounge was very nice food was very good and of the Service boy Mr. Rinku singh very good person thanks again...
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,San T,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Bad treatment by Reception staff,"Usually I don't write reviews except when I have an exceptional one. This time, I had a real bad taste in my mouth that, I thought of letting everyone know.I had booked online and when I booked, there was only 1 room available for 2 persons. We are family of 4 and I thought of trying to get a room when I get there. It was not available, and that is not their fault. I asked them to give me two choices (1) Give the additional room after waiting 2 hrs when the room will become available (2) Cancel and give me refund- so that I can go to Holiday Inn Express - they had other people willing to take the room.The reception guy was so adamant that he wont refund, and he asked me to pay him lounge fee to sit there (the fees was more than the room) - and there is no washrooms, no food except coffee, no chairs where you can stretch etc. Since I didn't have a choice, I let him take for this ride. Then I told him that my son and I will sit in this ""lounge"" but we will use the bathroom which my wife and daughter have reservation for. He wouldn't let me do that advised me to use public restroom outside. I asked him whether you can check with his ""manager"". Not sure whether he checked or not but he said, his boss didn't agree that either. So I ended up in paying approx $100 and ended up in sitting there for 5 hrs, but went to the public toilets outside, ate in restaurant outside. My advise will be NOT to use this lounge, but try other options you can have.I am giving the TWO stars, because the the guy sho served coffee was nice and saw sympathy in his eyes for this ill-treatment of his customer.I am willing to give more direct feedback if someone from higher management wants to hear. I had used Plaza Premium in various airports, and always felt OK except that this one knocks me out."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Satish Kumar vijjapu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Lounge experience,Good ambience and nice food. Staff is so cooperative and especially Rinku singh is very nice person.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Kunal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Just average,"It is just an average lounge.No ambience, not much fod options.This property was great when I visited 2 years earlier in September 2019, but now it is worthless.All sitting arrangements have been changed, live counters have been removed.Very less options were provided for food."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Rahul Raj Aggarwal,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Business,A 3rd grade lounge,Chaotic and unorganised. Food selection is bad and the quality/taste very poor. Not befitting of international airlines lounges expectations
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Nibedita C,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Couples,Plaza premium in T3....Pathetic,"Post covid pathetic service. Lounge has become small inside.  The Mumbai and Bangalore lounge are 1000 times better. Very less staff, extremely limited food . No Frooty or Appy like in other lounge! Surprised that in all lounge fresh lime is complimentary.  But here they told its   chargeable.  Ambience not at all par with Airport! Do not know who is handling this, but in Mumbai Adani is doing awesome job. Pls improve your standards.  Banks pay a lot to you."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Sharva k,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Avoid Booking Here,Post Covid the facilities and staff have degraded dramatically. They have misleading booking options and staffs are both rude and untrained
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Naparat_Micky,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Business,Very small Prerium lounge 🤣,"Small siting area with drink and no food allow, first time in India feel the staff not pay attention when you asking questions,  a bit disappointed, too small siting area not feel like a lounge, even Prerium 🤣🤣🤣06/05/2022"
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Sameer C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Couples,Relaxing experience,This is the first time I've used this lounge and I had a pretty good experience. I used the nap room and had a shower while I was waiting for 12 hours. The room service attendant by the name Rinku was very good and polite and did not hesitate to answer any questions I had.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Sonic Prabhudesai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Convenient lounge with great coffee.,The lounge is great if you have a long wait before your international flight and are arriving at T3. The coffee made by Rinku is especially good and a must try!
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,abhay c,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Friends,Most useless lounge company,"Most consistently the most horrible lounge worldwide. I am forced to write this review as they have occupied all of the spots at airport leaving no other professional company any room to give a better customer experience. Over priced, unhygienic and cheap FnB. Cannot even sit here as full of mosquitoes."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Parit Gupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,"Nice Lounge, great F&B selection","I have been using this lounge for over 7-8 years now. The quality of service has definitely increased over years. This time i found that the options of F&B had improved a lot but the lounge was over crowded at the time of my flight.When asked for the reason for overcrowding, we learn that Lufthansa and Singapore lounges are not operational and hence all load is to this lounge.If i would fly non-Star Alliance , then i would be using the lounge again, in other case, i would stick to my Lufthansa Lounge at T3."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Dr.Prabhu,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Business,Welcome to  T2 Delhi Plaza premium Lounge . It was not Lounge it’s Plaza premium T2 MID DAY Meal 🥘.,Welcome to Plaza Premium MID Day meal   . New Delhi T2 Lounge. One of my worst experiences of lounge on earth is this lounge . Food OMG 🤦 Ambiance 🤦🤦. Coffee 🤦🤦🤦🤦
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Sangeeta K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,NEVER PREPAY!  Horrible Service,"I had a very bad experience with Plaza Premium Lounge as it seems they intentionally held information from and failed to inform crucial information.  It seems their plan is to take money and run.I contacted the Lounge several times over phone/emails ni prior to my travel.  I told them that I was travelling from USA (Newark NJ) to Delhi and would arrive at 9:30pm on Mar 29.  Since domestic flight was at 7am on Mar 30,I decided to prepay and book at the Lounge as suggested by the Lounge so that I could rest.  They requested prepay to guarantee space.  (When I reached there I found out that prepay was not necessary and there is enough space.After I checked her bags on Mar 29th as suggested by the airline, I was restricted to leave the area and hence could not go to the lounge.  The lounge sales personnel never told  me about this and were aware that bags were goingto get checked in.  I have no idea why they would hide this information.Since the lounge personnel did not clarify and inform even though they communicated regularly till I left, I requestedthe Lounge to refund as it was their mistake.  However they state that it was “NO SHOW” and so no refund.  Please note that I had no idea about this restriction and it was the duty of the Lounge personnel to inform.Please also note that the Lounge personnel were very responsive TILL I paid the money.  After I prepaid, they would not respond (before my travel).  In Summary, NEVER PREPAY and best to avoid this LOUNGE"
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,Setia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2021 • Family,Good,I did visited there last year in March. Food was also good. Staff was also coprative. must visited there again
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,nriish s,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 • Solo,Plaza premium Delhi departure,This is a review of the plaza premium at New Delhi domestic departures.Access: thorough travel via vistara J. You can also use priority pass and several credit card options as well as cash pay. Let’s star off by good- the staff is excellent. Very courteous and accommodating and looking after every need for each passenger. I spent about 4 hours at the lounge and I was asked if I needed anything at least 5 times!The food definitely has Indian flavor-I prefer local flavor while traveling to different parts of the world- so this is a plus! Now not so good.This is not a fault of the lounge but loud construction noise was present due to renovation at nearby food court. The lounge is relatively small and can get full- I did not feel it was overcrowded. Shower facility available but had to pay ~usd 9 (reasonable). Unfortunately flow of hot water was pretty slow.Recommendations for management: Kudos on your staff but the lounge may benefit from some minor renovation/ fixing wall papers and paint in areas near shower room and fixing simple plumbing issue to earn better review.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge,RSM,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Couples,Really sub par facility - how is this a “premium” lounge?,"We are traveling on American Airlines business class to JFK. Am horrified with this lounge that is offered to business travelers and prefer to sit in the general waiting areas. The place is dark, dingy and the food is revolting - you might get sick. How is this an airport lounge and premium????"
