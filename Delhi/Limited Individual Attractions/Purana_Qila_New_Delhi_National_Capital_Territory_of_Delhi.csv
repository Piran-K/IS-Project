Purana_Qila,Reyan11,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Old fort,Also known as sher fort it is one of the oldest fort of India. Lover visit this place & spend time here
Purana_Qila,Monika Jain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Friends,Lake,Amazing place to visit in delhi. Loved to visit again this place soon with my friends and family after the lockdown🌼
Purana_Qila,Anjan Sengupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Just watch the Light and Sound Show,This fort has nothing much left except the ruins and a big lawn. The best part of this place is the Light and Sound Show named 'Ishq-e-Dilli' which is a must watch one in a life if you are in Delhi
Purana_Qila,InnaYYZ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Ancient Indian fortress,"The current day fort was built in the 16th century, and replaced structures, some dating back over 2,000 years before its construction. Best to go at night to enjoy the light and sound show."
Purana_Qila,umalaviya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Ishq e dilli-the light and sound show of Purana Qila,"We have heard a lot about light and sound show of Old Fort Delhi so we specially went to see evening light and sound show- Ishq e dilli in Hindi narration. The show covers the history of Delhi through its 10 cities, starting from the 11th-century reign of Prithvi Raj Chauhan to the present days. It also traces Delhi's connection with the mythology of Mahabharata and Indraprastha. The show was not up to the mark as far as projected images on the fort walls are concerned but we definitely enjoyed hearing the History of Delhi."
Purana_Qila,Praveen M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Lover's park,Totally new to Delhi went to Old fort (Purana Qila) and disappointed with the people around us. It is just a place for lovers to make love and we felt uncomfortable to move around in the park being a tourist couple. I would not recommend this to tourists and prefer Humayun tomb or Red fort instead. Just don't waste time.
Purana_Qila,Soumya P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Light and sound show review,Only went there to see the 7:30 pm light and sound show- Ishq e dilli.While the concept is very good however the quality of the show was fairly average. The projected images on the fort wall was not very clear. The audio and narration was very good and We enjoyed listening to the history of Delhi..
Purana_Qila,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Definitely worth visiting when in Delhi,"Purana Qila is a fort complex thats thought to have been in use in various guises since the 5th century BC and possibly even mentioned in the Indian epic, Mahabharata. The most interesting buildings in the complex are the Qila-i-Kuhna Mosque, Sher Mandal and the museum. Definitely worth visiting when in Delhi, give yourself a couple of hours to see everything."
Purana_Qila,Sunil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Huge fort ,The place is very huge and it has its own history and best part will be the night view.It will be decorated with lights and music 
Purana_Qila,ghoomboom,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Back to the 15th century Delhi,Good historic place to visit is you take interest in history and archaeology. It is very near to Nizamuddin Railway station and just adjacent to Delhi Zoo. Nice fort with ruined walls and lovely surroundings. You can connect with history of 15th century India (Especially of Shershah Suri and Humayun) while visiting this place. There is a Mosque also inside the fort. And the famous structure (built by Shershah and used by Humayun as library) where Humayun fell down from stairs and died 3 days later. It is well maintained fort and there is a museum also that brings out the history of Delhi. The ticket price is for the the fort as well as the museum is very nominal. Light and sound shows are also organised every evening at around 6:30 or 7:00 PM. Don't be surprised if you find young couples displaying public affection as this place provides many secluded areas where one can be more adventurous.
Purana_Qila,Gurukohli,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Most attractions are inacessible and place is not tourist friendly,"I visited here on a cool December afternoon to learn the history of the early city of Delhi and early Moghuls. On the plus side , there is ample space within the attraction to walk around and the remnants of the old mosque, Qila Kuhna, are well preserved and a good example of Mughal architectureAll the other attractions - Sher Mandal, the Baoli , the 3 main doors and the ramparts of the Fort are inaccessible to public and that is disappointing. At one end of the Fort there are squatter settlements and abuse of a monument of such historical importance.No tour guides or information available as to it's earlier history as the ancient capital Indraprastha.If i was in Delhi for a short visit, i would give this place a miss"
Purana_Qila,GailWyness,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Ruins,"Pretty ruins of a Fort, much nicer than the red fort and surprising peaceful. For us this was the top attraction in Delhi."
Purana_Qila,coll612,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Loved this place- well worth doing,We loved this place- it was simply superb and with a guide was one of the top attractions in Delhi- dont miss this one when you are visiting 
Purana_Qila,ashishdeora123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,nice,one of the oldest and important forts in Delhi.  It is made of red sandstone  built by Sher Shah Suri  entry time 07:00 am to 05:00 pm. entry fee For Indians: Rs.20 and for foreigners: Rs.200
Purana_Qila,Jovial Holiday,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Delhi ka Purana Qila,"Purana Qila, the Urdu name fort Old Fort which was formerly called Shergarh or Sher Fort is one of the oldest forts in Delhi. It is made of red sandstone and has three arched gates. All the walls of the Delhi Old Fort, the Bada Darwaja, the Humayun Gate, the Talaqi Darwaja, the Sher Shah Suri Gate, the Qila-i-Kuhna mosque, the Sher Mandal and the Khairul Manazil make up a spectrum of history that echoes with the past."
Purana_Qila,Fiddi F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Romantic ruins ,"It’s a beautiful park with interesting historical heritage.But it’s looks rather neglected. When you’re paying 300 like a foreigner, you have lots expectations.Hiding kissing couples everywhere, curious dogs, some garbage, sudden constructions.No, it’s worth your time, but... I wanted to see something well-conditioned.Please be careful - flocks of dogs are rather scaring."
Purana_Qila,CHETAN CHOUDHARY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Family,Shan-e-delhi #1,"Purana Quila, Urdu for Old Fort also formerly called Shergarh & Sher Fort is one of the oldest forts in Delhi, India. The site has been continuously inhabited for 2,500 years and remains dating from the pre-Mauryan period have been found. The present citadel was begun in the time of Humayun and its construction continued under Sher Shah Suri. The site is often identified with the site of Indraprastha, the capital of the kingdoms of the Pandavas from the Mahabharata"
Purana_Qila,bizbull,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Summertime at Purana Qila,"I've been here earlier too and something tells me I am going to be there again soon :-)If you have young and enthusiastic kids OR wish to take a stroll with elderly, this is a place for you. It is nice and clean with mix of history and contemporary.Do make sure you are going in with good pair of sneakers as it takes good couple of hours to walk around and soak in the ambience. Lots of stairs to take around (optionally), if you wish to visit each and every corner of the place.Sometimes, it only takes little effort to enjoy magnificent things around us; you'll be sorely missing it if you give it a skip. But you may skip the lake for now; restoration work in progress when I visited."
Purana_Qila,MananAggarwal96,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Light and Sound Show,The light and show happens at the purana qila in 2 languages hindi and english.The old fort is used as the screen for the projecting the images.The fort itself looks beautiful in the evening!The show caters to the history of the rulers of Delhi!
Purana_Qila,Rkjrocks,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Old is Gold,We had a good time here walking around and enjoying the monuments in the campus. The surrounding is quite peaceful and you feel like spending a quality time here. The architecture of monuments is overall appreciable..

Purana_Qila,Food and Travel Gallery,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Historical Fort,"Located in old Delhi, near to Delhi Zoo. This is one of the best place to visit in Delhi. The place is photogenic. Crowd was average, no rush, the place was neat and clean and managed properly. At the exit there is one small museum which have some ancient artefacts related to this place. Entry is free. "
Purana_Qila,britabroad34,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Not worth going out of your way,"300 INR for foreigners or 250 INR if you pay by card (20 INR for locals). A few parts are closed and it won't take more than an hour to go round. As with everything here in Delhi, go early as it is too hot during the middle of the day and there isn't much shade."
Purana_Qila,Mr John,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Worth stepping down for.,If you are on the Hoho bus tour it is well worth getting down at this attraction to explore for an hour or more if you are into Indian history during the time of the mughals. Rupees 300 entrance fee for foreigners but worth it to spend time on a site steeped in history.
Purana_Qila,Nish_Wish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Doesn't disappoint,On a Delhi exploring trip. Purana qila stood to its heritage value. An experience that would leave you with memories.. I think it is truly something to not miss for the tourist and Delhi crowd alike 
Purana_Qila,Surabh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Ruined Place,I love to explore ruined place and this place is best for me there is many turnels you go inside and visit. But it's too risky
Purana_Qila,Rahul K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Not Recommended,"Worst place of Delhi if you are visiting a historical place. Terrible to watch. No maintenance and care of place had been taken, Archaeologist."
Purana_Qila,Nandita S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Shan-e-Dilli,Very beautiful fort. Only few parts open for public but still wort visiting. The light show in evening is awesome. Its located opposite to oldest market of delhi- chandni chowk. 
Purana_Qila,Julie B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Fabulous Old Fort,"This is a fantastic old fort in Delhi - well worth the visit, It also contains a hidden gem, a lovely little mausoleum. Looks great in the bright sunshine"
Purana_Qila,Bala Tripura S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,Well maintained historical monument,"As the name suggests,purana quila is very old fort built in the period of Shersha Suri and there are a few monuments inside the fort complex like mosque,Baoli,Hamam etc.Most of these monuments are maintained well and the whole premises is take care of"
Purana_Qila,rashig,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Ishq-E-Dilli ❤️ - a mesmerising show ,"The visit and the show was like stepping into history...went here to watch “Ishq-E-Dilli” - a light and sound show about the history of Delhi - 7.30-8.30 pm are the show timings in May for the Hindi version and 9-10 pm for English. The Hindi version was good and authentic but had some difficult Urdu words. There were two songs, one of which was a thumri, both amazing. Though I’m not a history buff and this visit was dictated as part of school weekend homework thus forced in a way, I have to admit I enjoyed the unique experience in the open air under the stars. After all where do we or our children get such experiences nowadays? Even if they understand only 10%, I recommend. The walk from the ticket booth through the Bada Darwaza and to the seating area was long but bearable as the sun was down by then. Amongst other tips, you can consider parking right outside, we saw several cars there. Not sure if allowed but people park after sundown anyway. We parked at the zoo parking which is a short walk away. Try and book online though the ticket counter isn’t typically busy. And do grab your free Odomos at the show! It really works!"
Purana_Qila,prabhumss,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,"Uninterested ASI, seeped in History","We went to visit Purana Wila in March 2019. There are many monuments like Qila - i - Kuhna Mosque, Humayun Gate, Bara Darwaza, North Gate. Many are in decent shape . There is a well preserved space with trees and grass. There is a small museum but houses very interesting artifacts going back to Mauryan era. The place itself is soaked in history and perhaps myths too. The area is generally clean and is maintained by Archeological Survey of India.But what disturbed me were : near Humayun gate the residents ( perhaps allowed to stay by ASI  } had hung clothes to dry. This is really ugly and does no credit to ASI. In the museum as well as elsewhere in Qila no guide is to be found to show us around, there are a very few signposts let alone material to read. There are no souveners or books to buy in the Museum, It is as if ASI does not want any one to visit. Further there are no toilets nor drinking water. Such history and such neglect !My three stars are because of neglect."
Purana_Qila,Nins,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Riveting!!!,"One of the historical and beautiful monument to make a visit. The entry fee would differ for locals and foreigners. The beauty of this place is not just during day hour but even in evenings too, if you are planning to visit the light and sound show.This is one of the oldest historic site in Delhi but haven’t seen many visiting it. Its awesome for photography!! Loved it!!"
Purana_Qila,susanwalsh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Well worth visiting,This is the old fort ofDelhi and well worth a visit. There are extensive grounds and the remains of the mosque where Humayan fell to his death rushing to prayer. There is a lovely boating lake which was closed sadly
Purana_Qila,PipPaul W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Overshadowed ,"Overshadowed and overlooked by tourists who all flock to the Red Fort, which is a shame as this is an interesting place too.The carving and decoration at the mosque inside is beautiful and the stepwell is pretty impressive too.Nice interesting museum too, though would benefit from an updating of style "
Purana_Qila,Tarique S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,FORT THAT WITNESSED RISE AND FALL OF MANY SULTANS.,"Purana Qila has witnessed rise and fall of many Sultans and the amazing Light and Sound Show at evening narrates the history in a very gripping manner.

Purana_Qila,Dilip B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,For family fun,The fort originally lay on the bank of the river Yamuna before the river changed its course. The Purana Quila was built by Humayun in an attempt to build a city of his own. ... When Sher Shah defeated Humayun most of the structures inside the old fort were demolished and was renamed as.
Purana_Qila,G A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Must See Ancient Citadel,"Purana Qila is a highly under rated monument of Delhi.  I much prefer this to the Red Fort.Massive ruined ramparts from the Humayun era enclose an ancient citadel, one of the oldest of the many cities of Delhi.  On going excavations have unearthed evidence of even older periods.The extensive grounds and greenery make Purana Qila the perfect picnic spot on a chilly winter day, and of course a favourite hiding spot for the many young couples that can be found lurking in dark corners of the ruins ... until a guard shoos them  away :-)History aside, this is a good place to feed the many squirrels that scamper around, or for birdwatching.  You may also see a mongoose or two if you are lucky!The ambience is great, its right next to the Delhi zoo and easy to get to.   Purana Qila is most definitely one of the city;s best attractions.  I've been twice and I look forward to coming here again on another trip to Delhi.Note:  Do wear comfortable shoes as there is extensive walking.  It isn't really suitable for the disabled, but children will enjoy running around the many green spaces as well as exploring the ruins.  There are enough ASI guards around so it is quite safe.  There is a sound and light show on certain days."
Purana_Qila,Finhasali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,"Huge, marvellous !!","With Qila, baoli, mosque, tombs, garden, hammam (bathing place) etc, this site is truly amazing. Suitable for couples, friends, architecture lovers and whoever wants to spend their free time. "
Purana_Qila,Viraj T.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Being reconstructed,The area is still in the process of being reconstructed. Overall the lawn is well maintained but sadly is full of couples who fail to get a room!
Purana_Qila,Adira,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,A good hangout for family,A serene atmosphere with history running in every wall of the monuments. A nice place to spend an evening with kids and family. Normal timing is 7am to 5pm. A good picnic spot too with a very peaceful and beautiful environment.
Purana_Qila,StratosLFC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,one of the oldest forts in Delhi,Good place to walk and see all these buildingThe normal visiting hours are from 7:00 A.M. to 5:00 pmif its a sunny day you need a cap and cold water with youThe entry fee was small
Purana_Qila,Sugeet,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Nice Hangout spot and catching up place,"There is a newly constructed moat, which is nice, it's a stroll alongside a lake. You could them club it with the sound and light show. The fort is magnificent. It's a fine itinerary for catching up with friends. Tip: club it with some snacks in adjacent cafe Lota."
Purana_Qila,Neha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Nice,There is nothing Soo much to watch ... Only some monuments which was not properly mentioned... But if u want spend some time with your partner then nice place ... Recommended but for couples only
Purana_Qila,Kasturi B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,The worst Sound and Light show,"This sound and light show is an example of a worst show ASI can produce. It's not a sound and light show, it's a multimedia show which is very badly maintained. The projector lights have dimmed down. The whole show is narrative so you don't get the actual essence sound and light. Totally waste of time."
Purana_Qila,Aditya Mehta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Must visit for sound and light show,"Entry is from Bada Darwaza. The ticket counter mentioned cashless payment at a discount but refused to accept it and asked for cash payment only. Besides this the place was full of mosquitoes around sunset.Otherwise it's a large complex and you will need to walk a lot. All visitors were asked to leave at 5pm and go buy tickets for the sound and light show again.We saw the ""Ishq-e-Delhi"" in Hindi that starts at 6pm (re-entry from the Bada Darwaza at 530pm). This show is held at the Humayun Darwaza inside the Qila.And what a show. Excellent sound and content. A must watch. Don't miss it at all."
Purana_Qila,AshisGhatak,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,A slice of history,Much less publicised but the place does deserve attention. A good place for walk and savour the lessons learnt in history book. Better go at sunset time. It remains open till 5.30 in the afternoon but gate closes at 5. 
Purana_Qila,deepak t,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,Historically exquisite,"This is one of the oldest forts of Delhi. It may not be as popular as the Red fort but is equally mesmerising. The place has much to offer to all age groups. It is spread over a large area. You can walk around the ancient ruins, climb on some of them, stroll in the well maintained park area. you might also find a sketch artist and get a quick sketch done. In the evenings the place offers the sound and light show.The place has also hosted many cultural festivals too.It has a lake as well for boating enthusiasts, though it is mostly dried out in summers. The Delhi zoo is also right adjoining to it which you can visit if you are a nature enthusiast.If you get hungry from all the walking, you will find a proper food area just beside main entry. or if you want to really indulge yourself, cafe Lota is just around the corner as well.Entry fee: How to reach : get down at pragati maidan metro station and walk from there if the weather is pleasant or take an auto.Nearby places : Delhi Zoo, Pragati Maidan."
Purana_Qila,Ashish S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Nice visit,I will rate this as a nice experience as we got to see this place in actual of what we have read in this history books.
Purana_Qila,Catherine Louise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Fun place to walk around,"It’s a nice place to walk around, less restored than Humayan’s Tomb and the gardens are beautiful. Lots of ruins you can climb over. The old mosque has some really ornate calligraphy. We also heard the peacocks and saw them on the edge near the zoo. "
Purana_Qila,PushExplore,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Majestic. Historic,The Purana Qila Tour was nice. We enjoyed walking around the ancient ruins of the fort and it was surprisingly less crowded than what we had imagined it would be. Best to go when the weather is cooler and avoid weekends.

Purana_Qila,Chandan P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Refreshment of mind,"Being bored of the city noise and pollution, i decided to get to some peaceful place in order to refresh my mind. I googled and found purana qila nearest to me. I went there with my wife on a pleasant evening. We started roaming around the widely spread garden and seeing the marvellous monument,small underground tunnels. Walking on the high walls also made it a bit adventurous. We also went for a light show that evening which takes place in a temporary arrangement made by the administration. Ot was fantastic. We rested for a while and went for boating in small lake located next to it. Allover, we enjoyed a lot. This place is best if you go with your partner."
Purana_Qila,Anil1050,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Historically very important but most distorted .,Purana qila is in heart of Delhi. A very important monument in Delhi but the facts about it are mostly distorted. It is connected with Pandavs but hardly people are told about it. Excavation done recently confirms it's connection with Hindus but excavation stopped.Entry to this is badly managed from Main road.Sound and light show inside also doesn't talk much about its connection with pandavs except for a few lines.Boating facility outside is in doldrum for last few years.Need immediate action
Purana_Qila,NiteshSaxena,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,Sound n light show,"This sound and light show is much better compared to red fort ""sound"" show. But still not much is visible due to damaged walls are being used for projection. It clearly articulate history of Dilli. Kids don't enjoy it for sure."

Purana_Qila,Aakash A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Great Fort in Delhi,"Purana Qila is one of the great fort in Delhi. We had visited this Fort in April, 2018 and we have spent a great time. We have captured lots of pictures. It is adjacent to Delhi Zoo. It has a museum also which is next to main entrance. It is well maintained."

Purana_Qila,Rajiv Bajaj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Light & Sound Show - A Date With Delhi's History,"This is a review only for the Light & Sound Show, and not the Fort itself.We visited the place in the evening to see their Light & Sound show, which takes one through the history of Delhi. We had booked online a day in advance, and were a little worried because no confirmation mail or sms alert was generated. All we had was a screenshot of the confirmation which I had printed out. However, the staff at the ticket window was helpful and we had absolutely no problem.The show is held in the open, with plastic chairs laid out facing the ruins of the fort's walls. We had booked the 7 PM shown in Hindi. Since the place is in the open, and surrounded with greenery, there were hordes of mosquitoes everywhere - something that we were not prepared for. Fortunately for us, there were representatives of the Odomos company handing out free sample tubes of the mosquito repellent cream to everyone, which was a life-saver, and we promptly applied the cream. A smart way of promoting the product, I must say, since it offered an immediate practical demo of the effectiveness of the cream !When the show started, it was not yet dark, so initially the light effect and projection of images on the fort wall were not very clear. However, when it gradually became darker, the effects of the projection became clearer.The narration of the show was excellent and the commentary took us through the history of Delhi right from the ancient times up to the current time, bringing up vivid images alive on the walls of the ruins. It was well put together and highly engaging. The show lasts for one hour.Some tips, if you are planning to visit there for the show -1. If you are booking online, avoid doing it on a mobile - their site is not mobile friendly. Use a desktop instead, and have a printer connected to print the confirmation, as it may not generate a confirmation mail. The cost is Rs 100 per person.2. Avoid the early show, as initially the light effects will be lost if it is not sufficiently dark. 3. Be prepared for mosquitoes - hordes of them. Carry a mosquito repellent cream and apply it liberally on your arms and legs. You may not get as lucky as us as free samples of the cream may not be available on the spot !4. Parking for the Purana Qila is common with the Delhi Zoo. There is ample parking space, and public toilets are also available in the parking lot, though I am not sure how clean they would be.5. Be prepared to be accosted by beggars etc when you walk from the parking to the Old Fort. Keep your mobiles, ladies handbags etc secure."
Purana_Qila,Sayanti Dutta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Do not miss this place,"Amazing experience. In my numerous trip to delhi, I never visited this place. God Knows why. I'm so ashamed that I never visited this place before. Its a pure historical bliss. Beautifully maintained gardens and structures. The small museum is a delight to the history lovers. Though very moderately maintained, its a sheer delight to watch the historical relics from so many different periods in history. Not too many tourists. Hence, it's peaceful and not so crowded. Beautiful view of the city from the top."

Purana_Qila,seeker_here,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Glorious Historical Monument,The Purana Qila or the Old Fort is a testimony to the magnificence of Mughal architecture. It is located in the middle of the city and is easily accessible.
Purana_Qila,Ravi R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,Old architecture,"The Purana Quila or the old fort is one of the most captivating tourist sites that narrate the history of Delhi in details. Constructed by the Mughal emperor – Humayun, the Purana Quila is evidence to the glory of the Mughal art. The Purana Quila is situated in New Delhi and is said to guard the ruins of the city of Indraprastha that is mentioned in the Mahabharata.HISTORYKnown asDinpanah meaning the ‘refuge of the faithful', the Purana Quila was built between 1538 and 1545 by the Mughal emperor Humanyun. The fort originally lay on the bank of the river Yamuna before the river changed its course. The Purana Quila was built by Humayun in an attempt to build a city of his own. But characteristically, the Old Fort did not bear the name of its creator unlike the other emperors erecting such structure. When Sher Shah defeated Humayun most of the structures inside the old fort were demolished and was renamed as. But once again as Humayun recaptured his city from Sher Shah's son he took the task of completing the city and rebuilding its old glory.DESCRIPTIONThe Purana Quila is another reminder of the bygone Mughal era which excelled in architectural styles. The Purana Quila has three majestic gates:The Humayun DarwazaThe Bara DarwazaThe Talaqi DarwazaThe three gates are double storied and built with red sandstone. The Humayun Darwaza and the Bara Darwaza were the two gates that were open for entry inside the old fort. Entry was prohibited through the Talaqi Darwaza as the name suggests.Talaqi means ‘forbidden'The other two attractions at the fort site are:Qila-I-Kuhna Masjid,Sher Mandalthe small museumThe Qila-I-Kuhna Masjid was built by Sher Shah when he had captured the Purana Quila after defeating Humayun in 1541. The prayer hall is the most imposing part of the  masjid  that has five doorways with horse shoe shaped arches. The original plans of building the entire place with marble was jeopardized due to supply shortage. But the fusion of marble and sandstone has given the masjid a unique style.The Sher Mandal is now an observatory, octagonal in shape. The structure and style of the building suggests that the Sher mandal was built for entertainment purposes. The style and design of the building proves a definite coupling of the Muslim and Hindu architectural magnificence. When Humayun recaptured the Purana quila from Sher shah's son, he used the Sher Mandalas his own library.The museum at the gate of the Purana Quila has many artifacts recording the beginning and end of a glorious era of the Mughal period."

Purana_Qila,Rosalynde J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,"History, culture and calm in beautiful gardens!","Having seen the major cultural highlights in Delhi on previous visits we were looking for something a little different. This place fit the bill perfectly, steeped in history and superstition, continuously used for centuries and with an active archeological dig taking place too.  The museum is well laid out with lots of information and is not to be missed. Strolling through the gardens to each of the highlights, mosque, hammam, different for gates etc was a delight, so peaceful in the centre of a very busy but beautiful city.A ‘must do’ we would definitely return here.  "
Purana_Qila,abrp722,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,"A great place to visit, but be careful of local dogs.","If you are a history fan, you will be fascinated with this place. If you look for a nice and quiet place in the center of Delhi, you will feel exactly same. But there is nothing perfect in our world. If you are entering to Purana Qila through the Bada Darwaza gate, there is a small mandir (temple) of Shiv and Durga on the right hand side. I decided to take a closer look, took off my shoes (as recommended in India), and entered in. I was back in a couple of minutes and found that one of my shoes got stolen. I sat down on the grass not far from the mandir, and soon a dog came and took my second shoe. I followed the dog. It left my shoe at some point, but I did not find the first one around. I had no choice, but to take a taxi and go home. No fun!"

Purana_Qila,PatilChinar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Historic Significane,Purana Qila or Old Fort is a masterpiece even though there are few remains left of this historic place. The museum is small yet efficient and it points out to the day of excavation and some preserved rare artefacts. P.S: You may find many couples loitering around and making out in this vicinity. I hope the Government imposes a strict law against such pathetic activities happening in our country's historic ground.
Purana_Qila,Krapa Kartik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,A very good place,It's one of the oldest monuments considering the history of Delhi... It also has a baoli connecting to the Agrasen ki Baoli at cp... Entry is obviously closed but it's a beautiful place for a one time visit...
Purana_Qila,Alok2108,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,A truly must see piece of History.,"Went to this beautiful place on a Sunday...the entry to the place is alongside the zoo and it being a sunday it was heavily crowded...Managed to get the ticket after standing in the queue but was happy with the fact that the ticket arrangements and entry were well organised and controlled...the place is really a masterpiece and anyone who is a lover of history must go there...the museum inside is also really well kept and gives a lot of interesting information...the structures inside like the main gate , the Khuna Mosque, Humayun's library, Humayun gate, north gate and also the south gate are all magnificent structures,,,there is some kind of excavation work going on on the side of Humayun gate and that is also interesting...the only drawback of visiting this place on a weekend is that one should be prepared for a huge crowd which is there more for a general outing and get together and can be noisy...its a must see place to get an insight into a important part of the history of delhi...would love to go back on a weekday and enjoy this memorable place again..."

Purana_Qila,radsvijay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Where the emperor Humayun came tumbling down!,"The Purana Qila had its share of misfortune.  From Humayun to Sher Shah Suri, Akbar and Hem Chandra.  Their rule from this place was short lived.  The ruins still give a glimpse of the magnificent architecture of the past. "
Purana_Qila,Ema Datshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Most won't do this on a first visit,"Delhi has a LOT of sights to be seen and Purana Qila is not usually in the 'first division' of the city's attractions. If people have time to only see one fort, they'll go to the Red Fort but the older, more southerly fort of Purana Qila is well worth a visit.  It's located next to Delhi's zoo - which is a bit smelly unless the weather is very cool - and there's a lot to see. If you've been to Humayun's Tomb, this offers a chance to see the library whose steps the old fella fell down and met his death.There are a lot of old buildings, some well preserved, some less so, and pleasant gardens. Entrance is just 200 rupees for foreigners making it a bit of a bargain in comparison to the Red Fort or Qutab Minar but I'd suggest that unless you have a lot of time in Delhi, tick off the more famous ones attractions first."
Purana_Qila,HighHeelsPinkLips,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,"""Magnificent""","The might of the entrance gate gives you an idea about the beauty of the whole fort. Architecture is magnificent. Gardens are well manicured and premises are extremely clean. Staff is very helpful. Being a solo female traveller, I experienced some hiccups initially in the fort but the efficient staff made me feel extremely comfortable. The guard at the Humayun's gate literally stood there the whole time I was clicking photographs so as to ensure that I felt safe  as there were a bunch of rowdy guys at the same spot. He even handed me a pamphlet with the timings of the light show. Toilets are near the Humayun's gate. A small cafeteria exists in the middle of the fort where you can grab a small bite. Couldn't do boating ; would try next time."
Purana_Qila,vrn2002,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,"Old relics, not much to see.","One of the very old forts in and around Delhi, has historical significance but is largely neglected and not very well maintained. Nothing much left to see except Humayaun's tomb which is quite ordinary. Definitely not worth spending time here unless you have too much time to spare."
Purana_Qila,Mayank1512,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Old fort (literally old),"I was there on 24Dec17 with my friends. It's next to Delhi zoological park & both shares parking. Entry gate is made of wooden & really big. when you enter you can see a clean green park surrounded by plants & covering main building. but If you are in mood of discovering the whole area, you will definitely disappoint. It must be pride of emperor in Mughal era with attractions like its main building, bawli & large lawn, but now it's dying due to lack of care by the govt. authorities. It covers a huge area with big boundary walls & lake outside it which once used for boating by visitors, But now there is just dust with shrub & love making couples in corners of the boundary wall.Only main attractions are taken care but what about the whole area which could led to any accident."
Purana_Qila,Khushboo Gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Great historic place to hangout,Oldest monument of Delhi and nice historic place. It's big in area. There are ruins in huge area so we can easily spend 3-4 hours. Some risky path is there we can try if we love adventure. Entry ticket is Rs.15 only with museum so it's reasonable. I love walking so it's great place because of huge area. Outside many foods are available.
Purana_Qila,Sudhir Kalra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Deep in History,"Purana Qila is situated on Mathura road in heart of Delhi and next to Pragati Maidan, this is one of the oldest monument in the City and dates back to even Mahabharata period (currently ASI is excavating few portions to confirm the same). In its current form it was made by Sher Shah Suri in 1500 AD that is about 500+ years ago but it has older history. A must visit place for those keen on historical monuments."
Purana_Qila,Kartik M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Historic but Unmanaged,Purana Qila is a historic place to visit. For Indians it have an entry fee of Rs.15 per head which you can collect easily near the main entrance. Inside Qila there is also a museum which is small but interesting to explore.As you start moving inside you will find the place filled with chips wrapper and empty water bottles and could find the place unhygienic.Purana Qila also offers boating which is offered for a small period of time in a year. Inside Qila there is also a Baoli which is often dry.One of the great advantage of visiting this place is that we can have a good photo sessions here. Also if you are visiting this place with friends then you can do some group and fun activities.

Purana_Qila,kamakshi2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,The oldest Fort of Delhi !,This fort is perhaps the oldest fort in Delhi from the time of Mughal ruler She shah Suri . It has also been located close the Humauyn tomb - a great tourist attraction. The fort has been also marked as hostoric place because grounds here were used as refugee camp during the time of partition in 1947 . It is a historic monument and coming here is like reliving history by turning its pages . The access is easy and not much crowded . No dress code here . Must visit place .
Purana_Qila,Blabbott,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,A pleasant morning stroll,"This attraction may not get the attention that other sites in Delhi get, but it deserves a visit.

Purana_Qila,keith h,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,Worth Visiting for Historical Associations.,"Apart from imposing Bara Darwaza through which one enters the complex, there are few buidings intact enough to spend much time over. The other 2 gateways are intact enough to make photogenic.   However, the Qila-i - Kuhna mosque is well preserved & impressive.       The Sher Mandal tower is also pretty much intact & is, poignantly, where Humayun met an untimely end as he was mortally injured falling down stairs when hurrying to prayer at the muezzin's call.   Historically the site is steeped in history, being the place of Indraprastha, the Pandava Capital & was where Humayun was to construct his city, Dinpanah ( Asylum of Faith )   The grounds become a little scruffy towards the back walls where one can climb up & gaze at a vast car park & away to the city swathed in haze.   A scruffy cafe set in a dusty dip near the toilets sells snacks but for some reason no tea or coffee on my visit- no explanation available !   The whole site is walled & sits on a prominence, which allows a breeze to play."
