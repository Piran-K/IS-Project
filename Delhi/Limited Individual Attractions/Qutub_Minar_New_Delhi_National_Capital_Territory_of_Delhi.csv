Qutub_Minar,podrozniczka60,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,The tallest minaret - THIS UNESCO World Heritage Site,After visiting Jami Masjid it is good to compare your impressions with Qutub Minar. The latter is supposed to be the tallest in the world. It was built was built over the ruins of the former citadel. Qutub Minar is built with red sandstone in  the style of Indo-Islamic Afghan architecture.
Qutub_Minar,Riteshdelhi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Well maintained monument, good experience,  lack of public amenities","The monument is well maintained... with proper information available for visitors. Good for a 1-2   hour visit.Food at parking lot canteen was aweful and expensive. Tried bhelpuri, papdi chat and hakka noodle - all were not good in spite of being very expensive.Downside is amenities: *bathrooms inside premises was locked and not operational. * public toilet was available in parking lot but it is very smelly and not maintained well. What kind of impression will it have on tourist visiting India.   "
Qutub_Minar,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,A complex of buildings from the Delhi Sultanate that included India‚Äôs tallest minaret and an iron pillar from earlier ti,"The Qutb Minar complex contains the Qutb Minar itself, a towering minaret that is the highest in India. It was one of the largest minarets in the world when it was first built. The complex also holds the ruins of an even larger minaret that was never completed. But one of the most intriguing aspects of the complex is an ancient iron pillar, created with an alloy that allows it to defy rust. The pillar was created by a king called Chandra, probably Chandragupta Gupta, but this is currently not proven. It is one of the finest pieces of ancient metalworking anywhere on earth."

Qutub_Minar,zczigler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Worth visiting,"The site is very impressive and well worth visiting. We went on a busy sunday afternoon, there were lots of people, but they have a separate ticket counter for foreigners, so we were able to get our tickets within a few minutes. The ticket counters are on the opposite side of the road. If you book online in advance, then you don't have to queue for tickets of course. If you take the metro then you need to walk a little to the site, or hire a riksha. Please note, that they will make you throw your cigarettes in the dustbin, as cigarettes are not permitted within the compound, so accept the loss or make your own arrangements for safekeeping (we asked one of the stall operators outside and got the pack back after exiting the compound). All in all we spent an enjoyable two hours among the ruins, even with the sunday afternoon traffic."

The design, engineering and style is impressive and rich with detail.  Historic and an insight into how rulers wanted to make a mark, leave a legacy.  The grounds around this monument include the ruins of another tower base only, and several ruins that depict a blend of cultures, influences. Worth exploring the grounds and there are many photo opportunities to get that shot and full view from base to top.  "

Climbing to the first floor of the tower is no longer possibleBeware what kind of tour guide you're getting you might just be paying for an old-school photographer (rotating the camera for effects). I got wrong information from my guide (i.e writings I could read in Arabic that he said was another language compared to other writings in Arabic which he acknowledged was Arabic!) He gave wrong dates vs what I had read online, asked me a bunch of questions on capitals of different countries that had little to nothing to do with the topic. He didn't have change so he took 25% more than what he originally asked for."
Qutub_Minar,dr ganapathi bhat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,""" Historical monument""","It's a gigantic structure. Better to know its history before going. Heavy rush, lots of young couples. There is an entry fee. Children below 15 years are allowed free entry. One has to walk a distance to get close to the minar from the main gate. Photography is permitted, but no much ""guides"" to explain the monument's significance. Decent eateries near the ticket counter and adjacent area. Vehicles like autos and taxis available near the gate. Will take approx one hour to quickly cover the area. A must visit in Delhi."

Qutub_Minar,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Soaring history.,"THIS UNESCO World Heritage structure is the tallest brick-built minaret in the world at nearly 240ft.It has five storeys each marked by a projecting balcony, but people can no longer ascend its heights after a 1980 accident when 43 people died in a stampede, most of them children, when there was a power failure.Foreign tourists have to pay a 600-rupee (nearly ¬£7) entry fee to the site which contains plenty of places to just sit down and contemplate this soaring wonder.The gardens are nice while the stonework is worth a very close look because of its intricate carving.If you look carefully at the minaret rising above you then its is possible to see that its red sandstone and marble circular structure has alternate sections which are first rounded and then angled.The site also contains an iron pillar more than 23ft high which weighs more than six tons. It is famous for its rust-resistant composition of metals which have withstood nearly 2,000 years of wear and tear. There are a number of inscriptions on it.A very striking site and structure which is well worth a visit."
Qutub_Minar,NVKOnTheGo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,One time visit,The monument could have been better preserved and given a facelift in terms of good and engaging write up boards to appeal to tourists.

The minaret and the tomb and the grounds are very interesting and well worth a look. Apparently they are around 800 - 1000 years old. I was very impressed with how well kept the grounds were, that there was a lot of shelter from the heat with trees providing cover dotted all around, and that most of the tombs, etc had information provided in English as well as the Indian. A lot of space, and good for a walk around the grounds, making it appear not too crowded and gives one the chance to relax and take in the splendor without worrying about too many people hogging the views.....Liked this place a lot, and it is definitely recommend to see if visiting New Delhi"

According to popular belief, the Qutub Minar was built by the first Islamic ruler of North India, Qutubuddin Aibak. It was this victory over last Hindu kingdom in Delhi that he attempted to symbolize with the Qutb Minar. An inscription on the tower indicates that it also served as a victory monument. He managed to get only one Storey made in Mehrauli area of Delhi in 1193 AD. It was his successor and son-in-law the famous slave king Iltutmush who continued the construction to include three more levels. Lightning  destroyed the top floor of this construction in the 1360's. It was the then ruler of Delhi Feroz Shah Tughlaq who not only replaced that damaged floor but also added one more on top of it. All in all the current Qutub Minar with all its builders, took around 75 years to be completed.  Architecture of Qutub Minar: Build in the style of Indo-Islamic Afghan architecture. The First three stories were formed upon rich red sandstone. The remaining two stories were stacked using finely polished marble and sandstone. It is 14.3 meters at the base and tapers up to 2.7 meters. It is a tapering tower, designed in a similar way to the minaret of Jam in Western Afghanistan. The total height of the Qutub Minar is 73 meters. It has 379 stairs within it to reach the top, but now it's not allowed public as in the month of December, 1981, there were around 300-400 tourists inside the Minar when electricity failure occurred. This led to complete darkness inside the staircase and resulted in a rush that killed around 47 people, including Scholl Kids. This resulted in banning entry to the inside of tower.

Qutub_Minar,lauratravellover,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,15 times more expensive for not Indians. Shame!,"The place is fine, maintained and interesting, especially if you get a guide. However we were very annoyed that, as in all tourist attractions in India, we, foreigners have to pay way more than Indians. This time was really exaggerate, 40 rupees versus 600, which means 15 times more expensive. If you do something like this in Europe or North America you would be accused of racism and risk a fine or even jail. It's shameful that this happens so often in India, especially after Covid, this is not welcoming tourists."

Qutub_Minar,MikeDorsey90,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,My first stop in Delhi,"Qutub Minar was grand, and there are ground to explore around the ancient minaret. Many local Indians visit this monument, and I visited in the cool season when foreign visas were restricted. If you come from outside India, spend a little more to purchase the foreigner entry pass - this is like the express line pass as Disney. You have your own separate entrance line and it takes a teeny fraction of the time. Placards inside are also in English so you can read about the history of the grounds. Golden hour before sunset is a great time to visit. I enjoyed this beautiful site - it left an impression on me. "

Qutub_Minar,Sushriit Chatterjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,The only thing that stood for the whole time!,"The Qutub Minar, got laid its inception in 12th century , is a 72.5-meter tall Minaret and 'victory tower' that has conjoined the part of the Qutb Complex. It is a UNESCO world Heritage site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India. It is speculated that a similar Minaret, has been sited in the Ghur Province of Central Afghanistan, was built a decade prior to the Qutub Minar. The height of Qutub Minar  is 72.5 meters, making it the tallest minaret in the world built of bricks. The tower tapers, and has a 14.3 metres (47 feet) base diameter, reducing to 2.7 metres (9 feet) at the top of the peak. It contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.The inscriptions suggest that it was  began by Qutub ud-din Aibak in 1198 and completed by his successor Iltutmish in 1215, although the 2 upper tiers were rebuilt later.I really rekindled the idea of walking down the memory lane and rejoicing in recollection of arts and artifacts for the History Project."
