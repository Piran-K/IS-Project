Raj_Ghat,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,The place where Gandhi was cremated after his assassination.,"This is a memorial place dedicated to the memory of Gandhi. An eternal flame burns beside a cenotaph. There are well kept gardens in the area, and there are many flowers. The entrance is free, but there is security to pass through. Many schoolchildren visit here to help them learn about Gandhi. Definitely worth a visit, but not a place to spend a lot of time unless you wish to sit and ponder the life of Gandhi."
Raj_Ghat,Gustavo A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,"Calm, relaxing, Gandhi","The Raj Ghat is not a big fancy attraction, for instance, as the Taj Mahal. It's a quiet place of calm and humility, very symbolic of how Gandhi lived. This is where his remains are and people come to pay their respects to essentially the father of the nation. It's a large compound of grass, bush and few trees all very well-kept. It's mostly empty compared to other places you can visit in Delhi, and security is constant. As you walk to the center, there are inscriptions of Gandhi's sayings on the walls of the pavement and in the middle is the main square where the tomb is. This main zone has to be crossed barefoot (with socks) and I don't think there's shoe covers available (at least when we went there). Still, this place is very much worth the visit, specially if you want a place to relax and get away from the chaos that is Delhi."
Raj_Ghat,Something Tookish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,A simple well maintain memorial,"Though it is a large memorial, it is a very simple memorial. A wall encircles  a grassy field with a rectangular marker in the middle. You need to remove your shoes before entering and you can't carry your shoes unless in a backpack or such."
Raj_Ghat,Woodstag,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Nice Memorial,This is a very well maintained memorial garden dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi which is worth a visit because it has nice maintained grounds and location for some of his ashes - better value in visiting the Gandhi Smitri in New Delhi which is his last residence where he was assassinated and a museum
Raj_Ghat,NVKOnTheGo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Best watched on TV,The place is very well maintained. We went just before Gandhi Jayanthi and so were barred from entering as they were beautifying the approach with flower beds for the Presidential visit. Truck full of flower pots had come to the venue for the decor. So we went again 2 days after Gandhi Jayanthi and could see the drying flower decorations. The lawns are always very well maintained and spending on the flower beds for just one day could have been avoided. Footwear needs to be removed and the Delhi heat can burn your foot! Dont forget to shop on the street opposite the entrance for trinkets at a good price.

It is a peaceful and thought provoking resting place and we had read that it recognises his achievements and has a number of his quotes.  The cremation sight reflects his very simple life.We did not go beyond the gates as the previous day we had visited Gandi Smriti which is where he spent his final days before his assassination.  This had been such a good experience we did not want to take away from it.

Raj_Ghat,Philip_Marsh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Memorial Garden Celebrating the Life of Mahatma Gandhi,"A visit to Delhi wouldn’t be complete without learning more about Gandhi. Whilst he was cremated and his ashes scattered in the river in Nepal this park was converted into a memorial for him.The park is separated from a square memorial garden, with eternal flame, by a large bank that you can walk up.If you wish to enter the garden then remove your shoes (officially you aren’t allowed to wear foot covers but we saw people wearing them) and leave your shoes with the attendants (who look after them for IRS1 per person - but they don’t carry change so it’ll cost you the smallest denomination that you carry). It’s then a small walk, in a pleasant garden, to view flower arrangements and an eternal flame. It’s pleasant enough but, all told, you’ll probably be finished within 30 minutes."

This memorial site is a popular tourist attraction and is visited by tourists.This memorial site is located in Daryaganj area. There is a black marble platform which marks the spot where Mahatma Gandhi was cremated. However, there is an eternal flame burning in one end. It holds a great significance of the history of India. There is a stone footpath flanked by lawns leading to the walled enclosure that houses the memorial site. These lawns have fountains fitted in them. One can visit the memorial site of Jawaharlal Nehru called as Shantivan located close by. Had admired the garden as well as the black marble platform having the burning eternal flame. Also, had read the smaller inscriptions nearby in the dark as a school going child.This memorial site is an ideal place for families, school children as well as dignitaries. It is a must visit and should not be missed when in New Delhi."

Raj_Ghat,macedonboy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Gandhi funeral spot,"The Raj Ghat is a memorial park that is both a park and a memorial for notable Indian leaders. The most famous of all the memorial is probably the one to Gandhi. The memorial is on the lower level of a mound. The mound is essentially a platform from which to view the memorial below, which is a large marble platform to commemorate the sport where the great man was cremated. The lower level is accessible to the public, although you do need to remove your shoes to enter. The marble platform is garlanded with flowers and next to it is an eternal flame.The Raj Ghat is not the most amazing thing you’ll see in Delhi, but I could not visit the city without paying my respects to the great man and stand at the spot where he was cremated."

I know there's an entire museum dedicated to the great leader not far from here, but some additional write-up/ videos/ displays would help tourists, especially those coming from outside India. 2. Some other leaders' samadhis are housed within the same area, but I wish there were clear directions with distances mentioned at the signboards so getting around is easy for tourists."

Raj_Ghat,Ian M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,peaceful,This memorial to Ghandi is peaceful. A large expanse of lawn and some beautiful gardens.  Not a lot to see but worth the time once you get through the security.
Raj_Ghat,Bossman43,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Visit to Gandhi’s Memorial,"A little bit of peace in the bustling intensity of Delhi. Simple garden to walk around (after you have been through airport style security and bag scans). Then, after taking off your shoes (you can leave them for free or pay a small fee for them to be looked after), you can go into the smaller central area to see the black marble platform marking the spot where Gandhi’s was cremated and the eternal flame...the garden has a number of Gandhi’s quotes dotted around it...."

Raj_Ghat,Fiona1110,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Not really much to see or do.,"This is the place Ghandi was cremated the day after he was assassinated. You can take your shoes off  and go to the lower level, or leave them on and walk around the top.There is basically only a garden, a black slab and an eternal flame. Not really worth the visit."

Raj_Ghat,Woody16,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Beautiful memorial.....,Our great guide explained everything that had happened to this great man and then to visit the area where he was cremated was an honour. Even though it was very busy everyone showed great respect and it was all very quiet around the flame. The gardens were lovely too.
Raj_Ghat,Sudipta Shaheen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Memorial,This is one of the best place in Delhi. Very nice and very well maintained place. You can spend your whole evening in this place. Best to visit in winter. No food joints inside. Security is very tight also. very clean place.
Raj_Ghat,Middlemiss,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,It's the place of a memorable cremation ,Mahatma Gandhi's funeral pyre after his assassination in 1948. It is beautifully preserved as a modern garden. It is clearly a place of pilgrimage for many. So much history that we British have much to answer for.
Raj_Ghat,Linda Y,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Mahatma Gandhi Memorial,"The focus of this open-air memorial to Mahatma Gandhi is a black marble platform marking the place where the peace leader was cremated after his assassination on Jan 30, 1948. I visited on Jan 31, the day after India celebrates Martyrs' Day, and Gandhi’s memorial was covered in flowers. Gandhi Smriti, a museum dedicated to his life, is much more informative. If short on time, go there instead."
Raj_Ghat,Andrew S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Great Political Significance,"The key aspect of this memorial is the great significance of Mahatma Gandhi.  You would not expect it to be very exciting, rather a very calm and peaceful site, as it should be.  It is decently quiet, and does not shout politics or preach indfependance."

A simple but very appropriate & fitting memorial to this great man, serene and tranquil, which enables you to feel far away from the city hubbub outside.There are some very interesting names from history on the plaques by the trees planted by visiting dignitaries."
Raj_Ghat,Margaret G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,A green space to reflect in,In such a busy city it is amazing to go to such a 'modern' green space that is an oasis of calm. We walked through this memorium to Gandhi and it was lovely to see the reverence with which he was held and it was a privilege to see the flowers being changed. We were there before 10am when the shoe storage was open but it was lovely to be there when not busy. A beautiful place with lots of colours.
Raj_Ghat,ValK033,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Beautiful memorial garden,This is a beautiful memorial garden dedicated to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi. Take time to wander around and enjoy the famous sayings. It is well worth a visit.

Raj_Ghat,Nikko4Me,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Business,A Must See during a visit to Delhi area!!!!,"Wow!, definitely a must see while in Delhi.  Raj Ghat is a memorial dedicated to Gandhi, and it’s located in the place where he was cremated.The entire area is a park. You do need to go through a scanner to access the memorial.  There are ramps on either side which will give you access above the memorial.  When you enter the memorial, you leave your shoes at the counter (for a small tip), and then walk into the central courtyard where you can walk around the black marble memorial of Gandhi.  The quotes that are around the walkway are also very thought provoking!The music that is playing completes the experience!The one sad thing that I saw within a minute of being there was someone threw trash onto lawn, instead of putting it into the trash receptacle that was within 50 feet of the person!"
