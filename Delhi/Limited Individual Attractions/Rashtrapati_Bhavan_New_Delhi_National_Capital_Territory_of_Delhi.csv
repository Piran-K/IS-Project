Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Niket Kumar Dixit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Family,Must must must visit ,"Booked this online for circuit 1 tour.

A must must must visit, if you are in Delhi for sightseeing. "

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,mikey2846,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,a must see on a Delhi itinery,"having visited Delhi previously and had an argument with the tour guide as to whether you could access the building i was determined to return and bought him a ticket just to prove the point!. it rather says much about how the building is marketed that even some of the tour guides don't know how to access it. The building is stunning and well worth visiting even to see the small number of rooms on the guided tour. I won't give a history lesson you can read all about it in more eloquent terms than mine, what I will say is that the booking system is a nightmare hence the deduction of a star. the tickets are not released that early so don't dispair if you are told there is no availability, just keep trying. I ended up buying the tickets twice as the system told me it had failed the first time but at approx 50p a ticket it wasn't relevant. The mughal gardens are also worth the visit - even if you are guided via the boring herb garden! This really should be on a tour itinery as an absolute must in Delhi - be prepared for a little over enthusiastic security - I had my passort checked five times but that said there was no aggression or hostility and the setting and design are a must see"
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,SAROJ8585,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,RESIDENCE OF THE FIRST CITIZEN OF INDIA,"The Rastrapati bhavan is the official home of the president of India located at the western end of Rajpath.It was formerly known as viceroys house.Everyyear on republic day the president of India hoists nationa flag here and a parade is organized.The area of rastrapati bhavan complex is very big.The mughal garden,museum ,clock tower etc. are the main attractions of rastrapati bhavan."
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Gl0balCitizen2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Secret Gem of New Delhi - A Must Visit,"Rashtrapati Bhavan is the secret gem of New Delhi. I had no idea one could visit Rashtrapati Bhavan inside, but when I discovered that one could, I prioritised visiting it, rather than other New Delhi attractions.You have to book the tickets online and it includes a guided tour of the building and entry into the museums. Photography is not allowed inside the building and security is tight. If you are visiting by car, please keep your RB ticket handy and tell the guards that you are a visitor. We were shooed away, most aggressively. And after we disembarked & sent our car away, were told by another guard that we could take the car inside and the parking was inside the complex! So, we had to wait for our car to come back and then we went inside the building and parked inside. We saw peacocks and monkeys on the grounds. We could take some pictures of the outside portico, but inside we had to deposit all our belongings, including phones.We had a real buzz from the tour and saw the hall, where the President gives the highest awards of India, the grand hall, with the murals on the ceiling, some amazing artefacts from the great Darbar, a thousand headed Buddha sculpture from Vietnam and the State Banquet rooms. The Rashtrapati Bhavan Museums were also wonderful - one can spend hours inside. For me, the most wonderful exhibits were the veena of President Kalam and his notebooks, along with the medals like the Bharat Ratna. Also, there is this unique opportunity to get a truly amazing personalised souvenir, whereby, you can get your own personalised stamps, with your face, along with the logo of Indian Army/Navy/Airforce. What is amazing is that the stamp actually works- if you deliver a letter or postcard with your own stamp, it does get delivered! I tried it and it really works! Every Indian should visit Rashtrapati Bhavan, especially the Museums, which have the Ashoka Chakra, the Constitution of India and other such historic things. We could not explore everything in the museums, so give yourself plenty of time, when you visit."
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,sanjayvora45,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,grand Structure,"Rashtrapati bhavan is a splendid, majestic and grand building constructed by british in the year 1912. It has total 340 rooms, large open space and staff quarters inside the complex. It is probably the largest residence of any head of state in the world.Mughal garden in the backside where general public are allowed during certain period of the year. I got only glimpse from the outside."
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,"MUKUL GUPTA, ADVOCATE",4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,RASHTRAPATI BHAWAN-ROTARY FRIENDSHIP EXCHANGE TEAM FROM SWEDEN,Our 12 friends from Sweden got a fair idea of our country's present structure of governance as well as grandeur of our President House which they were earlier seeing on TV News. The newly developed Museum has used the most innovative Information Technology tools which immediately creates interest and absorbs the attention of the visitor. The intricate art work inside the halls & rooms is fully preserved with utmost care. The memories and teachings of our past presidents are very emphatically communicated. The official guide was very well informed and authentically took care of queries of our Swedish friends. We could also had the opportunity to have a glimpse of Mughal Gardens.
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Sibi L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,MUGAL GARDENS & RASHTRAPATI BHAVAN MUSEUM,"Avoid visit during school holidays, you will find huge crowd which literally spoils the entire charm. Now the Mugal Gardens is not that great....so...so that is all.  You need about 2 hours for a proper visit.  Rashtrapati  Bhavan Museum is good.....but for smaller children and for those guys who are not interested in history, it is not worthy.......needs about 3 hours minimum to cover it in a reasonable way. "
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Jaipur Column,"The Jaipur Column stands at a height of 145 feet on the Rashtrapati Bhavan Forecourt. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and sponsored by Maharaja Madho Singh of Jaipur. It was built to celebrate the transfer of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi and as a token of allegiance of the princely state of Jaipur to the British Crown. It is made of sandstone and atop is a five-ton bronze lotus from which emerges a six-pointed Star of India, made of glass."
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Nitin V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Rashtrapati Bhawan a magnificent British era building!,"Rashtrapati Bhawan is truly a magnificent British era building situated in the heart of New Delhi.

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,AZCasualTraveler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Awsome Presidential Palace,"The Presidential Palace of India is a stunning looking structure - huge and very nice looking architecture.  We visited the ""Palace"" twice on consecutive days - the first day visit was with a private tour guide and the second day visit was with a small group tour. We were told by both tour guides that nobody is allowed to enter the ""Palace"" gates for a visit.  Our small-group tour guide told us that the public is not allowed to even stop and get out of tour vehicle to take photos of the ""Palace"" - but we were allowed to take photos through the window of our tour vehicle as we slowly drove by the security gate.  According to our small group tour guide, we were not even allowed to stop even for a minute for photos.  However, our private tour guide allowed us to get out of our tour vehicle to take a few photos of the ""Palace"" near the front security gate, but told us to do so ""quickly"" so as not to get in trouble with the security guards - nice!.  Our best photos were taken when we had the opportunity to actually stand in front of the ""Palace""."

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Adamthegardener,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Gardens Group Tour - A Rare Opportunity to visit the Gardens,"Rashtrapati Bhavan is the official residence of the President of India. Designed by Edwin Lutyens it was the former Viceroy House. It features both Mughal and English styled gardens. It is onle possible to visit the gardens on a few days per year. Subsequently, it was VERY BUSY but worth the time and effort to be one of the chosen few!"
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,mssundaram,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Awesome light show,"Always a marvel.  Best is to visit during winter evenings.  The light show is something you won't want to miss.  Sometimes they allow upto main gate but most of the time, for security reasons, you wouldn't even be allowed to stop by."
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,NafeeTA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Worth Viewing if you are in the Area,"We didint have much time, so decided to view it from the outside as we were passing by on our way to India Gate. The place has great architectural beauty and right next to is the Parliament Building. So, if you are passing by the area or if you have time on our hands, worth going there to check it out as well as the parliament building."
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,SalimM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Huge palace,It is the Presidents official home. It is huge. The building was designed by a Brit and completed in 1929. Apparently it took 17 years and that is not surprising when you hear the facts. It has four floors and 340 rooms – some residence. You can visit but must book online in advance. The huge dome is visible from afar. Worth a drive past to see this.

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Prijy George,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Excellent. The change of Guard is a prestigious ceremony. Inside of Rashtrapati Bhavan is marvelous,Before visiting Rashtrapathi bhavan we were in Punjab and observed the ceremony at wagagh boarder. I didn't like that because it creates enimity in our mind. Then we visited Rashtrapati Bhavan. This was the BEST part in our 10 days tour. We were first directed to watch the change of guard ceremony. It was EXCELLENT. Well arranged and formal ceremony. My family liked it very much. Then we visited inside Rashtrapathi Bhavan. It is really marvelous.We can take photos of the change of guard ceremony & exterior area of rashtrapathi bhavan. They wont allow camera's or mobile phones or any bags inside the building. They will collect it from us and store safely. We can collect it back once we are finished with the visit.Very good.

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Jajabor,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Not to Miss,One of the best architecture beauty and well managed place which is not to be missed by any one visiting the capital of India. 
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Sounak Poddar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Royal,Have you ever wondered how the supreme commander of all the forces of Inda stays and what are luxuries he has or what are the things he is allowed to do? to know more in details one has to visit this place. Before visiting make sure it is open for visitors because it is not open everyday more general public.
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,S Dutta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Menacing monkeys in the President's house,"My family visited Rashtrapati Bhavan in August 2019.  We had booked the Circuit 1/main building tour online a week before.  The fee is nominal but you can only book via an Indian credit/bank card.  It's not convenient for those planning to visit India.  We had booked the 9:30 am tour, and got there early enough.  There was heavy security on the grounds as we drove in through gate number 2.  The parking lot is small and unkempt.  The guard who checked our reservation and IDs warned us about monkeys in the stairs and pathway to the bhavan.  They should have done more than a passive warning.  2 monkeys attacked my senior citizen mother from behind.  She had deep gashes on her shoulders and legs.  I took her to the washroom close by take a closer look at her wounds.  No one helped us with any first aid kit, my father went back to the car for band-aid.  The washroom was a mess, there wasn't even a trashcan to put the bloodied wound dressings in.  This was a bad start, but anyway we all checked in and waited to be called for our tour.  We had to check in everything, we weren't even allowed to take even a phone, what if someone tried to reach us in an emergency.  There were about 30-35 people in our group.  I asked the tour guide to speak a little louder but we could still barely hear her, unless we stood next to her.  It was good to walk the corridors where many powerful people from all over the world have walked.  The rooms have a lot of history.  Great furnishings and decor all around.  Well-trimmed gardens.  The guide did have some interesting tidbits, but it sounded very rote.  It didn't feel like the guide had any personal love or interest in what she did.  A big contrast with another recent tour of ours of a former American president - Thomas Jefferson's Monticello in Virginia.  What was even more astounding was that the tour guide took a personal phone call right in the middle of the tour - and rattled off her grocery SHOPPING LIST to the person at the other end, in front of the whole tour group.  What a shame!  And sorry to say, what low class!  Maybe they have better guides, but we didn't get one.We were glad when it was over.  We ran straight to a hospital emergency room to get my mother some rabies shots.  Was the trip worth the time and effort?  Heck no!  Maybe the Change of Guard ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan is a better experience."
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Dan L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Spectacular Presidential Palace,"Monday, 7/10/19, was not the best day or time to visit.  Barricading and heavy security elsewhere. We had to be satisfied with a couple of drive-pasts and a momentary stop until  a member of the heavily armed security hastened our way with arms waving. Enough time to marvel at the spectacular building and architecture of this former Viceroy's House, a building of 340 rooms.  One can only surmise the pomp and splendor of the Viceroy and his household of various staff and officials. We should have checked the website, ""Visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan"", this gives comprehensive details of booking procedures, opening times, etc. Hindsight is wonderful. Based on our external view, we believe this complex should be a priority visit in the city."

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,wishk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Rashtrapati Bhawan: Circuit 1,"One of my and my husband's favourite spot nearer home is Raisina hill. All my interest in politics and country goes to my father . We visited this beautiful residence on July 16th, Sunday with my family and my five year old son.This was basically a surprise planned for my parents. After relishing breakfast at Gujarat Bhawan, we reached the residence of the first citizen of India.It was a beautiful morning with light drizzling in the green surroundings of Delhi with the sounds of happy peacocks and cheerful policemen.The white marble steps starts with the journey to the residence with a beautiful gift presented in the form of Vietnamese Buddha.Checking the Ashoka hall, Vietnamese Buddha statue, Durbar hall and guest wing where foreign presidents visit and pass on the exchange/gifts and other that includes Main Building, Forecourt, Reception, Banquet Hall, Upper Loggia,and  Lutyens Grand Stairs.If you see the colour difference between red and white, it was created under the British raj. Area marked red colour was meant for Indians and the other for British officials.Dining hall and the view of the mughal gardens in the rain was not less than a writer writing a book. I haven't seen such a charm in any of the palaces before.My son was repeatedly waiting to meet Mr.Kovind. He has learnt his name by- heart after Modi. He knows the PM offcie is nearby.P.S.- I learnt about the Indian flag above the Bhavan's dome if unfurled represents the President is in Delhi otherwise when furled up shows the president is not in New Delhi.Loved the area where you get to meet people (in groups) with the eagerness and curiosity to check the past and the present without any loudness in their behaviour."

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,rastha2001,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Great experience and glad it's open to public,It's a good thing that Rashtrapati Bhawan is now open to general public. There are 3 circuits. Booking can be easily done online. Entry fee is very nominal. Id proof must for all visitors and details to be given in advance. Vehicle entry is also allowed if details are given in advance at the time of booking. One must do Circuit 1 which is entry to main building open from Thursday to Sunday.

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,ParthaSarathy K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Memorable visit,"We did Circuit 1, Circuit 2 and the Change of Guard Ceremony. There is a Rs. 50 charge for Circuit 1 and Circuit 2 with prior permission from Rashtrapati Bhavan and the permission is required for Change of Guard ceremony.  Circuit 2 has an excellent museum where are shown 3D movies and you a Virtual Reality show for few minutes where you walk with Mahatma Gandhi.  It has stunning displays of the gifts received by various presidents or how the Bharat Ratna and other medals look like and much more than that. They also have a post office inside where you can get your own stamp published Change of Guard ceremony with horses and the band is something not to be missed. We took the Sunday evening Change of Guard (believe it's available on Saturday too)Circuit 1 tour is probably the most strict of all where they check your id's at multiple places. This is because they show you the Durbar Hall (where the swearing in of the MP's take place), Asoka Hall , Banquet Hall and much more. If you are in Rajdhani, make sure you plan a visit to President's house. I booked only a week in advance through the Rastrapathi Bhavan website and was given approval within couple of days."
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,pickytweeter,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Tourless Grandeur with harassment,"Sad to put this what should be 5 star attraction at a mere 3 stars but reasons are many fold. I could not secure  a circuit 1 tour or changing of guards for love nor money despite contacting delhi tourism and the Govt. office in charge of tours in advance -as has been said before- the bureaucracy!! I would suggest starting to book online months in advance for the select days  these happen- currently thursday-sunday and at specific times. Lutyens Baker buildings are quite magnificent  but as has been said possibly shabby. The  heavy and sulky security chaps and procedures and harassment by touting guides, ubiquitous photo opp folk and chasing rickshaw riders on the janpath- make the experience very tiring- especially if you are unaccompanied females (by a male of course)!"

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Rahul2604,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,Excellent but system need to be improved,"Finally after trying many time for circuit 1 ,was able to book for a day ,took around 15 days to get confirmation mail after paying the prescribed fee.Circuit 1 tour and building is excellent and everyone say the same so not going to repeat that.Those travelling by own vehicle can take their vehicle inside to visitors parking but if travelling by auto/cab then have to leave to early,if coming from Janpath then before North/South block building,if lucky then till before main front gate of rashtrapati bhawan,even from there a long walk,simply an useless rule just to harrass people.I entered through gate no 2,then came gate no 4,there was a check point and our baggage and mobile were take their saying that mobile/camera not allowed beyond that and no photography allowed,ok rules are rule,after that we use a gate and after ascending a stairs we were right in front of majestic fore court and shock to see that people were taking photographs using their mobile where as our Mobile were taken away.When I reached reception query I asked them was how they can take photo whereas our mobile was taken away saying about rules,they didnt have any official anwer for that , unofficially said that those who came with reference of any officer/mp/vip etc (and they even don't need to pay rs 50) are allowed,they suggest me to meet the reception incharge officer,when meeting 1st he was just repeating the same but when I asked for written complain he allowed me to get back my mobile till reception (as other),this is the situation of residence/office of country 1st citizen.These things need to be changed and logged a formal complain too."

It is the world's largest president house. It is almost spreading in 320 acres. It was designed in 1911 and it took about 17 years to develop it. It is home of the present India's President.It is a vast mansion and its architecture is breathtaking. More than these, it has a hallowed existence in the annals of democracy for being the residence of the President of the largest democracy in the world.Unforgettable experience & Wow feeling!!!"

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,iti_94,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,A must see for every Indian,"I made a reservation for all the four circuits inside Rashtapati Bhawan that were permitted.We went to Delhi during Udayanotsav and the entry to the Mughal Gardens was free of cost.But let me give you a tip ,i was not aware of the vastness of the Presidential Building and it is not possible to cover all the circuits in one day.From the central secretarial metro station we took an auto which left us near Mughal Gardens entrance but it was a long walk.Finally when you enter there is again a long queue for keeping your bags and there is a long checking after which you enter the arena from where you can reach the garden.Since it was a sunday it was so crowded that we had to turn back midway since our slot for tour inside Rashtrapati Bhawan was just one hour.No one exactly knows the gate numbers and we were walking for a long time in the opposite direction when we finally came to know that it is just next to the Mughal Garden gate.We entered through Gate 37 and there was a long walk after you can see the great building and finally reach the office where to your surprise again there is a lot of crowd and people have come without prior reservation and slots are just for namesake.we again had to stand for photo and show all our IDs afterwhich we were called and a guide took a group of people through all the selected rooms.it was worth a visit .we saw Durbar Hall,Ashok Hall,the different paintings and statues and carpets,the dining as well as siting rooms and we got an excellent view of the Mughal Gardens from the window.It was a one hour tour after which we asked the guide for directions to the Museum as well as the change of Guard ceremony.The Museum gate was far away so we decided to drop it and after eating something went straight to Vijay Chowk Gate no 2,where we saw the change of guard"
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Jodi R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Fantastic buildings and gardens,"This group of buildings houses the government officials of India.  The ministry of home affairs, finance, defence, external affairs, as well as the prime minster, cabinet staff and the presidents house are all located in this block.  The architecture of the buildings is a mixture of classical, Indian, Islamic, Mughal and Rajasthani.  They are well maintained and the gardens are pristine.  At night the buildings are covered by multi coloured lights, quite a sight to see. Definitely worth a visit."
Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Linda Y,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,President of India’s Official Residence,"Edwin Lutyens succeeded in his desire to make Rashtrapati the focal point of the British New Delhi. Sitting on top of Raisina Hill, it is stunning! Due to security, you’ll have to admire it from a distance. A small area blocked off in the middle of the road provides a photo op. Today Rashtrapati is the President of India’s official residence. Completed in 1929, the 200,000-square-foot palace with its 350 rooms and 4.5-acre grounds are the largest residence of any head of the state in the world. Just behind the gate stands the Jaipur Column. At the top of the 145 ft (44 m ) pillar is an egg surmounted by a bronze lotus flower and a six-pointed glass star. See the official website for instructions on how you can tour Rashtrapati Bhavan. I didn’t have time, but it would be a fascinating look inside the Indian government."

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,Rasputin21,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Non Indians not permitted - not wanted.,"For three years I have battled with the extremely difficult website to try and book tickets for Circuit 1.  I also sent e-mails to the contact given on the website without so much as an acknowledgement let alone a response.  This year I was able to log on to the website and choose the date I wanted and even upload the required photograph and passport details.  However, by the time I reached the payment page, it refused all efforts to pay the Rs50 each Contacting Mr Ramesh failed again and I was transferred to the PLO division who, when hearing a non-Indian voice either said Sorry Mam and hung up or just hung up.  Finally after five calls I managed to get someone who was prepared to explain to me that the site is only for owners of an Indian credit or debit card.  When I explained that I obviously do not have one of those, I was told to get an Indian ""friend"" to purchase on our behalf.  I tried to do so but they too were unsuccessful, so for another year I have been unsuccessful visiting Rashtrapathi Bhawan - only for Indians.  Visiting the Change of Guard and Moghul gardens were also very difficult."

Passport required for entry. V beautiful and historical inside. Good for both pre and post colonial history. Excellent authoritative guides. Changing of the guard must also be prebooked and again high security. Very entertaining with great horsemanship from Presiden’s Bodyguard. We were so disappointed after following all the no camera, no phones rules to find EVERYONE there with phones, taking pics with no problems at all from guards and security. "

I and my family visited both Circuit 1 and Circuit 2 yesterday. We booked 11:30 am slot for Circuit 1 and 2:00 pm for Circuit 2. We went via Metro and got down at Central Secretariat Metro station. From there, we took auto for Rs 60/- to go to Gate 35. Our print-out of approval email and Pan Card was checked. We spent some time (~20 minutes) taking fantastic photos of royal Rashtrapati Bhavan. Then we went inside Reception area. We deposited ladies handbag and water bottle and mobiles. We waited for 10 minutes for guide to arrive. Guide took us through various halls like Durbar Hall, Ashoka Hall, North Drawing Room, Long Drawing room etc. It was like visiting a true palace of big kingdom. Thousand hand statue of Lord Budhha was mesmerizing. The tour of Circuit 1 completed by 12:20 pm, which was well explained by our scholar guide. Then we booked auto to go to Connaught Place for lunch. We returned to President's house by 1:50 pm. Then we were again explained various artifacts, gifts to President, ancient paintings, royal furniture by our scholar guide. It took around 2 hours to see Meuseum, but still we could not spend much time in meuseum as it was very big. Note: You need 3.5 hours gap ideally between slots of Circuit 1 and Circuit 2 if you wish to cover both on same day so that you can go for lunch to CP comfortably. Circuit 1 takes 1.5 hours Circuit 2 takes 2+ hours. You can skip Circuit 2 if you are short on time."

Note cars cant go all the way up due to security concerns but one can walk up to some distance and see it closely. This was built by the british and designed by the british architect Edward Lutyens. Its a must see if visiting delhi and doesnt take that long. I would recomend driving through this part, topping at India Gate, going to Bangla sahib Gurudwara, birla mandir and just driving through parts of Lutyen's delhi. the whole thing would take 2-3 hrs and is the historic and beautiful part of delhi"

Mughal gardens are known for their flora attraction but we couldnt plan a trip for Feb.- March when it was open.Still the visit to others circuits were so good to feel the loss.We need to book in advance on rashtraptibhavan website and get the confirmation email.Group of 10 can be booked in one request.Each circuit has seperate booking. Based on our experience I would suggest its good if you split the visit to 2 sessions on seperate days. Our visit started with Change of Guard ceremony.An event I will always cherish.You need to view it to realize the feeling.You will enjoy it unless you have a military background and has seen many parades.The guided tour of Rashtraptibhavan circuit 1 is well organized and very informative.Only con is that there is no Cafeteria inside and they do not allow food inside.So make sure you have your meals before you visit.Its a long walk inside.The meuseum is also well arranged with so much informative elements nicely presented. For school going kids enjoyed a lot.We being expats kids,do not get much chances of exposure to those area,hence they enjoyed the most."

Rashtrapati_Bhavan,SophieBlue09,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Can be great but not yet visitor-friebdly,"We had wanted to see the presidents’ house but it was closed on the only day we had for sightseeing. However, we did secure a time online to enter this new museum on the grounds. We toured with an art historian guide who provided a great perspective to the tableaux and exhibits. The 3D film is worth seeing for the history and CGI, although we found the writing stilted and propagandized. The unusual and often extraordinarily valuable gifts were the most fascinating aspect of this museum. However, many of the large portraits on the walls did not have the lights turned on, even though several small groups were touring. Understandably, security is extremely tight. We parked outside the grounds and walked to the museum. No water is allowed in the museum. There are no visitors’ lockers, (and, of course, foreigners are advised to avoid non-bottled water.) There are no public vending machines, cafes or vendors in the complex. Our tour guide was told that some sort of remedy is in the works soon, but even in mid-November, it was too hot to expect visitors to go a long period of time without access to water!"

So i have taken the circuit1 and circuit 2 tour and also the change of guard ceremony. The tours need to be booked online on the official website and when in doubt you can call the number provided and they are very helpful.  The circuit 1 tour is amazing and highly recommended. You get to go right inside the magnificent Rashtrapati Bhavan - get to know its history and marvel at the architectural genius of Lutyen. The tour guide Rosie does a good job. Given a chance if in delhi dont miss this tour but do pre booking as its getting very popular. The Circuit 2 tour is easy to get and involves a museum tour which too is worth visiting. What we loved as a family is the change of guard ceremony where you also get to see the presidents guards and their fabulous horses.There is no parking when you go for change of guard and involves quite a bit of walk.
