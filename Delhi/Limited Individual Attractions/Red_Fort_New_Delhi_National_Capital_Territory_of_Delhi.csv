Red_Fort,singhasam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,History on a vast scale,"WHEN your guide tells you that the Red Fort site in New Delhi covers ten square kilometres you wonder how you are going to have the strength to get round it all.Then he tells you that most of the site is out of bounds because the Indian Army are based there and the public can only view two square kilometres.I relaxed a little at that news but by the end of my visit I was exhausted from a tremendous amount of walking and climbing up and down steps.The Red Fort really is a gigantic construction with walls 100ft high and a network of interlocking passages for defence. Work to build the fort began in 1638 and was completed in 1648Just the walk to the entrance was a taste of things to come as we passed along the base of the wall with its grassy moat ditch.Even here the legacy of Covid reared its head because once we got inside we found that all the waterways were dry, emptied on the order of the Indian Government as part of its attempts to combat Covid.It meant visitors had to imagine what the true setting would have been like with platforms for musicians surrounded by water and channels of water tinkling everywhere.There were harems, hamams, areas set aside for justice, cannons, holes for other weapons and a host of other features.To reach this rich display we had to walk through a sort of covered bazaar of stalls offerings everything from chess sets and backgammon boards to carved stone in 64 arched bays, half on each side.I particularly liked the Hall of Public Audience or Diwan-i-Am with its lovely carved stone, a marble throne area and the stunning palace area with carved marble inlaid with semi-precious stones which was truly beautiful.It is a very tiring site to visit and those going there should make sure they have bottled water with them as those sections in the open quickly become quite hot.Definitely worth a visit by anyone who is in New Delhi."

The place is vast and has a decent exhibition which shows various exhibits, photographs and storyline about British occupation and their tyranny.

Red_Fort,RkRoadie,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Huge area needs lot of walking,Red fort is the most important architecture in India. The area has two different parking lot. One can park the car at Jama Masjid parking and walk towards ticket counter or else there is parking space near to Red Fort ticket counter as well. Vehicle entry is restricted ahead of parking place which is exactly at opposite site of main entrance of Red Fort hence one need to keep walking all through the outer boundary till main entrance of Red Fort.The picturesque Red Fort can be clicked from outside itself which dont need any sort of ticket. Once you enter inside the passage passes through Chatta Bazaar where you can shop for things (only cash was accepted). Inside the main campus there are many architectural building where you can click some more pics and come out again through Chatta Bazaar.

Red_Fort,Vlaamse_Reiziger,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Large compound with some buildings.,"The Red Fort is one of the tourist attractions of Delhi (of which there are not many). It is located in the Old part of Delhi. From the outside you only see a huge wall, but on the inside there is a 250 acres (100 hectares) compound with about 10 buildings from the Moghul times (the king who built it in 1658 also built the Taj Mahal), plus about 10 buildings built by the British in the late 1800s-early 1900s. It is worthwhile a visit, but you will be completing the visit in less than an hour. For me the most impressive part was the sheer size of the whole compound. Some practicalities:- go as early in the day as possible. Otherwise you will face loooong queues to buy the ticket, again for the security check etc- the main entrance (near Chandni Chowk) is closed (Oct2021), so you must enter from where the parking is.- be prepared to walk! First you must walk around half the compound from the entrance (parking) to the actual entrance in the buildings (buying your tickets on the way). Then, inside, there is quite a lot to walk. The place is not wheelchair friendly. - Inside the compound are quite a number of trees, which provide some nice shade (remember you are in Delhi!). - The Moghul buildings are nice but not very well restored, and due to covid, tourists are not allowed to visit the inside of some of them. The British buildings are museums but can easily be skipped: they are a mishmash of the take-over by the British, some resistance fighting, some paintings (unrelated to the site) etc. - Bring something to drink because there is no place to buy drinks (I understand one of the British buildings is being renovated to become a cafetaria)- You can hire a tour guide as you walk in (500 INR) but you can as well jot down the few things to know from a guidebook or from the web.  - Inside is a market with tourist junk."

Lal Qila Metro station is the nearest and most suitable means to visit the fort.The view at the entry is mesmerising and after a few clicks, we proceeded to the left for tickets. The tickets can be done online here after scanning the bar code through paytm. It asks for name, ID number and after online payment, the ticket is generated in form of mobile barcode ticket. This is scanned on the machine at the entry gate. For visit to museums combined ticket of higher denomination must be taken.You are allowed to carry your bag after scanning.Inside you have a huge premises and after passing through the main porch you see the Indian flag flying high. Opposite you have stairs reaching to the podium from where our PM delivers his speech. When you proceed further, there are some shops, and then you have  Diwan-i-Am, Naubat Khana, Rang Mahal, Diwan-i-Khas, Moti Masjid, Mumtaz Mahal. You have 6 Museums buildings out of which one at the left extreme end is free for all. For others you must have bought the Museum ticket at the main entry itself.This Museum called Drishyakala building (Ground plus 2) is free and houses old paintings and collections.It takes atleast half a day to move around here at Red fort. Opposite the Red fort you have Chandni Chowk where you can look for shopping and food."

One of those areas I would only explore on a tour as it is difficult to reach through the crowded streets nearby.

Red_Fort,R1chardN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Incredible history but too much for one visit,We went to the Red Fort as part of our Delhi City and highlights tour.  It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is an impressive building.  It is a very large walled Fort - 2.5km around the battlements.Others on the site have commented that foreign tourists pay much more than locals for entrance but that is quite normal in India and be prepared for men and women to enter separately and to be searched.  The monument is occupied mainly by the military and the armed guards are very obvious and initially made me look twice.  There are also numerous protective metal 'shields' in very visible locations.  We were told that this is all due to the situation with Pakistan - we had not expected it and made us feel a bit on edge.Once inside the gates there is an arcade that is full of 'merchants' - this is not a good place to buy!!  There are numerous other celebratory buildings within the walls.This is a large 'site' and you need to be realistic in the amount of time you want to spend here.  Our guide suggested no more than two hours and it is easy to go into overload here.
Red_Fort,AstroBloke,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"A magnificent structure, but...","This old fort is magnificent, and represents the highs and lows of Indian history in the last few centuries.  It will take some 2-3 hours to do it justice.Why didn't I rate if a 5, then? Firstly, as a international visitor I was charged around 10 times the admission for locals.  To make matters worse, we paid extra to visit the museum inside but were not given the token signifying that we had paid.  The guard at the museum wouldn't take our word for it, and all but told us to get lost.  (The approx. one kilometre walk to/from the ticket office meant we couldn't be bothered following it up them there.) You understandably cannot take your backpacks inside the fort for security reasons, so you need to leave them in a makeshift facility where there is no advertised price, they charge whatever they can gouge out of you as you go to collect your belongings.All in all, what should have been the highlight of our stay in Delhi was somewhat spoilt by the way we were treated."

Is that welcoming ?Take plenty of drinking water with you, as there is much ground to cover, within the walls, with many separate  buildings and pavilions to view ! Squirrels and well-fed stray dogs appear to co-habit, peacefully, too !The traders, inside, close to the entrance/exit, are ruthless at exploiting the most casual of interest - especially when they see you are hot and tired, and about to leave !You can easily spend 2 to 3 hours, here, and there are plenty of stone seats, (or low flat-topped walls ?) to rest tired limbs !Take your cameras !"

Govt has recently installed lights and done some great uplifting work here. "
Red_Fort,Steven_Teo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A Bulwark,Looking from outside is daunting for a would-be invader. The walls and moat were impressive structures. The inside was equally impressive. The road from the gate to the main court was meticulously planned in case of an invasion. The inside has other buildings.  It was worth the visit.
Red_Fort,Rahul Babbar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Nice place for knowing about our history. Good place to spend time with family and friends.,Only ticket holder can visit it. Use your mobile for download self ticket after payment online that is cost cheaper than offline ticket. Peaceful place many shows pantings and many more. Every single site has its own story. Some shows are paid also which included in ticket there are 2 type of ticket for show or not only 10 to 20 rs difference between them.
Red_Fort,WeDiscover8890,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nice landmark - shame about the prices,"Nice attraction to walk around, disappointed how foreigners have to pay x10 the price of locals. Doesn‚Äôt seem fair at all but this seems to be common across all main landmarks in India."
Red_Fort,Richard Ludlow OBE,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Red Fort,"The fee was 600 rupees for the monument and gardens. It‚Äôs worth a visit, getting away from the busy streets. I paid 350 rupees extra to visit the museum within the grounds. As this was a barracks it focussed on the journey to independence from Britain. A thought provoking visit! I learnt a lot about the struggles the country has endured. "

Red_Fort,Sh12014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Beautifully interesting,We were taken by our guide who gave us the history of the fort.  A beautiful place and well worth a visit.

Red_Fort,AMDS94,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Very Nice Architecture,The Laal Qila (Red Fort) was built in the mogul empire. It has stunning architectural views and beautiful garden walking space.Would recommend to anyone who is travelling to Delhi to see this place.
Red_Fort,Dave_Kippax,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Impressive building amazing architecture,"Visited as part of the Titan Tour, the guide was amazing, setting the seen and explaining the building and layout, including uses.  A beautifully appointed fort.  Worth a visit."
Red_Fort,Prabal Basu Roy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Excellent,A national pride.....very well written and explained at every point. Only the Son et Luminiare was stopped for some reason and that was disappointing as it was truly an excellent show.
Red_Fort,Alex C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Interesting huge fort,We went to the Red Fort as part of a guided tour. It was really interesting and had various parts to explore. I was glad we had a guide to show us around as there aren't many signs. But overall we enjoyed it. 
Red_Fort,louiset809,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Calm in the middle of New Delhi,The Red Fort is a must see in New Delhi. Right in the middle of New Delhi you walk through the entrance to acres of beautiful grounds and magnificent buildings.
Red_Fort,CWegg,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Disappointing inside,"The Red Fort is a beautiful and imposing historical landmark in Delhi. I certainly think every visitor should have a look. However, there is not much to see inside. Many interiors are closed and most of the areas you can visit are poorly maintained. I did not find this site to be worth the steep price of the foreigner admission ticket. Instead, walk around the exterior of the fort, then spend your time wandering the streets of Old Delhi. You won‚Äôt be disappointed and you‚Äôll have more money in your pocket. "
Red_Fort,subuller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Impressive ...,This was the first of many places we visited on a recent trip to India.  It's quite something to see and well worth the visit.  The grounds are extensive and a guide is useful.
Red_Fort,Vivienne M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Amazing ,Architecture is fantastic. Walls surround the fortress which protected the royal residence of Shah Jahan and subsequent Emperors. Very impressive.

Red_Fort,The Food Wanderer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Architectural Marvel,The Red Fort is a architectural marvel in north Delhi. You would need atleast 4 hours to completely understand and take a look at the whole structure. 
Red_Fort,rae5753,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Red Fort Jaipur,"Very interesting site. Well worth the trip. A marvel of construction. Tour was great and very informative,"
Red_Fort,Travel_Revival,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Impressive!,"Massive fortress walls protect the royal residence of Shah Jahan and subsequent Mughul Emperors. Much of the interior was destroyed by the British, but enough remains to give a perspective on the lavish lifestyle of the ruling Mughals. Information boards give the history of each building within the compound."
Red_Fort,ghummiwithnandini,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Big big,"That place is so big and amazing too , you need 3 to 4 hours to completely enjoy the place. there are many monuments there."

Red_Fort,Ivan B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Incredible ,"Incredible inside, huge, good to have a Guide to explain all internal architecture,  places, cultures and history behind."
Red_Fort,katieko,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Disappointing and overpriced,"A real disappointment as you couldn't go into any of the buildings here - all were roped off so you just had to peer over the barriers and take a photo. Having visited many forts in our trip round India, including Agra's which we'd heard was similar, this was the only one to disappoint. Agra has far more beautiful rooms to see and you can actually wander inside them. This ended up just being a wander round a large park area, without any nice gardens, so we felt the visit was hugely overpriced."
Red_Fort,Rahul Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Wow,"It's a great architecture made buy mugals...Made of red stone which is remarkable ....Well maintained n cleaned by the authority ..,"
Red_Fort,GAURAV M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Mr.  Gaurav Mangla ,We visited the place but could see the fort only from outside. But we were to lucky to reach there in the eve. It was superb to watch the fort in the evening with all the lights ON.. I could only imagine how creative Shahajan must have been.  The Red fort and Taj Mahal both are made by him. The architecture of both the places is beyond imagination.. 
Red_Fort,InnaYYZ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Impressive fort of Mughal Emperors,"Beautiful, well-maintained former residence of Mughal Emperors. Built, added to and modified over the years, this historic fort displays a few architectural styles."
Red_Fort,jjcoffman,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Red Fort visit in Delhi,"We hired a driver to take us around Delhi, before driving us to Agra. The Red Fort was one of our stops. It‚Äôs easy to get to, and you can pay to have a tuk tuk take you right up to the entrance, but the walk isn‚Äôt too far.  It‚Äôs just the hazardous air quality that can make it difficult. "
Red_Fort,Ann S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Make sure to take enough time when visiting,"We went to the Red Fort whilst on a business trip, so had no time to do our research first. Turned out to be a huge place so try to take enough time when visiting. The other reviews are true: ticket counter for non-Indians is ""at the other side"" so take into account that you'll have to do quite some walking.There's plenty of choice to buy souvenirs inside the Red Fort."
Red_Fort,NafeeTA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Old Delhi at its Best,"The visit to the Red Fort will take you on a journey to Old Delhi. The fort is just beside Jama Masjid. The fort has different entry rates for Indian Citizens and Foreigners, so its best if you check out the current rates online before going. The ticketing line for foreigners is usually very small, so dont fall for scammers who tell you that they can get you in faster. The walk from the ticket counter to the actual entry gate is a bit long, you can use the tuktuk that run along this path, at Rs 10 per person. Once inside, you can opt to take a guide, there are many waiting just outside the entry gate, but be sure to bargain for the prices. The fort itself covers a vast area, and honestly if you wanted to explore it all, you would literally have to spend about 4-5 hrs. We stayed for about 2 hrs, until we got exhausted of walking and taking pictures. All together, make sure to check if the fort will be open on the days you plan to go, and check out the current prices for tickets to avoid being scammed."
Red_Fort,sujatasingh2222,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Beauty of Delhi,"The picture of oldDelhi, Red Fort is located opposite to Chandni Chowk Market.Good option to reach there is Violent line metro if you are traveling from public transport."

Red_Fort,Barbara S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,At last I saw the Red Fort,"This was my third visit to Delhi and finally I have got to the Red Fort in all its stunning glory. It is cold and smoggy at this time of year, but enjoyed the walk around the site as it was not too crowded once in the fort."
