Safdarjung_s_Tomb,A Choudhury,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Friends,Beautiful Architecture,"Located at a walking distance from Jor Bagh metro station, this is a fine example of beautiful Mughal architecture. The place is clean, well maintained and peaceful as very few people visit this place which is actually quite surprising. A couple of hours visit is recommended. Photography is permitted."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,PhilthetravellerXI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Beautiful architecture and history.,This beautiful tomb complex from the late 18th century displays Mughal architecture at its best and is less crowded than other sites around Delhi and Agra. The blend of local sandstone and marble brings out the superb colours depending on the time of day you visit. Allow an hour to take in the complex and enjoy the peace of the grounds. We had a guide which helped with the explanations and history.
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,lemotka,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Stunningly beautiful ,"I visited on a week day in December at 9 am in the morning . Almost had the place to myself . What an experience !!! Intricate stone carvings , beautiful views and serene views! Loved every minute of it ! "
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,3000calories,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Business,No crowds while enjoying park like atmosphere ,"Gorgeous Taj Mahal like structure in a park setting with no crowds. Come hear for great photography, and historical site. We also saw parrots and a peacock while here."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Payal G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Superb discovery,"Off the tourist radar, this place offers the best place to study and photograph Mughal architecture without pushing through crowds. The information board describes it as the last flicker of Mughal architecture and indeed it's both grand and elegant. Yet to be discovered by the tourists thronging Humayun's tomb, it is a peaceful and well maintained place with clean facilities. The square gardens are huge and nicely kept. In fact the layout of the tomb is exactly like that of the Taj Mahal without the crowds. Built of red sandstone and marble, the tomb on the top floor may be difficult to reach for people with walking problem due to the high steps. However, the carved ceilings are a delight to discover.Ideal as a shooting location. The only substandard thing at the place is the sad shop of the ASI. It's a mystery why they are reluctant to have to do anything with souvenirs and general information.It's at a short walk from the Gate 3 exit of the Jor Bagh metro station on the yellow line and crossing the road in about a couple of minutes one reaches the lush Lodhi Gardens."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Denzel2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Neglected yet stands proud,"Any one who is in the jorbagh, India habitat center, prithviraj road area or even near INA should take out 30 min to visit this one of most easily accessible and visible monuments of Delhi. Less than 5 min walk from the jor bath metro station gets you here and if you stay a little post 6 pm, might be able to see this lit too"
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Tomb of the Nawab of Oudh,"This mausoleum was built to house the tomb of Safdar Jang, whose descendants all became Nawabs of Oudh. The building itself is a fine example of Mughal architecture. The mausoleum is a symmetric square of sandstone and marble with 4 minarets, one on each corner. Surrounding the mausoleum are gardens fitting in with the Mughal concept of garden tombs resemble the gardens of heaven. Even the gardens are highly regular, which combined with the symmetry of the building makes it look like it’s the same photo no matter which cardinal direction you take a photo.The interior of the mausoleum is a masterpiece of Persian influence architecture, especially the inverted lotus ceiling that adorn both the main hall housing the tomb and the smaller rooms surrounding the hall.This tomb is not as well known as other attractions in Delhi, but is totally worth the visit."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,DevonRed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Beautifully lit at night,On a flying business trip to Delhi and wanted to see something classically Indian. The Tomb of Safdarjang was a wonderful example of just that. I visited at night and the lighting was spectacular.  So good that even I was able to take a half decent picture. Next time I shall come during the day to see the gardens. Well worth a visit.
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Kevin S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Lesser known, but just as impressive","Another huge mausoleum built by a Mogul emperor, Safdarjung, this being the last of the major monuments that include those at Lodhi Gardens and Humayan’s tomb.  Set in a very large walled garden it is an impressive building on the scale of the much more visited, and twice the price, Humayans tomb ,and without the tour groups. A peaceful place to spend a while admiring the striking architecture."

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Chloe Augustin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Beautiful tomb with clean gardens ,"Beautiful and very well maintained place. The gardens around are also very well maintained and very clean. I went on Saturday at 10PM and met only few people, so I assume the place is not so popular."

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Sandeep singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Beautiful garden around the tomb,"Tomb is not much maintained, but it's beautiful . Garden around is good to relax. I went for photography."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,ashishdeora123,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,ok,Safdarjung’s Tomb in Delhi is a famous attraction that is made of sandstone and marble mausoleum and it came into existence in 1754 It is open on all days from sunrise to sunset entry For Indians: Rs.15 and for foreigners: Rs.200.
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Dan L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Imposing Structure,"Safdarjung's Tomb is the central focus of a Persian and Mughal Style Chaharbagh garden plan. The garden is in four segments separated by walkways and water channels and then further divided into smaller sections within the walled area. On the day we visited, the water channel from the entrance was full but no fountains working. There is a steep climb through the raised sandstone platform to access the mausoleum above. It was worth the climb to view the structure; a central chamber surrounded by eight smaller chambers and the dome above supported by a sixteen sided drum. The marble tomb is located in the middle of the central chamber.  The remainder of the site is less impressive. The three pavilions are in need of restoration and the water channels were dry. Shame, as the entire area would be a remarkable relic of the Mughal past if restored to it's former glory."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Petra F,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,No recommendation,"staff doesn't care about harassement. I felt like in a zoo, as I am european and seemend to be the attraction. I got asked approximatly 30 times for a picture before I rushed out. I couldnt get to see anything. Very disappointing consultation with staff. I do not recommend this place. There are plenty of other places to enjoy. "
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,792Carol_H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,What a Shame,"Safdarjung's Tomb is one of the last trumiphs of Moghal arcitecture. This sandstone and marble mausoleum was built for the prime minister of the Moghal empire in 1748 by his son. Some say it is similar to the style of the Taj Mahal.This was basically a derelict building they charge tourists to visit, even though it was only $7.00 each it was a waste of money. It is a shame, as the building could have been really lovely had they looked after it.The photo's do make it look pretty good though"
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Jovial Holiday,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Safdarjung Tomb Delhi is built in the style of Taj Mahal,"The Safdarjung Tomb Delhi is built in the style of Taj Mahal.  The Safdarjung tomb architecture consists of Mughal style construction, which can be seen in the material used to build it, which is red sandstone. The nearest metro station to the Safdarjung tomb is the Jor Bagh metro station."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Bala Tripura S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,One of the best monuments,This is very well maintained monument.We need to pay 25rs as entrance fee to enter this monument.Its structure looks like humayun tomb.When i entered the monument for the first time i am surprised that its structure resembles Humayun tomb.This tomb had a symmetrical structure and all the four sides of the monument looks similar
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,scs-953,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,One of the best maintained monuments. ,It was built in 1754 in the late Mughal Empire style for Nawab Safdarjung. The monument has an ambience of spaciousness and an imposing presence with its domed and arched red brown and white coloured structures. The monument is close to Lodhi garden and is easily accessible by metro as well. It has been beautifully restored over the years. It is not as grand as the Humayun’s  Tomb but still is worth a visit. Carry water with you when you visit in summer. 
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Gp Capt R K D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Historical!!,I have visited the tomb a couple of times. Maybe due to the dry season the garden seemed slightly unkept. However the monument is kept clean. Nice shady trees in the arena. The tomb is majestic and historic
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Anisha N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,well maintained,a definite visit when on trip to delhi close to lodhi gardens and humayun tomb.the place was not very crowded on sunday noon. entry fee rs 25
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Rupesh Anand,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Well Maintained Monument,"Safadarjung Tomb was built by Safdarjung’s son Nawab Shujaud Daula in 1754, it is built by sandstone and marble mausoleum, though it is not as good as Humayu Tomb but still you can find a good piece of ancient architecture."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Mark A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,under visited site.,Very interesting tomb.  Very few visitors and well worth a visit.  Expect to spend about 1/2 hour.  While not on the scale of Humayum's tomb still very interesting site.  I would recommend going early as the afternoon sun can be quite brutal.
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Alok2108,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,A must see place in Delhi.,This is a very nice historical monument and is a good place to visit if one is interested in historical places..The tomb is well maintained and so is the area around it...There is the main tomb made of marble and sand stone and is  beautiful. Typical of the design of those times there is a huge garden around the main tomb in line with the design of Humayun's tomb..The tomb is of Safdarjung who was the Nawab of Oudh who was made the prime minister of the Mughal empire. Entering through the gates one can get a perfect view of the tomb.There are also four buildings around the tomb and there is also a mosque in the premise...the quality of this tomb architecture is not in the same league as that of Humayun Tomb since this was built at a time when the moghul power was on the decline..probably this being not a very popular tourist site there was not much of a crowd..overall a very nice place to visit...
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Christopher,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,As remarkable in its own way as the Taj Mahal,"India is full of tombs, the Taj Mahal being the most famous, and it's easy to become ‘tombed out’ if you’re on a tour with a guide who is not selective.  In Delhi, however, I would urge you to visit Safdarjung’s Tomb which is awesome.  Built in 1753 in memory of ‘Mirza Abdul Mansur Khan’ who was Governor of the province of Awadh, it is a breathtakingly beautiful monument to someone few have heard of, its architecture and gardens as remarkable in their own way as the Taj.  Our visit to Safdarjung’s Tomb was all the nicer for being shared with half a dozen parties of schoolchildren whose cheerful dispositions and exemplary behaviour set an example to their contemporaries in Europe.  Do not be deterred from visiting Safdarjang’s Tomb by the physical challenges of climbing to the top.  Leave that to the children.  There is so much here to wonder at from below, you won’t be disappointed."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,travel_fan022,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,A peaceful place but limited access to the tomb.,Went here with a group and the gardens and buildings were quite nice. The main tomb is photogenic from a distance but up close it is a bit tatty and needs restoration. Interesting to here about the history of the tomb. You can walk around the ground floor but that is all.
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Indu2510,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Quiet and Beautiful,"Safadarajng Tomb is located near Lodhi Road and is worth a visit. It's beautiful and has lush green gardens, which are well maintained. The footfall we observed was less and there was ease in getting tickets. There is not much too see or roam around, so one can complete their visit in about one to two hours. It's quite beautiful, great to take pictures and relax in the lawns. Washroom is available in the premises. Worth a visit to enjoy the serenity of this monument."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,L0d0,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Daises grandure,"A beautiful ancient sandstone tomb set in extensive gardens. Ok it’s not the Taj and Humajans is grander, but it’s a beautiful place.  I really wish some effort was put in to restore the ancient brickwork and lime plaster. If they did I’m sure it would attract many more visitors. Still worth a visit if you are near."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,JEAN B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Safdarjang's amazing tomm,"The Safdarjang Tomb is a beautiful marble and sandstone tomb built for a governor or chief minister in the Mughal Empire in 1754. It is perhaps the most lavishly built mausoleum that doesn’t belong to an emperor or someone from the royal family in Delhi. Safdarjang and his family were apparently quite wealthy and powerful and the tomb was built by his son. The stone carvings which are very common in Mughal architecture are intricate and stunning. I was amazed by the wonderful arched, intricately carved ceilings throughout. Altogether the two-storey tomb, its enormous dome, minarets, elaborate arches and intricate architecture just make you want to stare in wonderment. As with many other palaces and tombs of the time it has a typical four-section garden around it. It is a shame that none of the water channels or fountains were working and didn’t look as if they had been for a while.It is located in the heart of the city, at the junction of Safdarjung Road and Aurobindo Marg and the nearest metro station is Jor Bagh Metro, situated on the yellow line. We went mid morning which was perfect as there were not many people around.It is open 7:00 AM - 6:00 PMEntry fee Indian- 15 rupeesForeigners- 200 rupees (about £2.20) but definitely worth seeing.Children up to 15 years - Free Entry."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,NikaJunie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Peaceful Place in a Crowded City,"This is the mid-18th century mausoleum, mosque, and palace complex of Nawab Safdarjung, a prime minister of the Moghul Empire. It is a beautiful structure in Moghul style, surrounded by large water gardens. Unfortunately, the fountains and pools were dry when I visited. Nevertheless, there is a peaceful atmosphere. Visitors are charged an entry fee. Washrooms near the entrance. These were clean when we visited (both ladies' and men's), but I have heard they are not always so."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,SATISHMOHAN J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Lush Green and very well maintained,Another green and neat place in the heart of Delhi and very close to Lodhi Gardenand Humanyun`s Tomb. Surrounded parks are very green and very well maintained with trees lined up and good view all around. A must visit for those  who are opting forDelhi Darshan.  The good thing is this that very vigil armed security guards were seen all around for security of monument and garden.
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,divertliving,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Beautiful and Quiet,"This city is full of amazing places. Mosques, Tombs and beautiful Parks everywhere but Safdarjung Tomb is one i wouldn't miss. I really wish they had water in the canals but other than that theres really not a bad thing you can say about it. The place is really well maintained and only 300 Ruppe to get in. We went at 7am when it opened and had the place to our self."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Tarique S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,BEAUTIFUL AND SERENE,"Built in the style of Humayun's Tomb, this 17th century Mausoleum is the last monument of Mughal Dynasty. Its beautiful and serene. One can spend free time just sitting and relaxing over here. Visit, if only you have ample time. If running short of time, then visit Humayun's Tomb. It can be said that Safdarjung Tomb is a smaller version of Humayun's Tomb. There is entry fees and parking is also available. No shops or restaurant inside."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,GSK2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Incredible,This is another beautiful example of architecture of that period. Considering the chaos outside of the gardens and tomb it is extremely peaceful and the sounds outside the walls a muffled hum. The gardens are quite large and one can envision their lushness in the peak of bloom (we were there in winter). There is some restorative work being done when we went. The tomb itself was well designed to take in the gardens from various areas and some of the delicate work still visible. Well worth the visit. If possible take time to sit in the gardens in silence and take it all in for 10-15 mins at least. NOTE: This was designated as a plastic-free zone and I was happy to see that and hope more places adopt and implement plastic-free zones across other monuments.
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,rave24,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Another marvel,"Another good place to know about the great Mughal rulers. Its a tomb on the lines of other Mughal rulers. Lush green gardens with a very different style of tomb exterior. The tomb is not in very good shape, but restoration work is going on currently and it should be back to its full glory in some time. You can see the different style of carvings done on the entrance door as well as inside the tomb. Plus the gardens surrounding will make you feel surreal. If visiting it on a sunny day, then each and every piece would be clearly visible to you.Small parking is outside it with nominal parking charges (Rs 10) and it can be easily reached via Metro/Bus. Its near to Lodhi gardens so you can walk as well."

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Essexnat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Interesting ,"Good way to spend 2 hours. Like a mini Taj Mahal, cost 600 rupees for “foreigners” but amazing architecture. Not advisable for old or disabled people as extremely steep steps"
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Geeess,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Different,This is a lesser visited monument in central Delhi and needs better upkeep which seemed underway.It is close to the well manicured Lodhi gardens but is built around 1754 in the late Mughal period The entombed was the Nawab of Awadh who was nominated as premier by a later Mughal king.The building is in the same symmetrical style as the Humayuns tomb but less grand It is mainly of red sandstone with some marble and inlay work.It is worth seeing for its different style of decoration. It has a single grave on the first level and nice gardens too. A ticket for non Indians is Rs 300
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Faismoh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Calm serenity,"Safdajung’s is another of ancient indian rulers imposing tombs right in the heart of Delhi. Perhaps because it’s lesser known, this tomb didn’t attract a lot of visitors on the day I went and as a result the atmosphere was serene allowing me to explore the tomb at my own pace. The tomb’s architecture and it’s surrounding gardens are truly worth seeing. I’ll recommend a visit."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Abbotsbury92,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,A quiet monument worth visiting; pair with Lodhi Gardens,"I'd visited New Delhi a half-dozen times on business but hadn't made it to visit Safdarjung's Tomb until a hazy, late October, Wednesday afternoon.  The tomb is one of the final Mughal monuments erected in Delhi. Built in the mid-1700s it stands in contrast to the recently-restored Humayun's Tomb, erected in the late 1500s.  Safdarjung is smaller, more modest (mostly sandstone with merely a smattering of marble), and in need of some restoration.  Nevertheless, it is well worth visiting.  The entry gate has some lovely mosaic work on the exterior arch.  Once inside the gate itself, one enjoys a striking, framed view of the tomb in the distance.  Entering the grounds proper, a three-domed mosque sits immediately north of the entry gate, built into the surrounding walls.The grounds of the tomb were nearly empty on this hazy, late afternoon (I visited at 4 p.m.)  I counted only around a dozen visitors in the tomb and around the gardens.  The golden hour before sunset is the best time to visit these monuments.  On this day, the smoky haze rendered the sun a small orange disc low in the western sky. The grounds are expansive and well-manicured.  I took a leisurely walk around the circumference twice as well as visiting the tomb and walking around the raised podium, which affords some striking isometric views of the building from its corners.  I took my time and lingered here and yet the entire visit didn't take me more than 50 minutes.  Admission is INR 300 (around US$4.50 at current exchange rates) for non-Indian visitors and well worth the trip.  I took the Metro from Patel Chowk (Ashoka Road, in the area north of Rajpath) four stops south to Jor Bagh, and then walked north approximately five minutes to the tomb.  Afterward, I recommend walking east another five minutes to the Lodhi Gardens, which is a beautifully-landscaped park containing tombs and shrines of the Lodhi dynasty of the 1400s.  It's a lovely, charming park, and the ruins amidst the English landscaping are poignant and interesting to examine.Afterward, you can easily walk northeast to Khan Market, or northwest over to the Metro at Lok Kalyan Marg (the former Racecourse Metro stop.)  This area of New Delhi is filled with grand residences, embassies and diplomatic enclaves.  I enjoy walking through this neighborhood, particularly at dusk."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Alok Mishra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Tomb built by a son in remembrance of father,"Mostly such monuments were built as a sign of love, either by a king for his queen or by a queen for king, but unlike the trend this tomb was built by a son in love and respect for his father.The structure is very similar to other tombs like Humayun's tomb or even Taj Mahal in architecture, having octagonal corners and a central hall housing the tomb.There is an entry fee of IRs 25 for the Indians and IRs 300 for the foreigners.Visit it if you are one amongst history buffs else do away with it to spend your time for  other tourist spots of Delhi."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,naveen_oberoi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Amazing monument,Safdarjungs tomb is one of the oldest monument in delhi. One can visit this monument in good weather or in winters.

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Nikhil D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,A good stop over but not a destination in itself,"If I had to do it again, I would but I would plan it as part of a trip including some other destinations in the area (of which there are plenty). Entry for Indian citizen Rs. 25 per head. Parking 10 rupees. Best part about this monument is there are very few people around so you get to enjoy it without the usual crowds. But in terms of upkeep much to be desired - there is lot of rubble and work happening so hopefully will get better. Gardens and surroundings are nice but not very large in comparison to others we have visited so if your looking g for a good walk about as well this would need a couple of rounds around the periphery to clock I. Your steps. "

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,R0hanL,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Peaceful place to visit,"We caught the metro to this site (yellow line-Jor Bagh from memory). Which ever station it was, walk to exit No. 2 or 3 as that will put you on the right side of the road to walk directly to the tomb (some 3-400m away).After purchasing a ticket, we walked in through the ornate entrance to the start of the fountain, with the tomb in the distance. There was virtually no one else there, which made our visit very peaceful. We walked all around the tomb and took our time to examine the ornate carvings in the sandstone as well as the in-lay work. We stayed a bit less than an hour, but it was well worth it. We walked back to the same metro station and carried on the Central Secretariat where we got off to visit the Rajpath and India Gate."

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Mrinal Kanti D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017,"Safdarjung Tomb – Well maintained, worth a visit",Safdarjung's Tomb was built in 1754 and is considered the last monumental tomb garden of the Mughals. It was constructed by Nawab Shujaud Daula in memory of his father Safadarjung. One interesting fact that came to light was that tomb was built using the slabs from the tomb of Abdul Rahim Khankhana. This tomb lacks the grandeur of Humayun Tomb but nonetheless worth a onetime visit. This sandstone and marble mausoleum looks beautiful during the golden hour and is perfect for photo enthusiast.

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Shikha S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,A personal favourite.,"The place is beautiful, the tomb itself looks very modest and appealing. Usually, there is no crowd and that's just perfect if you are seeking some alone time. The greenery around is breathtaking in monsoon and you can easily spot peacocks in the premises. A very beautiful place, indeed."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Chiranjib H,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Another splendour,"One of the last later Mughal era domes, Safdar Jung's tomb was built as the regime was in eclipse. The structure is symbolic of the rising domination of the provinces over the Mughal seat of power because Safdar Jung was in fact a Mughal subedar, a governor of the province of Oudh. Yet his edifice clearly shows the degeneracy of the empire in decadence. The baroque strains of Mughal architecture with its billowing domes and the encompassing plaster coats gives it a splendour of another kind. When you enter the light shines through the archway and you get a foreground symmetry of the tomb and the minarets so common to Mughal era tombs. The stone and grime cast a silhouette and on rain soaked afternoons Safdar Jung's tomb gives it a charm amidst the sound of vehicles outside."

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Tarun W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,An unexplored Mughal Gem,"Safdarjung Tomb is one of the Mughal gem which hasn't got its due. While it may not be the finest of all Mughal structures but it's architecture is pleasing and history is significant.It's located in the heart of modern Delhi city and is build on traditional Mughal concept of char bagh. While the proportion of the tomb aren't aesthetically most pleasing but seen in context of evolution with similar structures as Taj and Humayun tomb they have a story to tell.Since it's not as frequented, visit to this place is mostly quiet and calm. It has a majestic view as we enter and garden on all four side. The top is built with a mix of marble and sandstone. It is said that since it was build in a hurry the marble was actually peeled of the Khan-e-khana tomb to be reused here.Entry ticket is nominal with a separate  charge for Indian and foreign nationals.

The design is in symmetry like any other mughal monuments. The facade is made of red sandstone and marble. The intricate design pattern of the ceiling are very interesting. Jalis in every facade for the hot climate of Delhi. The main monument is in tact which the other functions are converted to ASI offices. The gardens are well maintained, You an relax there with your friends."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,janhvi_mohanta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Safdarjung ka Maqbara,"It's a garden tomb, made of marble and sandstone built in 18th century by Nawab Shujaud Daula. Quite similar to Humayun's tomb. As it is surrounded by garden, one can spend time there specially in mornings and evenings in summers and afternoon in winters. Nearby metro station is Jor Bagh. I personally liked the architecture. Just bit concerned for it's maintenance."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,PushExplore,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Well preserved monument,The Safdarjung's Tomb is a well preserved ancient monument. It has a nice garden and it quite a nice place to explore if the weather is nice. Thankfully March was quite pleasant so we enjoyed being here.
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,theCanonFanboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Solo,Wonderful & peaceful,"Draped in the pages of history, Safdarjung Tomb is such a wonderful place to spend a summers evening experiencing the history of the place. Unlike other prominent historical structures, this one is a lot quieter & you can take a stroll around the place, create some great photographs and overall have a good time."

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,PatilChinar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Another architectural marvel.,"I found Safdarjung's tomb and the complex a tad similar to Humayun's complex. Nevertheless, it is still beautiful and again well maintained. I actually found similarities in ancient Arabic structures and designs."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,vinit1791,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017,Calm and less crowded,"This place, located near Lodhi Gardens is very calm and less crowded. Structure is very much similar to Humayun's tomb, but in smaller scale. Also the stone used is bit different here. I visited in summer, so sadly heat took the toll, as there is hardly any shed around this place. Though, right outside the monument, there are lots of trees on road. This place scores full points on accessibility."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Hourie A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Another perfect monument to visit,"This monument has an architecture similar to what has been built in Humayoun's Tomb. Unfortunately, some of its parts were ruined by people but generally it is worth visiting. "
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,KANewYork,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Quiet and beautiful ,Tomb of Safdarjung. Again built in the Mughal style with a symmetric garden around. Ticket booth at the entrance. The place is not as well kept as for example the Humayuns tomb. Also much less crowded. I loved this monument. It’s definitely much smaller that other known Mughal mausoleums. Beautiful architecture. The gardens are not that well kept. Once you enter you leave the chaos of the city behind. Quite atmospheric.

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,JMGeneva,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Beautiful,"This tomb is a spectacular building in the middle of a beautiful geometrical garden... the building is not very large and mostly empty so the visit can be short but you shouldn’t miss it if visiting the neighboring Lodi gardens, it is on the way from the metro station (actually less than 5 Minutes from it). Nice pictures guaranteed."

You can easily spent more than hour here just visiting and clicking pics."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Yuliana H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Beautiful Tomb!,"Come as early as possible to avoid big crowds which makes your visit not only a lot more relaxing but also enjoyable. You can come here by metro (station : Jor Bagh, yellow line) and walk for about 15 minutes. It’s way more than beautiful to describe, you should come and experience it yourself! "
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Shounak Patwardhan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"Charming, Photogenic Monument","Do visit this tomb before Humayun's Tomb since both have a lot of similarities including the type of square buildings with the signature dome, minarets in the corners and the quadrilateral gardens around them, but the Safdarjung Tomb has its own charm even though the other one is grander. The interiors are amazing, carved and decorated in marble. The cenotaph rests peacefully in the central, arid room even though the actual grave is 20 feet under.You can visit this monument early in the morning since there aren't a lot of trees around and it can get very hot on a sunny day. There are very less people visiting here so you can get some great photographs uninterrupted by people in them. And after you can visit the Lodi Gardens since they are both very close. Also it would help to read about the history before visiting since the information available at the site is very brief."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,famous201,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Peaceful historical place ,"Safdarjung's Tomb is a historical monument. It is a square lawn with a square tomb having  symmetrical faces on all faces. The tomb is surrounded with quadrilateral gardens from all sides. In contrary to other places in New Delhi like Humayun's Tomb, Lodhi Garden or India Gate this place is less crowded most of the time. What I observed is that most of the crowd remains stuck to front lawn and main tomb. If one want to peacefully sit and relax to admire the beauty of monument in the clean garden then back side of the campus is nice place with very little crowd. Must visit as per my recommendation."

Its just one of many fantastic buildings that have been here for centuries.  Over the course of time,I stopped off and visited all of them.  One can only marvel at the richness of the amazing craftsmanship of all of them. But this one, in particular, I had a soft spot for."

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Janelle B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Very uncomfortable visit,"I’m not sure what went on. We paid for our ticket then traveled up to the tomb when we were stopped by someone claiming to be the owner of the monument. He showed an ID of some sort but being a foreigner was unsure of what it meant. He asked to see our tickets and we told him we would in front of the security officer. We pulled out the tickets, which were torn by the security guard, to show they were checked and he still doubted us. We just handed the gentleman the ticket and we left before being able to see the whole grounds because it made us so uneasy and uncomfortable. This was the only tomb/tourist area where this problem occurred. If you read the other 1 star reviews mentions some sort of scam between the security guards and the ticket booth. I would avoid. "

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,aish_1406,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Peaceful place,In Delhi there are many historical places which I truly adore but this is something not everyone is aware about. So it's less crowded and quite peaceful place to be. Best location for photoshoots. Loved this place and it's beatiful architecture. It was build in the Mughal era around 1754. If you are peace seeker then you should definitely visit this place. 
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,phillkentuk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,amazing - but a little tatty,"it looks like the Taj (a bit), but without the crowds.  Its is starting to get a bit tatty.  it's way nice to visit vs. the Taj.  Do see the Taj, of course."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Ema Datshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,The last of the Mughal garden tombs,"If you've seen Humayun's tomb - the first of the great Mughal garden tombs - I recommend to also visit Safdarjung's tomb which was the last of them. Whilst Humayun was was a Mughal emperor, Safdarjung was only a prime minister and so his tomb is grand but less impressive than Humayun's. It's more modest, but the gardens are lovely and you can play 'compare and contrast' with the other great tombs. If you're going by Metro, this is near to Jorbagh station and you can easily take a short walk from here to Lodhi Gardens. If you've hired a driver for the day, I'd recommend doing the Indira Gandhi museum, this tomb, Lodhi Gardens and then heading south to Hauz Khas for lunch and on to Qutab Minar. All can be done off the same Metro line if you prefer to avoid a driver and are willing to do a bit more walking.Entrance - I think it's 200 rupees. Less than half the price of Humayun's tomb and usually less crowded."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Anonymous :),5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017,Taj Mahal has nothing on this place,This place is a definite must-see. It's beautifully preserved with walking paths along some gorgeous trees. There are lots of amazing little birds flying around and then of course you see the buildings and your breath will be taken away. Just be careful when walking through some doorways that are covered in chains as the rust can discolour your clothes. 
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,HighHeelsPinkLips,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,"""Beautiful""","Beautiful. A mosque exists on the right side of the entrance, so, it's better to dress modestly. I wore a frock and felt a bit uncomfortable. Not much crowded. Won't take much long if you have already visited Humayun's tomb as the architecture is pretty similar. A small eatery joint is at the entrance. Would recommend a visit to Humayun's tomb prior to this."
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,SVDivvaakar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,A lesser-known peaceful basking spot with a three hundred year old mausoleum around.,"I've lived in Delhi for fifty years and more, passed this place at least once a month, but today was the first time I decided to check it out. Not as sprawling as the Humanyun's tomb, the Safdarjung Tomb has an aesthetic layout and has an attraction of its own. Lot simpler and low on the tourist lists, this place is more about having a quiet reflective afternoon bask in the largish green space, juxtaposed to a three-hundred-year-old mausoleum with a three-domed mosque hidden by trees along the periphery. A lot of the stone for this monument (built in the 1970s) was taken from the older Moghul structures in Delhi. The person in whose honour this stands: Abdul Manzur Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan-  christened as Safdar Jung by the Moghul Emperor Mohammad Shah- Safdar Jang had bought the princely state of Oudh (present day Lucknow and thereabouts), and went on to get the administration of other states like Ajmer and even Kashmir, and even became Chief Minister of Hindustan briefly before his ouster."

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,Sandeep K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Underated attraction with its own charm,"Safdarjung's Tomb is not on the must-visit list for travellers to Delhi. Heck, even I took so long to visit it even though I've lived in the city for a long time. We reached early one November morning. The place was eerily calm and once we were in, it was like an oasis of peace in the middle of the city. Just off the busy Aurobindo Marg-Lodhi Road T-point, the tomb is a reminder of Delhi's rich historic legacy. There are few visitors so one can amble about in peace. The structure itself is interesting but we couldn't find a guide to explain things better. That, we felt was a drawback, though, it could be on account of being there at 7:30 am! So, do check out the tomb and its environs. If you manage a guide, so much the better."

The sprawling garden around it makes it look like the peaceful resting place of the same name. The walking around here in the morning before it gets too crowded is so rewarding . One can see the scores of pleople locals / travellers coming here with families . An attraction worth visiting . 
Safdarjung_s_Tomb,dalhi_girl,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,"Well maintained lawns, easily accessible, good for a quick visit","Safdarjang's tomb has well maintained lawns, and it's pleasant in winters, as a place to soak up the sun. The tomb can be covered quickly. It's a lot less impressive than Humayun's tomb, but it is quieter also.  It is walking distance from Jor Bagh metro station. There are a lot of buses and autos nearby also.  Do take your own water.  There is supposed to be a water dispenser that dispenses 1 glass of water for 1 rupee. However, the person in charge had decided to take an impromptu day off the day I went. We had to buy bottled water from a dubious brand from the cafeteria just outside."

Safdarjung_s_Tomb,keith h,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,Peaceful Garden Tomb.,"I visited fairly early in the day & found the site virtually empty. A great pleasure to wander around & enjoy the early sun shining on the tomb & hear & watch the lively bird life-parakeets, mynahs & peacocks.   The tomb is typical in that it stands in a char bagh with water channels. Apparently another was raided in part to build this one.    Some pavilions set in the walls ( which are intact ) appear not to be open.The gardens are tidy with some fine trees but not exceptional.   The gateway is fairly impressive & the upper storey is the abode of The Archaeological  Survey of India's Library.  Within a few minutes walk of Jor Bagh Metro station & also a short walk from Lodhi Gardens- as long as you exit them onto Lodhi Road."

But if you have time for two, then come here as well."
