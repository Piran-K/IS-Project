Saffron_Palate,Steve I,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,Wonderful cookery class,Had the most amazing time learning about spices and their part in indian cookery. Was good to be involved in the prep for each dish. Neha really takes her time to explain each step and why we're doing what we're doing. The dishes that we managed to come up with were delicious.Neha also gives you a great insight into day to day life in Delhi and explained some things which had been puzzling us.I'd thoroughly recommend this to anyone visiting Delhi.
Saffron_Palate,Chris B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,Learning about India through cooking : an event not to be missed,"Met Neha at her home on my second day in India . It proved to be a wonderful introduction to the food and culture of the country. Neha has created a relaxed and pleasant environment that go to make the experience a memorable one. Like others I think rolling up your sleeves and having a go at preparation and cooking  is the way to get the best from the evening. Her booklet that you take away is beautifully presented  and the recipes and instructions are clear. I throughly enjoyed what I had cooked ,which isn’t always the case!  Neha is a great conversationalist and I learned a great deal about Indian life that you don’t get in the guide books."

She is a great instructor, and it was especially interesting learning about all the different Indian spices and how they are used. We will definitely be experimenting when we get home with the ones we purchased in the Spice Market. Thank you, Neha!"
Saffron_Palate,Rachael H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Peaceful and enjoyable class,My fiancé and I took part in a cooking class with Neha. She was very welcoming and we had a lovely experience chatting about everything. It was fun to learn how to cook some Indian dishes. Neha altered how spicy the dishes were according to our spice tolerance. It was a lovely and peaceful experience.
Saffron_Palate,Timothy D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Excellent Cooking Class,"This was my first travel cooking class, and a great introduction!  Neha's instruction was thorough, patient, and very helpful.  I consider myself a decent amateur Indian cook, but the class significantly improved my technique, and added to my recipe collection.  Everything was delicious, and Neha made it all quite easy to learn, including Indian flatbreads which I'd been wanting to try but not bold enough to attempt on my own from a recipe book.  Though she had a bit of a schedule conflict, Neha was able to send me to the market with her delightful mother.  The whole experience was well worth it!"
