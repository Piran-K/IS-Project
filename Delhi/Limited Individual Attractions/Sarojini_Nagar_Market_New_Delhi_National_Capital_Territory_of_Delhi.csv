Sarojini_Nagar_Market,JastiGrl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Solo,Come with energy!,"I had heard a lot about the market on social media in the past so definitely wanted to check it out before flying out the next day. I went on a weekday and there was still a crowd but it wasn’t too hard to navigate. I would suggest going early or late to avoid the sun. And make sure you have stamina! I only shopped for an hour and half because I was simply too hot & tired to keep going. I only made it through a small portion, but it seems like they sell just about everything there. I ended up getting a couple cheap outfits, bed sheets/cover, and two home decor items. Felt totally safe going on my own as a female - just was careful with my belongs but no more than usual."

Sarojini_Nagar_Market,Navigator781299,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,The new and improved New Delhi,There’s been tremendous changes from 3 years ago when I last came here. The market is more spacious but things are more expensive. I think it is because of the tax imposed by the government since post-covid. It was difficult to locate areas where I used to buy certain things because there has been displacement. I definitely accord the Indian government for the effort for putting things in place especially the neatness and tidiness. I like the new India i am currently staying in. They should keep it up.

Sarojini_Nagar_Market,Explore with Alok,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 • Couples,Best flea market in the bylanes of South Delhi.,"Best place in the bylanes of South Delhi when it comes to flea market. This place is most famous for its really cheap designer clothes and reputable brands that have been rejected from export, either because of surplus quantity or small manufacturing defects. It houses the rejected goods from across the world, and thus offers almost every product at throwaway prices. Shops and stalls, selling all kinds of clothes and fashion accessories, sprawl onto the streets. New stock arrives every Tuesday, so it's best to go then.This shopping site is particularly famous among youth and foreigners, which is probably the reason behind it being the tidiest place in the city. Music, fashionable clothes, books, kitchenware, handicrafts, are all available here at wholesale price, but very high quality. The many shoe shops in the vicinity of the market also catch the eye."

Sarojini_Nagar_Market,Madhulika L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"Chaos, crowds — and unlimited shopping","In Delhi, if you want to buy designer wear, and if you can afford those prices, you go to a fancy mall like Emporia. If you want to revamp your wardrobe at dirt-cheap prices, you come to Sarojini Nagar. Over the past thirty-odd years, this formerly sleepy and quiet little shopping area has burgeoned and become one of South Delhi’s busiest, most popular and most crowded markets. Sarojini Nagar Market is divided into two main sections: the smaller, more compact one is Babu Market, which is a rectangular group of shops (almost all selling clothing or jewellery), arranged in rows. Across a narrow road from this is the bulk of the market, a huge roughly H-shaped spread with the crossbar disproportionately long and facing (across a parking lot) Babu Market. This market also is dominated by clothing shops and stalls. One of the ‘uprights’ of the H faces the main road, and is taken up by clothing stores as well as several shoe shops. The other upright, which forms the back of the market, has even more clothing stores, and faces a vegetable and fruit market. The other side of the crossbar has—you guessed it—more clothing stores, with some electrical and electronics shops thrown in (this is a good place to go shopping for washing machines, fridges, TVs and the like: several shops are showrooms for major brands). The cross bar of the T actually consists of two crossbars, separated by a lane which is occupied by dozens of stalls that mostly sell cheap clothing, much of it second-hand imported stuff. Sarojini Nagar doesn’t have any great restaurants: if you want to eat, the only options here are roadside food, like chaat and the like. But if you want to shop, there’s no end of choices available. There’s lots of haggling going on, there are plenty of ridiculously inexpensive items available, and there are wandering vendors selling everything from tablecloths to sun glasses to watches and wallets. If you visit on a busy day (a weekend, or pretty much any day just before a major festival like Diwali) be prepared for a lot of jostling and shoving. Weekdays are better; the market is closed on Mondays."

But you must know how to bargain to get your money's worth. We went on a Sunday when most stores were open. From regular shops, to boutiques, to street hawkers and vendors one can buy anything and everything based on one's budget. We went to a luggage store selling really good brands at reasonable prices. Sarojini Nagar Market is probably the best and cheapest market in Delhi. I love the section where beautiful lamps are sold, and if I am not mistaken it's called the Graffiti Lane. Make sure you have money in smaller denominations if you wish to buy from street hawkers. I highly recommend this market, it's heaven for bargain hunters. And by the way, for sari lovers like me, there are saris which cost really cheap."

There are Taylor's abound if you need something fixed like i did with the zipper on my neck pouch.  I was thrilled because I prefer it over my money belt.  Was fixed for 100inr.  Many local food shops.

There are an endless number of shops that sell everything from clothes to shoes to makeup and accessories. The prices are unbeatable. Although the quality isn't the best, the styles and choices are great. Whatever style of clothing you're looking for, you'll find. Bargaining is a must- the shopkeepers will quote a higher price because they know the customer will bargain. Take a bag with you, as you'll be loaded with things to carry. There's a metro station that stops right at the market, so it's extremely convenient to access. This market is definitely a must visit."

Sarojini_Nagar_Market,Nishita Jindal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Cheap Prices For Brands,"We went as a group of friends. We entered from gate no.2, near icici bank atm. The market is really amazing for shopping for party wear. Though, there rae other forms of clothes, party wear is what sarojini nagar is known for. The shoes, clothes, jewellery and watches are all branded, but very cheap. Of course, they could be faked, but they're cheap, so...Bargaining is an art here. When a person says 600-800Rs. for a watch, reduce the amount to 100-250 Rs. and quote that as your last price. They are desperate to give away their wares, so they'll agree to anything, if you make as if to leave them.I'll give you a small tip. Never look for more than a millisecond or just a glance at any ware, as if you look at it for a longer time, the hawkers will think you're interested in their wares and will force you to buy it by appealing to your morals and by pestering you. A few shopkeepers keep a board saying ""Fixed Price"", but sometimes, you can haggle there. I bought a capatin america tee for rs.250 ( which is quite a bargain) and a fasttrack watch for also the same price. The person who sold me the watch was telling me of the watch's brand and its quality. But since, this is sarojini nagar, you can haggle a lot."

When I first went back in the eighties it was much dirtier and cows would accompany you on your trip, but it still retains a fun atmosphere and you are unlikely to leave empty handed. If you're going to be backpacking around India it's a great place to pick up some cheap clothes you can later abandon. Or not. Lots of shops selling a plethora of stuff you never knew you needed! Easy to reach by tuk tuk."
