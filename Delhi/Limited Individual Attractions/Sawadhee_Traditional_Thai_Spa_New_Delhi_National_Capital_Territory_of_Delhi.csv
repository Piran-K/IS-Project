So the first thing I did when I reached the hotel was to look up a massage place around me. I‚Äôm SO glad that I found and decided to go to Sawadhee. It was exactly what I needed. The whole place has such a calming vibe, the staff is so so kind and good at what they do & the music was so on point! I probably slept through most of my foot massage because it was so relaxing!

Last evening I along with my friends headed out for a relaxing Spa Eve at the much awarded and highly recommended Sawadhee Spa ; rather than the usual girls night out at one of our favorite watering holes . And boy! Was it a rewarding experience!! We all opted for the 2 hour duration Deep Tissue massage and were each welcomed into a gorgeously done up therapy room with private steam & bathing area fully equipped with hairdryer ,specially formulated shampoo bath gel et al.The treatment started with a Balinese foot bath ritual to clean the feet and prepare the body for the relaxation to come. The massage was perfection with an array of exotic oils to choose from & with the perfect amount of pressure and variety. After this absolutely blissfully sublime therapy we were served with some divine Thai tea served beautifully in a tray handmade quaint ceramic kettle & cups - the subtle aroma & flavour  further succeeded in enhancing the sense of calm and relaxation.Sawadhee Traditional Thai Spa is a must for some ‚Äòme‚Äô time (or ‚Äòwe‚Äô time with ones significant other ); especially with the todays hectic pace of life.I came away feeling rejuvenated & replinished ‚Ä¶ and an absolute Sawadhee addict!Congratulations to the owner for consistently keeping up excellent standards & sweeping the Spa awards each year for the best stand alone  day spa in India!!Kudos Team Sawadhee!!Cant wait to be spoilt in this fabulous realm of utter luxury‚Ä¶ see you again soon!!!"

The therapist had long nails and while giving me a head massage she scratched all over my scalp. It was bleeding. She also pulled a strand of hair, which caused a boil. Overall they are not professional AT ALL."

The ambience, staff, variety of services and safety precautions undertaken were beyond expectations.The staff was extremely warm and helpful,and took me through their entire collection of home-made body scrubs, helping me select the right one for my skin type. I absolutely loved the home-made jasmine sugar body scrub treatment - it left my skin feeling so smooth, hydrated and smelling amazing! The entire treatment was extremely blissful and soothing, like a mini-massage in itself. Must try for those looking for a day of ultimate relaxation!Thank you, Team Sawadhee.

The safety precautions taken by the team were spectacular to say the least, I felt safe and secure during the entire course of my massage. The massage was outstanding, and completely relaxed me- just what I was looking for. I had heard a lot about Sawadhee from my friends and family and finally got down to trying it. The experience exceeded my expectations by far and I'm glad I found a spa I can trust. I would highly recommend this spa to anyone looking for a good massage. Great work by the team! Keep it up!"

Sawadhee_Traditional_Thai_Spa,agoel9,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Horrible spa experience ,"I recently visited Sawadhee for a deep tissue massage and I was thoroughly disappointed from the first moment. I went in the afternoon, it‚Äôs 40C currently in Delhi, you would think they‚Äôd have their air conditioning on when they know a client has his appointment. They turned it on only after I entered the room and it took good 20 mins for the room to be somewhat cool, ruining all that time that was supposed to be for ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù. There was an air purifier in the room that wasn‚Äôt turned on even after my request. The therapist completely forgot about giving a foot bath which is something you‚Äôd expect and I mentioned it as I won‚Äôt get a massage without one. The massage itself was average, I don‚Äôt know about the credentials of their therapists, I had bruising from the massage which is weird (I regularly get deep tissue and I know it can cause soreness before you think I‚Äôm being harsh). After the massage, I had the option to take steam/shower or get changed, I couldn‚Äôt even consider taking a shower as it didn‚Äôt look clean so I decided to just get dressed but the therapist turned off the air conditioning without even asking. It was almost as if, ‚Äúok massage over, you can get out‚Äù. I mentioned all this to the lady at the reception while paying, she was all smiles and all she said to me was, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the only one that has ever given such an elaborate feedback, people over here don‚Äôt really care so much about these little things‚Äù. If you‚Äôre considering getting a spa in Delhi, go to Chi at Shangri La instead , you‚Äôd be happy. I won‚Äôt recommend this place at all. "

Thankyou for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

It is with great concern and regret that we received your review outlining the problems that you had at our spa. First and foremost, we would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to you.

We believe your visit to our spa was amidst the beginning of the second wave of COVID 19 in Delhi ( 2 days before we shut operations and Delhi went into a complete lockdown soon after), when there was immense panic in the city, as a result of which a lot of our pre and post massage rituals like foot scrub that increase the face to face interaction of the client and staff had to be paused, to ensure the safety of our clients as well as staff members. Further, we were also following other precautions like switching off the air conditioner and opening doors to allow maximum circulation of fresh air.  Those were indeed dark times and we hope and pray that those days are now far behind us. 

Now, with the number of cases greatly reducing in the city, we hope the Delhi government shall soon allow us to open our doors again very soon and we shall be able to serve you once more!

Our sincere apologies to you once again and we do hope that once we open you will give us another opportunity to showcase our services and this time we assure you that we will live up to our usual high standards and will make sure you enjoy our services and leave with a smile on your face!

Finally my stiffness won the battle and I decided to go. But before that I called up Sawadhee and the receptionist reassured me that they are following all covid safety protocols. I finally went there and I was totally at ease. They had a sanitizer cum temperature checking machines installed right at the reception. On going into the massage room, the room was sanitized and sprayed in front of me and disposable sheets were used. My therapist wore a mask the entire time.

It was a much-needed treatment after a long flight from the U.S. and in preparation for the Mumbai 1/2 marathon in a week's time.  The facilities are clean, serene and welcoming, but most importantly (to me), the massage was on point.  I left feeling 100% better than I felt walking in.  It was like a massage and chiropractor appointment in 1!  The therapist listened to my needs and applied the right pressure in the right places, as requested.  The steam shower after was also appreciated.  The prices are competitive, and worth every rupee.  I will definitely be back!"

Sawadhee_Traditional_Thai_Spa,F Athar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Great Massage but Unprofessional environment,"My daughter had been going to the spa and I liked the massage service they provided so I signed up. However, when I went there yesterday, for the 4th time, my experience left a very bad taste. The massage, deep tissue by Shaija, was exceptional. However, I could not utilize the steam facility as the room seemed filled with steam but was cold. (dont ask how). The masseur came in tried to fiddle with the controls but could not make it warm. I had to leave so I came to the reception and mentioned that the service was incomplete. The in-charge, a lady who said her name was Vibha, just refused to believe that the steam room had been cold! Even when the massuer told her that it was cold, she ignored her and kept telling me that the steam here could not be as hot as 5-star hotels. I tried to tell her that it was COLD and that I was comparing it to earlier visits when the steam experience had also been exceptional. When i realized that she was not even interested in listening to my feedback, i left.It is sad because the massuers are exceptional but I will never go back. The unprofessional attitude of the owner/in-charge was very off putting. I wonder if she even thought of why I would tell her something was wrong if i had enjoyed the massage so much.Hence, I do NOT recommend going there. The impact of the massage was lost."
Sawadhee_Traditional_Thai_Spa,TeamSawadhee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Excellent 3 hour package,"Dear Guest,

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused to you. We consider all are guests to be really special and we feel that it is never too late to clear out any confusion that may be there.

Your daughter has been a membership client with us for some time now and we have had a long and beautiful relationship with your family wherein  your daughter has renewed her membership with us time and again.

As per our company policy, we allow our member clients to share their discounted membership packages with their loved ones and in this context you have also been coming and using our spa services on your daughters membership card.

On the fateful day, you took a one hour massage therapy (which as per your words was exceptional!) After the massage, we have a complimentary steam for 5-7 minutes followed by a shower.

After your therapy, when you came down and  the girl at the reception asked you to sign the membership card for the massage therapy taken, you refused to sign it, saying you would not pay for it and started getting really angry and shouting at her and all our staff that the steam was not hot enough. Our staff profusely apologized and tried their best to pacify you, but you just kept getting more and more upset at everyone.

You insisted that the steam was not working properly and that we go and check the steam with you, which we did and the result was the steam was working, although it was not as hot as it had been in the summer months. You then demanded we refund the money of your daughters membership, to which we readily agreed, but then you changed your mind and said that your daughter would come and take the refund if she wished to, since it was her membership.

In our defense, we would just like to say that these were very cold days in the month of December (as per the weather charts, it was the coldest December in a 100 years in Delhi) and certain external factors like the efficient working of the steam machine in producing really hot steam can be a little on the lower side in these cold winter months.

Once again, the inconvenience caused to you is deeply regretted! And our very Sincere Apologies to you!!

Warm Regards,

The Sawadhee Team

The employees at the front desk are patient & respectful. The massage rooms are ambient and quite comfortable (there are private bathrooms); the masseuse highly professional, checking in frequently to ensure everything is going well. I selected the Head to Toe package, which ran slightly over three hours, but was well worth the cost & time. I'm visiting Delhi for a short while but will likely be visiting Sawadhee again."

Sawadhee_Traditional_Thai_Spa,Anjali C,,,,"I went to get a massage November 24, 2019.As I mentioned, the massage was great.However...There was some Indian man (Not sure if he was the manager/owner or what), verbally reprimanding the receptionist behind the counter. This is unprofessional and should be handled behind closed doors, not in the presence of customers.After my 90 minute massage, I went to check out at the reception, and the same Indian man was still at it. I felt extremely uncomfortable. It soured my perception of this business.Also, they took forever on my phone, using my credit, to try to explain to the driver how to find my location who was just down the street. It still baffles me how people can be of the same culture and speak the same language and still can‚Äôt communicate simple  directions. What really made me angry was that I was using roaming and she (Possibly a manager as well) still had my phone connected at the end of the conversation, holding the phone in her hand. Why are you listening to the taxi man breathing while you should‚Äôve disconnected the call after you told him how to get to the location..The only positive thing was the massage itself. The organization, communication, and professionalism was a miss."
Sawadhee_Traditional_Thai_Spa,TeamSawadhee,,,,"Dear Guest,

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your feedback. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your massage therapy here.

We have taken up your feedback, shared it with our management and staff. We apologise for the inconvenience caused to you. Usually, whenever we have outstation guests who have roaming cards on their phones, we assist them in calling the uber/ ola /taxi services from our own phone lines so that they do not waste their precious resources on long distance calls. We would have readily done the same for you had you just asked. Sometimes, it takes time to explain the directions as the people who are driving these taxi services are from outside of Delhi and may have difficulty in understanding the directions and hence it could have taken some time to explain. Our spa is also on google maps, hence finding our spa should never be a problem if the person is familiar with reading google maps.

We can assure you that your experience was certainly not reflective of our usual standards. Let us assure you that it is our constant endeavor to provide the best of services to our guests and that every guest of our spa is treated with utmost professional care and hospitality. It seems we have fallen short this time

We do hope that you will give us another opportunity to showcase our services to you again, and assure you that we will live up to our usual high standards.

,,,,,"My husband and i were in delhi after a hectic 10 days of travel, and we decided that a massage package was exactly what we needed. we found sawadhee somewhat close to our hotel, and decided to get the massage, body scrub and body wrap package. Once you enter the spa and check in, you can choose between a variety of oil options for the massage, and scrub options for the body scrub. You change into slippers and are then escorted to the 3rd floor to the couples room. The massage was excellent - it was really deep tissue, and painful at times where i had knots. we were definitely relaxed after it. The scrub and body wrap were also good. They rub some sort of herbal paste and then cover you up with plastic film. My husband was sleeping through a lot of it! My only complaint is that the shower area does not drain very fast, and everytime you go in to wash off the oil or the paste, you are standing in a pool of water that does not drain away. Other than that, the experience was excellent and i highly recommend"

The place is beautifully designed and you can smell the lovely fragrance of lemon grass. The girls at the reception were very friendly and helped us to decide on our therapy - I took the Hot Stone massage therapy and my friend took the Sports massage therapy. Our therapists (Shaiza and Alina) were very nice, they were well trained and knew their job well. After the massage, they made us inhale a lovely fragrance which felt really refreshing and soothing. Then we had a steam and hot shower and were served this awesome thai tea which is a combination of thai herbs and stevia leaf as a natural sweetener which again was very calming.Both of us just loved our therapy at Sawadhee and hopefully shall be back again soon for another awesome experience! Highly Recommend this Wonderful Spa!"
