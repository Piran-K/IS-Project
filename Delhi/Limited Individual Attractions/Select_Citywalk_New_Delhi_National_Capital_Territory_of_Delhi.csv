Though the nearest metro station is Malvia Nagar.ShoppingIt has one of the best range of brands, which means the top end to the middle level.The layout and classification is amazing, like you have all the kids stuff  at one area near the Home Store. The food court has just been upgraded and has the best spread. Incidentally the average price range of anything is around 350.The specialty restaurants are great with a spread from fast food to sit in restaurants. Shopping for cloths is great as they have a lot of offers going on be it H&M or the Home Store. They have interesting home stuff especially a shop called 'Gifts of love@' located on the second floor near the central arcade. Its great for gifting items. High end glassweare like OMA or ethnic wear like Fab India you have it all.The main attraction is the decor of the central arcade. It has the best display in the city every time be it a festival or valentines Day. There is always some interactive theme going. Outside there is a place to even adopt stray puppies which is a good social initiative.Parking is big but a wee bit on the expensive side like if you park for 4 hours you end up shelling out 90 bucks but its well manned, clean and safe."

Neither it was too spicy nor overloaded with various sauces, each and every ingredient was rightly placed.The vegetables curry was super delicious with vegetables rightly boiled with a thick gravy.The Chicken Manchurian was too juicy and rightly cooked with a very adequate portion size.A must try food counter if you happened to visit this mall.It accepts all major debit and credit cards and also wallets.Ambience-9/10Food- 9/10Cleanliness-10/10If you like the post, please comment and hit the 👍 button and also follow the page for upcoming posts."

It's a mall just perfect for the rich and famous from food to brands from Addidas to Tommy Hilfiger you name it and you'd see it although it is a bit expensive, but like I said if you want to go on a shopping spree and your pockets are loaded then it's the place. Chicago pizza as you enter so theres a slice of everything 😀😍😍"
Select_Citywalk,Shobha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,World class mall,"Not somewhere to go for a bargain, but safe, clean and all western brands you would find in Australia as well as some others.The ambience here is really nice.  Good to visit the eateries around the outside with music playing and stunning light displays etc.It seems like a place locals like to be seen at and you will see many of them taking selfies there.Recommended for the great atmosphere.  Expect to pay the same as you would in australia for things."
Select_Citywalk,832vgs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Lovely shopping mall!,The many of the shops would be found in a european mall and as a european I was suppriced to find a mall that looks like being taken right out of Europe. Only a few shops are focused on Indian articles. Lots of restaurants.
Select_Citywalk,Nick L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Sept 2019,Found majorly all my favourite brands available here . There were huge fresh collections which I loved . Even restaurants in the mall were good . We had lots of fun here . Will love to visit again for shopping here if in delhi .

,,,,,Well I
,,,,,Went here on Trip Advisor recommendation. Cheapest transport for tourist is by UBER by far. We paid more in random rickshaw rides before we worked out half prices on Uber. Western shopping mall with huge food choice. Was thrilled to find a French Patisserie - L’Opera. Best sandwich I have seen or tasted in 2 weeks! Great coffee too! Felt like I was home for 40 mins. Expensive grocery store underneath Shopping mall....but definately fun to see different products and compare prices. Definately only a place to get top up items or just allow access to some  familiar Australian foods as well as local items. Nice homewares shop also that had good prices if you took time to look at items. Nice and cool to stop by and get out of the “market”heat for a change.
Select_Citywalk,Attul Handoo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Select Citywalk,Nearest mall to my home with walk able distance. Lots of places to eat and shop. You can get some best brands for shopping.

Select_Citywalk,SelectCITYWALK,,,,"This mall is quite nice but nothing really spectacular about it. Just some regular stores and few brand names. However, it was a place for us to kill time when we really had nothing to do after the tour to Jaipur and Taj Mahal. It's a place just to grab some nice restaurants and groceries. It was quite crowded since it's the only nice mall around the area."

,,,,,The mall is located in Saket as the name suggests. It is comparable to international malls. All major brands have a store here. The food court has a variety of options to choose from. The back entry of the mall is a better option if you choose to ride in an Uber.

Select_Citywalk,Nidhi Gupta,,,,"Coming from Kochi, this is the first mall I've visited in the capital and the Select Citywalk I feel does have enough to keep you engaged. The shops and outlets are nicely laid out having a great mix of mid to upper end and international brands. The mall has quite a lot of everything,.. apparels, personal care, novel goods, lifestyle brands, ice creams, restaurants, liquor and a foodcourt, all nicely spaced out. All in all was a fun place to spend some time. Looking forward to going here more."
