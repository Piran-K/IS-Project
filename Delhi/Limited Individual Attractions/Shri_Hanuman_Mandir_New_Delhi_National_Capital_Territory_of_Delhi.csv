Shri_Hanuman_Mandir,Catherine,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Exotic,Well worth a trip to see this temple .   Make sure you have plenty of small denominations. You will have to take off your shoes on the street outside.   There is a young man there who looks after them for you for a small fee.   You will also be  expected to donate something to each of the priests who show you to their altar.   Take lots of photos.   The statue you see in this photo was not easily visible when I was there because of repairs to the temple.

Shri_Hanuman_Mandir,macedonboy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Temple with giant statue of Hanuman,"The Hanuman Temple in Jhandewalan is as the name suggests, a Hindu temple dedicated to the monkey god Hanuman. Itâ€™s probably best known for the huge and colourful statue of Hanuman and for the monkey themes that decorated the entrances to the temple. This is the second time I've visited the temple, but sadly, there a lot of scaffolding around the statue which makes me glad that I saw it before the scaffolding went up. Better wait until the renovations are complete."

Shri_Hanuman_Mandir,Les Thuilliers,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Uncomfortable Visit To Hanuman Temple,"I visited the Hanuman Temple as my departing experience of Indian culture.In the Temple I was ""scooped"" up by a devotee who sat me down, tied a string around my wrist & painted on a bindi. He then went on to demand 100 rupees which I paid & he placed in his pocket.I then walked to view the statues on the ground level & another devotee called my upstairs. Upstairs I was placed in front of Goddess Parvati. The devotee recited a prayer, brushed me with peacock feathers & asked me for money for the Goddess. I handed over another 100 rupee. Then asked for money for himself. I only had 500 rupee notes. When I said ""no change,"" he said 500 rupees to which I said no. I was feeling a little uncomfortable & decided to leave at which point another devotee stood in my way.I persisted & made my way out.. Finally I went to retrieve my shoes from the rack. A young man asked for money & stood in front of my shoes. I had 20 rupees in coins which he wasn't interested in & held his arm in the way of me collecting my shoes. By now I was getting rather pi**ed off with the interactions of the past 15 minutes. I called over to a uniformed man who had guided me into the Temple entrance when I arrived. Fortunately he told the young man to allow me to collect my shoes. In my 9 days of travel in northern India this was the first time I felt uncomfortable. I think if you are with a guide or in a group of people you wouldn't be subjected to an experience like this. Not nice particularly in a Temple."

The temple is quite a spectacle though. You can go in and poke around, and I suggest you do. There are all kinds of wacky rituals going on in there. There is even some lower passageway with all kinds of gonzo statues that you can crawl through. It's one of the stranger temple experiences I had in India and reminded me if Pee Wee Herman went Hindu and built a temple in Delhi. Walk through the giant demon mouth and explore. They have such sights to show you."

I gave 100 INR.Lots of high pressure sales pitching to go in to each of the many rooms-my last room held a large statue and I was ushered in.

Shri_Hanuman_Mandir,SILBERSTEINSKY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 â€¢ Couples,Interesting temple,For sure much better than the famous and boring Birla temple which is more or less in the same location. A little bit like a Disneyland but this is really active worship place. A must to see a specific Hindu temple with a variety of gods. Nicely organized. Close to the metro station.

Shri_Hanuman_Mandir,enigmatic1989,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Solo,Delhi's own landmark!!,"Delhi is famous for many historical things like Lal Quila, India Gate, Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb but this mega structure located at Jhandewalan is one of the few modern structures that has been visualised as a landmark of Delhi. I personally have seen this structure made in a span of 10 years as my school was nearby and I used to think that it will never be built completely. The best thing about this statue is that it's in the heart of Delhi (in the vicinity of Karol Bagh of Cannaught Place) and the way to Gurgaon (road to Dhaula Kuan) passes by its side, giving it a centre of attraction for people coming to Delhi from airport or via Delhi-Jaipur highway. The addition of metro station (Jhandewalan) adjacent to it and the metro passing intermittently in front of it is a sight to cherish, one which is showed in many movies and serials based on Delhi."
