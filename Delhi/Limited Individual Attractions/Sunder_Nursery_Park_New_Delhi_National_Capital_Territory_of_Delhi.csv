Sunder_Nursery_Park,Alison B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples," Dahlias in January! Enjoy an atmospheric, hassle free, sensory walk through a well laid out garden park.","Our 7th time in Delhi, but first at this relatively recently opened park. We loved it! Beautifully laid out with dahlias, stocks, marigolds, pansies, roses all in flower (in january). No one hassled us as foreigners. The park was spotless; we thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere at dusk as we walked round the lit fountains, with the birds roosting above. What  a vision this is from the Aga Khan trust."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Hanzik von Tutenschwarz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Clean and well maintained park,"Nice and very clean place to chill at. Walk around the park, sleep on a blanket under a tree, whatever floats your boat, it's the perfect place. Entry fee is 25 Rs for locals, 200 Rs for foreigners, I would still consider that a fairly reasonable price. There are free water stations, clean public bathrooms and a decent cafe/restaurant at the end of the park - a bit pricey, but clean and full of good food/drinks.All in all, ideal place to visit. Make sure to also visit Humayun's tomb across the street (probably go there first and then come here to recharge)."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Shiv V,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Amazing nusery park  bad cafe,So when I entered the nuresery park it was colourful great and fun but when I was hungry I went to the cafe witch really let it down it was dirty dusty mouldy walls and the walls were chipping off the had horrible horrible hygiene they didn‚Äôt use gloves and didn‚Äôt was their hands before making meals and the place looks run down     Amazing nursery park bad cafe
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Anika S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,"Sprawling and well maintained Picnic Park at Nizamuddin , Annual Christmas Market. Pets allowed .","It's a huge and well maintained park at Nizamuddin area of New Delhi .It's a great place for picnic , one is allowed to carry eatables and picnic baskets inside ,can spread a sheet and sit in the sprawling lawns .Timing 7 am to 10 pm.Today was Christmas and they have an annual Christmas Market - The Sorbet Soiree having stalls of clothes ,accessories , food ,home decor etc .It has multiple attractions like Sunder Burj ,Nursery Bed, Garden of Delight ,Flower Valley.One time Entry Charges : Indian Adults -Rs 50 ; Child (5-12 year),Senior Citizen -Rs 25 . Foreign Tourists - Rs 200.They even have annual entry pass . Pets are allowed ,spotted many dogs walking around with owners .It was extremely crowded due to Christmas Market and there were long queues and waiting time for tickets and food too. They don't have online ticketing facility .However its an interesting and must visit attraction if one is in this area . There was a variety of food like Pizza, Barbecue ,Thai ,Dimsums ,chaat etc ."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Devaleena J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Nice but a huge distance from Gurgaon!,"The directions in the park has to be more prominent and clear and has to be placed more frequently. The food stalls are a disappointment after a long, long walk. The small food stalls have mostly chips, biscuits, tea and coffee, and some patties. Only few food vans have sandwiches, which are located at another place.The full-fledged restaurant by Fab India has a mix of Indian, Thai, italian cuisine.  The Ladakhi soup noodles we ordered was of good quantity, light and mildly spicy. However, it is a very busy spot and might take a long time to receive the food. Seating arrangement is small, so there is a rush during lunch hours.Good restroom facilities. Nice picnic spots throughout the park. It has an amphitheater, which can be booked in advance for holding programmes. Overall, a nice place to spend with family and friends on a winter afternoon. Please note: The Drive Way is different from the Walk Way. The Drive Way will lead to the Fab India restaurant. It is a longer distance. The Walk Way is a shorter route to the restaurant. Please do not use the Drive Way if you are walking to the restaurant. You will end up walking miles through an isolated paved forest road, which may make you feel uncanny, though it is safe."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Rahul S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Fantastic place for picnic,"Fantastic place. Well maintained, lots of greenery and open as well as shaded places. Had a great time here. The farmers market on the weekend is cherry on the cake."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Manisha T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Picnic with family,"Very well kept place!! visiting Sundar Nursery brought back childhood memories of picnic which is kind of fading away these days.There are many activities to keep kids engaged, however i would suggest to allow indoor games at least if not outdoor games. Sports like badminton, frisbee etc as its harmless and will not conflict in keeping the heritage site maintained.I had two young kids and two teenagers accompanying with me and it was difficult to keep them full time engaged because of no permission of playing badminton or any other such game. This is why rated 3 out of 5. If kids would have played their sport here, it would have been 5 out of 5 experience."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Maneesh2700,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Sunder Nursery - Close to Nature,"Sunder Nursery takes you away from the hustle-bustle of the city and presents a very beautiful picture of the nature. This place is simply amazing if visited early in the morning but, I believe, it would look equally beautiful in the evening. Well, worth spending time there with the family"
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Bhanu Pratap Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Close to Nature,"When I was planning to visit Sunder Nursery Park, One thing that hesitates me was the safety of my car.

Sunder_Nursery_Park,Pooja,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Delhi's own green Crown!!,In a metro packed with vehicles and honks ecohing even in midnight- this nursery is a gift from Mother Nature! Beautifully crafted and maintained- gives insight into Indian history. With fallen petals adorning the grass every few steps like gems in ornaments...the quality of air one gets to breathe is balm on lungs- I concluded! there are weekend flea markets in winters- selling organic groceries and food.

Sunder_Nursery_Park,Twarita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,"A place for history and nature lovers Chill,pill!","The garden is absolutely a place to cool down with the view it offers. The track is good for walkers and joggers. Historically speaking ,the monuments that offered the bridge between Humayun and Mughals are there and now the beauty of the park maintained well around it gives a pleasent experience to the people who come to roam with all flora and fauna and the colorful scenes .The lake adds to the calm of the place. A must visit if you havnt. Birds,butterflies and flowers,blue sky and greenery is definately a chill pill. Can even organise cultural events in the amphitheatre of it . Pond containing lotus flowers also there . Some transcripts carved out of stone in urdu written on monuments to give a culture experience too. Nature and culture going hand in hand is a total bliss."

Sunder_Nursery_Park,Babita Huria,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 ‚Ä¢ Friends,An oasis in the concrete jungle of Delhi ,"The Sunder Nursery is an outstanding place to visit for walk , picnic or just sit and admire the beautiful green space and some Mughal Architecture tomb. It has beautiful green space with lots of fountains. The best day to visit is on Sunday when the farmer market is on. We went a day before Holi on Sunday which a great day to browse the farmers market and also visit the fabcafe by the lake. You can also take your pets though you have to take of the strays in the garden. A must visit if you live in Delhi or visiting.  "
Sunder_Nursery_Park,tarit1979,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Oasis in the heart of Delhi,"Sunder Nursery which opened in 2018 is a real oasis in the heart of Delhi for a nice Sunday picnic. Acres of manicured gardens, flower beds, tree houses and a great spot near the lake make it a feast for the senses. On weekends there is a organic farmers market and a superb food court. The Fab caf√© inside also has great food. The kids will enjoy the open space to play games like cricket and football and also the swings on the trees. A great place to visit with your family!"
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Shakti,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Fantastic Experience but one hiccup. The toilets are not clean,It was a great place to be on a sunny winter day. Only problem is that toilets are not well maintained and not clean.
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Bhadriraju M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Pretty and clean place,"Large, well laid out gardens, clean, inside New Delhi. Part of the biohabitat includes the Sunder Burj with its beautiful plaster work, striking after a few hundred years, with help from conservation efforts by Aga Khan  Trust. Pretty water channel, alive with children. Samples of some interesting scenery are attached."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,NeelavSamratDe,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Bad humiliating guard named Vandana spoilt our visit,"The nursery is a great place to be with the family. But we had a nasty incident with a guard named Vandana, a young crass uneducated lady, who does not have the basic decency to talk to good genre visitors. She infact spoilt my entire day just because we wanted to step out of the park and go to the car and fetch a sweater for my wife. She wouldnt allow us! And then threatened me with having to purchase an additional ticket if I stepped out! She was a total muck and left a sore spot to our visit to this awesome park, which we had visited to celebrate my wife's birthday. She was humiliating and arrogant in her approach and I never wanted to interact with her, because her behaviour made me feel that I shouldnt stoop to her pedigree."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,DSA,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,poorly maintained ,i‚Äôve been regularly visiting sunder for quite some time now with my friend. i‚Äôd give this place a 4 star rating however over time i‚Äôve seen some things that i don‚Äôt like and show signs of it not being maintained. the first and foremost is dogs !! - the premises is filled with street dogs and stray dogs who are all around the park. These dogs started barking at my friend once and we have not visited sunder ever since! these dogs are not owned by anyone and are roaming around and pooping all around! second thing is that it is not well maintained - i‚Äôve noticed atleast twice that the grass is filled with puddles due to excessive watering and it makes walking with shoes extremely difficult as you don‚Äôt want to get them wet ! especially in the winter season. third is that there are no lights what so ever- although it is a good thing that there is no light pollution in sunder it is essential to have atleast some guiding lights to the exit. as it is a huge property first time visitors find it very difficult to guide them selfs in pitch dark (for eg me) and this is true in winter season as it gets dark very early. so a person can get lost in pitch darkness after dawn  
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Jaspal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Place in heart of Delhi to win your hearts!!!,"A well maintained and developed Heritage park cum nursery to take into a peaceful world for long...a must visit place in Delhi...Kids equally enjoyed the big lawn, fountains and space to breathe freely the clean air...lots of activities to involved into and a perfect place for family picnic ..."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,rajesh u,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Another pretty park in Delhi,"A large expanse with lawns, flower beds, a small water body with a few Mughal era structures. Excellent ambiance and open spaces, optimum for the present time. Easily walkable and disable friendly. Small restaurant and eatery.  Too add color, a flea market with organic products, pottery, honey, handicrafts and other offers.The only negative is the long parking line. Either opt for public transport or come early around 11 to 12."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Rohan T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Just OK,"I would have rated this place very good a few weeks ago but am forced to revise my assessment. Having been a regular visitor, I used to really enjoy the place, but unfortunately since the Fab Cafe has opened, the vehicular traffic (on the peripheral road) has shot up tremendously. It has become difficult to walk on that road because of vehicles zipping up and down for the cafe. Not only is it adding to the pollution inside the park, it is also dangerous to walkers and pets alike. Many people have been driving fast on that narrow road without check. Honking is also endemic. The presence of vehicles is actually ruining the atmosphere. The administrators should ensure that parking of vehicles is restricted to the parking lot at the entrance."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Ratish N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nice garden,"Dear Rohan T, thank you for your comments. True that with a significant ncrease in visitor numbers from 2019, there are also greater number of vehicles. However, the peripheral road has parking for 250 cars and is busy only on weekends. There are speed breakers after every 100 m. We woukd encourage visitors to walk on the scenic pathways within the gardens rather on the road. There are several kilometres of walkways. Please remember that the peripheral road was built segregated from the garden for a purpose - also it's required for customers to the CPWD Nursery'. "

,,,,,Sundar nursery is being refashioned now to give it a modern look by Aga Khan trust. Very good for a picnic or a family outing. Very recently a restaurant is also started making it more viable. Fountains and waterbodies are adding value in it. Lawns are well maintained and monuments are well kept. Some construction is still going on. 
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Tamal KishoreAcharya,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,REVIEW OF SUNDER NURSERY IN COVID TIMES,"I am a Delhiite, born and living last 40 years , an Engineering manager by profession, visited with my family today to Sunder nursery around 4 pm today.Like my earlier visits I was carrying a DSLR and had earlier captured the landscape and birds of Sunder Nursery.This time I was along with my brother in law and to be sister in law who were getting married.  We were all dressed in normal regular dresses. My brother in law in a kurta and my to be sister in law in a skirt. I had just entered the campus and in front of the Sundar Burj on the public sandstone seat was photographing them.  I had taken two photographs when two individuals from the ticket counter came to us and informed us that WEDDING Photography was not allowed. We needed to pay up extra money to do wedding photography. We should keep our DSLR outside or handover it in reception since WEDDING Photography was not allowed. They also informed categorically that there were 4970 visitors at that time inside the park doing picnic and we visitors can only do MOBILE PHOTOGRAPHY  , move around take selfie , picture monuments but cannot do WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY. They also informed that  at that time 4 pm today, around 7 wedding photography teams were inside the park and they had paid and booked for wedding photography to Aga Khan trust.We have come so many times but we have never seen any Fees mentioned at ticket counter for photography or videography.These two  one -short height and  another stout long height person literally followed us and on their walky talky kept  instructing security. Following us - stalking me and my family till we got to only entry area around amphitheatre, we were blocked by guards, literally getting to listen "" Ask the Red dress guy to leave and stop DSLR photography"".  They followed us till the food cart and  another heritage monument ..blocked all our ways HARASSING us.I think we spent just 20-25 minutes and left the park disgusted , harassed and humiliated.I am not a professional but a hobbist . Without verifying my credentials, among 4970 people, the two so called Guardians labelled me as a WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER ????Few observations :1. No mention of DSLR photography not allowed at Sunder nursery or in website.2. No mention of WEDDING photography not allowed and no mention of DSLR charges .3. Highly surprised to see families doing picnic in large groups and no one being stopped in group. I could see 90 % people without mask. A highly prone zone for COVID Transmission. 4. No SANITISER kept at entrance of the park and GUARDIANS running behind general public like us to stop WEDDING photography.5. A potential public place for money laundering and harassment.Questions :> I would seriously ask Aga Khan Trust to introspect whether Wedding photography is a challenge or helping Delhi Government to INCREASE their COVID challenges is important. Seriously seeing no CAP on entry of people and no monitoring the way picnics without MASKs happening meant easy COVID transmission to public at large.>  Seriously no mention of any  camera fees in website of gate and extortion of money in name of wedding photographyHighly disappointed with the state of affairs of this beautiful campus.I would love to come back to the campus but will never come to be humiliated again."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Ratish N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Best kept secret,"Hi Tamal! Wedding photography is charged and contrary to yiur review, this is clearly mentioned at the ticket counter. The required fee is easily payable at the ticket counter and the money goes towards supporting the maintenance of Sunder Nursery'. 

Pity that the security guards repeated requests for yiu to make the due payment seemed humiliation to you. However, even though you are angry for due payment requested off you - it's needless to make allegations of Covid protocols not being implemented. 

Will deeply appreciate your adhering to payment norms in the future. Thank you for yiur appreciation and understanding.  "

Sunder_Nursery_Park,Tak Menon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Best time for a visit,"A must visit. These 75 acres of green lungs in the heart of city is reclaimed. Wonderfully planned. Parking is ‚Çπ75 and entry is ‚Çπ35 per adult. The only negative point what I found was the price for non-Indians a bit weird. ‚Çπ100 for non-Indians. Why discriminate? The place is maintained very well (unlike other such places)It has been listed in UNESCO and is a pleasure to visit. The peacocks, birds, bees, butterflies, flowers, lemon trees and restored monuments and tombs are worth every penny. "
Sunder_Nursery_Park,drarunkumar24,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Such an apt name for this beautiful garden,"Entry fee of Rs.35/- per adult is very affordable. We were simply spellbound. The sights were stunningly beautiful. Several gorgeous types of flowers in myriad colors were on display. Thunder and rain added to the splendour of the occasion and served to make us feel truly blessed to have been able to visit this gem of a garden! The lawns were well manicured and though paths are well laid, it appears rather a tragedy that the authorities prevent you from stepping onto them or walking on them. The rest rooms were average. The Mughal era structures added to the beauty of this wonderful garden."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Nisha Sharma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A very new bloom of beauty!,This Park at the moment is at it's best with the flower beds in Full Cry. If you happen to be in New delhi at this time do not miss it. It is in any case well worth a visit any time of the year.
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Pallav Shishodia,,,,We visited the Sundar nursery recently for on a winter weekend and had a lovely picnic. It is such a beautiful garden situated at the heart of Delhi. The lush green gardens and the gorgeous fountains and tombs in between add such an old-world charm to the garden. We spent several hours roaming through the entire garden and it was amazing. There was also a small Christmas market stall run by the Prague embassy serving their national delicacies along with an amazing fashion mela. We had a fun time in the evening exploring that.You would usually see something or the other happening at the nursery around weekends and it is such a fun place to visit with family and friends. I highly recommend it if you are looking to spend some leisurely hours amidst a lot of greenery.
,,,,,"Sunder Nursery is the latest bloom of  heritage beauty, restored with moghal grace and grandeur of bygone era.  In final stages of finish as part of Humayun Tomb Complex, there are already slew of open air public events of music, art shows and plant sale. You can experience a heritage walk, picnic and public art installations - all at one go!The Aghakhan Trust has done an excellent job to restore gardens, fountains and water bodies as also the monuments in this patch of resting place for dead eminences including rarely heard son-in-law of Akbar the great. The merry go round of Sunder Mahal and the beautifully carved structure before and around main fountains are too magnificent for words.The charges for entrance fee and parking, though not so high, ensures a crowd in numbers enough to enjoy being in public with your own space.  In current pleasant weather of less polluted Delhi, on a Sunday morning there is organic food mela with tasty wonders for your pallet and good healthy eating. In this mela and other events, some celebrity or glitterati or a known face would always be there to greet a Delhiite. So you better go well turned out whatever time you go!"

This is one of the most serene place i have visited in Delhi, lush green lawns curated flower beds and you get everything here for your gardening needs, at unbelievable prices, Sunder Nursery is a must visit place."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,gauth333,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Superb garden,Place is located in central Delhi. They have good parking facilities only thing is you have to take a short walk to the garden from the parking place. The garden is huge and nicely maintained. Entry ticket price is kinda nominal. They organize some great events here during the winters which I personally feel is a good time to visit. It's also a great place to organize a picnic. I'm not too sure of the permission formalities though but I did find a few groups when I went here.
Sunder_Nursery_Park,ghoomboom,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Well Maintained Big Park with lots of History inside,"This place is very near to Humayun's tomb. In fact, it can be said to be a part of the whole complex of areas surrounding Humayun's tomb. It is a very big area and there are many historical monuments and structures of medieval India inside the park like tombs of many medieval personalitites of 16th century Mughal India, mosque etc. It is a 16th century nursery and garden and was earlier called Azeem-E-Bagh. At present it is being maintained by Aga Khan Trust. The nursery is very well maintained with beautiful landscapes, fountains and gardens. Many times, it is the venue of many cultural programs in the open area. I recently attended one such programme by Delhi Government in which Ustaad Amzad Ali Khan performed sarod. It was such a wonderful feeling listening to his performance in the beautiful surroundings of open air of this nursery. Kind of spiritual experience.

Located in the vicinity of Humayan's Tomb and spread over 90 acres, it is home to over 200 species of trees and medicinal plants. The manicured gardens are dotted with fountains, gently flowing streams and the flower laden Lotus Pool is a stunning sight. The Trust has also restored old monuments, 6 of these feature on UNESCOs World Heritage list. Birds, butterflies, a lotus pond, an amphitheatre where art and theatre flourish, a govt nursery to purchase plants and on winter Sunday's if you're lucky a Farmer's Market where you can eat local food and buy organic produce. If you're super lucky someone will be sitting in the grass strumming their guitar and singing for the love and joy of being alive. Guides and information brochures are available, pre-book online to avoid disappointment.  A wheelchair too free of cost though it does sound a bit wheezy. It functions well. Loos/ restrooms are spotless."

You can carry in food but if you visit on Sunday Mornings, there is an Earth Collective pop up organic foods market where you will get milk, vegetables and fruits as well as a sumptuous breakfast of dosas, vadas, kebabs, fresh juices, while wheat breads and vegan foods. I also spotted barley coffee, almond milk and honey, ghee, black garlic among other goodies. Facilities are clean and hygenic. You can park within the nursery for 75 bucks. It's worth it if you plan to picnic it and stick around for a couple of hours. Pets are permitted on a leash although harmless stays around. Art installations abound although they  seem temporary. The children's park is under construction. Visit early morning for peace and quiet. Park opens at 6 but doesn't really start buzzing till 9. A Gurudwara close by and humayuns tomb opposite can help you make a day of it. "
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Karen W,,,,"On the day after Divali, a public holiday, we‚Äôd been to visit Humayun‚Äôs tomb. The Sunder Nursery is next door. It is a fair-sized botanical garden, containing some Mughal tombs (we didn‚Äôt visit them) but beautifully maintained and laid out. We were particularly impressed with the wilderness area which replicates in miniature Delhi environments. The Nursery was full of birds (we saw a hawk drinking only a few feet from us), butterflies, trees and flowers. The hubbub of Delhi is reduced to background noise. I loved it."

It's strikingly beautiful and very clean - refer the pictures. One can spend mornings and/or evenings with friends and family. If staying in or travelling to Delhi, do drop by. There is a nominal entry ticket and the place opens at sunrise and closes at sunset. The nearest metro stations should be Jangpura and Nizamuddin railway station. Paid parking is also available at a convenient distance away. Enjoy your visit to Sunder Nursery."
Sunder_Nursery_Park,Sanjiv V,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Oasis amidst chaos!,"We visited Sundar Nursery having heard of it fairly recently. Adjacent to Humayun‚Äôs Tomb, it has ample car parking within the complex for a charge of Rs 75 for 4 hours. Entrance fee for a senior citizen is Rs 15. The park area with amphitheater is well signposted and visitors can wander around the various historical monuments dotted about. They are about 400 odd years old and were built during Mughal era. The Venue covers 20 acres and the nursery is at the very end, almost a kilometre from the entrance gate. One can wander about, buy plants, manure, seeds etc but the bureaucracy is comical beyond belief! Payment is only by credit card and that too at a different location near entrance, even though plants are selected and loaded at the nursery!There is an adequate rest room with drinking water near the car park area, as well as near the nursery.Sunday morning 8.30-12.30 is occasion for a farmers market offering produce, preserves etc. We only found out when we visited so it‚Äôs for another day!All in all about a couple of hours in pleasant and green surroundings; however they could have done a much better job with more seating, more information on significant structures and ease of access to the nursery itself."

It includes multiple heritage sites likes tombs and mausoleums along, garderning workshop, amphitheatre and obviously an active nursery. It's a must visit if you are a Delhite because such a  clean and well kept natural site in the middle of the city nothing less than stunning. Hopefully they will maintain the nursery.

We spent a good hour and a half there. It was amazing. We enjoyed the landscape with the fountains,the peacocks,we even spotted a few dancing. My son ran around the site, playing in the tree house and the swings. The monuments inside have been beautifully restored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. It's a great place to visit and I would surely like to visit again. I would say it's our own Central Park of New York in the busy City of Delhi."

Sunder_Nursery_Park,Amitarya28,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,An Oasis inside concrete jungle,"So we got to spend a day at the Sunder Nursery yesterday - was intending to go for a long time but a workshop on making a sparrows nest was the perfect excuse to trek out with the kids on a Sunday morning. However this didn‚Äôt just turn out to be a workshop amongst the monuments . The workshop itself was very interesting and though it was held in the gardens , it was quite pleasant. Just sitting under the trees was bliss. However the highlight was that the kids loved the gardens themselves. They used the pathways and signages to explore the monuments and identify the wide variety of birds. Most excited when they saw a dancing peacock. They absolutely loved the tree swings and ropes that they could play on. The organic market, which was being held at the same time, provided another activity and some much needed ‚Äòhealthy food‚Äô.A must visit, especially with children,  if you want to experience a heritage space come alive."

Sunder_Nursery_Park,A R Kohli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A Cultural time travel in a Natural habitat,"""What a welcome relief""-- these words come to  my mind when I visited the magnificent urban park with my extended family. By far, the best park in Delhi in terms of design, facilities, plantation,arboretum, interpretation and intelligent circulation inside the gardens  17th century tombs embellished with exquisite stucco ornamentation are spread across the gardens along with presence of two water bodies. The variety of birds and butterflies that one comes across is mind boggling. Designers have sensitively inculcated transition spaces for the visitors to sit, relax and enjoy the vistas and surrounding natural beauty from strategic vantage points. It's surreal to think that something like this would come up inside a dreary concrete jungle like Delhi. On Sundays, a haat/bazaar is organized where local farmers and self-help groups sell exclusive organic produce. Couple of  swings and a tree house has been strategically designed to cater to the children. The entrance ticket costs just 35 rupees and is insignificant compared to the fact that one can spend an entire morning with their families coupled with access to clean toilets free of charge. A couple of restaurants are upcoming up inside the complex too. It's a terrific place for the denizens of Delhi to relax and release their stress."

The gardens were absolutely stunning & the restoration work they have accomplished is astonishing. We visited at 9:30am & were pretty much the only visitors in the gardens, it was lovely. Their Canna gardens, Lotus pond & Bonsai house, the 6 monuments & the various water features have all been linked together flawlessly. If I lived in Delhi or was go visit again I would definitely go to Sunder Nursey again. Best 100Rs we spent on that trip!"

,,,,,"I had visited this botanical park about two weeks ago. It lies right next to the Humayun's tomb in South Delhi. It's very easily accessible by Metro, cab & rickshaw too.It was a very hot summer afternoon in Delhi & I wanted to walk around the heritage monuments of Old Delhi. But since it was a blistering 40 degrees, I decided to walk inside the beautiful Sunder nursery. On my previous visit to this park about 4 years ago, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture & the restoration team headed by conservation architect Ratish Nanda had just started the work & hence this site was out of bounds. But on this visit the park was up & running. The old Mughal era monuments which formed a part of the Mughal era graveyards have been beautifully been restored & connecting them are walkways, fountains, etc. A whole lot of planning has ensured that everything is a delight to view. Such is the level of detailing that even the toilets at a far corner have been aesthetically been designed to blend in with the surroundings. But the highlight of this botanical park are its trees, plants & birds. The manicure lawns have varieties of flowers which attract insects like butterflies & the bees. These in turn attract the birds like pigeons, hawks, peacocks, etc. It's a delight to view the birds & the bees at such close proximity. Go here if you want to enjoy the sunset, beat the heat, love to explore the heritage, gaze at the birds & take in some really fresh air."
