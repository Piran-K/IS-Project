Swaminarayan_Akshardham,JCP,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Ornate carvings!,"The carvings are ornate and beautiful! Enjoyed the visit! No cameras/cellphones allowed. Looks expensive, free entry."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Michael F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Beautiful Temple,Amazing temple with unforgettable sights. The temple complex is quite large but well worth  a visit. Make sure to walk around the elephant plinth.
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,zczigler,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Extreme entry prohibitions for maximized rip-off,"Having to remove your shoes (and sometimes even your socks) before entering some filthy facility is a staple in India. This place puts another extreme spin on the insanity, so do check the visitor information section of the website before you visit, as it will save you a lot of frustration. We visited spontaneously, got ripped off by the riksha hawkers operating between the metro station and the compound (my mother suffers from COPD, so walking was not an option), and eventually decided not to enter once we learned about the different prohibitions, dress code, etc. This was my most frustrating experience in India. They prohibit mobile phones, so you can't take a photo, but of course they have their own photographers who will take your photo and then sell you the print (not the jpeg file, the print, in 2023). If you ever wondered, you are of course welcome to take your money with you, as there are ample opportunities within the complex to spend it. Even the boys from the Vatican could come and take courses from these guys on the true essence of all religions: how to maximize revenue from the gullible masses."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Rav.Marinda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Akshardham Was PEacuful.,"I had visited Akshardham & It wil very nice experience. Rav.MarindaGood driver, excellent guide.

Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Rohit M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Family break,"How much you would like it depends on spirituality level. There are 4 different zones, first 2 are completely spiritual and can be left out in case not your interest area. Other 2 areas for boat ride and water show is something all would enjoy."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Monika S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,"Mesmerizing, spiritual, thoughtful, and fun - all in one!","I visited the temple along with my parents, not realizing beforehand the magnanimity of the temple space and time it would take to experience everything in offering. Every step in the temple that we took passed through a really well-organized process, beginning from parking to security check to entry and then the tours. We began by paying our tributes at the temple, that besides being a spiritual abode was just out of the world in its carvings and beautifully laid out statues. We then proceeded to the tours that worked like a perfect assembly line, moving people from one room to the other, taking you through the stories, learnings, and history of both Swaminarayan and India. The boat ride was just exceptional not to say that the robotic show and the movie were any less. And the final piece - the light and sound show - was a marvelous combination of arts and technology, coordinated and choreographed superbly.A day outing cannot go without the mention of food facilities. The food court is decent, with availability of strictly vegetarian food and beverages. There is a big courtyard space made available to enjoy food along with nice view of the temple. At all places in the temple space, there are carts selling tea/coffee and snacks. The price of the food is not all expensive.Make sure to leave your bags, mobile phones, cameras, and any electronic items outside in your vehicle or deposit them in the cloak room. The toilet facilities are not as clean but manageable. Wear comfortable shows for all the walking you need to do (you remove them only while stepping into the temple). Try to take a center seat for the light and sound show (right in front of the Swaminarayan statue) at least 45 minutes before the show start time.Overall, every moment that we spent at the temple was enriching spiritually and the huge space filled with lush greenery, beautiful architecture, very well organized activities, and polite and supportive staff made it an exceptional day."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Alison M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Truly Nothing Like It,"This is an absolute must-see if you're in Delhi.

Exhibition is mostly about the cult.Separate fee for multimedia water show.The main attraction is the boat ride showing glimpses of India.Food is reasonably priced, light, medium quantity, and at less number of counters compared to the rush.Nearest Metro station is at walking distance."

Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Bill B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Amazing,"The architecture of Akshardham Temple, dedicated to 10,000 years of Hindu culture extraordinary.  The carving work both inside the temple and all throughout the grounds is absolutely amazing.  "
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,ian m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,A very strange place.,"This is a huge and very modern complex with a security system stricter than most airports. You start with a full bonnet and boot car search followed by full metal detection and a pat-down.No cameras or phones are allowed (no idea why but there it is).Once inside there is a very efficient shoe storage area before you can proceed to the temple - loads of carved stone and golden statues - it must have cost billions in whatever currency you want to use.Then on to something somewhere between an education centre and a theme park. First a series of rooms with audio-visual displays where automatons nod and bow in time with the words. Then it really gets strange when you're ushered onto a huge plastic boat that Disney would be proud of to make a circuit of an underground display that explains the distant past and how, among other things, India invented space travel thousands of years ago. All beautifully laid out and lit but I still left thinking ""what on earth was that all about"".To people of this particular religion visiting this place is a deep and meaningful experience and I wish them well - we met some great people while we were there - but somehow I left feeling more confused than when I started."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Sarvan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Temple???,"It doesn't feel like being inside a temple, for me it's like visiting a tourist place for leisure. The water show was excellent and worth every money spent. No electronics or food items were allowed inside so we cant click any photos. But if you pay you can eat inside the food court and take photos."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,MrBLosAngeles,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Structure is impressive but more commercial than cultural in nature.,Exceptional structure. Worthwhile. But if looking for historic or cultural...  this may not be worth the time and cost... compared to visiting an active temple.
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Travellertohelp,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Beautiful monument,"Akshardham temple is best the example of the modern engineering. We went in the evening for light and sound show which was amazing.Only downside is that you can't bring phones inside. So, we can't capture the memories."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,SOUMITRA SANKAR DAS,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,It is a commercial temple,"At Akshardham Temple the lady security are very rude.They did not know how to speak with a senior citizen .If any person bring his personal and own necessities/accesories, they will  tell them chorni and tell other people that ""dekh chorni ai hai dusro ka mobile churake"".They also use this type of language at teens,adults and senior citizen also.If a person had submited their mobiles, bags etc. they will tell them ""itna jaldi rakh bhi ai"".This temple is very commercialized.At every idol of a god,complaining  area, restaurant, cloak room and boot house they will keep a donation box and tell us to donate money.Please do not visit this temple ."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Colsloan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Great experienxe,"We visited the temple and it was an amazing experience.

Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Amanjot Thind,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Indian Disney World,"It is clean, calm & modern. Best temple to visit in New Delhi. It’s very Modern. Must visit this temple forget about any other historical place in Delhi. Any other place is dirty, filthy & packed. It is Indian version of Disney World. Inside very modern and kids enjoy Disney World spiritual feeling. just can’t take picture which I actually like so entire family can focus on temple."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,The_Traveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Absolutely stunning,"Magnificent place! very beautiful, shame that it doesn't have much history as it's one of the ""new temples"" but definitely worth to visit. Photo/video strictly forbidden."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Shagun M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Spritual Marvel...@New Delhi ,"Visited this temple may times before, but this it was special as i visited there with my family this time. I choose weekday rather weekends to avoid crowds. As looks in pictures it is an architectural marvel of today's era. Apart from spritual point, it is one of the must visit destination in New Delhi specially for the tourists. This time I also explore their documentry and their organisation's history, (which is paid.. u have to buy tickets for the same).I would recommend, specially to first timers to please explore the above paid documentry/ history of the Akshardham organization, it took around 2:30 hrs for the same. Also checkout the musical fountain in the evening if u have time.Must explore the tempting food at their cafeteria/restaurant which is pure vegetarian or i would say SATTVIK...Lovely time spent there, enjoyed there whole day with family after long time... Feeling great...Thanks Akshardham..."

Swaminarayan_Akshardham,varunkamra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Family,Out of this world experience ,This is not a temple it's an institute of knowledge and trust........When you visit this place you can not imagine what art you are going to see......after visiting this place even Taj Mahal can be replaced by the art and beauty of this place....it's so well planned and organised that you just feel like revisiting this place again and again.

Swaminarayan_Akshardham,ashish g,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Friends,Should be one of the wonders,The place is spread in vast area which is well connected by public transport and also by metro on blue line. Cameras mobiles purses not allowed inside the main compound. Enter the compound and u will feel the u are in a different world . Beautiful structural architecture and the beautiful handcrafted stone work. Everything is very beautiful. Water dance is must to see I promise u would have never seen such a beautiful water play. And boating 
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,simon R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Fantastic architecture and a great water show,Although this is definitely a place to visit you cannot take mobile phones into the grounds. This does mean if you go in a group you should stick together or have a defined meeting place. The queue for security checks can be long but once you are there it is great.The temple itself is an amazing piece or architecture with beautiful carvings.The water show is also worth seeing but there will be lots of queuing before and after.
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Travellerscht001,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,lovely temple,temple was excellent. Guide was able to explain all the details. Complex was so clean. Go early to avoid crowd. 
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,vales m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,nice l,Nice place to visit. If there is a possibility go in your own car so that you can save time. We need a lot of time to give and take back our belongings in the counter because we are not allowed to take any of our belongings to inside of the temple. Keep your things in the car and lock it and visit the site and come back.
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,londoncallin2080,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Family,Wonderful and inspiring ,"Well worth the visit.   Temple has some construction going on but the main part of the temple is completed.   Plan to spend 2-3 hrs for your visit as they have an audio show and boat tour to take you back in time and learn some of the history.   There is a water show in the evening so you should plan accordingly.  As a tip, don’t take anything other than money as they don’t let you take anything into the temple- no phones cameras purses etc.  they do have A cloakroom if you need to check your belongings in.  Enjoy!"
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,M_uk989,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Solo,Wow..What a place !,Wow what a place. I go there many times and always the same experience. Neat and clean. Architecture is fabulous. Staff and guards all are very cooperative they all are guiding you if you are having any problem. The food court is also there there so much food there eat according to your appetite. Parking is also there and nearby metro is also there overall nice place.Note : if your staying at main bazar then there is direct metro from Rk Ashram Marg to The point ( blue line ) !
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Sophie M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Solo,Meh,"This temple feels very much like visiting Disneyland. There is no religious feel nor any authenticity. It is a modern temple and frankly, a cash grab. The architecture is impressive, but there are far more interesting and authentic temples to visit in Delhi. Skip this. However, the place is very clean and organised and easily accessible by metro. "
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Erin Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,First Time at Temple,Beautiful view with stunning craftsmanship. Photos and electronics are not allowed on property to preserve the sanctity of the site. My tour guide Hershit provided excellent overviews of the different parts of the temple. Would love to see the evening light show next time.
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,simonemiami,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Beautiful building,I never made it inside due to the cattle like entry blocks. Security went through my entire bag in detail touching every single item just to let e know at the end that my clothing was not appropriate. I also would not leave my phone among 1000 other in some shed. No phones allowed. it is best to take a picture from the street and move on. a very unpleasant experience which is a shame as it looks like a beautiful building.

Swaminarayan_Akshardham,krish_ekm,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,THE WORST SECURITY PERSONNEL,"THE WORST SECURITY PERSONNEL I HAVE EVER COME ACROSSWe had a recent visit to this temple and the experiences are shared below1`.Location    It is easily accessible by road, uber and by metro and is very convenient.2.Entry: Relatively easy but poorly managed .Even in a normal where there is no queue at all, one has to walk all through the removable barricades for long distance which particularly makes it very difficult for elders.3.Security: The worst part of the whole process.They are behaving as if the all the visitors are anti national.Even hearing aids for the physically disabled are not allowed.They understand Hindi language only and nothing else !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Really pity for a structure which is visited by non hindi speaking people especially foreign nationals at large.Definitely the security personnel require intense training on how to behave decently to the visitors.4.Main temple.: Really feels to be an architectural piece rather than a temple.Well crafted interiors in marble is classic and the roof ceilings in particular.But they could well have avoided the bright colored pictures inside the temple but substituted with black and white portraits.5.The structures surrounding the main temple on all the four sides are well designed and made.Really marvelous to watch.But definitely the proportion is not that great in comparison to the main temple.A bit more height for the side structures would have enhanced the beauty.6.Cleanliness: Very clean and really deserve a word of appreciation.7.Strange part: Really do not understand why this much of restrictions for visitors etc are laid down.Phone or camera is not allowed.After insisting a reasonable entry fee,had the visitors been permitted to take pics etc, this would have attracted millions and millions in an year for sure, to SAY THE LEAST"

Spread across a wide area. The temple is very artistically crafted and chiselled . Entry fees is free, however there are some shows and activities going on in the temple which costs you some money but it is well worth the entire penny you spend.

Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Madhur,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Friends,Ticket and show time info,"Excellent experience... Combo Ticket price Rs.340 in the year 2022 for (Robotic show+Short movie+Boating+light show).Total program of 2-3 hours. Try to reach the temple by 4pm so you can enjoy everything without any haste and have good food in the canteen. Light show only starts after sunset, so cover everything else before that."
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,AirborneSpoon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Solo,Cleanest Site in New Delhi,"This was the best tourist site that I've been to in New Delhi! The Temple grounds were immaculately kept, no trash anywhere and the grass and shrubbery was perfect. The food court had plenty of options with plenty of clean places to sit. There was actually a proper gift shop where I didn't feel as if I was being ripped off. The Temple is modern being built in 2005 or so but none the less beautiful and breathtaking. Before I go on I must say that due to the no phone no camera policy the most beautiful place in Delhi couldn't be photographed! For only 250 rupees you get to see two videos on big screen on the history of India. I decided not to see the movies but I did go on the "" It's a Small World"" Disney type ride that takes you through Indian history on a small boat.   This Temple is in my Top 3 things to do in New Delhi and I would recommend it to everyone. Again, it's very clean (I saw more trash cans on the Temple grounds than I've seen in all of Delhi combined), every exhibit is labelled in Hindi and English, very good food court and gift shop.  Don't miss this!"

Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Moniesha V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Sparkle for your eyes,"I am not really a spiritual person yet I decided to visit this place. There is a lot of rush so, that throws all the spirituality out of the window. However, the main temple has really beautiful carvings. I would suggest you go at mid afternoon - 3-4 PM IST and even an hour earlier if you want to go for the exhibition which costs around 350-400 INR more. I skipped that one and jumped directly at the temple; the entire temple - walls, ceilings, pillars are beautifully carved and the led lights just add that sparkle to that beauty. Then you can visit the water show area and buy the tickets for that show too. The story in the show is okayish but, the fountain, laser (lights) are more fascinating. "

Swaminarayan_Akshardham,JourneyOf1000Ms,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Couples,Swaminarawan Akshardham visit in Delhi,This is one of the new magnificent places built by humans in new era and its a must visit besides other beautiful buildings in New Delhi.While this is the biggest Hindu’s temple in the world and mostly visited by pilgrims the only negative point was not allowing the visitors to take any photos inside or outside of the Mandir! I am pretty sure if photography were allowed this temple would be the most attractive place to be visited in Delhi.
Swaminarayan_Akshardham,Vaidehi15,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Mesmerizing Place to worship & relax,"This place cant be missed if you visiting New Delhi.Its easily accessible by Metro or local transport. Please note you arent allowed to carry any bags, mobile, electronics inside, thus avoid carrying much valubles. There is safe place to deposit too, so if carried no worries.It atleast needs 3-4hrs to see the complete place. Definitely see all the shows. Especially if you are travelling with kids. Dont miss the Water show which has 2 slots : 6.30 & 7.30pm.Overall a must visit place. The carvings & lighting at the temple will mesmerize you completely."
