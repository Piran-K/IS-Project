Tastesutra,Jonathan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,"If you’re in India, take a cooking class for a couple of hours! You won’t regret it! Ultimate fun and delicious as well!","It was an amazing experience. I was a solo traveler and I was a bit apprehensive to do a cooking class by myself so I bit the bullet and did this class. It was amazing and then some! Teacher was very kind, informative and the food was delicious. The teacher was so welcoming and she broke down the recipe into steps and did a good job of explaining “why” we use this or that. All of the food was delicious!"

Dishes are simple to make but complex in taste and totally delicious. Often on cooking classes like this you leave full of enthusiasm but unsure of how to recreate the menu in your own home but not with Tastesutra. I will definitely be whipping up the dishes we made. It was a great way to meet other people as well. Well worth joining up."
Tastesutra,Vishal Telang,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Brilliant!,"Right from entering this beautiful space to everything that we did with Cooking and food. Loved every bit of it. The worst part was leaving the place. I didn't want to leave because Anchal and Tastesutra made it like home for me. I am going there everytime I am in Delhi. If you want to fall in love with food then Anchal's Tastesutra it is. I left the place emotional, fulfilled and wanting for more."

Tastesutra,448ashc,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Best first day in Delhi!,Loved every second! We were taught how to make many dishes in a very relaxed and fun environment. I feel confident making these dishes again myself as everything was made so simple for us. It was also great to do this on our first day and to learn about what is in all the different dishes so we knew what to order as we travelled. Thank you so much for an amazing introduction to India and Indian cuisine!
Tastesutra,David J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,A great experience.,This proved to be a lovely day talking about Indian food and cooking three dishes plus making chi and Indian breads. We learnt the basics about using Indian spices and the various techniques to create authentic Indian dishes. After lunch we visited the local market to buy spices and vegetables. We would recommend this course as a very full introduction to creating Indian food.

Tastesutra,Jacquelyn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Favorite thing we did in India!!  Don't miss it!!,"We did the 5 course cooking class and meal, followed by a walk through the local market.  After spending about a month and a half exploring all over India, I can honestly say our Tastesutra cooking class with Anchal was one of my absolute favorite experiences!!  Do not miss it!  Anchal makes this class both super fun and accessible to all levels!  Her ""this is how I would make this for my family"" cooking style makes the recipes easily replicable so you truly can make them at home!  This class comes with a wealth of knowledge about spices, their profiles, cooking traditional Indian meals, recipes to go home with, candid photos, a full belly, and more.  Not only that, but she has mastered and beautified the art of sustainability in her business.  Her heart is fully felt when you are in her studio:) A truly wonderful experience!"
Tastesutra,Brino84,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Phenomenal woman owned business -- exceptional experience,"Anchal was incredible. A kind, strong businesswoman who is doing everything right. She cares about the environment and uses sustainable, reusable or compostable items. She teaches you how to cook things healthier than restaurant style -- like they do it at home. I can't recommend this experience enough. Beautiful venue, great location (near an amazing market and the metro train), great employees. But Anchal is the star. Don't overthink it, just book."
Tastesutra,Jacie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Like cooking with a friend,"My fiancé and I enjoyed our cooking class with Anchal so much. She was warm, friendly and engaging - it really felt like we were in the kitchen of a friend or family member who was teaching us to make something new.We cook often, and really appreciated how quickly Anchal was able to pinpoint to our expertise level and adjust her instruction specifically to us, teaching us things we did not know and providing many useful tips to better understand the flavors of Indian cuisine and how to apply that understanding to our future endeavors. The food was amazing, too!We both highly recommend any experience with Anchal!"
Tastesutra,Danny C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Unmissable food experience,"Such a great learning experience to cook with Anchal at Tastesutra.

Tastesutra,chriskennedy310,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Excellent cultural experience,"My wife and her friend joined a cooking class on short notice (about an hour before it started). Easy Metro ride to the location (on both Purple and Pink Lines. We first made  chai using some ""sweet"" spices--ginger, green cardamon pods, cloves, cinnamon, then created 3 dishes for lunch--butter paneer, curried chicken/veggies, ""bachelor"" potatoes and rotis.  Every person in the class participated in making one of the dishes and everyone's feedback was sought when adjusting the spices during the cooking process. Anchal was very open about sharing her experiences with individualizing  every day dishes by varying the amouts of different spice combinations.  The local market walk after the meal was also enjoyable because we had some experience with using the spices that were for sale.  A terrific way to spend a day in Delhi."
Tastesutra,robyn l,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,"Wonderful morning, the ultimate souvenir","Book this cooking class.   Not only was the food delicious for home cooked food, this was better than some of the (very) fancy restaurants I've eaten at in Delhi.   On top of that Anchal is doing wonderful things for her community, and has a real passion for food.  I couldn't say enough good things about the delicious food, her amazing warmth, generosity, the experience as a whole and how flexible she was in terms of my tastes, skill level, flavour preferences and experience.   I would and will be recommending this to anyone I know who could attend.   Not only that but she showed me two new ways to improve my parathas."

Tastesutra,SAB5859,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,What a fantastic Indian cookery course 😀 ,I booked the cookery course directly through Tastesutra via email which all worked fine.  I took a taxi there and back from my hotel but there is a Metro line a short walk away from Tastesutra.There were 3 of us in the class which worked out really well with us all contributing to making all of the dishes.The venue is fantastic and really well set out for cooking and eating what you've cooked after the meal.Our teacher was just fantastic and had a really easy going personality which is great for teaching and answering numerous questions.I really enjoyed cooking the different Indian dishes and enjoyed eating the dishes we cooked too.  We were also shown how the Indian people eat using their hands.We were all sent the recipes we used plus more by email.I'm really glad that I did this course as I picked up some amazing tips.I would definitely recommend this course for anyone who likes cooking Indian food.
Tastesutra,Mary15,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Excellent cooking session,"We went as a group of 4 and thoroughly enjoyed our lesson (and eating what we'd made!). Anchal and her friend were warm and welcoming and encouraged us at every step of the way. I was the only vegetarian in the group and Anchal adapted her planned chicken recipe so that I could make a vegetarian version and not be left out. We were sent copies of the recipes (and some extra ones) after the class, together with photos."
Tastesutra,Cam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Absolutely brilliant cooking class!,We absolutely loved our cooking class with Anchal.

Tastesutra,Anna,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Great cooking class,Amazing experience! Everybody was super nice.

Tastesutra,karen w,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,A fantastic cooking experience,Absolutely fantastic experience - cannot recommend it highly enough - a must do for when you are in Delhi - friends recommended it to us snd we are very pleased they did.
Tastesutra,sduff27,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Fantastic,"What a fun and engaging experience! Once you have the metro figured out it’s very easy to get there, and was a lovely way to spend my first afternoon in India. I’ve regularly been seeing the same dishes I learned to cook at restaurants, and learned a lot about what is made (and how it’s made) in regular Indian households. I’m confident I’ll be able to repeat these recipes at home! Highly recommend!"
Tastesutra,Yvonne Laborda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,GREAT FAMILY EXPERIENCE,We had a fantastic experience. Our 3 teens enjoyed so much. We all had a great time and learned a lot. Thank you so much.
Tastesutra,Charlotte E,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Dive into Indian culture ,"We had the best time doing a cooking class with Anchal. She’s very knowledgeable about spices, their health benefits and gives brilliant tips for future excursions into Indian cooking. The food was delicious - if I may say so myself ;) the second I came back home I tried several of the recipes we made. The trip to the market rounded our day off as we were able to get all the spices we needed to recreate the dishes. It also gave a great insight into a local market and day to day life. Great, educational fun that I can highly recommend! "
Tastesutra,Natalia F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Solo,Unforgettable experience,"I was always skeptical towards cooking classes as I saw them as tourist traps, but this experience certainly went beyond any of my expectations. I was taught more than I thought would be possible, not only with meal cooking but also the importance of spices and with that really just how unique and flexible Indian cuisine is. Anchal also tried to make the dishes a little healthier and really guides you through the process of cooking rather than bluntly giving directions, all while encouraging you to cook yourself.  I will always cherish the lesson from one of the best teachers out there."
Tastesutra,larslambertsen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,More than a cooking class; we met a Saint!,Amazing! This was one of our highlights during our month in India. Anchal was so warm and welcoming. She is a passionate cook and a gifted teacher. The location doesn’t look like much from the street; but inside was very hygienic and quite lovely. We had our 4 kids (ages 9-16) and they absolutely loved the hands on experience. Anchal even invited our family to return later to help her on a Saturday morning make 300 meals for street children which she voluntarily donates to a non-profit. We got so much more than just a cooking class; we got a friend for life. She’s truly a modern day saint. We are already planning our next trip to India with friends so they too can have this experience.
Tastesutra,Tushar Dabral,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Best cooking studio,"I had a cooking class with Tastesutra and it was full of knowledge and fun. Mrs Anchal made sure to use the freshest ingredients from the town. Everything was so clean, organized, and very professional. After the five course meal class I had a local market tour guided by Mrs Anchal herself and it was a wonderful experience. So it is a must to visit Tastesutra if you are travelling to Delhi as this place vibes is totally different from any other cooking studio. And it’s the best cooking studio in Delhi so go for it and come back with beautiful memories!"

We picked up lots of skills that we can take home such as making fresh chapati and tasty curry pastes. It was great getting all the recipes via email so we can keep cooking!
Tastesutra,Christian,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Wonderful and delicious,Our family loved this experience!  The food turned out delicious and with Anchal's guidance it was easier than expected to prepare. We highly recommend this experience!
Tastesutra,Paulina G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Amazing cooking class,"The cooking class was the last experience on our agenda during our trip in India and boy are we happy we have done it. We learned very easy and quick meals, discovered what taste spices give and learned to do naan bread and chapati. The best that any profit of the experience goes to meals for people in need. Simply the right thing to do in all aspects. We highly recommend-we have already ourselves prepared the same meals several times at home."

Tastesutra,maylesa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,Delicious & fun!,"Anchal was wonderful at every stage - planning the event, menu selection, prep & planning and finally cooking together via zoom. When 2 of us got Covid, she kindly rescheduled and expressed lots of care. During the event we learned about her, her culture and more about Indian cooking than I’d imagined. We were two adult couples in 2 different locations. Anchal managed us all with patience, through different ingredients and differing cooking speeds. She was kind and lovely. I’d definitely cook with her again and highly recommend the experience."
Tastesutra,Patrick C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,authentic Indian cooking simplified!,"This was a delightful experience. Anchal is very friendly and patient, and her instructions were very clear.

Tastesutra,Expedition704507,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 • Solo,Fabulous virtual cooking class!,"This cooking class was fabulous - wish I could give it more than five stars!  Anchal was really responsive to a few questions I had ahead of time, so I thought she would be great, but she exceeded all expectations.  My husband and I did the class with two other friends in different cities.  Anchal was so personable and it felt like she was live in front of us.  She shared so many great tips that we will use for all our cooking.  We made butter chicken, cumin potatoes and garlic naan and it was all easy and delicious!  Already planning on making these for our family soon and looking to sign up for more of Anchal’s classes in the future.  "
Tastesutra,Mindy R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,Great cooking experience,"This was a fantastic class and I cannot imagine how amazing it would be to take a class with Anchal in person.

Tastesutra,Jessicalauren012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,Great class!,"Really fun class! Food was delicious and very easy to make with great guidance.

As the only vegetarian in the class, she made sure I knew what notes and adjustments to make as we were cooking. Loved it."
Tastesutra,Chris05842,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Great & Fun Indian cooking class for the family,"Anchal was great. She helped customize the class to address both vegetarian and non-vegetarian participants in our family. She was patient with us when we weren't always moving along as fast as we should have been. And she was great at explaining how dishes could be modified to different tastes, as well as how food was part of her family life and culture. Highly recommend to others!"
Tastesutra,Craig B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Indian Food virtual class,"This class was a present from my daughter.  We had so much fun together and Anchal made is go easy.  Even when things started to get busy with all the different ingredients.    This is our second virtual food class and we will continue to use this fun and instructive tool.    My only suggestion is to have a few more of the ingredients chopped up and prepared prior to class.  Anchal will give you a few things to do prior but I would add about 2 to 3 things ready to go.  ie garlic, onions, ginger,   Not mandatory but would give you more time to socially drink and talk during the process and not rush chopping.   Even though that's part of the fun also."
Tastesutra,Lennart R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Recommendable indian cooking class!,Great cooking class and really nice and patient instructor! We learned a lot about the principles about the indian cuisine and the meal was just delicous! Definitely not the last time that we took a cooking class with tastesutra! Thanks again to Anchal!

Tastesutra,Allegrainbernal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Delicious and fun cooking class,"My team and I took Anchal's class during our (virtual) company off-site, and we all loved it! Anchal was warm and welcoming, and expertly guided us through creating three different recipes. She explained the logic behind the process, and also how to modify each recipe based on our preferences. Each dish we made was delicious! Several of us in the class had tried to cook Indian food before and hadn't felt it turned out well or with the right depth of flavor, but with Anchal, we all prepared food that was incredibly tasty and actually felt manageable to cook again on our own. Thanks for an amazing class, Anchal!"
Tastesutra,Andy B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Family,Umm..delicious and easy!  Great class!,"My food preference is ANYTHING ethnic and Indian food is a very favorite.  Living in the Deep South, true ethnic foods are almost impossible to find in restaurants.  Honestly, that’s probably true in most places in the US…ethnic foods tend to get “Americanized”.  I’ve struggled to get the spice blends right when making Indian food.  Anchal is a warm, welcoming woman who loves sharing her food and culture. Communication was easy before the class…questions were answered quickly.  The curry was delicious and so easy to make (be sure you have a blender to get the texture right) and it was cool to learn how to make naan.  I had no idea it was so easy!  Sign up for this class.  You won’t be disappointed!"

Thanks to Anchal and Tastesutra for helping me get over my reluctance and inhibition of making an elaborated Indian snack.Not only did Anchal taught me the easy and quick way making Indian snacks but also made me fall in love with the process of cooking it. Her tips, tricks and the way she addresses your queries with patience and smile is the reason why I will go back to Tastesutra again.PS - Samosas are now a hit in my family and is our go to tea time snack."

We are not usually adventurous in the kitchen, but Anchal made the meal feel approachable and fun. We loved getting to cook with some new spices and learn a bit about Anchal's family and culture. As less experienced chefs, it felt like a very full hour and half on our feet, but the amazing meal made it so worth it!"

We booked from the UK whilst Anchal was in New Delhi (and it was 22:30 there!) Anchal couldn’t have been more patient, kind and lovely to teach us and our friends how to cook butter chicken, cumin potatoes and garlic naan and we would love to book a lesson again to learn more! Highly recommend :)"

Tastesutra,Anchal B,,,,"Fun experience during lockdown, learnt more despite having cooked Indian dishes for 35 years, used sumac powder instead of mango powder, as it was to give a sour taste to the dish."

,,,,,"Wonderful way to learn from your own home with a brilliant tutor. Nothing is too much trouble, if you aren't able to get a certain ingredient (spice etc.) Anchal will suggest a more commonly kept alternative.She explains everything and will go over it aging if you're in any doubt without any fluster or impatience. This is the third time we've attended a course (once at Tastesutra kitchen now 2 on line) They're fun to do and (obviously) so authentic. We use the recipes regularly using the skills we've learnt."
,,,,,Thank you so much for the wonderful review. It is always a pleasure cooking with you and we are hoping to meet again in person to cook and talk about Indian food and culture.

Tastesutra,Olivia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Great learning experience,"My friend who has visited India and attended the cooking classes here really enjoyed it, so when she invited me to a beginners virtual class that was put on for free for International Woman's Day I jumped at the chance.Very well organised, we were sent the ingredients in advance for a Chicken Korma and we were welcomed by Anchal on a Zoom call. Very personal experience, made it very easy to follow the instructions and gave lots of good suggestions, hints and tips. Then sent the recipe after the class so we can make it again.Really enjoyed the experience, felt very authentic and curry was delicious! We definitely plan on booking another one! Thank you."

Tastesutra,Anchal B,,,,"Anchal is awesome. When I was in India last year I cooked with her at her house, which was so much fun and an amazing peak into authentic Indian life and culture. With the pandemic, it’s been impossible to travel, so learning about Indian culture and food online is still pleasing my travel bug, and allowed me to bring my parents and sister along for the ride so they have an experience that and a glimpse into the places I’ve travelled. It also allowed me to try something new for lunches this week! Would highly recommend a virtual or in person class with Tastesutra. A great experience."

,,,,,"We've already done a couple of the virtual classes and they're so much fun! The food always comes out so good, it's great learning new indian recipes. This time we gifted a class to a friend and 4 of us did it virtually as we all live in different cities, so it was a great idea to do something together while being apart.Definitely recommend to virtual classes! To do with your partner or a family member at home or with friends who live far from you!"

,,,,,"Anchal a synonym to delicious, tempting & mouth watering dishes. She is flawless with wide understanding of regional cum international dishes. Moreover she could explain the significance & impact of even a pinch of spice, make you feel the aroma while cooking & dressing.I opted the course to suprise my parents on their aniversary and reached out to Anchal for help. She heard me calmly, asked for likes & dislikes. She taught me how to exactly cut, mix & grind species till certain degree basis on dish.I never believed myself that I could ever cook but this god gifted blessed lady made me cook like a professional and cuisines tasted like exact which I always expect while eating out.She is an encyclopedia of cooking even knows the dishes which were elapsed since ages by explaining the history, background & rare ingredients. I would recommend her to all I know across the globe and strong advise to all who want learn and try new cuisines. If pro you could polish the cooking skills by consulting her. Someday I would like to narrate and pen down her experience in a form of book.From brunch to supper snacks or from lavish  and fancy lunch and dinner or bar - be - queue parties dishes. She knows all tips and tricks.Hats off  keep on making world to eat amazing finger licious cuisines.Best regards....Tarunjit Singh"
