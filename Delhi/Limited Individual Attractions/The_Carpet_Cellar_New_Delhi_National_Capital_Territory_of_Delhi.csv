They have the most extensive collection of carpets I’ve ever seen and the quality is fantastic.  It is a family run business.  I received exceptional service from Dhruv and Mudita. I’ve been to Delhi a few times and seen a lot of carpets.  Nowhere has compared in quality or personal service. This is the place to go.

The_Carpet_Cellar,Manisha A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Business,Best selection and service for carpets in Delhi,"We have bought high quality carpets in Mumbai and Delhi from different vendors on many occasions.  None of them can compare with the selection that Carpet Cellar has.  My husband and I visited multiple stores to find a variety of carpets for our home and found Carpet Cellar’s collection to be the most comprehensive. We had the pleasure of dealing with one of the owners, Mudita. She was incredibly professional, resourceful and responsive in all dealings. You don’t have to worry that you’ll be taken advantage of or that she’ll play games with you. We needed the carpets shipped to us in California and the shipment reached us in great condition and well within the promised timeframe. I would unhesitatingly recommend Carpet Cellars and Mudita. One quick tip - their store is located in a residential area, towards the back of a home right on the main road. It can be a little tricky to find - but so very well worth the tiny extra effort."

The_Carpet_Cellar,deepika,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Business,The Carpet Cellar,"We have been buying carpets from the Carpet Cellar for the last decade. We recently moved to our new home and needed a large carpet and went to carpet cellar to look at their collection. Mudita, the owner, showed us a wide variety of carpets both traditional & contemporary. Their collection is unmatched. She helped us select a carpet keeping in mind our furniture and living room layout. We soon found a carpet which would go perfectly in our living room. The international shipping by carpet cellar was seamless and we received our carpet in less than 10 days. If you are in the market to buy a carpet, look no further, the Carpet Cellar is a one stop shop for both traditional or contemporary carpets."

The_Carpet_Cellar,Neha G.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Couples,Wonderful experience and carpet!,"We visited several carpet stores before chancing upon the carpet cellar in Sultanpur. One of the owners was at the store and showed us a huge collection in our size preference! Other stores we had visited had very few option in 9x6 size that we wanted. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find what I wanted (a tribal style rug) at that location. So, they suggested we visit their other location at Anand Lok, where they had already curated a set for us to view. We, once again, met with one of the store owners. Their collection is just so beautiful! We had a hard time choosing because we ended up liking several a lot! We ultimately chose something we just love! I highly, highly recommend the carpet cellar if you’re looking for an area rug. They have an extensive collection and knowledgeable staff."
The_Carpet_Cellar,Karan Puri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Couples,Just wonderful!,"Visiting the Carpet Cellar is an educational experience.

The_Carpet_Cellar,DG4,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Business,Best place in the world to buy a quality lifetime carpet,"Recently went to India where I decided to invest in some more quality carpets.  I love hard wood floors but there is nothing more beautiful then a hard wood floor with a stunning carpet.We bought carpets 9 years ago when we were in India for 4 months.  We bought a few from carpet cellar and some from other places.  As time as gone on we have grown to love the carpet cellar carpets more and more and regretted not having bought more.   This trip I decided - it’s time - and well prices are still remarkable for the quality.  These are carpets that truly last your life.  They were so patient with me .... spent hours looking and thinking about our home and our taste.  In the end,  after narrowing it ..... landed on many! My husband was thrilled when they arrived.  Nicely shipped and arrived very quickly.  They are stunning and surprise us how much more we love them then we even thought.Only regret- not getting them years earlier!"
The_Carpet_Cellar,Padytr,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Truly the mecca for carpets in Delhi,"The Carpet Cellar is truly an amazing place for carpets of all kinds, old & new, antique and modern pieces. Large, extra large & small. From carpets that can cost you an arm & a leg to more affordable pieces. Carpets, dhuries, kilims - you can find everything here. And, what is more, you can be sure you won’t be taken for a ‘ride’ here as you may be in many of the other ‘carpet showrooms’ in the city, especially those in the large hotels. Sheel Chandra, the patriarch of the ‘Chandra family’ had a passion for carpets and built an amazing g collection from all over the world and later decided to make his passion his business. He has passed on this passion to his sons, Pawan & Nishant, and you are likely to meet one of them in the showroom. Engage them in conversation, and you can spend hours looking at carpets and learning about them - and you will definitely leave with a few gems you discover!The Carpet Cellar has two showrooms in Delhi, one in Anand Lok which is the main showroom, and the other on the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, just next to the Sultanpu metro station and above the Ishatvam (a well known handicrafts showroom) store. I visited the latter, had been there earlier too, and this is a huge warehouse with thousands of carpets of all kinds and sizes.  But do not be fazed, just talk to the manager or Nishant, if he is there, tell him what you are looking for, and soon his staff will be pulling out dozens, and dozens for your viewing!! All the while, Nishant (or the manager) will be telling you all about the carpets, the origin, old or new, antique or modern - and I will be surprised if you do not end up buying - more than what you had planned, and walking away with a large satisfied smile!! Do visit. Here are pics of a few kilims I viewed. "
The_Carpet_Cellar,Smm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Met with such positive kindness,"People feel welcome at this treasure house, even if you are there just to look at beautiful carpets.

The_Carpet_Cellar,John Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Solo,"Beautiful Carpets, People you can Trust","This one of the best carpets shops I now visit to buy all my quality rugs.  Despite living in Dubai where there is a wide selection available, I know I can trust these guys to provide great quality and super value.  They had a wide selection of carpets made from high-quality wools and silks.   Its not often you can find a carpet manufacturer who offers such super quality value with a high level of trust.  The last visit I purchased another two carpets and the team expertly wrapped them for me to carry home care of Emirates.  Thank you Pranav for carrying on in your Father's tradition and honouring his memory!"
The_Carpet_Cellar,mickylawro,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Business,Great Carpet collection and no pressure ,This low key carpet shop is not your typical Indian carpet store. They’re friendly staff allow you to look at the collection stress free without being pressured into buying. I purchased a beautiful piece inspired by a Persian print. Very happy with my purchase.
The_Carpet_Cellar,Paula S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,Aladdin’s cave,"I can’t remember how I heard of Carpet Cellar, but I have been a loyal client of theirs whenever I visit Delhi. The owner describes it so aptly as Aladdin’s Cave, when describing their outlet in Ananda Lok. There is a stunning selection of carpets and Kilims, old and new, where one can spend hours learning about the history of the carpet. My favorite section is the shawls and stoles. There’s a vast range of colour and print and I can never buy just one. I am always well greeted and served by their very professional team. A highly recommend visit when in Delhi. "
The_Carpet_Cellar,Katandapickle,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,An expensive mistake,"I knew that I wanted to buy a carpet when I visited Delhi last December and did a lot of research before deciding to buy from the Carpet Cellar. My experience buying the carpet was fine: the showroom was easy to find, the staff were helpful and they had a good selection of carpets. I was after a kilim, a flat-woven reversible carpet, and chose one from the large number available. I was told that it was approximately 50 years old, from Afghanistan. One of the staff carefully wrapped it up for me for transport home.When I got home and unpacked it, I was horrified to see that Carpet Cellar had written the serial number of the carpet on both sides of the carpet in permanent marker, not once but in 3 different places! I immediately emailed them, and was told that they do this because the paper tags they use fall off - but this means that I’m now home, with a carpet I paid several thousands of dollars for that is damaged and useless. They recommended that I clean the carpet with rubbing alcohol, which I have tried, but the numbering is still visible. I suspect that the only way the carpet can be fixed is by having a professional rug repairer remove the damaged section and re-weave it, which from experience will cost almost as much as the carpet.I cannot believe that a professional carpet dealer would do this. I’ve purchased several carpets from other dealers and have never seen anything like this before. If you are considering buying from this shop, make sure you check your carpets very carefully because they’ve indicated that they do this to all their stock!"
The_Carpet_Cellar,John M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Purchase at the Carpet Celler,The Carpet Celler has a very wide selection of very high quality carpets and their service is excellent
The_Carpet_Cellar,William M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,The Place to Buy a Rug in Delhi,"India has some of the most beautiful rugs in the world but buying a rug can be a daunting task.  Rest assured, you will get quality at The Carpet Cellar.  They will be upfront, friendly, non-pushy and genuinely interested in getting you what you want. Even better for visitors in that the dickering is non-existent.  You don't leave thinking ""if I argued more I could have saved $50"".  Give yourself two hours to understand rugs, know your colors,  see the options, be upfront about how much traffic the rug will see and look at what is presented to you. If you have time, ask them to show you the antique museum quality rugs.  It is like rug porn.  Trust these guys, listen to their advice and travel home with a new family heirloom"
The_Carpet_Cellar,Kumar S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,The Carpet Cellar,Huge quantity and good quality of various types of carpets available here. This place is lesser known but once you visit this place won’t go anywhere else for carpets. 
The_Carpet_Cellar,Jason M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Business,Great Experience Buying a Carpet,"On my last visit to Delhi I thought I would look to buy a carpet.  I searched trip advisor and The Carpet Cellar was the first hit.  Once inside I was met by Dhruv, a very pleasant man.  I explained my budget, he didn't try to up sell me, but did explain the different types of wool's and weave process.  With help, I was shown many carpets, and we were able to narrow the search to a few.  Via FaceTime my wife and I chose our carpet, and it was sent via FedEx back to Canada.  It arrived within a few days.  Thank you for excellent service."
The_Carpet_Cellar,Marshall B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Something very special in the world of carpets,"I have been buying carpets in Delhi for three decades but only recently did I discover the Carpet Cellar. I wish I had known about it much sooner for it is by far the best option for buying quality carpets without fear of being duped or cheated. It is the only place in Delhi and India where I would now buy carpets of any description.The most important thing to understand about Carpet Cellar is that they have not only a very large and diverse inventory of beautiful carpets but also a unique one. All their carpet either come from the remarkable collection assembled over decades by the owners or are high-end reproductions of carpets in their historically important collection. Both the Persian and tribal carpets come in a huge variety of styles, colors and price ranges. Their finest carpets, some of which are not for sale, are of truly museum quality.The owners are delightful to deal with. Highly knowledgeable, utterly professional, friendly and engaging, and reliable. I had the great pleasure of dealing with Mudita Chandra, the niece of the original collector, who understood my wishes and was sophisticated and responsive in every way. Carpet Cellar has professional photographs of every carpet and can email those photos immediately so that if you wish, you can review a number of images of each carpet as you consider your purchase. On this visit I was buying carpets for our son and his family and was able to send photos for their consideration and then return to the store the next morning to make final choices.Carpet Cellar will go out of its way to ensure your purchases are shipped securely and rapidly. My purchase took place just a month after the implementation of India's first national goods and services tax, which made many new demands on businesses large and small requiring initial bureaucratic approval. Carpet Cellar managed to ship the carpets to me via FedEx only a few days after our wire transfer payment was received by them despite the new requirements.It was a great pleasure to work with Carpet Cellar in the purchase of three gorgeous carpets, two of them 100-120 years old, for my son and his family.  I know any visitor would have the same great experience."

The_Carpet_Cellar,vancouvermtv,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Know your quality and bring your paint chips and sizes,"I arrived on a saturday morning knowing what i needed colour wise more or less and size. The owner helped identify which pile i needed to look through and with his and th staff's help  put a number of maybes aside. Then we went through them. Staff were helpful in moving carpets and bringing closer to the window to check on colours . The owner is very knowledgeable if zyou are trying to decide on silk verses wool . You need tomhave some knowledge of rugs to ensure you jnderstand price points etc. Once the decision was made, price negotiate then decision was made to ship verses carry as allowed us to exempt some taxes therefore making shipping cost reasonable. Carpet arrived safely. Good customer sevice. They have you sign your carpet on the inderside to ensure that you know you received the right carpet. Would higlhly recommend this store especially is you know what you are looking for. "

We will definitely visit him again on our next trip and recommend this store to others."

The_Carpet_Cellar,dgcrouch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,Purchased a silk carpet - great experience!,"I went to The Carpet Cellar to purchase a 3'x5' carpet for my bedroom.  The showroom has a vast array of different carpet types in various sizes.  The task seemed daunting at first.However, the staff patiently explained the different carpet types and we quickly settled on a silk carpet.  The financial arrangements were efficient and straightforward.  I arranged to have the carpet shipped to my home in Canada.  The carpet arrived two weeks later packaged very well.Overall, I am not sure how the experience could have been any better."

Wool tribal rugs were amazing and Mudita knew the story behind every one. We shopped for carpets all over India and met mostly crooks. No pressure to buy here, relaxed atmosphere with straight facts. If you're looking for a carpet, check this place out."
The_Carpet_Cellar,lskowron,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,"Fantastic Service, Excellent Quality","Amazing gem in New Delhi - a bit difficult to find, but definitely worth it.

I go into the Carpet Cellar with my old Persian rug that was in my Grandfather's study for 40 years and then with me for the last 15 years, to get it cleaned and mended. Not only do they welcome you into their treasure trove of beautiful carpets, but Dhruv also tells me the interesting history and complexity of the rug I have brought in - this is when a service turns into history, culture & art. Gotta love that!Ps The rug I took in last year has been beautifully cleaned & mended. I'm certain this one will be too.  "
The_Carpet_Cellar,139brucer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Solo,Excellent Service,"We needed a large carpet for our new home in Minnesota, USA. I travel to New Delhi for business and had heard good things about The Carpet Cellar. After some research I realized others had experienced good service and quality at The Carpet Cellar. I visited the showroom and was amazed by how much quality product they had. As you approach their entrance down a small stairway you might think you have lost your way-it is very modest. When you enter however everyone is very friendly. Dhruv (one of the owners) helped me pick out the perfect carpet. The prices are are well worth the quality of the product. Dhruv set up shipping to our home via FEDEX a half a world away and it arrived packed neatly within a few days. All aspects of the transaction were pleasant. I am planning on buying additional carpets for our new home from Dhruv and the Carpet Cellar in the future. Their website also is an excellent resource."
The_Carpet_Cellar,Gaurav R P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Solo,A most satisfying experience,"While The Carpet Cellar has both contemporary and classic examples of the art available, I am captivated by their dizzying range of antique carpets. The attention to detail and design that shines forth in their selections represent a deep understanding of these magnificent, and often overlooked, cultural objets d'art. The quality and range is impeccable and their whole collection is handmade, as the best art often tends to be. Unless you have already decided exactly what you want, I would suggest taking an appointment before visiting and setting aside at least a couple of hours, if not more, to look through the collections and discuss your requirements with the capable and knowledgeable staff. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a piece of culture that is more than just something to walk on."
The_Carpet_Cellar,MBDC16,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Wonderful collection,"Magnificent carpet collection of very good quality. Colton and wool dhurries, tribal, silk... Antique and new. We found what we were looking for. I highly recommend it. We will return on our next visit to Delhi. "
The_Carpet_Cellar,mcurtez,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Couples,"Amazing selection, great customer service","We were looking to buy a rug for our living room during our trip in India and a friend suggested that we'd check the Carpet Cellar. We did a little research, found several articles in well known magazines about the store and decided to visit their showroom the day before we left. Mudita and the staff took great care of us. Their selection is almost never ending and they have really great pieces. We spent close to 2 hours in the store and after going through piles of rugs we came up with a shortlist of 6 or 7 rugs we really liked. Since they were pretty different from each other in style and size we wanted to come back home and get a better sense of how they would fit before pulling the trigger so they emailed us pictures, dimensions and details for each of those. At no point we were ever pressured to buy anything, which was probably a first during our trip... While we were there we also selected 2 smaller silk rugs for our bedroom.They patiently provided additional assistance as we were narrowing down choices, and once we made up our mind on the large rug we coordinated the last steps (payment and shipment) with Mudita via email, received a FedEx tracking number and 4 days later got the 3 rugs delivered at home in Chicago. They were packaged extremely well and are now proudly displayed in our living room and bedroom.Prices were very fair for the quality of the rugs, especially when comparing them with similar pieces here in the US.If we're ever in Delhi again we will certainly make another visit to the store, but I think we won't wait that long and will find a way to work with Mudita remotely to pick our next one."

The_Carpet_Cellar,Kavi1979,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Solo,Highly Recommend  -- Each Visit Is An Education!,"I recommend The Carpet Cellar with highest praise to anyone seeking to purchase a carpet or shawl. Over a period of two years, we purchased three large carpets for our home from The Carpet Cellar, as well as a couple other smaller carpets to gift to friends.  We've also personally recommended The Carpet Cellar to all our friends and family who are seeking to make a purchase. Not only does The Carpet Cellar have an extensive and well-curated collection of exquisite carpets, kilims, and pashmina shawls, but the owners and staff are tremendously knowledgeable about the history and art of carpet weaving. In fact, the family themselves own one of the largest and most beautiful collections of carpets in Asia. Each visit is an education.  If you purchase a carpet from here, you not only walk away with a beautiful carpet, but also the assurance of the high quality  of your purchase, and also a detailed appreciation of the craftsmanship behind the piece you have selected. This is the only place  in Delhi you should go to if you are seeking to purchase a carpet, kilim, or shawl."
The_Carpet_Cellar,Nicole S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,A wonderful shop,We visited The Carpet Cellar for the first time last year and couldn't wait to come back. We have never seen so many beautiful carpets under one roof. We bought 4 carpets last year which we have never regretted buying and 5 more this year. The service we received was impeccable and we enjoyed learning about the different techniques of carpet making.We would highly recommend a visit.

You are provided with the provenance of any carpet you purchase. This knowledge takes you beyond owning a carpet to owning a work of art. I cannot recommend the Carpet Cellar enough. A visit to their amazing showroom and a conversation with the manager ""Bobby"" should be on the must-see list of any visitor to Delhi."

The family has been in the business for generation, which shows from their expertise. Very interesting to learn how every carpet was made, how it changes in colour depending on from where you look etc. The never-tiring staff let us browse through pile after pile until we found the perfect solutions for our home in Spain. We will surely go back next time we are in India."

A family owned business with a commitment to being the best. All staff are highly knowledgeable and will provide extensive information and insight into each rug. The rug selection is varied with antique rugs through to dhurries. There is also a beautiful range of cashmere pashminas, shawls and scarves in natural colours that have simple designs that I have not seen elsewhere. The sophisticated daughter  Mudita was particularly helpful and charming."

Excellent language skills, seemless transaction and prompt international delivery by FedEx."
The_Carpet_Cellar,RENET C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Business,Amazing selection of quality carpets!,"With so many carpet stores in Delhi, we were apprehensive about the quality and fairness we would get. After selecting a few before we left home, The Carpet Cellar ended up being the most favorable. There was a comfort in knowing the company was family owned and has been in business for many years. Mudita Chandra, the daughter of one of the owners, was extremely helpful and patient with us as we looked through numerous rugs. We ended up with a beautiful runner that we will have as a wonderful token of our visit to India. The price she gave us for the rug was very fair, considering we had been to 3 other carpet stores and had some knowledge of rug costs for comparisons. The rug arrived to our home within 2 days of our return, so the delivery process was swift. I highly recommend this store if you are in the market for a quality carpet. I wouldn't waste my time going to any other stores. I'd  also advise to forget buying at stores your tour guide takes you to as the mark up for the carpets is ridiculous since the guide takes a cut. We went to the Carpet Cellar on our own and had the opportunity to deal directly with a family member. Unlike the other stores we visited, there was absolutely no pressure to purchase anything even though we took up almost an hour of Mudita's and her staff's time showing us rugs for us to review."

As ABITA chairman,I was looking for gifts & giveaways for the 125th anniversary celebrations of the Assam Branch of the Indian Tea Association. I searched far & wide,through Calcutta then Delhi ,but did not find that something exclusive,something special. And then I happened to visit the Cellar & it really is something straight out of the Arabian Nights ! Their collection of carpets,rugs,kilims is out of this world.                I was also pleased with their collection of shawls & stoles in a wide variety & top quality.                 Special word of thanks to his staff.

The_Carpet_Cellar,19Sarita71,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Solo,Each carpet a masterpiece!,"3 years ago I purchased 3 carpets for my new home from  an exporter, whom I knew and who boasted that his carpets were sold all over Europe and the USA. I selected and bought 3 carpets which had very attractive designs and colours. Within 6 months they started getting threadbare in patches and the colour started fading! After two years of use I had to replace them! What a waste of my hard earned money!I had heard of The Carpet Cellar, but was wary of going there asI felt such an old,huge and established shop would be too expensive and the carpets would not be within by budget. Finally I went. I was in for a real surprise! The carpet selection was huge, and there was such a profusion of traditional and modern designs in the most striking and exquisite colours. The staff, most of them family members, were so patient and helpful in showing me endless pieces. I was given a brief history of each design and the service was so personalised! I was made to feel that I could take all the time in the world to choose! And the prices were so competitive! I finally selected 2 large and 2 smaller carpets. They occupy the pride of place in my house and give my husband and me endless pleasure! They are swept everyday with an ordinary household broom and are still in mint condition!Look nowhere else if you want carpets. Just head to The Carpet Cellar! Highly recommended!"
The_Carpet_Cellar,Bryan B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,Great experience in Delhi..,"Over the past year or so I have purchased carpets a number of times from the Carpet Cellar in Delhi to ship back to the US and to keep for personal use in India (I am a US citizen and currently work in India). I have visited both locations and dealt with most of the family members running the business. I have also read all of the previous 5 star reviews and all of them describe my experience exactly (especially recommend ""Very Professional"" Jan 3, 2014). The prices I paid seemed very reasonable and while some reviewers suggest that better prices may be obtained elsewhere, I doubt after having shopped for carpets in India for four years, that you would have the same quality experience and support as I have received from Mudita and her family members at the CC. Only hiccup I have had is once with DHL shipping to the US so I recommend asking for Fedex instead. A little more expensive but far less hassle."
The_Carpet_Cellar,mailmanoj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Solo,Experience in itself,It’s a beautifully done store that makes you feel at home. Their staff is very supportive and forthcoming. The huge collection priced rightly makes you long for more. Every step at this store is an experience in itself. You would like to stay at their store for more and more time. The courteous approach and positive vibes are a delight at The Carpet Cellar. The un-ending collection makes it easier and offers a choice for everyone. I believe this one store can definitely fulfill everyone’s need as per an individual’s choice. It’s a must visit store. Kudos! The Carpet Cellar

The_Carpet_Cellar,debottambose,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015,Personable!,"I visited Carpet cellar without any expectation thanks to a friend, both of us out of towners!It was quite the feast for the eyes. Perhaps the most widely known woven textiles are the famed Kashmir shawls. From the Kanikar, with its intricately woven designs that are formalized imitations of Nature. The Chenar leaf (plane tree leaf), apple and cherry blossoms, the rose and tulip, the almond and pear, the nightingale—these are done to the Jamiavr, which is a brocaded woolen fabric.The floral designing appears like heavy close embroidery-like weave in dull silk or soft pashmina wool, and usually comprises small or large flowers delicately sprayed and combined; some shawls have net-like patterns with floral ensemble motifs in them. Still another type of Kashmir shawl is the Dourukha, a woven shawl that is so done as to produce the same effect on both sides. This is a unique piece of craftsmanship, in which a multi-coloured pattern scheme is woven all over the surface, and after the shawl is completed, the rafugar (expert embroiderer) works the outlines of the motifs in darker shades to bring into relief the beauty of design. This attractive mode of craftsmanship not only produces a shawl which is reversible because of the perfect workmanship on both sides, but it combines the crafts of both weaving and embroidery and religious beliefs.I was hoping to see some Shatoosh, which are made from the beard hairs of the wild Ibex. They are so fine that a whole shawl can be pulled through a small finger ring. But something's are best kept for the next trip!Our guide was the young expert purveyor of such fine things: Ms. M. Chandra who along with her team showed my friend a staggering collection and made discerning recommendation, a fine balance between the art of selling and informed opinion which was refreshing I thought. For lovers of aesthetics and quality, this place is a great treasure trove and one should take some time and have deep pockets as well! Enjoy!"

The_Carpet_Cellar,Sidharth P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Couples,Buying a piece of history,"The carpet celler has one of the best collections in the capital. Carpets from Iran, afghanistan , Turkey, the list goes on. With each carpet comes its own history and region and the staff here help you understand and appreciates the true value of each individual carpet. Infact there are a handful of the carpets which are heirlooms and just for display, the Chandras have refused to part with them no matter what you may offer, but have preserved and display for those who share the passion for carpets and the craft. Carpets are a passion for the Chandras and this comes across easily.This is not the place if you want a cheap carpet for using under you dining table. Having said that, if you want a carpet that could well become part of the discussion among guests at your home then this is the place to visit. The first time I had gone there with a budget and did manage to find a beautiful Afghan carpet. Have gone back several times over the years and each time came back with further insights and greater appreciation. Truly worth a visit and a place which belongs firmly on Delhi's cultural and historical map."

The_Carpet_Cellar,Julian P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Solo,Carpet Heaven,"I have lived in New Delhi for the last 14 years and am a huge fan of the Carpet Cellar. It has the largest collection of carpets, modern and antique, in India if not South Asia. Based in South Delhi, it’s vast cellar reveals a treasure trove for lovers of fine carpets, kilms and antique fine embroidered pashmina shawls. Just to walk in there is an education in itself although the Carpet Cellar does occasionally organise remarkably informative talks on carpet weaving through the centuries both to aficionado’s and the uninitiated. The cellar smells faintly of neem to store the carpets but once the rugs are unrolled you are in for a treat as the jewel like colours come alive. Take off your shoes and socks and feel the lush pile and silky softness of the Baluch’s and lust after the colours of the Kashmiri and Agra carpets, the rich red and indigo's of the Afghans and the burnt umber and crimson of the Samarkand pomegranate carpets. In addition the Carpet Cellar is a large exporter of new carpets to the royal families of the Middle East so have a high reputation for quality.The family is an interesting one – one set of identical twins marrying another set and the business has been in the family for generations, which means that they really know their stuff and will be informative on everything from “jail carpets” to Turkish kilms. If you can’t find it lurking in their huge stock I doubt whether the “one” you are looking for will be found elsewhere in Delhi. They are not the cheapest place to buy a carpet in New Delhi but you are assured of both quality and origin and I have never felt cheated. They have carpets of a wide size and price to suit most pockets from a small prayer rug that can be wrapped up as hand luggage to huge Aubusson’s that would fill a State Room. The Carpet Cellar will also clean carpets, hand washing them with herbal, not chemical cleaners. The carpets that I have bought from them are pieces of art that will last me a lifetime and I have never parted with one. A thing of beauty is a joy forever, and although I would never say my floors are clean enough to eat off they certainly are a picture gallery to rival the Louvre!"

Every time I visit India with my wife, Carpet Cellar is a mandatory stopover for rekindling friendships, a warm cup of chai and to pick up a carpet or two to add to our home. You pay a slight premium but I much rather do that and have the selection, the experience, the incredible service and most importantly the trust that the carpet cellar offers. What you see is what you get which is critical in the carpet world. They will package the carpet for you the way you want for international travel and deliver to where you want it delivered."

The staff is very learned and gently guide you through the whole store, without the urgency of the 'buy'. The friendly proprietors are mostly on hand to regale you with stories and tell you minute details about each piece. It clearly seems to be a passion which has now been translated into a store.

Its my understanding that they wash the carpets 'herbally' as it was done over a hundred years ago. This made sure that the natural and delicate fibers of my Carpet were not harmed. SInce there were no chemicals involved its better for the environment too. I was very pleased with how good my carpet turned out and also the efficient manner in which the process was completed.Upon visiting the store to collect my Carpet i was astounded at the huge collection they have and the vast knowledge of the owners and their well trained and courteous staff.

We travelled all over the country during that year and kept an eye out for deals.  Agra was the worst place to buy handicrafts, textiles, carpets, etc.  We travelled to Rajasthan and paid $1700 for a 6x9 single weft carpet in Jaipur (negotiated down from $2400) thinking it was a decent price.  We found the Carpet Cellar the last month we were in Delhi and were shocked at how fair their prices were and amazed at the great collection of old and new carpets.  We ended up buying four more carpets from the Carpet Cellar; two old Persian carpets and two new Indian hand-knotted.  Don't waste time during your trip visiting any other carpet vendors."

In desperation I turned to my trusty Trip Advisor for help, read the recommendations for the Carpet Cellar and promptly jumped in a taxi to check it out for myself. Good decision.While the charming and very knowledgeable Mudita patiently explained the different types of fabrics and designs, staff at the shop literally flipped 100 rugs for me to look at. There was no pressure to buy so I was able to take my time and really think about my choice.I short-listed 6 rugs, returned with my husband the next day and purchased a beautiful 5 x 7 silk on silk rug.  On this occasion Dhruv kindly assisted us. About 10-14 days later our rug arrived safely in Melbourne courtesy of DHL and is living happily ever after in our lounge room!Thanks Mudita and Dhruv."

If you are interested in buying a rug while in Delhi this is worth your time.  But, better yet, they made the process very easy.  I live in California and saw a rug I liked very much.  I wasn't sure it would fit the room I had in mind, and I wanted to think about the price etc.  No problem!  I flew home, they forwarded additional photos of the rug and its specific dimensions via email.  The rug fit the space and I decided to buy it.  I sent a personal check to their agent in New York and a week later the rug arrived in Santa Monica via FedEx...it was carefully wrapped and was in perfect condition.

I bought an expensive, handmade carpet through the Internet without seeing it in person. And . . . it all worked out beautifully, thanks to the hard work, expertise and patience of Bobby, who guided us carefully through detailed photos, exact measurements, pricing and shipping. He generously provided us with many, MANY high quality photos whenever we inquired about a particular carpet.  The measurements he gave us were exact. He explained rug quality and construction to us as required. He has an enormous selection of very high quality pieces in a large variety of styles. What a fascinating experience it was to recieve emails with photo attachments each morning as we requested more options to choose from. Let me also add that we live in Canada and Bobby arranged the shipping and handling for us. As it turns out, the company we shipped with, DSL, had its challenges, keeping our shipment at the port in India for many days as well as leaving it in a warehouse in Calgary for almost a week; none of this had anything to do with Carpet Cellar, but Bobby did his best to contact the people he knows at DSL to try to sort this out. Our rug arrived beautifully packed and in perfect condition, and it is a beauty, as stunning as the photos, if not more so. We couldn't be happier with our experience, our rug and would recommend Carpet Cellar to anyone who appreciates fine rugs and the beauty they bring to a space. Pricing is competitive and reasonable, given the quality of the rugs. Don't be afraid to shop on the Internet! It can be done!!"
The_Carpet_Cellar,slvrwolf58,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013,The Best Carpet/Shawl Store In New Delhi,"My wife and I were taken to this store by a local woman who said this was the place she was taking us.  We had arrived at 2:00 in the morning and had only one day to shop before our tour started. After a few hours of rest, she picked us up to go shopping for the rug that we had waited for this India trip to purchase.  Needless to say, after our visit to the Carpet Cellar, we did not need to go anywhere else.  They are the nicest people with the best quality rugs and shawls in all of India.  If you need or want a really nice quality product, this should be the first  and only place you need look!  It was a wonderful experience in what could be a nightmare.  You can purchase rugs and shawls anywhere in India and not be sure that you are purchasing the quality that you think you are.  At this place, you can be assured that the quality is tops, and the price will be very good.  As you can read, I would highly recommend this place.AMS (Waco, Texas, USA)"
