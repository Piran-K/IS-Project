,,,,,I was much pleased with the experience since it was the first time trying out an escape room. What didn't work out was the limited number of themes available at the site and the one we wanted to to try was not working at the time.It also seemed a bit overpriced. And after completion we did not receive anything. Some medal or coupon for next time or maybe cashback would've been great.

The_Hidden_Hour,Mr_Abhishek_A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Amazing experience in post covid era,"I tried the hidden hour for the first time with much apprehension and not expecting much since I have done a lot of escape rooms in the US. I wanted to do something similar in India for my birthday (to do something different than the regular party/ dinners) and I was so PLEASANTLY surprised. The hidden hour was so so so good- as good (or even better) than the ones I have done in the US. They were very well done- were challenging and fun, with a lot of attention to details and very well maintained. The themes were selected with care and then the challenges were apt for the theme. The puzzles were challenging and innovative. Most importantly, the team was very good and provided excellent customer service- which I believe is a very important factor contributing to the overall great experience. I plan to do all their themes at all their locations and will definitely recommend it to all my friends. Anyone wishing to have some clean fun should not even think twice before doing this!It was a great one hour spent!"

The_Hidden_Hour,brookem91,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Must visit,"Was waiting for the escape rooms to open since last 6 months and wohaaa, we finally got to play the game at The Hidden Hour in Hauz Khas Village. They have renovated the entire place and it looks absolutely new.. They had introduced a new game -  Lost in an Island. It's one of the best escape rooms I have played till date. Absolutely loved it.. Lots of use of technology.. and big multiple rooms with lot of space.. you actually get a feel of island inside.. very well decorated n designed. We had a great time celebrating my anniversary here. Infact all the precautions were taken like temp screening, sanitizer, mask, gloves, digital start to the game.. just loved it! Will definitely experience it again soon.."
The_Hidden_Hour,TravellingDogLady,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Amazing experience,I along with my friends visited The Hidden Hour and played quarantine zone mission. We had an amazing time together and the puzzles made our bond even more stronger. It is a Highly Recommended place for groups looking for adventure.
The_Hidden_Hour,aman s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A really fun game!,We had an awesome time solving the Quarantine Room.. with some hints from our helpful hosts üòÖExperiences was great value and definitely a challenge.
The_Hidden_Hour,pragati s,,,,"The concept is great but the props are all faded, old or spoiled by users. People have scribbled on their things and they haven't cleaned those off well so it gives away most of the clues. Plus if we want help, it doesn't only show up on the scree, the person comes inside to tell you what to do. How annoying is that? Not worth it for the price. half the money, and that experience would be worthwhile"
The_Hidden_Hour,xeoneux,,,,"Too much fun, the games had me and my friends shook and additionally the time bar kept us on our toes. Do visit with your friends if you‚Äôre looking forward for some fun time and experience."
,,,,,Do visit if you need to test your brains and soend some time with friends. An experience definitely worth the while! Looking forward to visit again and try another game soom.
