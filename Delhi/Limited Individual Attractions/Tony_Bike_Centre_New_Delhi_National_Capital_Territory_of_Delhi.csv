Tony_Bike_Centre,Nibedita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,LADAKH TRIP,Ladakh is not easy terrian to compete it but tbc made it easy for us.every tent to hotel all are chosen carefully  by Mala mam which was clean and comfy.comming to food not a single day we suffered any kind of discomfort as it  personally choosen by tbc.some ups and downs will be there but you can pass hurdle if someone is there with you to say its okay will find a solution for this.TBC not only given the comfort but also made our trip sucessfull.
Tony_Bike_Centre,Ashwin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,TBC made the arduous Ladakh bike trip seem effortless,"I rode my own bike but wanted to join a tour operator for taking care of food and lodging along with getting the safety of a group. I underestimated Tony Bike Centre. I found team TBC to be much more experienced and caring. People find Ladakh bike trip an arduous task but TBC made it seem effortless. All of us riders formed a cordial bond and became one family. Each day provided different challange (probable landslide / water crossings / probable traffic jams / broken road or road construction / bad weather etc) and our tour head Mala ma'am already had updated intel for that particular day's road conditions. Her valuable post-dinner briefings helped us immensely to prepare for the next day's ride.This being an adventure tour, the food and lodgings provided throughout the trip were better than expected, barring Sarchu. There were non-veg options too, whenever possible.To sum up my experience : Despite riding hard daily, we all were able to experience the natural beauty of Ladakh because team TBC took away a lot of hassle. THIS made all the difference."

Tony_Bike_Centre,Harish Sharma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Excellent with Tony Bike Group,"Hi everyone . I am Harish Sharma , today I am going to express my candid views about the ladakh your with Tony bike centre üôÇ I was planning my trip since last 15 years but unfortunately my friends betrayed me everytime . Then I was browsing on my phone and I saw Tony bike centre on YouTube ... Then I was searching and googling around and around ... Then me and my wife went to Tony bike centre (Karol Bagh) met Mala Mam . She brief us all the things very well .Then we planned a bike tour for ladakh with TBC and I asked to mala mam that my daughter also want to come with us but we are unaware about the group members .. as this was our first time  .Then mala mam suggested you are in safe hands . (Your daughter is my daughter) . After I started my journey with TBC I realised that Mala Mam( Take care of us like  a mother) , Mr. Gagan( Treat my daughter as a Father) , Sadan , Thomas , Nutan , Kiran , Suresh , Ashwin , Qaisar(Treat my daughter as a caring brother ) and Mrs Roseena and Hina (Take care my daughter as an elder sister) .  Ladakh trip is so adventorous , challenging so at last i suggested you all that please if anybody wants to plan a bike tour for ladakh so please you should join a group because ladakh is a tough terrain so you should need  a proper guidance at every step as Mala Mam guide us very well . And Tony Bike Centre also provide bikes for rent and also a backing car  in which mala mam and mechanic are always at your backup and medical facilities (oxygen cylinder) everything she carried with herself in backing car  so you don't need to worry anything .Thank You üòä"

Tony_Bike_Centre,Gagan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,BEST EXPERIENCE,"Going to Ladakh by bike was my dream which I‚Äôve been able to fulfil only because of TBC, Every experience of the journey was beautiful and will stay with me forever. The entire group was full of cheerful and adventurous people, who have now become my family.This fantastic journey seemed very easy with TBC. This was not only an adventurous and an accomplished trip for me but gave me great friends and an elder sister Mala ma‚Äôam.

Tony_Bike_Centre,Roseena Xavier,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Great Experience,"Completed the Ladakh circuit with TBC from Delhi. It was a dream of me and my husband and TBC helped to complete it without any hassle. If you are looking for a tour guide who will help you cross the difficult adventurous terrains of Ladakh, then TBC is your go to spot. The accommodation was moderate but the helping service they provided at the time of need was greatly appreciated. Mala ma'am guided us throughout how to face the changing altitudes and ride through difficult terrains as a cake walk. Thank you TBC for helping us complete our dream ride :)"
Tony_Bike_Centre,Nutan Kumar Panda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A trip worth a lifetime,"I have enquired about many guided tour providers and met with many on the way. 3 things makes TBC apart from others is 1. Planning 2. Accomodation and food 3.support staff. We faced some serious medical emergency, TBC staff and fellow riders helped us above and beyond to pass that hurdle. We finished our trip with a big smile on our face. Highly recommended."
Tony_Bike_Centre,Varun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Very friendly and quick,"I booked a scooty for a week just to roam in Delhi. First they will show u some available vehicles as per ur preference which u have to test ride and then choose. The paper work is also quick Prabjot helped a lot with that, they will provide u with the papers of the vehicle  and I had to give 3k as deposit and a PAN Card (u can give other valid id too) which was returned to me on the last day. They will ask u what is the purpose of ur visit and where r u residing here this is a valid question as it is for security reasons. The vehicle worked very well for those 7 days I hired it I did not face any problems and I did ride it a lot. Aunty and uncle are also very helpful and I would recommend them if ur planning to hire a 2 wheeler they also plan Leh Ladakh trips. On the last day I wanted the 3k in cash and without hesitation they gave the money."
Tony_Bike_Centre,Akshit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Superb experience,"I had dreamt of completing Ladakh circuit from Delhi. Tony Bike Center made it a reality for me. The experience was so great that my entire solo journey went by super smooth. I rented a Himalayan BS4 from them and believe me it rode all the way from Delhi and Back without any hiccup. I‚Äôll certainly be planning again with TBC on their group tours, i‚Äôve heard those are super fun too. I would recommend using their services for all your bike/tour requirements.

Tony_Bike_Centre,tonybikecentre,,,,"Me and my 2 friends booked a Leh Safari from Tony Bike Centre towards the end of September. The bookings were effortless. The accommodations and food provided were excellent and everything felt just like home. Even after visiting such a high altitude, all of us were in perfect condition without encountering any health related issues. We were able to visit Leh, Nubra Valley, Tangse, Pangong Lake, Chang La and Khardung La all of them were too scenic and this place has endless beauty and is a must visit. We booked an SUV through the Leh Safari package from Tony Bike Centre and it was very comfortable and made the journey even more enjoyable. Would recommend 10/10!"

,,,,,"How could I know what would happen in march 2020 ?!I rented a Royal Enfield 500 CC at Tony bike centre on the 2nd of march and could start my program with an excellent ride to Pushkar within seven hours. The bike is a wonder.But then came the lockdown. I could just get in time to Delhi before the border closed in ordre to be on time to my dentist appointment.But... Everything was closed, dentiste included.So I spent about two month in confinement. By chance I was living in a private house, south Delhi, with a wonderful family and a beautiful garden. Not to mention the nepalese cook who was a cordon bleu.Rajesh, the boss at Tony bike centre was really understanding and he did his best to accommodate me. I could not bring the bike back to the shop but he did not charge anything and refunded the days I paid in advance as I could not ride the bike.I am really greatfull for that, especially knowing the troubles he had to go throught with this pandemic. He has, for example, to find a way to bring back to Delhi, bikes that were in Goa because the tourists had to go back home on a short notice.I warmly recommend Rajesh and his staff for motorcycle rentais in India. I have no comparaison with other provider, but I need none. My exp√©rience was one of the best I had in India.Thank you Rajesh ! See you soon !"

Tony_Bike_Centre,Footloose Hobo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Very good service,"I rented a Royal Enfield Himalayan from Tony Bike Centre because of the positive reviews. The staff were very friendly and helpful and made the rental hassle free. They were even kind enough to let me store my bike at there premises while I had to go home for a month. The Himalayan was in good condition and the 5 months I rented it I had no problems. Although I was responsible for servicing, these were inexpensive. They also do great tours.I would happily recommend Tony Bike Centre for your bike rental."

A few hiccups at the start sorting out the bikes however once we were on the road Mala and her crew couldn't do enough for us.  We are used to riding hard and the 13 day adventure was some of the best riding I have ever done, the Himalaya's are spectacular.  The Enfield Himalayans are a very capable bike the TBC mechanics had them in top condition for the whole trip.  The trip was well organised, great value and allot of fun and TBC were great, cheers Peter"

Tony_Bike_Centre,tonybikecentre,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,LEH-LADAHK BIKE EXPEDITION 2019,"Me, my wife and my father-in-law who is 59 now were part of the Leh and Ladkah Expedition in July 2019.  Before the start of the tour during the initial inquiry, I had told TBC that I intend to hire a 350 cc and this will be a dual rider, my wife always being the pillion. I was recommended instead to use a 500 cc. This proved to be a great recommendation from TBC. In those terrain, 350 cc would not have given me a smooth-ride experience that I had with the 500 cc. This was the first of the many recommendations that they made all of which resulted in only positive, memorable and great experience.First review: Take 500 CCFollow whatever they recommend. This will be very very useful and make your trip all the more memorable. I give 100/100 to TBC for their recommendations. PS: If you have never driven a 500 cc bullet before, do't worry. It will not be difficult for you to learn and ride. Yes, the first two days will be difficult. Your hands will go numb, you will have pain in the fingers, your shoulders may hurt. But all these are normal and will go away in a day or two. Second review: Total Number of days for the tour: The first two days of ride is very very crucial for the journey in the mountains. So I strongly and emphatically recommend that you start your bike journey from New Delhi and not from up-hill Manali. The first two day you will get used to the bike. 2nd day, you will start up-hill. If it is your first time ride up-hill on a bike, you are bound to make mistakes and TBC will be watching you from their back-up car and help you correct your mistakes. This will come a long way to easily undertake the journey from Manali onwards where the up-hill journey becomes more challenging. If you have issues with number of days you get leave, then I suggest you use the days here and cut-short the trip in the end and not compromise on the first two days. I give 98/100 for the tour dates and routes planned. The bike they provide in Delhi will be in very very good condition. They care for their bikes and expect you to do the same to it as well once it is in your custody. The bike we exchanged in Leh had issues only with the quality of tyres. The tyres had appeared to be too worn-out. TBC went beyond their call of duty here to discuss with the local Leh biker rentals to ensure that the bikes with worn-out tyres were replaced with a good one.  Review three: TBC's Local Connections: TBC has a very good hold, command and experience with all the local guys en-route to destination. You are in safe hands and so you can rely on them to get the best for your. I give 100/100 and an extra star for their local connections. . Review four: Food and accommodationBe it the bikes or food or even the accommodation. TBC did strive their best to give us the best. The fact that for all the 14  days we were there we did not fall one bit sick despite being there for the first time and also considering the fact that we were drinking not-bottled water in the hotels speak volumes about the quality of food and water. The Srinagar boathouse was the only thing I was just satisfied with. Probably it was just a day's stay there or it may be because we were travelling downhill. While the boathouse had some of the best crafted works for the door and windows, curtains and clean and well maintained boathouse, I just could not help myself with the smell I was having while staying inside the room. Probably, one is not meant to stay inside it after-all. I give 100/100 for their local connections. 100/100 for all their accommodations except at Srinagar. 90/100 for their accommodation at Srinagar.   Review five: Staff The staff from TBC are no-nonsense guys. They know their work like the back of the hand. They stick to their jobs from the first day to the last day. I have to mention 3 people here: The Mechanic's name Manjey. He sings and keeps you in good spirit no matter what situation. Helps you with the smallest of the smallest problem you may have with the bike. The back-up car driver Mulayam. No matter what speed you go, he his always behind you. No matter how may convoys you have over-taken, he is behind you. No matter the terrain, he is behind you. He knows these mountains. You can be 100% sure that he is behind you. You will be feeling safe always on account of this. The team captain Rahul (Gulshan) Sharma. On the 2nd day of the tour, first time when I was riding up-hill, TBC suggested that I simply follow him. Then I don't have to take any decision, it will be a team decision and you can easily ride uphill, despite the traffic. I understood this suggestion after following Gulshan. He is good with his bike. Knows the terrain very well. At water crossings, the route he would take would be the least risky one. This speaks volumes about his experience in understanding the ice,weather, road and off-road conditions. For my next tour, I did request Rajesh from TBC to ensure we get only these three staff from TBC. I give 99/100 for their staff. Review Six: Get used to go DutchMost of my previous tours, not on bikes, were packages. In all these cases, the tour operator would give some additional things say a tea or an evening snack which would not be included in the package. Like many, I would accept this gesture wholeheartedly. With TBC, they go strictly Dutch. They will do everything that is previously committed, but only that is previously committed. No extra tea, no extra coffee, no extra snack, no extra water bottles. I am not complaining that this is wrong. But I am informing others here that TBC is strictly professional in their work. So learn and be ready to shell out to what you eat and drink and whatever consumables incurred for the bike like the engine oil, wheel alignment and (in my case on account of being a learner, an extra pair of break shoes). PS: All these are not over-charged. They are reasonable.I give 100/100 for their commitment to give whatever they promised. Review Seven: Riding gearsWe hired riding gears from them. They were reasonably well maintained. I give 90/100 for their gears. During the test drive in New-Delhi, you will have one of the mechanics from TBC as your pillion rider. You must consider asking the mechanic and TBC before you start the tour, based on the test drive experience whether your driving skills are good enough for the trip. If you ask before you start, you will never be sorry for it."

Tony_Bike_Centre,tonybikecentre,,,,"Starting from home city Bengaluru to capital of India our New Delhi by air then Delhi to Delhi 14 days successful motorbike expedition round trip for about 2750 kms was really memorable and adventurous to all our friends, we were a group of 11 childhood friends with all mischief,enjoyable and adventurous mood, having all arrangements for 350 cc and 500 cc Royal Enfield bikes hired from TONY BIKE CENTER, DELHI, KAROLBAGH. Mr.Rajesh and madam Mala Trehan were really helpful and informative about the trip arrangements, well organised hotel arrangements, time to time update about upcoming places and weather as well. We were new to this trains and mountains but our organiser Mala Trehan made it easy for us by making us ready for all challenges from weather, road, rain and snow fall as well. we came accross all kind of weather from extreme hot Delhi to freezing cold Kardungla pass. We all enjoyed life time journey of bullet ride from Delhi to back Delhi. Bullets were well maintained and serviced to reach the challenges of any kind of weather and also different kind of rides too. We had  good company with few other bikers from Andrapradesh, Tamilnadu and Delhi as well.This bike expedition with Tony Bike Center was really a DREAM COME TRUE for us. I definitely recommend those adventurous bike riders to go for this expedition have a life time memory experience. It was wow wow wow where ever our sight reaches and just enjoy the moment that you be there at world highest motor biking road (Khardungla top) or world highest coldest place like (Siachen Glaciers). Kargil one of my dream place to visit and we did it by this expedition, it was so honored to be there and salute the memory of the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army who were martyred during the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan. All the hotels and Camps we stayed were well maintained and well organised. Bikers had well informed to carry warm cloths, water proof jackets, rubber boots, travel bags, mobile phone or cameras, general medicines, sun glasses, caps, gloves, safety gears, hell mates, bungee cords, thermos flasks and some cash as well. In the end all is well and every body reached safely with lot and lot of good memories. Thanks to Tony Bike Center and their team...Mr Rajesh, Madam Mala Trehan, Mr Devender singh(Lead), Mr Harish(Service) ect.... made our journey safe and adventurous.This was our tour itinerary for bike expedition 2019  Delhi-Chandigarh-Manail-Jispa-Sarchu-Leh-Pangong-Nubra-Kargil-Srinagar-Pathankot-Delhi.Jai Hind, Thank you,Pavan K RangappaiKindness Medical and Nursing care homesBengaluru, India."

,,,,,"Done 14 days adventure bike trip over the 3 worlds highest mountain passes, starting and finishing in Delhi. If you want an adventure, this is what you will get, and if you want a nice relaxing chill out holiday, well you might have to go somewhere else. I was the only foreigner on the trip, coming over from Scotland, and from day one I was welcomed by everyone, and very well looked after.  Tony Bike Centre is a family run business and have been going for years, and they really know their stuff. Over the duration of the trip, not one bike broke down, and only one puncture over the length of the trip. They give you loads of information on the entire trip and keep you updated on any changes that might occur.The trip is covering long days over plenty locations and terrane, but there are also shorter days for resting.We covered everything from 40c+ heat to zero in the mountains, and over smooth roads to very bumpy gravel tracks, so you get everything in the tour.This trip would never be possible without the back up of Tony Bike Centre, due to the terrane you cover with the bikes, and if something went wrong, you need the back up. Plus all the border control and checks that we crossed over and the paperwork involved is immense, so its better to leave all the stress to someone that knows what they are doing, and you can then ride and enjoy the trip.You have a Captain that rides in the front, and a back up vehicle at the back, and you  wont get lost or go missing if anything goes wrong, you are in safe hands, and there number one thing they always say is, SAFETY 1st, they don't want anyone getting hurt and want everyone to enjoy the trip, so there is no pressure on anyone.Would I book a trip again with Tony Bike Centre, O Yes, but would probably be another location, so I have to not convince the wife to get another trip booked.Many thanks for a great trip and plenty of great memories and friends."

Tony Bike Centre arranged for the engine to be repaired at their own cost, something we really appreciated, especially as we had purchased the bikes and not rented them.

I had to pay a little extra to cover the service and fixing of the tool compartment upon return however, this was explained upon collection. I will definitely be using them again either this year or next.Cheers Rajesh and the guys.P.S Thanks to the gentleman who held onto and returned my hoodie which I had left in the shop."

When we picked up the bikes and discussed our plans TBC‚Äôs advice was valuable and accurate. They included locks and chains and occy straps free of charge and they refunded hire amounts when the bikes were returned early.  We had leaky front forks on one bike and a short on the ampmetre on the other. These were cheaply and easily repaired in Chandigarh and these repairs were partially refunded by TBC when we returned.

Tony_Bike_Centre,wiebebaron,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Tour through NW-India,"In FEB 2018 my wife and I travelled on a motorbike, rented from Tony Bike Center through NW-India. It was a fantastic journey. From New Delhi, we drove about 1.600 kilometres visiting Agra, Jaipur, Pushkar, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikalmer and returned to Delhi. The trips between these cities varied between 200-300 kilometres. We ususally stayed a couple of days in these cities. An unforgettable trip. The roads were in a pretty good condition and of course you have to get used to the local traffic but that happens rather quickly. The weather was excellent, although it was a bit chilly in the early mornings on the motorbike. Once a year we travel on a rented motorbike through an Asian country. So this year, NW-India. In all these years we have never rented a motorbike which was in such a good condition as from Tony Bike Center. It was unbelievable the way they prepair you for the trip. You will get spair tubes, maintenance equipment and oil. You will pay approx 10 US a day, which is worth while due to the good quality bike.  Therefore, if you want to enjoy a motortrip in N-India, I really recommend Tony Bike Center."

I was first in contact with the manager, Rajesh, who helped me a lot defining my itinerary with all the background knowledge he has as a motorbike tour guide himself. So instead of going thru Rajasthan's heat Rajesh advised me to drive thru the north/Himalayas instead. This advice was gold!Not only was the weather much better (cooler and almost no rain in this time of the year) but also the landscapes were phenomenal. The road were sometimes pretty rough and probably one of the roughest that people will call road (where I'm from we wouldn't call most of these things anything close to a street), but the bike mastered all conditions without a single complaint. So I drove 4100km thru all terrain and had no mechanical issue with the bike altogether. That's not common at all and rather an exception. My next holiday will also go to India and I will definitely take a bike from these guys again!Keep up with the good work and service."

They provide bike on rent and also organize tour if required.We were 10 friends and had undertaken the tour in June 2016. It was 2500 Km of riding with the experienced TBC team.Malaji had organised the entire tour and all riders from experienced to novice riders were looked after and made comfortable. Back up vehicle was provided for spares and emergency repairs. Accommodation was satisfactory as expected on a bike ride.We found the commercials reasonable and i would ride again with them.
Tony_Bike_Centre,Al0kshukla,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Planning a bike trip to Leh..? Contact Tony Bike Centre!,"Tony Bike Centre is run by a very dedicated and extremely soft spoken couple - Rajesh and Mala Tehran. I have known them since 2009 and I have rented bikes from them for a couple of trips I have done up in the Himalayas. And I have had a good experience always. If you are planning to do a group bike/car tour to Leh, I would really recommend them. They are experienced, sincere and very hard working and they have a very decent network of hotels and accommodations on the route. They also have a very good support staff. With their personal care and involvement, you won't be chasing around making calls in case you require remote support.   Have a safe trip!"

Tony_Bike_Centre,Peter E,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Thanks Tony,"We hired 4 bikes from here for a couple of weeks, tony did admit that the bikes we ended up with were not his best bikes.The hire process is a long winded one, but I believe that is the way it goes in India, it took a good half day to get the bikes, this included paperwork, test rides and a very thorough check list.Make sure photos are taken of any issues noted on the bike, as this could save any confusion later.Note, get in early with your bookings and confirm that you have his better bikes ( if he has an organised tour then you are probably less likely to get the best bikes.Tony's is closed on Mondays, so work you trip around that.Allow half a day to pick up your bikes. All in all the bike hire was okay and I would use Tony again."
Tony_Bike_Centre,N2680Traveller,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,PATHETIC SERVICE,"Bike and service both pathetic, initially they will sweet talk and take you into confidence but in the end you will be disappointed with Bike quality, exorbitant bike service charge which they will deduct from your security deposit, and if you are booking hotels from them then beware it will be worst and over priced compare to market."
