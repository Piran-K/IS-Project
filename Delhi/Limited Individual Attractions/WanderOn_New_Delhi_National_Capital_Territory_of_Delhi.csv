WanderOn,Priya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Fun filled trip with lots of adventure,"I travelled to Meghalaya with wanderon with Team captain Tanushka. It was a really great experience. All the view points mentioned in the itinerary were covered. Punctuality was top notch. Tanushka made sure to give us timely wake up calls and gave us proper briefing about the things that we might need to take care of while exploring all the view points. All the hotels that we stayed at served good food and had all the basic amenities. Trips generally become more fun when you enjoy the company of the people you‚Äôre travelling with. I had some amazing set of people. Most importantly, people in Meghalaya are really not greedy. So shopping is not something you‚Äôll feel cheated upon. Be prepared for the most adventurous treks you would have ever experienced especially to Wei Sawdong and Double decker root bridge. Also, please try Zip lining at Umngot river on the day you‚Äôll reach the camping zone. It was super fun! Had a great time. Thanks wanderon! üòä"

We did the Meghalaya backpacking trip with them and it was amazing to say the least. Everything from the accommodations to the food and the activities involved were superb! Best of all, our team captain Tanushka with her buoyant spirit and killer personality, who made sure we were so well taken care off and had the time of our lives! With her around it felt like nothing could go wrong and in her we made a friend for life!Also mad credit to Divyansh (the co-captain) for being the best sport and putting up with our shenanigans and drama!Would üíØ recommend booking your next trip with them, I'm surely looking forward to mine! ‚ù§Ô∏èPs: here's a pic with our 2 captains and now best buds."

WanderOn,Parvinder,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Solo,CHOPTA TUNGNATH REVIEW,I travelled with wanderon from 27 to 31 Jan on the trip of chopta tungnath. This was my third time with wanderon and the quality expected was same top notch. The stay was awesome as usual and the meal was also super. Talking about our coordinator Akash Rangar aka (Sky bhai). What a gem kind of a person he is. He took his responsibility very seriously not even a single thing that I can tell bad about him from managing the crowd to client interaction everything he was doing in a very professional way. Plus very impressive fact about him was that while going to devprayag I got injured my foot got swelled up because of which I was not able to walk dunno how he managed both first of all he gave me first aid and after that he  took other clients to sangam and later came back to me and took me to doctor there who gave me proper treatment. Literally I'm feeling short of words to thank this guy. Would surely recommend wanderon to everyone and if it's with akash bhai then it's cherry on cake. Thanks wanderon thanks akash for all these memories. ‚ù§Ô∏è

WanderOn,Aishwarya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Fantastic,"I had been for Meghalaya backpacking trip dated 17th January 2023 with my friend.Since this was my first community travel, I wanted to be sure of what I was getting into. After sufficient research, we zeroed down on wanderon. Initially we were skeptical about wanderon and it‚Äôs services and the kind of people who would be joining us.Day 0 - Ashutosh Bindra, our trip captain called to inform me about the trip and gave me certain guidelines. He was talking quite casually which sort of broke the ice. I feel that is more important coz only then will we trust the man who is leading this bunch of people. Only two minutes of my conversation with him eased me out. This showed how diligent and comforting Wanderon is.The trip started and went on so smoothly, without any hiccups. Generally with a group of 4 people also, there can be nuisances but here this guy led a whole group of 9 people and yet there was no trouble. The accommodations and services provided by wanderon were perfect and very thoughtfully chalked out itinerary. The food was arranged after taking utmost care of each and everyone‚Äôs preferences.Our captain was quite helpful, rather was going out of his way for us to create the most beautiful memories. He follows his words ‚Äúhe wants others to experience the nature to the fullest‚Äù in letter and spirit.Honest, warm and welcoming trip captain cum friend he is. His emotional connect with everyone is the primary reason why he does an excellent job.I am sure I will go for another trip with Wanderon and hope to get Ashutosh as our team captain."

It has been a very serene, deep, mind numbing experience. Everything was quiet, peaceful and again serene. I would like to thank our Captain Ashutosh for making our trip smooth, fun and relaxing at the same time.

WanderOn,Namita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,JUST AMAZING,"Hello guys, this was my first trip with WanderOn and also with trekking, camping.I must say with a broad smile ‚ÄúWhat a trip, what an experience and what a group of friends (strangers). I went to Kasol-Rudranag-Manali with WanderOn (7th Jan to 13th Jan 2023), and I am super happy that I started my year with these wonderful experience and people.Before going in detail, I must say I found another two-captain cool ‚ÄúIZAAN & RAHUL‚Äù during this trip. Their presence was like cherry on the cake. It never felt like they are at their work and not my friends. It‚Äôs just amazing how skillfully they manage their work giving the travelers the best experience, adding a personal touch and also highly professional.The food quality, the hotels that we stayed in, etc was worth every penny spent, probably more than what I have spent. We visited Manikaran gurudwara, kasol market, rudranag, solang valley and Manali. The stay in Manali (Hotel Rock Manali by Vivan) was a pleasant surprise for all my group. Experiencing the live snow fall in Solang is a lifetime memory to be cherished. Every day was too much fun and the captains were highly experienced and had well planned everything in advance. It was surprising for me when we all were hell tired after entire day activities, the captains start their planning for next day making sure it should be perfect. A big salute to their passion and dedication.Coming to the trekking and camping, the captains were so helping and motivating throughout the trekking and trust me they will make sure you finish it happily. But shocked to see their planning and arrangement in the thick of the forest. It was just beyond imagination the perfect camping location, camps, the food and the warmth from the bonfire they had arranged there. It never felt risky or scary anytime. The whole team (captains, WanderOn office SPOCs, local guide) is super supportive and takes your safety and enjoyment as their first priority!Lastly, A big thanks to Rahul, Izaan and entire WanderOn team. You guys have a long way to go on the path of success. Cheers and Hope to see you soon again.Kudos ‚ù§Ô∏è"

WanderOn,Ashwini Rao,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Wow experience with Wanderon!!,"new year bag pack trip: Mcleodganj, Bir, Thirthan. Dec 29th 2022 to Jan 3rd 2023.It was all fun filled, adventurous trip including paragliding, lots of trekking towards waterfalls, river rafting, soul soothing experience of beautiful mountain valleys throught the journey, spectacular view of sunrise n sunset and Beas river.. Pros:¬†‚Ä¢¬†Places where we stayed were scenic, in midst of mountains n near waterbeds. food at resorts was good. luxurious tent stay at Bir was superb. n all places had bonfire to chill at night after the hectic day. I felt that each day was so packed with activities that group rarely had chance to spend good amount of time at bonfire to sit down n relax n have fun conversations. ¬†‚Ä¢¬†paragliding was an amazing experience where as river rafting was more like boating with no much rafts. we could not make to Jalori pass due to heavy snowfall but we were alternatively taken to snow point where group enjoyed playing in snow. exploring chhoei waterfalls in thirthan was a good trekking experience. ¬†‚Ä¢¬†Aditi our team caption is sweet and cool. She was very co-ordinative and effective in managing this diversified group. She was there for each and everyone in the group making sure all are okay and everything is okay, giving the comfort/liniance people expected most of the time. proper instructions were given on each day trekking details, dressing requirements, what to carry etc which was helpful. Cons:¬†‚Ä¢¬†There was kinda no co-ordination between wanderon backend team in providing correct details on trip pick up  and drop off time in Delhi. which lead us to booking flights either very early or too late. after trip we ended up reaching delhi early morning at 4 but our flight was in evening 5.30 which made us search for a stay at last moment and it was not at a good experience to go through since being unfamiliar with Delhi city and we were worried about safety. Hope team takes care of it in future and avoid unpleasant experience of any sort. Conclusion: Wanderon overall is a good travel community, solo trip, group trip whatever it is, we can be rest assured to enjoy every moment of the trip and take good memories back home and make some good connection with people too:)"
WanderOn,Cosmicexplorer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Jaunting of Jaisalmer,"New year Jaisalmer jaunting was my fourth trip with WanderOn, so it's almost inevitable to understand that I love wandering with them because they have the right set of co-travelers and never fail to curate engaging itineraries. This 3-day fun-filled trip consisted of standout adventures like midnight dune bashing and an adequately arranged welcome to the new year. I had an incredible time and was lucky enough to engross the moments that made me feel infinite.Special shoutout to our skilled team captains, Aditya, Nikita, & Shivanshu, for managing this outrageous group with the utmost entertainment & poise.Kudos to the whole team of WanderOn!"
WanderOn,Khushboo Jain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Best trip of 2022 with best travel community!,"Kashmir is genuinely a slice of heaven and words will not be able to do justice to the beauty that is Kashmir.I am glad I planned my trip with wanderon and not with any other travel groups because the unprecedented snowfall and hours long road jams needed someone experienced and knowledgeable captains, like Muneeb and Feroz.They both know the place inside out and took smart decisions to wait and halt our entire convoy of travellers to a safe place when we were faced by heavy snowfall and traffic jams in subzero temperatures.They tried tooth and nail to try and book stay for us the entire night, when all of us were sleeping peacefully in Parsa restaurant :)All the stays were very comfortable with one or other sort of heating facilities available in all the hotels.The people were very hospitable throughout, the like minded fellow travellers were like a cherry on the cake and to top it all, the weather was almost always on our sides.Lastly, it gives me immense pleasure to say that I; who generally don‚Äôt like repeating places, can go back again and again to Kashmir, just for the out worldly experience it had to offer."

WanderOn,Varun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Thank you Team WanderOn,"Jus did the Himachal Trip with WanderOn and probably is one of my best decisions of 2022 !! An awesome team of trip leaders who are super chilled out & fun to hang out with. The trip in itself covers the prominent locations of Himachal but can to too tiring for most people since we travel a lot during the 8 days. But all of this was trumped by the chillax team and parties organized by the team. We did have some feedback for the trip leaders at the beginning which was heard and we saw changes in the subsequent days, which was awesome. WanderOn team is open to feedback and did their best to make us comfortable. The stays/ hotels booked were safe, clean and awesome..no complaints there. Overall a fun trip with a fun gang !

I went to Bir-Kasol-Rudranag with WanderOn, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. The food quality, the hotels that we stayed in, etc cetera was worth every cent. And the cherry on the cake were our trip captains - Prem, Dheeraj and Harshit bhai! They were fun to hang out with, easy to talk to and very focused yet had fun with everyone on the trip.

WanderOn,Puneet J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,WanderOn: Mcleodganj Bir Tirthan trip,"Destination - Mcleodganj/Bir/TirthanTeam captain - AditiTldr:Had a amazing trip which included paragliding, rafting, waterfalls, snow, and bonfires. Going to a trip with them again in a few months and 10/10 would recommend Wanderon to friends. Pros-The team captain (Aditi). was really great with ice-breakers, getting the group to gel together with games, etc. You kind of feel like a college group after the first day itself. Team captain was approachable and her food recommendations hit the spot.The stays where all ranging from decent to wonderful (Glamping in tent in Bir being the highlight). There was bonfire on most days. The stay in Bir and Tirthan were quite scenic.Clear agenda for each day given a day earlier with what to wear advice as well. Really good handling of last-minute weather enforced change in itinerary. As an instance, Jalori pass didn't happen for us due to Govt. closing it down, but Aditi planned an alternative day for us. Their commitment to safety gave us the license to chill a bit more.What could be better- We reached back to Delhi a lot earlier than anticipated/communicated, which meant a few of the group had to scramble to arrange night stay. I guess people need to be made more aware of this possibility."

WanderOn,Rothin Shaw,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,New year in the Hills - WanderOn Rudranaag,"Destination: Bir-Kasol-RudranagDates ‚Äì 27th Dec OnwardsCaptains ‚Äì Harshit, Dheeraj, Prem~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy... Oye Oye Oye.Chanting like a war cry we got off the bus when we came back to Delhi and left for our mundane lives, carrying only memories of the amazing 5 days spent in the lap of nature.Here is my review of the short group trip I took with 26 other travellers to Bir, Kasol, and Rudranaag.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2022 had been a long and stressful year for me and I wanted to take some time off for myself. Someone suggested WanderOn's trips and I got in touch with a very helpful sales executive Saniah who cleared all my doubts and helped book the trip etc. Then came the D-Day: December 27th.All bags packed, I meet a few people from the group and Harshit, one of the team captains. We proceed to stow our bags and board the bus. Seat allocation was very smooth and we departed for Bir.During the ride, we were introduced to our other captains, Dheeraj and Prem. We were also explained the itinerary and certain changes which were made to make sure we didn‚Äôt miss out on anything due to weather conditions.Next day, we reached Camp Kasbah, a cosy li‚Äôl place with all the amenities like hot water, heated blankets and spacious beds. The breakfast was good and we headed out for small walk, exploring the monasteries and waiting for our turn to go paragliding.The monasteries are very pretty and calm. We also explored the streets, had some food and went for paragliding, which was an experience in itself. Soaring high with the clouds was unreal. This was the first time I was high in the clouds drifting, seeing the world from a different lens.We were greeted by Dheeraj, our second captain, asking if everything was smooth and if we had a good time. Finally, as evening dawned, we took another hike to a place called the northern cafe, and trust me when I tell you, this was worth every step taken. The sunset that this place has was a view to die for.The night dawned and we went for cafe hopping again to this amazing pace called Viking Caf√©. We vibed and chilled with the locals singing and dancing to tunes and finally went back to our camps where a mighty bonfire was waiting for us, blazing in all its glory.This was just the first day!!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Day 2Next day, we had breakfast and left for Kasol in the local transport.We reached Kasol at around 7 PM. The hotel was VERY comfortable and I was not expecting the rooms to be pre-heated before we came. Turns out the captains had already informed the hotel to keep the heaters etc on. (Small things like these go a long way.)Few of us decided to start the cafe hopping in the evening itself. Went out, had cakes, pastries, Maggi, momos, any and everything we wanted (skipped the actual food :P ) and found some good hidden cafe's in Kasol. (One to check out is OFFBEAT Caf√©.)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Day 38-9-10 That‚Äôs the message our captains gave us for the next day.8:00 Wakeup call9:00 Breakfast10:00 - we leave for ManikaranHike to Manikaran took 1 - 1.5 hours approx. but was breath-taking. The place gave a few really good profile pictures.Manikaran is a beautiful place. The guides told us about its the history, and after exploring it, we went back to kasol for some free time to have lunch etc.Since we had some free time in the evening, the captains carved some time out and added another hike. The Challal Hike was really refreshing; walking next to the river was refreshing and seemed to draw one closer to nature. Again, some really good pictures and videos for the gram!It was a birthday on that day and the captains made sure that they made it special, they arranged for a bonfire on the rooftop with cake and snacks for everyone.All the captains, especially our Kheerganga experts, Dheeraj and Prem, gave a serious gyan to everyone about the dos and the donts for the trek the next day.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~D Day - 31 December 2022We boarded our cabs to go to Barsheni, the starting point of the trek. Here, we met our tour guide and started on the long journey of rocks, mud, snow and ice.The trek started from an iconic bridge just after the road diverts for Tosh.The hike was a lil over 3 - 3.5 Hour long and we could see camps. The trip captains said that we are not going to camps but that we would be visiting a waterfall. This waterfall was Rudranaag.Being one of the first few to arrive, I saw the scenery untouched, unadulterated and undisturbed, my first steps on snow digging deep with every step I took on that white mount.It was MAGNIFICIENT!The temperature was easily 0 - 1 degrees and  tea and maggi were back to the rescue.After spending an hour in the snow-clad mountain clicking hundreds of pictures, we headed back to our camps.KTC or Kheerganga Trekking Camp, as these are called, house 120 individuals and have a HUGE bonfire place and a big common hall, the ONLY two warm places in the whole area.The tea was served in the common area at 5 PM.Dheeraj and Prem played multiple games with us including mafia and bluff, and damn were they good at those games!!!Finally, we had our dinner (a lavish meal considering were were) and waited for 12:00 AM.It was a Happy New Year,  2023.I spent more than an hour in the dark, covered up in blanket, looking at the stars.Finally, the cold night wasn‚Äôt that cold anymore under the blankets.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Next morning.In a place with -10 degrees, in the middle of nowhere one would not expect much for meals.But this place continued to surprise me. It had a good breakfast of poori, sabji, boiled egg and hot tea.We had the tea. Later, thanks to the expert navigation and help from Prem, Dheeraj and Harshit, we were able to climb down in almost an hour.We came back to Kasol in local transport and boarded the bus back to Delhi at night.This is how I spent my new year, making new friends, amazing memories and clicking superb pictures.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A BIG Shout-out to the trip captains Dheeraj, Prem and Harshit-‚Ä¢	For making the micro- adjustments in the plan to make sure we all had a good time and not miss out on anything.‚Ä¢	For the small history lessons about all the places visited‚Ä¢	For the cakes at the birthdays‚Ä¢	For helping out everyone with anything that they needed, from a band-aid to a bottle of water‚Ä¢	For being amazing at bluff and mafia to make sure that we are engaged, in the cold winter night as we waited for the new year.‚Ä¢	For being a fellow traveler at the end of the day and enjoying the trip as much as we did.Looking forward to traveling with you guys more.Rothin Shaw"

WanderOn,Harssh Prabu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A 'Hymn'achal New Year,"There are only so many New Years one comes across in his/her life. So you better spend it wisely. And this New Year, I put my my faith in WanderOn. I enrolled for the Kasol, Rudranag, Manali trip.From the time I landed in Delhi, the trip captains (Mirza, Nivedita and Ravi) were readily available and made the convening process simple. Shoutout to captain Nivedita, who helped me feel at home within few minutes with ease. It didn't take long before the 30 odd  trippers (from various parts of India and beyond!) started their journey together with one common goal in mind. On all the following days, I went back to sleep at night with a smile on my face; and that in itself was a quick indicator of how things were going. The properties in Kasol and Manali were excellent. The camp at Rudranag turned out to be one of a kind! How often do you dance beneath snowfall, and around bonfire at the same time, for hours together? At night, the sleep in the tent, after a hard day's trek, surrounded completely by snow, and listening to fresh snow hitting the top of your tent, is like none other. Couple that with a heavy snowfall-filled trek down from Rudranag, and you've got yourself a core memory created. It is a tough job to keep track of, and help, such a large number of people in such difficult terrains, but our captains Nivedita, Mirza, and Ravi did a fabulous job, all the while catering to the incessant photo requests of the excited trippers haha. We celebrated the New Year in Manali. The mood was such that folks from neighbouring hotels started grooving with us from their balconies haha. Everyone wished everyone. There were smiling faces everywhere. The tone was set for 2023.Overall, everyone felt comfortable enough to enjoy their days both as a group as well as an individual.

WanderOn,Diksha J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Good,"It was my first solo travelling experience, i was a little nervous while booking the ticket but now I truly cherish the beautiful experience WanderOn laid out for me. I along with a group of around 40 travelled to bir-billing, tirthan McLeod Ganj during NY. The hotels were very good, especially the camp. Our trip captains Rahul, Sana and Prashant were so professional in their planning and management. Kudos to them for making it so special for everyone! Just faced one problem on the last day as we were dropped too early before the reaching time in Delhi and we had to look for accommodation at 5am in the morning. Other than this it was an amazing experience. I definitely recommend WanderOn for all the travel gigs out there, especially for solo ones, just go for it, you will not regret it!!"

WanderOn,Lokesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Delightful,"I travelled to Kashmir on a new year's trip with WanderOn after an amazing experience in Ladakh in May, 22. WanderOn again gave me a phenomenal experience. Starting from the arrangements, to their plans to ensure safe and best experiences for the travellers, everything is managed flawlessly here. The co-traveller group is amazing. Even a solo traveller is made to feel inclusive and welcomed with such an ease. This trip was one of the most memorable one for me. Simply because of the harsh weather conditions and our captains quick plan of actions to continue to keep us safe and engaged. The continuing heads about the right places to buy souvenirs and dos and don'ts saved us a lot of effort and money. I cherish my friendships, the captains dedication, WanderOn's conviction to privide the best experience to its travelers. I will not think twice before booking my next travel Thank you much Team for everything üòÉüòÅü´†üòäüòáü•∞‚ùÑÔ∏è"
