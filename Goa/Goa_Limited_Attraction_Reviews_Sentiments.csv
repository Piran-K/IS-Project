Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Ria1104,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Couples,Best  Beach in Goa,"This might be the most scenic beach in Goa. Morning, afternoon, evening whenever you go here you will be mesmerized by its beauty.  Last time I visited this place on a day trip from Benaulim but could not get enough of the beach. So this time I decided to stay at least for a day here.The only con of this beach is that it is located far away from the main hub of Goa so it might take a long time to reach here. We started from Panaji at 4 and it was quite dark when we reached there. My boyfriend was very scared while driving in that dark but I won't say there was any safety issue. Still its better to reach here before dark if you are not sure about the direction. Our stay was just behind the Art Resort Cafe so we just walked over to the beach through the cafe everytime. I must say at night the beach looks magical. Though we dont see much clublife on the beach but the entire beach is set up with beautiful candle light dinner arrangements by the shack guys. There are beautiful cabanas also where you can sit and enjoy your drinks. Surprisingly the drinks here are super cheap compared to North Goa but just an advice....always check the menu before placing any order.The morning view of the beach was far more beautiful. It was much calm and peaceful. We rented a kayak and went deep inside the waters till an island called Monkey Island and spent quite some time relaxing in the waters. Best part of the beach was that it was mostly filled with foreigners and so I happily wore my bikini when I went for a swim without any awkward look from men. It was my birthday that day so my boyfriend arranged for a shack to beautifully decorate their cabana at some minimal charge and we had a wonderful time there cutting cake, enjoying our drinks and having a tasty dinner while enjoying some soul soothing music.It was honestly the best beach experience for me in Goa and even though I might get bored of Baga or Calangute one day I can never get bored of Palolem and would definitely go there again and again.I highly recommend you to visit this beach if you are in South Goa and its better if you can stay a night or two here (you will even find beach huts right on the beach). Do not miss out kayaking in the waters. Also it is one of the safest beach in Goa to go swimming. Other than this you can also try out the boat ride to Butterfly Beach if you are interested. Also if comfortable....ladies do put on your favourite swimwear here without fear. If you don't own one feel free to shop at the local stores.",0.999,5

We love the peace and quiet of Agonda beach but we wanted to mix it up a bit so came to Palolem for a livelier party atmosphere.  The place was heaving with both locals and tourists, roads filled with bustling stalls, music booming from a whole host of different bars.  We came during Holi so lots of people covered head to toe in colourful Gulal powders.  It was a true celebration of peace, love and boho hippy vibes. Palolem Beach is in the shape of an arc and is lined with a fabulous combination of coconut palms and rainbow coloured shacks.  The sea looked very inviting so after a couple of cocktails at a Cuba themed bar (in fact it could’ve actually been called Cuba) we had a swim.  It was nice to not have to deal with rough waves - Agonda and Cola are lovely beaches but I found the sea too choppy at both, so Palolem was a welcome change.  For lunch we ate at Dropadi Bar & Restaurant, where we ordered the crab soup amongst other dishes.  It was recommended to us by a Goan local and he was right - it was delicious.  I first heard of Palolem because of the Matt Damon movie The Bourne Supremacy, as the location was used for the opening of the film, so I’ve been wanting to visit for some years.

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Sumalee K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Something for everyone.,I was a little nervous about Palolem beach as everybody tells you something different. And now I can see why.I was lucky to be able to stay for a few days in Palolem. The south of the beach is very relaxed with many chilled beach shacks to hangout in and some good waves. The centre of the beach has many more tourists and those that love to be in a group. But the north end of the beach is like another place altogether.At the southern end the water is shallow for a long distance and this makes it perfect for kids to play in and there is also an amazing island just out to sea.

It's golden sands stretch for just over a mile.It is lined with bars, restaurants and holiday accommodations, primarily beach hut style. There was also a number of tattoo places and a few shops. We did visit a couple of the bars, a great place to sit with a cold drink and watch the sun set.We found the beach to be both safe and clean, with the beach cleaners very visible.It is a great place for walking, we did walk along the beach up towards Monkey Island, some great rock formations.Along the beach are places offering kayaks for hire and there are a plethora of colourful boats used for boat tours. There are no water sports like parasailing or jet skies on the beach.There are sunbeds and umbrellas along parts of the beach, these are for the shack, restaurant and hotel guests. There is plenty of room for visitors to spread out on towels and beach mats and enjoy the sunshine. There were a small number of beach sellers but in fairness they were no trouble.When we were here it was not overly busy so it was peaceful, can imagine getting very busy at times.There are Lifeguards on duty along the beach.",0.9582,5

This beach has no usual water sports but has activities like sea kayaking,  dolphin watching trips,  backwater trips, island  lunch experience, stand up paddle and unlimited space to play football and other sports. It has decent beach huts, shacks serving you good alcohol and food. This is a beach for people to spend some laid back time on beach and enjoy nature and goan culture. There are many centers offering yoga for short term as well as long term duration. There is music at night on beach but not very loud. On weekends there are places where you can dance your heart out.To reach this place, one can hire a cab from madgao station prepaid taxis costs 1100 rs and local cabs costs 1000. We chose to hire an auto rickshaw just to enjoy glimpses of local villages on our way to palolem, it was for 800RS. The other option is to catch a train from madgao to canaconna which is just 30 mins journey and then catch a vus or rickshaw to beach. There are many stay options at palolrm, even if you do not prebook your stay, you can find a good bargain for stay options right on beach.On weekend all the shacks served fresh grilled sea food of your choice turning the beach into good place to have sea food. The prices also went up for the services offered.Note - Carry cash with you as many small vendors do not accept any other form of payments, however  restaurants accepted credit cards and payments thru other wallets.Overall a beach for peace and nature lover to spend quality time on beach with nature.",0.9945,5

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Ria1104,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Couples,Best  Beach in Goa,"This might be the most scenic beach in Goa. Morning, afternoon, evening whenever you go here you will be mesmerized by its beauty.  Last time I visited this place on a day trip from Benaulim but could not get enough of the beach. So this time I decided to stay at least for a day here.The only con of this beach is that it is located far away from the main hub of Goa so it might take a long time to reach here. We started from Panaji at 4 and it was quite dark when we reached there. My boyfriend was very scared while driving in that dark but I won't say there was any safety issue. Still its better to reach here before dark if you are not sure about the direction. Our stay was just behind the Art Resort Cafe so we just walked over to the beach through the cafe everytime. I must say at night the beach looks magical. Though we dont see much clublife on the beach but the entire beach is set up with beautiful candle light dinner arrangements by the shack guys. There are beautiful cabanas also where you can sit and enjoy your drinks. Surprisingly the drinks here are super cheap compared to North Goa but just an advice....always check the menu before placing any order.The morning view of the beach was far more beautiful. It was much calm and peaceful. We rented a kayak and went deep inside the waters till an island called Monkey Island and spent quite some time relaxing in the waters. Best part of the beach was that it was mostly filled with foreigners and so I happily wore my bikini when I went for a swim without any awkward look from men. It was my birthday that day so my boyfriend arranged for a shack to beautifully decorate their cabana at some minimal charge and we had a wonderful time there cutting cake, enjoying our drinks and having a tasty dinner while enjoying some soul soothing music.It was honestly the best beach experience for me in Goa and even though I might get bored of Baga or Calangute one day I can never get bored of Palolem and would definitely go there again and again.I highly recommend you to visit this beach if you are in South Goa and its better if you can stay a night or two here (you will even find beach huts right on the beach). Do not miss out kayaking in the waters. Also it is one of the safest beach in Goa to go swimming. Other than this you can also try out the boat ride to Butterfly Beach if you are interested. Also if comfortable....ladies do put on your favourite swimwear here without fear. If you don't own one feel free to shop at the local stores.",0.999,5

We love the peace and quiet of Agonda beach but we wanted to mix it up a bit so came to Palolem for a livelier party atmosphere.  The place was heaving with both locals and tourists, roads filled with bustling stalls, music booming from a whole host of different bars.  We came during Holi so lots of people covered head to toe in colourful Gulal powders.  It was a true celebration of peace, love and boho hippy vibes. Palolem Beach is in the shape of an arc and is lined with a fabulous combination of coconut palms and rainbow coloured shacks.  The sea looked very inviting so after a couple of cocktails at a Cuba themed bar (in fact it could’ve actually been called Cuba) we had a swim.  It was nice to not have to deal with rough waves - Agonda and Cola are lovely beaches but I found the sea too choppy at both, so Palolem was a welcome change.  For lunch we ate at Dropadi Bar & Restaurant, where we ordered the crab soup amongst other dishes.  It was recommended to us by a Goan local and he was right - it was delicious.  I first heard of Palolem because of the Matt Damon movie The Bourne Supremacy, as the location was used for the opening of the film, so I’ve been wanting to visit for some years.

The centre of the beach has many more tourists and those that love to be in a group. But the north end of the beach is like another place altogether.At the southern end the water is shallow for a long distance and this makes it perfect for kids to play in and there is also an amazing island just out to sea.

This beach has no usual water sports but has activities like sea kayaking,  dolphin watching trips,  backwater trips, island  lunch experience, stand up paddle and unlimited space to play football and other sports. It has decent beach huts, shacks serving you good alcohol and food. This is a beach for people to spend some laid back time on beach and enjoy nature and goan culture. There are many centers offering yoga for short term as well as long term duration. There is music at night on beach but not very loud. On weekends there are places where you can dance your heart out.To reach this place, one can hire a cab from madgao station prepaid taxis costs 1100 rs and local cabs costs 1000. We chose to hire an auto rickshaw just to enjoy glimpses of local villages on our way to palolem, it was for 800RS. The other option is to catch a train from madgao to canaconna which is just 30 mins journey and then catch a vus or rickshaw to beach. There are many stay options at palolrm, even if you do not prebook your stay, you can find a good bargain for stay options right on beach.On weekend all the shacks served fresh grilled sea food of your choice turning the beach into good place to have sea food. The prices also went up for the services offered.Note - Carry cash with you as many small vendors do not accept any other form of payments, however  restaurants accepted credit cards and payments thru other wallets.Overall a beach for peace and nature lover to spend quality time on beach with nature.",0.9945,5

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,kcalpesh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,What's Happened to Baga?,I went to Baga with great expectations and my memories of 2014 visit to this place. In 2014 this place was awesome despite being very commercial. It had a great deal of charm. If I had rated Baga after my 2014 visit then I would have given it a good 5 stars full.Alas my last visit here in March 2019 was a terrible experience. People from all parts of the world had gathered. It was bad. The crowd had some really rowdy folks who think they are cool if they are in a big group. Lot of eve teasing and terrible behavior by some people.Food joints are overpriced and so are the water sports activities. There are limitations to how deep you can enter the water and a lot of littering of plastic and bottles and other stuff. I seriously felt like I should have never visited the beach and should have just cherished the memories of the previous visit all life.Big time that visitors understand the importance of keeping the beach and its vicinity clean. I think government should charge people for entering the beach and imply heavy fines on littering. Let everyone understand the value of these tourist-friendly places as soon as possible.,0.9678,5

The kish fish curry which I tasted in this beach was probably the best in Goa. Surprisingly food and liquor price at this beach was the least amongst all the beaches we went.

Nobody disturbed us and neither did we disturb anybody.In the daytime too there were some water activities like jet ski (I could not find parasailing or bumper ride here).

The beach itself was clean, gently shelving and the water was warm and clean. The only negative side still is, and was, the stray dogs. Far too many. Dog poo on the beach. Dogs fighting. Dogs begging for food at every shack. Once the season ends end of May, the shacks close and the dogs roam. The monsoon weather in June brings in an annual wash of oil, a result of tankers dumping the waste at sea and the tide pushing it up onto the beach. The high tides wash away the gentle sandy slopes and built up shack ""patio"" areas making it look so different during monsoon season.

Even small groups of walkers or runners seemed to have few difficulties.  Mosquito repellent was needed.

The Supermarket stocks most other necessities and close by are a chemist, the popular Hari’s German bakery/cafe, produce sellers, and a Kadar chicken shop.

The “basic” rooms are just that, and avoid rooms, 107 and 108 at all costs – maybe others as well. These rooms are next to the road, which is lit brightly, and there are no curtains to speak up, so if you are sensitive about light, sleep becomes very difficult. The rooms are Pokey and have very little furniture - though to be fair, they do have several electric points.

We went for surfing experience and were pleasantly surprised at all that agonda has to offer. Try the shops for some of the best wares knick knacks you may want to piick up, but please bargain, they are all over priced. Clothes, collectibles, shoes, bags, you name it, beautiful row lined shops with colourful display.The cottages lining the shore looked very inviting, and the foliage and the decor in some of the cottages were a must see.If you are a vegetarian or a vegan ZEST is a must try place, must try their smoothie bowls. Super efficient staff and lipsmacking food, the flavours just burst in your mouth.Parking if you are lucky you will get on the side of the road or in the Green valley resort ground.1 single line stretch from the main chowk on either side of the chowk and  you have seen it all.  The vast expanse of pristine blue water, the unending sky, the water sports, and the smooth as silk beaches will pull you back for more.Unlike other beaches this has a slight incline where you may sit with your legs dangling on the sand at a height and watch the Rock & the sunset. I call it the ""Pride Rock"" from Lion King.

Long and quite, its not crowded nor abandoned. Lots of cafes and lodges along the beach offer shady areas for food and drinks. Mostly foreigners and locals, haven't seen too many Indian tourists. From the left side the beach is limited with picturesque rock formations that is probably the major sight here. From the right there is the mouth of a small river and the locals offer Kerala-style boat trips for an hour or two. The area is quite green covered with coconut, cashew and mango trees, with lots of birds. A big  choice of lodging both on the beach and within a few minutes of walking from it on the hill. The markets are not so big and more expensive than those at Patnem or Palolem. Food is sort of touristic and not cheap (the average lunch bill is about 300-500 rupees per person), and its hard to find authentic local food. We enjoyed Mama's Kitchen most of all out of three or four places we got to try. As of things to do there's the surf school with rentals, dolphin watching boat trips, omnipresent yoga, auyrvedic massages. Beach dogs keep on watching their territories against other dogs and cows but are pretty friendly towards people, especially the tourists whom they surely distinguish from the locals. Most of the time the waves at the beach were big and great for surfing, but the last couple days they disappeared for the quite surface. Generally Agonda is said to have the growing popularity but so far it looks pretty exquisite and charming.",0.9924,5

What is worse is that this rule is new as my parents didn't have to follow this before.They offered scrafs to wrap around our legs but most of us refused as it is regression on equality, so we stood at the entrance and waited for those who were allowed in and the woman kicked us out.So very disappointed, Catholicism in most places if worship are not strict on dress rules, so to have acted in this way is embarrassing and shameful.

Varca_Beach-Varca_Salcette_South,Mihir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2020 • Friends,Best secluded white sand beach in Goa,"The reason I say best is coz in my numerous trips to Goa beaches right from Baga, Calagute, Candolim, Mandrem , Vagator, Morjim in North Goa to Canacona, Agonda, Palolem beaches in South, Varca turns out to be the best clean and free of public. And there is a simple reason for it...it just doesn't have enough hotels and shacks !I am not quite sure whether it's due to low awareness , popularity of dearth of budget hotels but maybe because if these reasons it's a place to be..The sands white, the beach quite broad for u to play, run, chill , sleep etc.. few shacks (must say most are not that good in food taste but it's the beach for which you go there ) and it's a long one.So if you wanna really rejuvenate, dont wanna see many faces and be by yourself then go to Varca..Best part about this beach is it's just 45 mins from the airport unlike other South Goa beaches. So you don't waste too much time traveling like in the case of far north (Mandrem,Morjim, Arambol) or far south ( Canacona, Agonda, Palolem)TIP : if you want a good meal (lunch/dinner) and don't wanna compromise on taste or quality then you can walk across to a hotel called Sterling Varca. That's the best in food and absolute bliss. It's just 500 mtrs from the entrance of Varca beach or just behind Zuri white Sands hotel.",0.9722,5

Some of these beaches are very crowded and some are not (especially during the peak/tourist season).Varca beach is one of the less crowded one even compared with Colva beach which is only about 10 km from Varca. If you are looking for a quiet beach with nice ambience to relax in Goa, then Varca beach is one of them. There is less activity here like Jet skiing, Para sailing etc. which is more evident in neighbouring Colva beach and other beaches, so there are less number of tourists/visitors here. For this reason perhaps there are less number of beach-side-food/drinks shacks & restaurants here too (compared to Colva and other beaches). You can hire beach-chairs which are mostly placed under beach-umbrellas and charged at hourly rates by the beach side restaurants/shacks. They also serve you cold Beer, drinks, food & snacks. (Some will offer you better rates/deal if you agree to also buy food, drinks from them -- it's negotiable).  Varca town itself which is about 3 km from the beach (and about 28 km from Dabolim international Airport) is quite a relaxed place to stay in Goa.

If you want a laid-back beach vibe, this is the place. Service is generally very good, though a bit slow, and prices very reasonable. Stay in a guest house just a short stroll from the beach to save money, and as always negotiate in the local shops where prices often start way higher than if you are prepared to walk away and get called back. Food quality is generally good, with most places offering a range of dishes from traditional curries to English style breakfasts etc. Beer and spirits are dirt cheap. Watersports are a notch higher in pricing than the rest - my advice is to push for extra time rather then lower prices and try them when they are less busy. Local sellers will try to flog cheap tat - be polite but firm if you want to be left alone, and don't be fooled by little their little pantomime acts to get your sympathy. Explore the town and try out cooking classes and yoga if you can find it (rare these days), but agree reasonable prices beforehand.

Calangute_Beach-Calangute_North,Raza,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Taken For A Ride,"I visited Calangute beach for the first time with my family on Jan 2, 2023. The beach is crowded. I saw a number of people standing on the edges of the beach waiting for their chance to get a water sports ride. On reaching Calangute beach, we were approached by a guy that we will get beach beds. We went with him, we didn't get it. We got beach chairs. Now here are some tips for you while visiting Calangute beach for the first time. 1. Look around, talk to 3-4 people before getting a beach chair. You won't get any beach bed. It's too crowded, all occupied. 2. Don't order any food on the beach except the most minimum priced non-alcoholic drink so that u can sit on a beach chair that some shack or restaurant has placed on the beach. Any food u order will b 5 times costly. If u r willing to pay that amount, u r free to do that. It's better u pack some snacks before coming to the beach to eat with ur ordered drinks. 3. Pls book your water sports rides before coming to this beach from established tour operators so that u pay acceptable amount n enjoy hassle-free rides. Otherwise there are many agents here who will take you for a ride - literally and figuratively. You will then end up paying 3-4 times the right price. 4. Enjoy the beach. Walk around. Watch people. Guess the number of states that people are coming from on this beach. 5. If you go for parasailing, check if other passengers with u stepping on the boat don't have alcohol or beer bottles in their hand. If u see that, make an excuse and get off that boat quickly. You don't want to see any drunken hassles n fights on the boat. ",0.9534,5

On our few trips here we tended to head for the Royal Shack... As you arrive at the main Calangute strip/rd, there are steps leading down to the beach... walk down the said steps and turn left, the forth beach shack along is the Royal shack with the flag of India flying above it... you can’t miss it!! The shack is run by a chap called Makan, a lovely friendly attentive fella that always made us feel so welcome👍🏼 He was constantly moving our umbrella throughout the day so we were always in the shade. Makan’s service of food and drink was excellent, 10 out of 10👍🏼😎👍🏼 bear in mind this is the busiest part of Calangute beach, possible busiest in North Goa so be prepared for an experience😂... for more relaxed options there are numerous other beaches in Goa, or just keep walking for around 500m or so on this beach and it’s a far quieter/chilled beach.

So we tried to stay as safe as possible. We had entered the beach from the entry near the Sinq Resort and this part had hardly any tourist around so we kind of had the entire beach for us. We ordered some snacks at a shack, kept our luggage there and took a quick dip. The best part of this beach I felt was the lack of crowd.....you can wear anything (even bikinis) and get zero stares from strangers.

The place is quite nice. Beaches are big and long with not many people on them. Sea is very warm. Price wise is rather cheap + there is a choice of places you can go and have some fun. Obviously most of them are far from being luxurious - but I don't think you go to GOA for luxury. Stayed in a place called Naga Cottage 30$/night - really not bad for this price.

Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,Raju Muthuswamy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Flat Ocean Floor!!!,"This was my first visit to this beach which is a haven for nesting Olive Ridley turtles.I was just exploring unknown beaches (not visited by me) and I reached this one!The beach is quite a big one.There are life guards at the beach (as are at most of the beaches frequented by tourists).The advantage of this beach is that the sea floor falls away from the beach very, very gently at a shallow angle (another example is the Colva beach in South Goa close to Margao/Madgaon city)This presents a beautiful opportunity for swimmers to wade in to the sea up to their waists and swim parallel to the beach. (Parallel and not into the sea or towards the beach which will be with or against the current - please read up on this technique before attempting it. I am not a good swimmer so I stick to the shallows and swim parallel to the beach).The sand is good. Not that bad. You will find some parts with dark sand, too! 😀.One factor to take into consideration is that there is a river meeting the sea at the southern end of this beach. So, the currents can be unpredictable. This meeting point between the river and the sea also sends the waves in a circular motion at the southern end wherein the waves hit the beach and turn north towards the beach proper and back west into the sea.So, in my opinion it is better to enjoy oneself in the centre of the beach rather than at the extreme southern end.The river that meets the sea at the southern end of the beach is the Chapora River.I found some toilets and baths which were under construction and not operational during this visit.The shacks on the beach have makeshift bathrooms, showers in the open to wash off the sand and toilets (portable toilet booths).As far as food is concerned, there are several shacks on the beach which serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes along with liqueur.Also, there a few handcarts/temporary food joints at the entrance to the beach which sell coconut water, chips, cold drinks and maggi ( our favourite from Ladakh to Morjim!)",0.9637,5

Deltin_Royale-Panjim_North,Raman,,,,"In my opinion ,any place can be good ,bad or average depending upon the personal choice. To me this place was disappointing on personal level. It may be good  from the perspective of unlimited food and drinks, but then if you think  of quality then it may be a complete waste of the time. Entertainment is average and  you have to make your way for getting the food or drinks. For the records we took vip ticketes and only difference was in terms of  entry level scotch, but then thinking rationally how much one can drink in such place. Casino was overcrowded like other places and if not your cup of tea like most of the  tourist then one will be roaming around the tabels. I would have definitely enjoyed more in my  twenties with offer of unlimited food , drinks  and entertainment with friends . Food can't be good or bed ,only thing whether you like it or not, I didn't.",0.9877,5

Deltin_Royale-Panjim_North,Monika Prasad,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,"Dirty, dingy and stinking casino, very expensive, service was not good","I went to this cruise along with my family, we were a group of 14 people including 5 kids . The place was really pathetic. The food was horrible, when we prebooked, they said the kids can play in the kids room while we could play at the casino, the kids room was a stinking small room with no activities for the kids. The live entertainment was crap. It was a shady place and I don’t recommend anyone going to place just to play at the casino. Also, for the price that they charge, this is is not even one tenth worth of the money you spend going to Deltin Royale. The team at Deltin Royale- I think you guys should spend some money and time on cleaning up the space, it was so stuffy.",-0.5095,1

With high-class dining, you also get to experience the enchanting nightlife. The gaming section includes American Roulette, Andar Bahar, Poker, Baccarat, Teen Patti and Sic Bo with the western impression. Enjoying the pleasure of gaming at this off-shore casino is one of the fun activities to do in Goa that offers dance, music, and DJ night as an add-on.Now come to the services: Very very poor show as compared to entry ticket. Very low quality food. Crowd mismanagement lead to huge rush on top deck for drinks etc. Appeared not suitable for family, but for bachelors, it may be ok.The two bands were good, but crowd was more interested in recovering their money than appreciating the band.Only plus can be for gamblers who like to spend mindlessly.Not worth it.!!Come to the Kids Police: If the child is 4 years old, then his ticket is not taken. But from 5 years old to 1500 will have to be paid. Which is absolutely a waste of money. At the same time, wherever he goes, he has no power. There is a play area for kids, the same has to be left for children up to 15 years with there moms. Or else the kids is allowed in the dining area, the kids are nowhere other than that. Will go with family or kids, read the policy when you plan. Because the staff there is very rude about kids. Only the first 15 kids will get the entry, first come and serve.",0.9525,5

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Naghee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Trip to Dudhsagar,"I am writing this review for parents who have small kids. i have travelled to Dudhsagar on 15th Jan,2023.  after visiting I realised, it's not a right time as the water flow was very less compared to season time, the waterfall will be continuous. The time taken from south goa to Dudhsagar is 2.5hrs, from there you will be travelling again for 45mins in Dudhsgar driver association SUV to reach the destination. I would advise to start at 6am to reach Dudhsagar from south goa to avoid the rush/queues, its full day trip. The Ticket counter opens at 8am- you pay 585.00rs per head, they give a paper with a WL-number and vehicle number on it. Kids below 4yrs free ( there is no one to check the kids age).  next to collect life jackets- 50rs per jacket. Driver assigned to you, will take you to Dudhsagar waterfalls which takes 45mins and drop you back in the same vehicle. The Road is pathetic, more pits than road because the roads will get damaged frequently due to waters. people with back pain good to avoid this trip. Total -276 vehicles are allowed per day, each vehicle will have 6 passengers. The drivers wont waste time your time, but once you enter the Dudhsagar water fall road, you will have to get vehicle entry done at forest department, you pay 100rs per head, kids below 4yrs-30rs. They will allow limited vehicles at once, so you will wait for your turn almost one hour at this point. One you reach Dudhsagar, you will be given 1.5hrs only. if you are late, then the drivers will ask extra money, you will have to walk to the waterfalls for almost 15mins. This is a big task, Parents and kids must be very careful, the way is full of big sharp rocks, unstable, slippery route, try to leave all the laguagge in the vehicle. On the way you have one changing room and toilets, depending on the crowd, you have to follow the queue. I visited the place around 1PM, its freaky crowded. no place to sit, can't take proper pics. swimmers will enjoy the place. hope this helps.",0.1168,4

But after reaching there , you get to know that you cannot trek without a guide . We were looking for guide and fortunately we met another group of friends like us and they already booked a guide.  price - Rs.850 per person.You get some small shops for breakfast nearby the entrance for jeep safari . Pack some food /snack and water as the trek is 13kms one way .Get some really grippy shoes as the trail is full of mud which is extremely slippery . We went during November and the day before there was little rain so it could be slippery but be prepared for it . Starting you need to pay 100rs/person for trekking apart from which we paid for guide as entrance Its all about the guide you get and the person was really amazing . he is experienced guy for 25 years and he walks on those trails like ice on cake where we were struggling to balance . After long trek , we reached the falls entrance in afternoon and he takes care of life jacket . You will be taken to a place where you will be allowed to swim for sometime ( luckily the guide was so polite for us and he takes care of everything ) .The experience of swimming in the high current of falls with view from bottom of falls was mind blowing . Then while returning we were so tired and half way through the guide arranged a jeep (2000 per jeep and we were 9 members). Note : Words from guide ""During monsoon , they won't let us swim in the place where we get to swim during our trip. As the current of water is extremely strong and you won't be able to go near by . The sound of falls is loud enough that you could listen away from 3kms """,0.9848,5

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Prakash S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Family,A Good experience away from the salty beaches of goa,"We visited the fall in the month of November 21. The Roads from western goa towards the fall are good. The drive from north or south goa wil take appx 1:30-2h. To visit the fall one has to reach near kullem railway station. There you will fin park & pay options for 100 rs.From kullem railway station to the waterfall personal vehicles are not allowed & one has to hire Dudhsagar fall association vehicle, which cost  3500rs per vehicle which can accommodate max 7 person.One has both options of booking either online or offline for the vehicle. Since the trail is through wildlife reserved area, only 240 vehicles of the association out of 430 registered  are allowed per day to enter the trail.So, if you are planning to visit in a weekend preferably book online from goa tourism site for your visit, else offline booking is also available till 1600 hrs, but for offline booking you will havve to wait in queue. Additionally if you don't wnt to spend 3500 per vehicle you can share with others which will cost you 500 per head. Other expenditures are rs 40 for life jacket & rs 100 per head for the forest entry fee.The drive from kullem railway station isof appx 45 min to the base of waterfall  & it's a complete off roading experience with 2-3 river crossings in between.You get 1.5h after deboarding to visît the fall & comeback, else you can pay additional 200-300 for some extra time.The walk from deboarding pt to the fall will take appx 7-10min. So, the total time from kullem railway station to the waterfall & back will take 3 hrs appx. It's preferable to visit in a weekday to avoid crowd at the waterfall & if visiting on a weekend, come early.",-0.2617,2
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Niks,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Family,Disappointed....,"I have been yearning to visit Dudhsagar for years now. This time finally I had baked it into my Goa plan and I was looking forward to this trip.I was planning to trek up to the waterfall (a 11km trek oneway). However was discouraged by one and all since I had a 10 year old. The main point which stuck was the humidity factor.Hence we finally decided to do the jeep Safari. As per the enquires we did, everyone mentioned that we should reach there before 8am and get a jeep ticket on the counter. We also checked for any online bookings but could not find any.Luckily, our driver showed us an SMS forward on online booking website (dudhsagarjeeps.com). Hence we registered paying Rs.10 per head for a 11am slot (earlier slots were fully booked). This website does not come up on the search engine(maybe because it is a new one).We reached the counter around 8 and we saw a sea of people jostling for jeep tickets. Forget social distancing (do we still fear Covid?) We were told to come back at 10.45am.Around 100-200 meters away from the maddening crowd, we found a Udipi pure veg hotel ( its more like a room in a house). It's a limited menu restaurant run by a couple. We were served fresh, hot and delicious Idlis. As we waited out there, we saw the idlis get over and the couple sweetly preparing upma and poha for the guests coming in. (Goes without saying that the guests would need to give them 10 mins to prepare the dish).We enquired about their lunch thali menu and gave them advance for lunch on our way back. And they did meet our expectation with the yummy thali.At 10ish, our driver called us asking us to get into the online que since there was chaos around. Finally at round 11.15am after all the effort on a humid day, we got a sharing jeep. (Every jeep is permitted to take 7 people.  Kids beyond the age of 4 need a ticket). Life jackets are mandatory and arranged by the jeep drivers.Overall the trip takes around 3 hours (45 minutes up-down and 1.5 hours in the waterfall). However the jeep drivers oblige if you pay them Rs.300 for an extra hour. This happened in our case since 4/5 car wanted to extend and others did not have a choice.(we were told so by the majority group and the drivers as well)From the parking the waterfall is around 1-1.5 kms through a rocky way. You can also see the trains cross the waterfall. I realized it might have been an easier option to take a train between the two stations. In the waterfall are most people stay on the sidelines since the water pond is cold, deep, rocky and slippery. There are makeshift toilets and changing rooms.My two cents if you are want to go -Book your slot online on dudhsagarjeeps.com (I could not find it in the Google searches.  Maybe it is a new process)Cost per person-Registration online -₹10Jeep cost -₹500Life jackets- ₹40Forest entry - ₹100Carry water bottles, snacks or food especially if you are traveling with kids. You don't get anything inside the jungle or near the waterfall. Some people do fill their water bottles and drink water in the waterfall. Though I understand it is flowing water hence naturallypurified. I still find it difficult to do it.There are makeshift toilets and changing rooms.  Dont kknow  how  clean  they are, but  do carry a set oof clothes and towels.If you oarevegetarian/jain or like vegetarian food, do try the Udupi homely food. It is near a parking lot 100-150 meters away from the counter.This would take an entire day unless it gets more organized.  Hence don't have anything else on the agenda for the day. We came across a lot of people turning back without visiting the falls because of lack of jeep tickets or other commitments (flights, had to reach another place etc)With the crowd and management by Goa tourism, would recommend giving it a miss.",0.9238,5

We will cross many streams on the way while inside the jeep.Due to lots of jeeps on the road, no parking was available and hence the driver dropped us off about 10mins away from the parking area.Once we get off the jeep, it once again took 30 mins each way to get to the actual waterfall itself.On the way to the waterfall, we need to cross multiple streams coming from the waterfall itself and some are deep and difficult for kids and elders to cross as its all rocky terrain.Not advisable for elderly folks. For kids, its manageable.Numerous folks lost their footwear while crossing the streams on foot, so carry your footwear in ur bag or covers separately while crossing the streams.Once we reach the waterfall, we will have a good view of the falls including the railway bridge. There is a pool of water at the bottom of the falls where people are swimming with their life jackets.overall it was a fun and adventurous trip. Plan atleast 6 hours for the whole trip from Panjim to Dudhsagar and back.And best if you reach early to avoid the crowds and traffic jams on the road to the falls.",0.6705,5

Nov-Dec (not so hot, will suggest trekking, less crowded).My mostly unplanned journey start from Pune by Indian railways to Belgaum, bike trip to Khanapur from Belgaum, rest and breakfast and travel by bike to Castle rock and then on goods train or by trail to Dudhsagar.The story: Was suggested to travel by train as it is the easiest and safe medium, we preferred to travel on a bike till Castle rock railway station and then boarded a goods train at 2:30 PM. reached Dudhsagar by 5 PM IST. Always plan your trip with water and food as this place does not have much in this regard. You will love the experience and place for sure.do visit to feel the experience as watching virtually does not help much. There is a trail to top and bottom of the fall, please explore. Leave before Dusk via any means for your safety. Once the darkness falls, there is hardly any option to relax as there will be no people around. Due to unplanned trip, we took it lightly. There was a time when everyone left and we were only remaining in the wonderful location. Place was so quiet, fresh breeze and away from city life. We enquired earlier about the last train which we have already missed as we reached late. There was no train during the night that will stop at this place. We either had option to walk till castle rock and that will take at least 3-4 hours on railway track but that was not feasible as the journey is all through jungle, other option was to walk till Sonalium railway station (not for passenger, only goods train stop in case of some technical help required) which is located 3 kms from Dudhsagar. We preferred the shortest route, by that time it was almost dark and nothing was visible from the railway track. Fortunately, we had out mobile flash light to move forward. It took us around 80-95 mins to reach Sonalium station. On the way walking we heard various sound of animals and that gave us Goosebumps and one scary feeling, this experience cannot be explained via words only. That was our hope to reach alive and without any faceoff with the jungle, fortunately there were some railway employee who suggested to wait for couple of hours to board another goods train (requesting the driver) that will drop us to Kulem station (towards Goa) from where we can get some passenger train to reach Castle rock. We finally reached castle rock station by 2 am and slept empty stomach in waiting room to wake up early, take the bike and leave for Belgaum. Over all journeys was more than adventurous due to unplanned trip. Writing this almost after 18 months, but having each and every experience alive and living at the moment. Next trip will be to reach the top from where the waterfall starts. Do comment your experience as well.",0.9493,5

It is amongst India's tallest waterfalls with a height of 310 m . It is also on the railway track of Konkan Railways and while on train you can watch the amazing nature passing by. We Recommend -  Monsoon sessions brings with it rains, beautiful waterfalls, greenery and adventure across the Western Ghats of India sub continent.  If you are in Mumbai, take a day train to Goa and enjoy not only this waterfall but many such nature created beauties on the way to Goa. You can also enjoy the scenes while on road and would like to keep coming back in this session. We have been there multiple times and just cant stop taking the train or on road trip next monsoons.Bollywood (Indian movie) – Chennai Express scene’s were shot with Dudhsagar waterfalls as background.

From Mollem, Official Management’s Jeeps take you to the fall on chargeable basis as Per Person Charges: Rs. 500 for Jeep Ticket + Rs. 80-100 Miscellaneous charges (for mandatory life jacket, Forest Entry, camera etc.) i.e. Rs. 600 per person.By Train: Strictly Suggested for Trekking enthusiasts only. There is no direct train for Waterfalls but nearest railways stations are Kulem & Castle Rock station from where one can trek to falls. People accompanied with families/aged persons may refrain from using this option.Best time to Visit:While Monsoon as the most amazing views, its also the most dangerous, hence anytime other than monsoons (between October to March) is best to visit •	Visiting the Dudhsagar waterfalls takes around the whole day. It takes one hour for Jeep to reach Falls (one side) from Mollem. Once you reach the destination, you are given 1.5 hours to enjoy at the waterfall before heading back to Mollem.•	Online Booking of Tickets for Dudhsagar Falls is now available. Checkout Goa Tourism website for details & avoid long queues during peak season.•	Do carry your swimsuits with you so as to enjoy the waterfall to the fullest while the Indian Railways whistles & crosses over the bridge right above your torso.•	Though food & water are very much available near the Jeep ticket counter however no such facility is available after that. So, make sure you don’t board the jeep with empty tummy. As for Toilets, yes, the portable types are there at one location after you reach the Falls but still, they are good for Nature’s short call only and hence tourists are advised to use washrooms near jeep ticket counters at Mollem.•	The ride on jeeps is also an adventure in itself and is somewhat bumpy, so people with back aches & those with infants need to be little careful.•	Beware of the monkeys at the entrance of falls (where the jeep will drop you). While they don’t seem to harm anyone but still as a precaution, take good care of your belongings especially food & spectacles.",0.9931,5

No health & safety ! ,"Dudhsagar falls is a full day affair from Goa.First thing to note is that tickets are sold over the counter and its a queue process. Ticket counter is run by women so women empowerment was food to see. Reached early by 8:00 and queued up . counter opens and we were allocated tickets. We took a full safari jeep. Jeep & jeep driver were allocated at ticket counter and jeep driver took us to jeep. We were then asked to rent out life jackets from adjoining counter, smooth process no issues. Jeep then took us to safari which essentially is a rough and bumpy ride through the wild.We approached entry gate of Reserve area and jeeps queued up for entry permit. We got down and clicked some pictures and flexed our muscles.After about 1 hour + driving .. Upon reaching parking lot of Dudhsagar falls, Jeep parked and we were on foot. A good 20 minutes trek to falls.The trek is honestly a health & safety hazard. I mean on the rocks near falls it is so slippery and risky that God only knows how people make it through. Anyways - good experience seeing the fall, would not say best/smooth experience and yet one thing ticked off the list during visit to Goa. ",0.8332,5

The walk up through the jungle is beautiful and gives views of the waterfall and surrounding area along with the wildlife. Lots if monkeys to be seen!Tou can hire your own driver and 4x4 for 3500 rupees or tou can opt to wait for other people. We waited for others and it took less than 5 minutes and cost us 550 rupees each. There is then a 50 rupee pp cost to get in the forest and 40 rupees pp for life jacket hire (mandatory). So all in about 650 covers you. You will  need ID or your taxis ID nber in order to go!The water is freezing but once your in it's a great way to enjoy the waterfall!",0.9543,5

It's the only day which train stops at Dudhsagar to drop the people. After the feast we went to Dudhsagar waterfall, which is totally astonishing, we can go on the top of the train bridge and top of the Waterfall where ( chennai express film was shoot) After visiting Waterfall we came home by train engine, my experience was amazing.

It is best to arrive when we did which is pre 10 am so that you get tickets and entry quick as lines can get busy and long waiting times for Jeeps. Overall it's an amazing place like the drive to the spot itself is a 20-minute jeep safari through mud and water. You can make a day out of it. Lots of time to take photos and enjoy the waterfalls.However...You would have thought that generating such income from tourists they would invest in better road structure. For example, if you had poor back posture or bone structure 9/10 you would get hurt in the Jeep trail as there is just bump after bump after bump. In addition to adding to the fact that the public toilets on the walk to the falls are disgusting beyond basic cleanliness. Everyone is given a life jacket to wear yet nobody follows the rules and simply swim without jackets and take photos in unsafe locations, we even witnessed a child wanting a photo and get swept away in the water because they did not abide by the rules. If you are a woman beware that if you're in a swimming costume the men will obviously stare but it gets to a point where it's uncomfortable and creepy.Overall a good day out but there are many issues with this overcrowded tourist spot with zero regulations enforced.",0.6705,5

There are cars which will take you there and for tickets for the cars you will need to stand in a long queue. Please carry cash with you because in our case, they did not accept credit cards or paytm. The queue was long. It took us one and a half hour. I ran hither thither in search of an atm and none of the atms worked. The people at the ticket counter are rude to the core. We had to wait for some friends of ours, but they did not even explain to us what and why we can’t wait. They just yelled at us and said, every car waits for just 5 minutes after you get the tickets and then you need to board the car immediately. The heat, the queue, the rude ticket counter folks were enough to make my mood off. Most of the cars were cars by mahendra. The last car to go the falls was at around 4 pm. So if you have to visit the place, try to reach as early as possible. We reached the place at around 12:30 pm and hence things were troublesome. After a long, tiresome wait, we finally git a car. One car carries 7 people.The ride to the falls was merry. The cars drive through rough terrain and tiny streams. Then they drop you and you need to walk on a stony path with tiny streams and bridges to reach the falls. From the parking, it is around 20 minutes walk to the falls. Ensure you wear proper footwear which are not slippery and can be drenched in water. The cars wait for you while you can spend around 1 hour approx in the falls or maybe 45 mins. I forgot the exact time. Then they bring you back. The waterfalls is certainly beautiful. You can get drenched and play in the water, however, be careful. The path is full of stones and if you are not comfortable walking in such stony slippery paths then this is not the place for you.

U can hire jeep in 3500 bucks if u need personal space or comfort. Other ₹90 would be charged for life jacket & forest entry fees. U can pay only for life jacket for kids around 3 yrs(if they luv water sports). Ride in jeep is bumpy and is for around 1 hr. U will get 1hr 30 mins after getting off from Jeepto enjoy falls. Go straight to main waterfall point as u wud be tempted for selfies and all in path. Nice cool water falling straight from rocks makes a nice swimming pool alongwith beautiful fishes. Lifejackets makes swimming easy and effortless. Try to get fruits, eatables with u, as everything is overpriced near ticket counter. For lunch Rushita homemade food restaurant near Church is best option if u wanna try goan delicacies made by mother alikes (they made Veg food on request for us also).

We thought this was a good thing they were doing for the environment. We got to the falls and had a 20 minute walk to get to the bottom of them up and over big rocks not safe a tall when we got there our guide said you must come swim we politely declined and I said to my girlfriend I’m not getting in that pool of p#€s. There were hundreds of people there we decided to move away from the main septic tank area and move back up the path to the septic tank run of and dipped our feet in the p#€s running of I wasn’t to concerned as the waster was cold and couldn’t feel any hot p#€s. The place was full of rubbish plastic bottles and worst of all people were taking nappies of kids and just leaving them lying beside them while they took photos of themselves smiling and bathing in p#€s most with all there clothes on there was also a nappy nest in between 2 rocks in a small dried up pool where people had thought this must be the nappy bucket. People would just have a sh#te where they were and cover it up with a piece of newspaper. So if you like septic tanks and like bathing in them don’t let me put you of.

The bumpy dirt track was basically a traffic jam with absolutely no chance of seeing any wildlife. No stopping was allowed for photos, our 'guide' helfully pointed to  a ""river"" and ""train"" and when i asked a question about wildlife said it was too noisy to talk. He still demanded a trip and despite a reasonable one given gave us a scowl and no thanks. Upon arrival we had to clamber on loose rocks with crowds of people to the waterfall. Many people were slipping, it is extremely dangerous. At the waterfall, which to be honest is not particularly beautiful with a dirty old railway bridge crossing in front of it, we were amongst hundreds of people jostling for a place to swim. I recognise that different cultures look at the environment in different ways which may explain so many positive reviews. I was appalled....dirty nappies, plastic bottles, rubbish and even human excrement...nothing would have got me in that water. Shamefull abuse of the environment. If you value cleanliness and appreciate nature ease don't waste your day visiting this rubbish dump and insult to the environment. To make matters worse we were offered an elephant ride near by.

A must place for visit. I visited on 25th Nov. 2019. Reach Kulem (Collem) in Goa by road or train as per your convenience. 1)	Train Options:Two trains from Pune to Kulem. Goa Express (Daily) & Poorna Express (Weekly on each Saturday).Goa Express starts from Pune at 4.35 pm & reaches Kulem at 4.35 am  (12 hours journey).Poorna Express starts from Pune at 9.55 pm & reaches Kulem at 11.05 am (13 hours journey).2)	Road Option:Pune to Kolhapur to Belgaum to Khanapur to Mollem to Kulem – 425 km. Shortest route.If you are using this road option, then please read very important instructions in the serial 2 paragraph under alphabet O below for route after Khanapur that goes thru forest. Jeeps are the only mode of transport at Kulem to travel to Dudhsagar Waterfall. Dudhsagar Tour Operators Association (DTOA) office is at 300 meter from Kulem railway station as well as bus stand. Walk of 3 to 5 minutes. I have attached photo of DTOA.Ample parking space near to DTOA office.Specific Helpful Information & Tips Are Given Below:If you plan to take bath under waterfall or swim in water, then please wear short & banian type T shirt or swimming costume and arrive at DTOA counter. Also carry towel & extra pair of clothes. A)	DTOA Season:  		Open: October to May.		Closed: June to September. There are trek agencies in Pune who organizes Dudhsagar tour during June to September. B)	Dudhsagar Tour Timings Thru DTOA:	8 am to 4 pmC)	Various Fares:1)	Rs. 500	Jeep fare per head for all aged 4 years & above 2)	Rs. 40 	Life jacket rent per head. Life jacket to be returned after the tour.3)	Rs. 50 	Forest entry fee per head. Rs. 10 	Forest entry fee for students with valid school ID card.Additional fee may be charged by forest entry post for camera. Mobile phone camera is free.NB: Online booking system is also available. You will receive sms & email confirmation of your booking. I have attached photo of the rules & regulations board at the DTOA office. Do have a look at it. It also contains the website address for online booking. NB: Even if you have online booking confirmation, you still have to be in the queue as each & every visitor is allowed to board jeep in a sequence thru queue. D)	Booking System:DTOA counter opens at 8 am. Surprising Sight: 	Visitors in queue from 6.30 or 7 or 7.30 am. Online booking visitors has to produce original sms or email confirmation.Only one person from the group has to be in the queue with valid photo ID card.Pay the jeep fare for all your members. DTOA staff will confirm your readiness to proceed immediately. Upon your confirmation, the staff will impart instructions related to tour. Only 7 visitors are allowed per jeep so staff will make the permutation & combination of 7 members from the visitors for each jeep.  Then the jeep driver will be called who will take you to the life jacket counter adjacent to DTOA counter. Pay the required money & take life jackets. It is a normal trend in India, for long queue only one counter will be there & not multiple counters. So standing in long queue will become a frustrating process during rush hours.NB: 1)	There is a sitting arrangement for ladies & kids next to the DTOA counter. Photo is attached.2)	There is a paid toilet facility not maintained well. Photo is attached.3)	There are small food snacks centers.4)	Very important thing: If you travel between 8 to 9 am, you save time. Otherwise once the Dudhsagar Waterfall parking area gets full then the jeeps are parked on the side of the narrow road for more than a half or one kilometer or more. In that case any jeep coming to Dudhsagar Waterfall doesn’t travel up to Dudhsagar Waterfall parking area instead it is parked after the last jeep on the side of road. From that point you have to start walking. So, you will lose more time to walk up to the Dudhsagar Waterfall. E)	Jeep System (More than 300 jeeps are there only for Dudhsagar Tour)Follow the driver to the jeep. One member will sit on the front seat next to driver, three members on the middle seat & three members on the rear seat.F)	Jeep Journey From Kulem (Collem) To Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area – 10 kmIt is 35 to 45 minutes very very very bumpy jeep ride thru an uneven graded narrow road with potholes as well as passing thru knee height water at 3 to 4 locations. Forest entry post is there at couple of minutes’ drive.  Pay the forest entry fee.PS: If you have mineral water bottle, show it at the forest entry post. Jeep driver will ask you on it. The forest entry post staff will write a number on the bottle with marker. The same bottle you have to show it on return. If you don’t show then fine of Rs.200. This practice is to keep control on use & throw type plastic water bottle pollution at Dudhsagar Waterfall.  G)	Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking AreaOn reaching Dudhsagar Waterfall parking area. You will find following things:1)	Washroom on the left2)	View point in front (Climb up to see the Dudhsagar Waterfall) – Photo is attached.3)	Change room box on left of view point – Photo is attachedH)	Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area To Dudhsagar WaterfallIt is a 15 minutes easy trek. Before starting the trek, note down the jeep number as you have to travel back by same jeep. The trek starts from right side descending road adjacent to view point. On route there are two more portable toilets not maintained well at some distance. Photo is attached.I)	Dudhsagar WaterfallTotal 90 minutes are allotted for visitors to spend & enjoy at Dudhsagar waterfall. It includes 15 minutes trek from Dudhsagar waterfall parking area to Dudhsagar waterfall & also includes 15 minutes return trek. So eventually, only 60 minutes to spend at actual Dudhsagar waterfall.J)	Dudhsagar Waterfall To Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking AreaOn returning to Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area, get into same jeep to travel back to Kulem (Collem). K)	Photos:  There are following locations for taking photos:1)	From view point at Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area2)	Dudhsagar waterfall parking area to Dudhsagar waterfall route3)	At Dudhsagar WaterfallPhotos attached in this review are tagged & described in an easy to understand way.L)	Restaurants At Kulem & Mollem:1)	A garden restaurant is located at only 15 meter distance from DTOA counter, opposite visitors car parking gate. Unlimited veg non veg buffet facility as well as ala carte. I have attached photo of it.Buffet cost is Rs. 250. If you have stayed at Jungle Book a night before or still occupying the room then Buffet cost for you will be Rs.200. 2)	The next best restaurant is at Dudhsagar Spa Resort in Mollem at 7 km from Kulem. It is after crossing Mollem on Arnod route. There is unlimited veg non veg buffet facility as well as ala carte. Buffet cost is Rs.350.3)	Parvati hotel at Mollem also has restaurant. 4)	There are few small ordinary restaurants in Kulem & Mollem.At night after 9 pm, Mollem is the place with options for food than Kulem.M)	Hotels For Accommodation At Kulem & Mollem:1)	Jungle Book is the best accommodation at Kulem. Very unique first of its kind construction. Has 70 rooms. We stayed at Jungle Book, the room rent was Rs.1500. It is a very very peaceful place near to river.2)	Room rent at Dudhsagar Spa Resort was also 1500. I didn’t like the room layout – open bathroom & toilet in the one room hall with wall partition of 7 feet height in between & open from top & front side. There were curtain for bathroom & toilet in place of door in front. Very strange system I saw for first time in my life. 3)	Roshan Hotel on Kulem to Mollem route is Rs.1500. Rooms were average.4)	Parvati Hotel at Mollem will be in the range of Rs.800 to 1000, I guess. Couldn’t get a chance to see room as staff was not there.NB: The moment you start leaving the hotel they show willingness to reduce price. I experienced this at above hotels as well as other hotels in Goa. Means, you can negotiate.N)	Car Parking At Kulem (Collem):It is available at 20 meter distance from DTOA. I didn’t see any body collecting parking fee during my visit. It is opposite garden restaurant gate or Jungle Book entry gate. Means, car parking is between the gate of garden restaurant on one side & the gate of Jungle Book on the other side.Photo of parking area is attached. O)	Brief Summary Of Our Dudhsagar Tour By Car:1)	Pune to Kulem Journey By Road Via KhanapurWe started at 9.00 am on 24th Nov 2019 from Pune Bibvewadi using Pune to Kolhapur to Belgaum to Khanapur to Mollem to Kulem route. Reached Khanapur at 6.30 pm. It was already dark.Four toll post in Maharashtra from Pune to Kolhapur. One toll post in Karnataka from Kolhapur to Belgaum. We had breakfast in Maharashtra & lunch in Karnataka. On road there are plenty of good restaurant options for food.2)	 Very Important Information On Route After Khanapur To Mollem.I cross checked with one of the shop owner for route from Khanapur to Dudhsagar (Kulem). It was with shock I got to know from the shop owner that there are two forest check toll post on Khanapur to Kulem route & they don't allow any vehicle to pass through after 6 pm as it is a route thru dense forest. I asked for alternative route or solution on it, to which he gave following options:i) Spent night at Khanapur & proceed early morning as per your planned route ORii) Go via Castle Rock, the distance will be more than 30 km ORiii) If you wish to travel now itself as per your planned route & thru the two forest check post then take a chance & follow these instructions:First forest check post is at couple of minutes drive. If they stop, tell them you are going to Hemmadaga. If they don't allow, then return back & decide on above 2 options. If they allow then proceed & there is high probability that second forest check post will also allow.Second forest check post is at little more distance not much.If they stop, tell them you are going to Paali. If they allow, then you are thru to Kulem.We prepared for the forest check post tests as advised by the Khanapur shop owner & started our journey in dark thru the dense forest with narrow road.On route we were in dilemma if the check post asks further questions on Hemmadaga or Paali then what should we answer. We were totally unprepared for it. On reaching first forest check post, we told we are going to Hemmadaga & he allowed us.On reaching second forest check post, we told we are going to Paali. The staff on duty asked for the identity card & car registration number. He entered it in his register & allowed us.NB: If you are planning by car thru the route we followed & if you have girls & womens from your family then try to reach 1st forest check post before 5.30 pm. Road thru the dense forest feels like isolated road with hardly any vehicles that will make a bit scary experience for them. If you reach after 6 pm, then use the Hemmadaga & Paali formula.The best things:The formula of Hemmadaga & Paali worked wonder for us.Narrow road thru dense forest was in a good condition.Google map was working in offline mode on forest route without network connection.Google map did showed & guided us accurately from Pune Bibvewadi to Kulem.We used to cross check with the locals when required to ensure we were on the right route.3)	Mollem to Kulem:After crossing the forest route passing thru Hemmadaga & Anmod, we reached Mollem a small village at 8.30 pm.Dudhsagar Spa Resort is located on left side of road 500 meters before Mollem. We came back to this resort from Mollem to have dinner.After dinner proceeded to Kulem via Mollem.There is a petrol pump on left side at Mollem junction. Took left turn after petrol pump & proceeded straight to Kulem. It is at 6 km from Mollem junction.Took room in Jungle Book at Kulem for night stay.4)	Dudhsagar Tour On 25th Nov 2019Went to DTOA counter at 7.30 am. We were surprised to see visitors already in queue. Our turn came at 8.30 am. Completed the required payment formalities of jeep travel & life jacket. Following was our total itinerary of Dudhsagar Tour:8.45 am to 9.15 am: 	Travel by jeep from DTOA at Kulem to Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area9.15 am to 9.30 am: 	Walk from Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area to Dudhsagar Waterfall9.30 am to 10.30 am: 	Spent time & enjoyed at Dudhsagar Waterfall10.30 am to 10.45 am:	Walk from Dudhsagar Waterfall to Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area10.45 am to 11.45 am: 	Travel by jeep from Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area to DTOA at Kulem12.30 pm to 1 pm:	We had buffet lunch at garden restaurant opposite car parking areaAfter lunch, we proceeded to Mangeshi Temple & Shanti Durga Temple in Goa.P)	Nearby Places To See:Tambdi Surla Mahadev temple at Surla is a picturesque green spot to be visited.

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Steve,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Well worth seeing if you are fit and healthy,"I visited on the 11th November 2019 as part of a tour arranged through Tui.Okay, first things first! If you have back or neck problems, aren't particularly mobile or suffer from motion sickness then this tour definitely isn't for you. That's because to get to the falls you are driven over some extremely rough terrain. You get thrown around the jeep, sometimes quite badly when you hit potholes. At the end of the journey to the falls you then have to walk over some more challenging terrain, clambering over rocks and through small streams. However, the end result is breathtaking!You begin the adventure in a small town (the name of which I can't remember). There you have to wait until a four wheeled drive jeep to become available and it's your turn. Beware: this can take over two hours in the blazing sun before your number is called! Even as part of an organised trip I had to wait over an hour.Once in your jeep you join a convoy into the park itself. As I've written above, the journey to the falls isn't for the faint hearted, so beware! Along the way, though, you get to see monkeys (you are encouraged not to buy bananas for the monkeys) and some spectacular views. You ford rivers and streams, so keep your belongs in your lap if you don't want them to get wet.The falls themselves are very beautiful but very crowded. Note: you won't be allowed into the falls area unless you are wearing a life preserver, which your driver will give you. That said, I saw lots of people simply take them off before they went to swim.So if you are fit and mobile and don't mind queuing in the sun then I'd definitely recommend adding this to your itinerary.",0.929,5
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Richa G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Beautiful...in love with the place.,I visited this place in mid November. I mentioned the month as it is the most convenient time to visit the Falls. We got to the waterfall road by rented car after a long drive of 2 hrs.from north Goa. There they have parking facility. We parked our car at a parking cost of RS.100/- . From there we bought tickets of Bolero Safari. The Safari takes you to inside the forest in 45 min. After a 15 min tracking you get to the waterfall. It was just Amazing and worth visiting. They allow you to have bath in the fall and lake within it. Enjoyable place for kids too. ,0.8591,5

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Martin_K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Good but busy ,"We booked through our tour operator and to be honest I would recommend that to everyone. You'll pay a bit more for it but there's no waiting for jeeps and no extra charges for life jackets etc. Be warned there is 20inr charge if you take a DSLR camera. It's an early start from your hotel but with a good guide they'll make the time pass. We had a short walk to change from coach to the jeep which was already waiting with the driver.  The jeep ride can very bumpy and I wouldn't recommend this trip to anyone with back or neck problems. The drive takes about 45 mins and theres is a bit of trekking to the waterfall itself. I'd recommend you have shoes for this as I saw people in flip flops struggling & even our guide had shoes on and he'd done it countless times. The waterfall basin edge is not that big, and is blocked by the selfie crowd who do not go in the water. You just have to push through. The water is cold but not freezing and the fish are mostly at the edge but move out of the way quickly. Getting in and out is difficult because of the crowds and slippery rocks. The waterfall itself is very pretty and if you haven't seen any or many then I can see why people rave about it, but if you're a traveller and have seen others then you may be a bit underwhelmed although theres not many you can swim in. Also forgot tot mention there is no toilet or changing room at the falls, and I didn't check but the toilet at the base are basic at best. Overall it's worth the trip but try and get there early as possible. ",-0.1447,3

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Themapwalaguy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Dudhsagar waterfalls,"3rd Oct 2019 I was having pleasant sleep in the hostel which i booked and the hostel inmates who beacme very good friend of mine came early in the morning to wake me up saying that ""hey lets go to Dudhsagar waaterfalls"".I gave them a cunning laugh and told them how it was very difficult to reach the place and its not a peice of cake to go there.a few weeks before this incident i already tried to go to the place but could only reach the base of the mountains as there were no jeeps or vehicles at that time of the day.so i actually made fun of these guys saying that no i wont come and you guys dont go as its difficult to reach.eventually i convinced myself to go along with them and then the journey began.i already knew that the base village or the railway station at the base was more than 90kilometres away.Dudhsagar waterfalls is almost 90kms from any beach in Goa as it is in the east end of Goa. One can either hire a cab to reach Kulem Village or just Rent a self Drive Vehicle.The Road is very beautifull to reach Kulem as it is filled with green tree covered roads and many backwater bridges as well as some valley roads.We were 10 people from the hostel and we went on rented scooters.We had local guy with us who was helping us in this journey as he had been there before.Two english girls,one danish woman and one Dutch guy who accompanied us i this tour.It was a good time driving to the place after a lot of heat and sun burn.Whenwe finally reached Kulem Railway station we came to know that the No vehicles go to the top area after 1:00 pm. We were helpless so we decided to take a trek route to the top.The total way hike is almost of 3 hours,which consist of 45 mins walk on the railway tracks and the remaining is the pure jungle walk.The way up is really beautiful but also tiring.The actual Waterfalls is very difficult to reach as it has some dangerous water crossings and the water level rises quickly as the river has huge stones which become slippery to walk on at some places.It is best to take a tour guide as the jungle walk is really confusing and there is place at Kulem railway station which has facilites to buy tickets and hire professional tour guides so that the locals dont scam you which is pretty common in Goa.I myself have bit of a water phobia myself so crossing the heavily flowing was also a task for me,we finally reached the place and wow what a magnificient look of nature,we took some skinny dips in the pond right beneath the waterfall.we couldnt stay for long as the rain came and the river water level can rise in seconds and its not safe to be there and also it was late in the evening and was already getting dark.i am glad that we didint come down all the way walking cause we would just be crawling after the hike.so what we did was we instead came down to a railway station which is start of a mid point of the trek and boarded and illiegal freight train.its dark in the middle of the night we are all dirty and sweaty and tired and hungry abd there we are in the middle of nowhere waiting for a train to come sitting on the tracks.it was afun experience actually and lot of adrenaline rush.Then we finally reached the base and then i remembered that i again have to drive home on a scooter in this chilling wheather and i was all drenched in the water even my shirt hadnt dried up.eventually i managed to drive home safely and then we all miss that day so much that people from differnt countries who didnt know each other in the beginning are now best of friends talk to each other daily like a familySome tips and Suggestion to Go to Dudhsagar waterfalls and get back ina day1.The place is almost 90kms away from City centre or Panjim city which is the capital of goa2.Try to hire a car and go cause you might get really tired when going for the trek and the returning home is also a big task.3.If you dont want to take the hike and walk all the way to the top the just reach the place befor 1:00 so that you can get a jeep all the way up to the falls area.4.Hire a good tour guide who can be helpful at all times you dont know what might go wrong.5.Go to the ticket counter of the spot and take a complete package which includes life jackets as well as the tour guide.6.Carry enough food and water or snacks as well as an extra pair of clothes for the swim.7.Make sure you are not bitten by any leech or mosquitos,due to the density of the huge forest there are various insects and animals.",0.9958,5

On the day of rush or weekends , if one is reaching around 9am, then one will be able to get the ticket around 2 pm. During all this waiting time , there are paid toilets available but these are in very poor condition.Fun starts once you get your tickets , a total of 7 persons go in one car or jeep to falls, these are government approved cars or jeep which goes for falls. Ticket price is 500 Rupees and 40 rupees for Life Jackets. 30 Rupees is being charged at the entrance of Jungle by government officials.One way journey is 45 mins , one can stay in falls for 1 and half an hour and afterwards again 45 mins back journey.The ride to falls is very bumpy and enjoyable. Falls view is really spectacular, one can enjoy natural beauty , water is very pure . One can enjoy bathing under falls !!Take some eatable and clothes with you if you want to take dip in falls, there are monkeys at falls entrance so keep your eatables safe in the bag from monkeys .

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Kostubh Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"Beautiful fall, Adventurous ride, Jump in the water, Great experience, Must visit place","I visited Dudhsagar during October time along with my wide, 8 years old son and one more similar family. Started my travel from Bangalore on a Friday evening, took a night stay break at Davangere, started early at 6AM from there and reached at the parking / taxi stand by 11:30AM. Roads were good except a 17 kms bad patch.Hired a Jeep (Authorized only are allowed) in approx. Rs. 3000. Jeep ride was hilarious and bumpy. It takes you though muddy roads and crosses apprx. 1 foot deep river. It was an amazing experience. IT took around 1 hr for us to reach at the drop point from where we need to trek a bit to reach at the water fall.Life jackets and guards are available around the fall so that you can jump in to the v. refreshing water. Got to be careful about the current of water which may pull you towards the stream. Even kids can jump in using the life jackets. You can also go directly under the water and can stand on the stones around there.Note: There are no bathrooms to change cloths.During October time, the fall was not at its best but still decent amount of water was there.Check when is it open as it gets closed during the rainy season.I guess, visiting this place just post rainy season would be the best.As far as I know, there are no official trekking around this fall. People go to the bridge by hiring some locals but I did not take that chance with family. You may explore that.There is no official stop of the train which passes by this bridge. You need to track  on your own or take local scooter riders help. They are not authorized so just be careful.There are no shops post taxi stand.Note: Do not eat much before you start your jeep ride. Carry water.Overall: Great experience.",-0.4203,2

We met up at kulem station, our trains though coming from different directions, reached kulem at almost the same time. We had checked into dudhsagar resort and quickly readied ourself for the trek. Our guide Anwar met with us at the kulem station and we began our walk. The first four kms was on the track and then into the pristine mollem sanctuary, onto the Jeep road through the jungle. This was about 6 .5 kms and then through streams and rivulets of dudhsagar falls. On our return we headed to Sonaulim station and sat on the tracks for some engine or train to take us across to kulem.Riding onto the engine was another experience altogether. The engine driver stopped a km away from kulem and we walked to the station jeep parking. In all we walked 17 kms, with breathtaking views and beautiful thick forest. Carrying food was a wise thing because there was nothing available on this quiet road in the forest. It was an immensely gratifying trip",0.9601,5

You can search for trains between stations using NTES website or app & book tickets on IRCTC website or app. Braganza Ghats are a stretch of hill section at the Goa – Karnataka border-This 26 km ghat section rail road connects coastal Goa to the hinterlands of Karnataka and other parts. The 26 km Braganza Ghat section starts from Castle rock in Karnataka and ends up at Kulem in Goa. Prior to the Konkan Railways this was the only way one could have reached Goa via rail.Both the uphill as well as the downhill trains have commercial halts at Castle Rock and Kulem which also serve as the stations for attachment and detachment of brakes. But, the trains do not have commercial halts at the three en route stations- Caranzol, Doodhsagar and Sonaulim.While descending the ghats, a train - whether passenger or freight - has to stop at all the 3 stations for mandatory brake tests; whereas, the uphill trains are not required to halt unless there is a crossing. .The Braganza Ghat Section is one of the toughest ghat sections in Indian Railways.

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,danish a,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Amazing experience... Must visit..,One of the best unexplored place in Goa. Amazing Jeep ride in the lap of nature and the waterfall will mesmerize you with it's beauty. Safe to swim there but life jacket is a must. Only demerit that no changing rooms are there. So if u need to swim prepare itself accordingly.Jeep ride a little bit bumpy but amazing views. I went there with my wife and children. They were 7 and 3 years old. We all had a fun time and a great experience. Women may face problem in swimming as no changing rooms are there.Jeep ride will cost you 500 rs per person and 40rs for life jacket and 50rs for forest entrance fee. Once u reach the waterfall point you will get approx one and a half hour which is lesser time according to swim as I enjoyed swimming there. If u delay in coming u have to pay more as instructed by driver.Fall usually gets closed during monsoon. So kindly check before going there.Don't go there with unauthorized people. Take only Jeep ride which is authorised by govt. It's very safe. Do take water bottles and some snacks along with you as  you will not get anything at the waterfall point. Save your snacks from the monkeys.Have fun. It's A must visit place,0.9894,5

The picked us up at 6.40 from the road 5minutes walk from our hotel, in an A/C bus. The journey to Mahaveer National Park was for 2hours through a beautiful country side. We stopped at Basilica Bom Jesus for 20minutes though and then for breakfast again for half an hour.From Mollem we were transferred to the waterfall in a jeep. The ride was horrible for people sitting at the back as my husband had to endure. But it was pretty scenic. The jeeps drop you at a point 15-20 mins away from the main waterfall and you have to traverse that part on foot. The walk was pretty adventurous as the part near the main plunge pool was rocky. The only problem was that there were no changing rooms and it was difficult for women. The water fall has two Rapids as well and many who cannot make it to the main plunge pool were enjoying there. The main plunge pool has alot of fish and they bite.The main problem was the crowd. They were too rowdy and ill mannered. If I take that out then I would have given Dudhsagar a 5star.",0.0516,3

The walk through the forest towards the waterfalls is great with plenty of interactions from the monkeys who will take food from your hand. When you reach the waterfall you are supposed to wear a life jacket whilst swimming, I didn't and nothing was said, although this is mainly directed towards the locals who are not great swimmers. A refreshing dip is most welcome in the heat and don't get alarmed with the big fish that are in the pool. The only disappointment is the ride up, crammed into a four wheel drive with little opportunity to see the views, an open top vehicle would be much better.",0.9717,5

Second way is Railway track from Kolam to Dudhsagar Junction where you will enjoy the scenic beauty arounds and experience the trekking of 15 Kms one way, for which you have to plan accordingly and start early morning from Kolam to reach your destination on time.

You are equipped with a life jacket. it takes about 15 minutes to trek to the waterfall. Please wear good shoes to ensure you don't slip. Do take a swimming costume unless you want to swim in your existing clothes and then change in a fresh pair. After the 15 minute walk, you reach the waterfall and you can swim if you like.

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Carl B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Not worth the drama,"First off, we visited in March which is at the end of the dry season so our expectations were low with regards to water flow. In all fairness, the waterfall was nice and the water flow was still quite impressive.That’s where the good news ends. This three hour trip was a mini test of character. In short, it was painful. We took a taxi as part of a private trip. Upon arrival we were to wait in line to get our tickets for the 4x4 trip to the waterfall. We then had to join a different que to get out compulsory life jacket (we later found out they were far from compulsory). After a very confusing and disorganised wait for our 4x4 (we had to wait for other groups to fill it) we were on our way. The trip takes abou5 40 minutes and it’s rough as hell. Not fun.We finally made it to the falls along with half of India and a third of Russia and every selfie stick ever manufactured. It was so packed and the swimming area isn’t exactly huge. We were told that we had 90 minutes there and to be back at the vehicle by 12:15 for the delightful return trip. We, no surprise, but one of the couples was late. We would have had to wait regardless for our 4x4 was blocked in by the other 50 or so parked up there.The return trip was much the same except for the added bonus of having to frequently stop for the new arrivals heading up along the one way road....genius All in all so not worth the time and energy, far from relaxing!A hint..... it looked to be getting quieter when we finished so maybe an arvo trip would be less painful.",-0.4687,2
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Courtney O,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples, Very busy,We booked this trip to the waterfall expecting for it to be quiet and beautiful but instead found that we had to line up and wait for tickets and rent life jackets we did not need to travel in a Jeep for 35 mins on VERY rocky terrain. When we saw the number of the jeeps leaving to go we realised this was going to be anything but quiet... we figured there could be up to 500 jeeps averaging 6/7 passengers at any given time... so as you can imagine the waterfall it’s self was jam packed. The waterfallItself was beautiful but the size of the crowd ruined the experience. One bonus was feeding the monkeys on the way in and out... but would not go back.. I’m sure there are a lot quieter waterfalls elsewhere that could work out a lot more enjoyable. ,0.9523,5

Not many playing options, no boards games as well, have some soft toys though.2. Some of the management & security staff is arrogant for no reason, if you ask anything they would answer in unnecessarily high pitch3. If you take VIP or Premium package, the online staff would mention that you would be allowed to seat in the front row of Entertainment zone on 4th Floor and Terrace (High Tides), but first 2-3 row is mostly booked for guest of Directors and owners as told to us by StaffPros: 1. Great gaming zones on 3 floors with lots of variety of gaming options. Very convenient & well Managed gaming tables with good F&B service while playing2. Great entertainment on gaming floor and entertainment floors, one of the best when compare with Deltin Royale3.

We had numerous shirts, shorts, dresses and a leather jacket made by him, all excellent quality, perfect fit and reasonably priced. Although we never purchased he does jewellery too.

It never disappoints took some trousers I like from U.K. and asked for them to be copied in a different colour. They fit great and fantastic material from Italy. Also had 3 shirts made, again great fit and good advice from Sartaj and the team. What I like about sheek emporium is they use designs  and material that you don’t get in UK So it feels exclusive.

Some years ago I had purchased a pendant necklace in the Caribbean and wanted some gold and diamond earrings to match. I didn’t have the item with me but found something similar online and gave a picture it to Sartak. He said he could do this. He kept me informed right through the process and within a few days I had my earrings. I am absolutely delighted with his workmanship and the price is extremely good. He even gave us a refund on his original quote because he hadn’t used as much gold material as he anticipated. Apart from his excellent work and very good price he is also a lovely gentleman and on our last few hours before departing Goa he invited us to his shop for coffee and cake.  Would not hesitate to use again. Very genuine and excellent quality.,0.9906,5

His eye for detail and measurements were perfect. He helped us choose fabrics and allowed me to go upstairs and find some more (I found a vintage purple floral fabric which was just perfect for the shirt I had made). The quality, price and overall service (including several fittings) made this a really great experience. The shirts and jacket my boyfriend had made are of really excellent quality; the fit is almost perfect and the lining of the jacket shows the level of care and experience of the tailors.

I was so pleased I ended up also having a jacket and two pair of trousers made. The shirts were £20 each and the trousers £30 though thats dependent on the material you choose.

The water seemed clean with small waves so probably safe bathing and paddling to be had along with a clean sandy shoreline.It was nothing like as bustling as Baga beach which we had visited the previous evening and much more attractive for bathing or generally just lazing around. We stayed a good hour longer than planned and thoroughly enjoyed our snacks and drinks in the beach bar, of which there are three of four.A local taxi from our hotel in Arpora (The Park Regis) was around 300 rupees so an affordable day out to a quiet relaxing beach with just enough commercial development to not spoil the tranquillity was very easy to do.",0.9845,5

Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,S.Menda,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Locals are violent against tourists - Vagator parking lot story,"First time in Goa, second of 7 days planned here and realised how much of a hooliganism locals can display for tourists. The parking is very bad at Vagator beach. Now I don't know is it the big beach or small. I was approaching the parking in my rented car and realised there was a traffic jam. This local tourist was trying to leave the parking from the opposite direction. As one car came towards us, all I said was 'please be careful, this is a rented car, cannot afford a scratch'....and then begins a series of abuse towards me (the driver) and my husband...so enraged got the guy whom my husband told to mind his tongue, that he got down his car and hurled abuses at my husband and began kicking my car. A random hooligan also started doing that from all directions and the man who was trying to leave the parking just supported them. They harassed us for my husband standing up for indecent behaviour, for supposedly creating traffic (which happened because of a bus by the way) and for being tourists. Since I'm a female, I was called a bad driver. Nice. That's how gender works. This happened within a few seconds which left me shocked, my husband feeling guilty for standing up for me and my rented car damaged by dents and bad scratches. While the hooligan created videos of us while hurling abuses at us, I managed to get a photograph of his which helped me lodge a complaint at Anjuna PS. Officers were supportive. Learnings: 1. Please use scooters as means of transportation in Goa. Roads are very narrow and weekends are crowded. We would have happily rented a scooty but we didn't have a two-wheeler licence on us. Chose to spend x5 times more on a rental car to avoid being fined. 2. You have the right to be anywhere you want but look for beaches with good parking and few people.3. Avoid scuffles with locals, do not curse.4. Please lodge police complaint for any wrong doing with you, atleast it stays in public record.Be vigilant and take as many evidence you can to help with the complaint. Goa Police has WhatsApp network so information provided to them can be shared quickly in their network.",-0.9237,1

Old,alex_24sh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Churches & Convents of Goa: UNESCO World Heritage Tour Plan on Motorbikes,"The seven WHS objectives lie within a 10-15min walking distance circle; however a more convenient and ""local"" way to explore them is by rented scooters. We started in early afternoon from Calangute and after a 50min trip we reached Old Goa quarters. The road was pretty tough with alternating clogged village and faster expressway segments, but in the end manageable even for beginners like us. We didnt spot any western-style cafes or restos around, so consider bringing some F&B along. 1. Basilica de Bom Jesus, Se Cathedral, Church of St Francis de Assisi, The Chapel of St CatherinePark your bikes in front of the shops by the entrance of Basilica de Bom Jesus, then after visiting it cross the main road to Se Cathedral and Church of St Francis de Assisi. These three churches make out the main touristic core of the site, so be prepared for the usual dose of noisy tourists, loud guides, and colonial opulence. Head towards The Chapel of St Catherine for a more tuned-down feeling, an ochre-colored small jewel nestled in its own small garden where tourist flows recede and the magic of olden days starts to work its way through. Enjoy a well-deserved hydration break with coconuts and plenty of water at the small shop just in front of the exit.2.  Church of St CajetanA short few minutes ride through the forest will lead straight to  the Church of St Cajetan. Despite its being modeled after Vatican's monumental San Pietro, the virtual absence of tourists will allow for an improved spiritual experience of the place. As you exit the church's compounds, head down right for a short glimpse of the Viceroy's Arch.3. Our Lady of the Rosary, Church and Monastery of St AugustineHead back the same way and up the small hilly road ending in the small, but exquisite Our Lady of the Rosary. If you are lucky enough to arrive here jist before sunset, then you are in for a treat. The silent, breezy halls filled with art and history. The view of the river with its lush forrested banks slowly filling with mist and mistery. What remains of St Augustine's is not much, but the scenic tower with the sun setting through its arches does make for a sight to remember. You can easily take the road leading to Panaji, and through some scenic old villages with goan mansions and portuguese chapels, just from St. Augustine's. Allow for plenty of unwind & relax time once back to your accommodation area to make up for the energy well spent.",0.9925,5

You can still sense that grandeur, as you wander what’s left of the city, with its towering churches and cathedrals. Its rise under the Portuguese, from 1510, was ephemeral, as cholera and malaria outbreaks, forced the abandonment of the city in the 1600s. It is a UNESCO World heritage site. Managed really well. Clean and good place to relax and study Portuguese rule in Goa. Some of the most imposing churches and cathedrals are still in use and are remarkably well preserved, while other historical buildings have become museums or simply ruins. It’s a fascinating day trip, but it can get crowded: consider visiting on a weekday morning. White washed Goa Cathedral and “Basilica of Bom Jesus” are the must visit places!Fused with Christian and Muslim culture, the Old Portuguese architecture have turned up to be cute guesthouses on clean narrow lanes behind the busy seashore road with the views of the offshore casinos and island backdrops.

The whole place is littered with rubbish? Why are the Indian government not paying for people to litter pick, maintain and clean the churches? The chapel was probably the best kept and the gardens there were delightful.  One of the churches would not allow tourists as they had a sermon on. Also if you wear sleeveless items, over the knee, shorts, t-shirt, you are considered inappropriate and cannot enter the church.

It is about 30kms from Panaji, in North Goa. The entrance to the Fort is about 1/2 km long walk over broken rubble path from the main road. Considering the stiff entry fee of Rs.25/person, the neglect of this path, where vehicles are prohibited, is criminal. Inside, the one major structure is the Lighthouse which is locked & barred at the base. Again, a shocking case of neglect. The Fort is nothing more than a long low compound wall from the inside. The large underground Water Tank of historical importance is also locked for preventing entry without any description board. Quite unimpressive.

Only problem is beach is 4 km far from village .road to beach is very difficult to drive. Local cab charge Rs.500 to 800 to drop to beach. Shack is very moderately price with good food quality. Service is slow.In all must visit place if u like seclude beach .  ,0.8225,5

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Surbhi C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Couples,Over hyped,"The beach is nice & clean and the unique thing about it is the sweet water lagoon. However, the path to reach the beach is dangerous. Right off the main road, you see the first parking spot. It's a 1.5-2 km jungle trek from there. The road is in extremely bad condition (actually there is no road). You can take your car/scooty/bike further down right before the descending stairs start but at your own risk coz the the path is terrible. Once you reach the beach, there is just one shack/restaurant. You cannot swim in the sea here but can swim in the lagoon or do kayaking in the lagoon. So, overall, we felt it was a bit overhyped based on all the rave reviews we had read about it. ",-0.7843,1

The road is bad, very bad and if you have a car which does off roading or no care for it, go on with the car. If you are taking your scooty, drive with utmost care.There is a tiny stall and a restaurant midway, decent. Once you reach the beach, the main attraction is the backwater, the lagoon. We went in February, and we found it moderately crowded, the water had algea in it and honestly, not worth the effort. There is one huge beach restaurant catering to all and some lifeguards.

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Mihir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2020 • Friends,Truly Secret Beach..Blissful,"Well this small stretch of the Cola beach is called Secret beach coz of two main reasons. It stretches across just about 300 mtrs between two small hills attached with a small beautiful natural lagoon and just 2 small boutique hotels.While it's accessible but the last 1km stretch is  bad road or hardly a road. If u have a bike then u might find it a bit challenging it may have to walk a bit to avoid damage. If u can, get a Mahindra Thar 4X4 .it helps. But not absolutely necessary. Even a regular car can make thru.The beach has just 2 small hotels withind blowing views of the lagoon and the sea of course. Gets booked very fast and I guess it's mostly open just from Oct to may as rains are quite heavy there..The restaurant there is good and serves very nice food. The lagoon is so pretty and beautiful u can consider it a swimming pool of about 3-4 mtrs depth and as long as 800 mtrs or more.TIP: if you wanna visit here , suggest u rather book one of the huts here in either of the hotels..it's expensive maybe INR  10-12K per night but I assure you it's worth every penny, that is, if you get a booking :-)",0.9767,5

The trip took us best part of an hour due to the heat and some rough terrain but worth the trek for the stunning beach and lagoon. It felt quite busy, more so than I was expecting as it’s quite remote, but it’s not a huge beach so could probably feel full quite quickly. Our journey began at beach road at Agonda, then over the bridge and uphill, lastly making a left through scrubland before finally climbing down to the beach past the Dwarka hotel at Cola.  We got a bit lost in the undergrowth but found our way in the end!  Lots of nature along the way including a huge tree full of bats, a wild boar and yet more dogs and cows.  The first view of the beach from the top of the hill was beautiful, it felt like we’d stumbled on a secret location.  Sweet relief to have made it.  All that was missing was a cocktail in hand.  Frustratingly we couldn’t buy a drink at the hotel bar/restaurant seeing as we weren’t guests.  We had a bottle of water with us for the walk but we were craving something icy cold!  We didn’t stay at Cola long, aside from feeling a little dehydrated the sea was quite choppy with big waves breaking close to the beach, so we had a dip in the lagoon instead.  Lovely to relax for an hour or so before making tracks again.",0.9839,5

Wasn't all it was hyped up to be!,"We had a recommendation from people we met in Patnem that Cola Beach was a must go place to go for sunset and food.We jumped on the Royal Enfield and headed over late afternoon.Whether it was high expectations from what we had been told we are not sure but there were a few things they omitted to point out to us.Firstly Cola Beach Road on Google maps looks like a circular road. When we got onto it one part of the road didn't exist. To use to the term road is a bit of poetic licence as its not only a sandy dirty track, but it's so bumpy with step hills that the motorbike struggled with people. I wouldn't have wanted to do it on a scooter with smaller wheels although others did. Cars were also trying to get to the car park above the beach blocking up the track.When we finally arrived, covered in red dust from the track we walked down onto the beach to enjoy a swim before sunset. The beach is really small with lots of rocks above and below the water and with rough waves we decided not to go in. Our looked like one of the two restaurants was preparing for a wedding so in the end we decided to give up and head to Agonda for sunset and food.It is a beautiful small secluded beach but its really hard work getting there (no Rickshaws would go on the track) if you don't have a bike.And for safety I would swim bin the lagoon behind the beach as the rocks would make it quite dangerous for swimming in the sea.",0.8847,5

WARNING: it is not an easy place to get it and the drive up to the cliff is not for the faint hearted. Do not attempt this in a hatch back low clearance vehicle as you will most likely be stranded in the middle of no where.. if you have a 4X4 then do give it a shot. Additional heads up.. there are only 3 shacks in this beach. 2 of the 3 have beach hut accommodations and these 2 serve food and drinks to only their guests. You are left with only one shack where you can get something to eat or drink and that place is always over crowded resulting in warm beers and late food outflow. Really cannot blame them because the only route to this place is via the drive to the cliff and they have limited staff and limited raw materials.. These shacks close off for the off season as early as 2nd week of April (As confirmed by Shack owner), so time your trip here accordingly Cheers and have fun.. P.S : once you drive through the life threatening roads and reach the cliff, you will have to walk down about 4 flights of stairs to reach sea level.. and yes you have to climb those 4 flights of stairs to get back to your car.

So what made this one so special?Cola beach is a bit of a trek by foot (which is how we travelled, 30-45 mins from Agonda)  but it can be reached by scooter/taxi also. The fact that it is slightly off the beaten track means that not many people are there at once, so not only is it fabulously picturesque it is spacious and uncrowded. Not that we found Goan beaches crowded generally but this one just felt extra peaceful.There is only one hotel/bar there, and the rest of the beach is untouched.

","Cola beach is less visited purely because of the rough terrain you have to drive through and people give up so easily and have no idea what they are missing. I went there by two wheeler, a Honda Aviator and the last 7 km took me a half hr and in the parking lot all I saw was tourist cars and rental bikes. My rear end took a pounding riding through the loose mud and rocky terrain, but it was all worth the pain when I got there. Cola beach has that raw natural beauty that very few beaches can match it and the limited accessibility keeps most of the tourists away. You can't help yourself but talk a walk along the entire coastline lined by brown rocks and coconut plantations. They have fancy wooden cottages on the small hills lining the beach as well.

A calm, relaxing day should be enjoyed at this location. A rare phenomenon I experienced here is the distinct dual shade of sand at this beach - black and golden.

This place not only exhibit a Aqua Blue serene beach with coconut tress on its coast but also a green lagoon where you can enjoy swimming!!Cola beach is not a easy place to reach and so has preserved its natural beauty in these many years. You need to trek about 4km to reach this beauty. And if have good driving skills, you can even drive a scooter to this place. It is steep descend with no paved path full of mud. We visited this place during raining season and found quite risky to drive then. The path  was little slippery, and so we decided to trek half way to beach.If you happen to trek to the beach, you will witness few hidden gems on the way which is usually missed when on bike . On the way to the beach we encountered a small part of lagoon some one km just before it meets  the ocean. The place is scheduled with no tourist or locals near it. You can hear the flow of water and rustling of leaves very clearly here I Weescended near the shallow water body and enjoyed there for almost an hour in the fresh clean water. There was one beach hut on the opposite end of the lagoon where we saw a foreigner meditating with OM mantra in background.About 20 min walk from this place we reached cola beach which withholds one of the most beautiful beach South Goa has to offer you. One end of this beach offers you a endless view of the sea blue coast with no sign of human intervention in between and the other end gives you a glimpse of lagoon made of green water. This perfect blend of salt and sweet water is a perfect dream destination you could ever image. The lagoon of green water is encircled with lush green palm trees behind it which darkens with the depth of jungle.Where to stay :1) Blue lagoon Resort is one of the best budget options to stay here. They have both beach facing cottages and lagoon facing huts and I can't score anyone of them with more points. Both of them have their own beauty.Estimated cost : Rs 1500-30002) Other option is to stay in Dwarka Eco Beach Resort which has equally good and sea view cottages.Estimated cost : Rs 7000-10000The restaurant on the beach is also owned by Blue Lagoon Resort where you can try some sea food and drinks .",0.9963,5

Colva_Beach-Colva_South,Ria1104,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Worst Experience in Goa,"We went to explore the beach for a day during our stay in the nearby Benaulim Beach. It had a proper watersports section but prices were too high compared to North Goa. I would strongly advise to try watersports in North Goa and not Colva as the prices are almost double in Colva.Being unaware of the price difference we tried out parasailing here and enjoyed it no doubt. It looked quite scary from outside but while doing it was super fun. With three dips it costed us around Rs 2000 per person (later in Calangute we found out that this could be done in and around Rs 1200 to Rs 1500 there). Also we decided to order from a shack and relax for a while in their sunbeds. This is where things got really bad.Firstly the attendant asked us how much drinks and food we are going to order. If it was above a certain amount only then he agreed to allow us to use the sunbeds. We ordered 2 feni and a crab dish, left our luggage at the sunbeds and went for a swim. After a few minutes the attendant literally went to the sea and called us out as he claimed that the food was getting cold. In all other beaches we had visited in Goa in that week, never were we called back from sea for any stupid reason. Usually the policy is once you order some item you can use the sunbed and enjoy in the waters as long as you want. I think our attendant basically wanted us to have our drinks and food and either leave or order more. He was not OK with us occupying the sunbeds for that long with our existing order. We were already irritated at this and decided to finish our food, clear the bill and go. During the bill clearing also there was another issue. The attendant had verbally told feni prices to be Rs 80 per peg earlier and in the bill he mentioned Rs 180 for 60ml of coconut feni. Now we were in Goa for almost a week and were fairly acquainted with the liquor prices there. Feni prices were never this high anywhere....even in fancy restaurants and this was just a shabby shack. When we pointed out this and reminded him of the price he mentioned before.....he got furious and denied his earlier statement. He even got into an argument with my boyfriend and attempted to punch him but was stopped by his colleagues. At this I was super annoyed paid the overcharged amount and took my partner out of the place.In most parts of Goa  guests were treated with utmost respect but not in the shacks of Colva. Not only with us, I even saw another group of bachelors getting unnecessarily harassed by another shack attendant. So if you are a tourist I would advise you to stay as far as Colva shacks as possible. Also the beach here was the most crowded in South Goa. I did not feel safe swimming in my one piece swimming costume over here due to the constant irritating glances from a group of guys even though I was with my partner. Better to try out the Benaulim Beach instead of Colva Beach for a relaxing and far more peaceful experience both in terms of a swim or the shacks. This is my third time in Goa and honestly nowhere were we treated like the way we were treated in Colva. Never will I return to this beach again.",0.9245,5

There it was pretty clean so I just sat where the waves comes to the shore. Within 5 mins, I felt excruciating pain on my forearm. The lifeguard gave a me a cotton ball dipped in vinegar to dab on my arm and said it will take 30 mins for the pain to subside. My arm was swollen and red. I couldn't bear the pain so we went to Margao Hospital and took a tetnus shot. Apparently they had a case in the morning as well. The doctors were very efficient. I was prescribed painkillers and given calamine lotion. By the next day I was feeling a little better.

Avoid the small jewellers shops, which have a notorious reputation for fake and overpriced jewellery sold by con men and fraudsters.

One has to skirt around some beach shacks to reach the sandy portion along the seaside. There is another approach road going from behind the restaurants which runs parallel to the beach.There are a lot of water sports activities taking place here. If you come during the daylight hours you will observe people enjoying parasailing, water skiing, banana boat riding and swimming in the sea. The beach is always crowded in the holiday season. It is a safe beach for a dip in the sea and there are lifeguards always present and patrolling in their red jeeps.We were sitting at one of the beach restaurants and observing the frenzied activities taking place on the lovely sands. It is a crowded beach and not one where one can relax with a book to read, though there are many sundecks which the Europeans hire from the local vendors, to give themselves a deep tan.Apart from the beach shacks there are also some  established restaurants and hotels on shore, including the state run GTDC Colva Residency.

You can still see many signs in Portuguese. The houses are multicolored and the streets are beautiful. Once the hippies’ paradise, this place isn’t as cheap nowadays.

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Manasa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Tranquil atmosphere and calming waters ,"Unlike Baga and Calangute, Anjuna is fairly less crowded and less noisy with lesser establishments occupying the beach area. Contrary to the other beaches, the water here is blue, the sand is white, and comes with an unusual rock formation (which are quite sharp and dangerous even, so one has to be careful while sitting or even standing on them). There is an air of tranquility and serenity here especially if you visit in the mornings. On a clear sky day, one can see the blue and green shades in the water. Also, there are plenty of assorted pebbles and shells of different colours and sizes that you can pick as souvenirs. If you ever go on a Wednesday, I would suggest that you shop in the flea market during the day and have a nice evening at Curlies or Shiva Valley, enjoying the gorgeous view of the sea.",0.9087,5

One negative to the beach is the amount of 'sellers' who approach you;they were often quite relentless and occasionally the bar staff would come out and tell them to leave.

In middle of each sport they ask extra money to give full ride. That means the amount you have already paid is just for half of the ride only.  They are always ready to argue which makes your experience very bad.,-0.4927,2

I went with a friend and we were joined by an Indian lady who said she was from Manchester! I thought she was a guide who would charge us but she had a stall off the main market. She encouraged us to visit and we said we would but she wouldn't leave us. We went to her stall an were manipulated and coerced into saying we wanted items. She had about 3 other ladies with her who were all very clever in their words - calling us friends, don't break my heart, how can you do this to us when we wanted to leave. Unfortunately I felt I had no option but to buy items at a greatly increased price - they talk to you incessantly, don't give you time to think and use your 'niceness' against you.I'm not after sympathy etc - my own stupid fault but please be careful.Only buy if you want something. Only pay the price you're happy with.

This anjuna market is literally full of hundreds of stands selling the same things...dresses incense....leather goods...jewelry which who knows what it's made of even though they claim gold plated and silver....healing sound bowls and nic naks.It's ok if you're in the area but dont go out of your way and pay more than 600 rupees there and back for a taxi.Theres plenty of nice cafes and restaurants by the beach eva cafe is a nice one along that beach area and a few others for nice food. We walked to that area for eva cafe from aria beach hotel and it was about 40minutes I bought 3 pasmina scarves and 1 silk and paid 2600 rupees.

Sprawling over a wide area close to the beach it is a vibrant in-your-face experience of colour, culture and merchandise. Racks of clothes, amazing jewellery and leather bags, sit beside stalls selling spices, hand embroidered bedspreads, inlaid wooden boxes and souvenir carved elephants. You are told: be prepared to haggle. 'Haggle' doesn't come close. They will hook you, reel you in, and before you know it you have agreed to buy. After practice, you develop techniques for saying 'no thank you' firmly and politely. But if you do want to buy something and hard bargain, remember that these people have little money and the price that they end up being prepared to accept may well leave them with a very small margin.

I had this misconception; I hope & feel sure that many will have this misconception.4)	Misconception To True Perception a)	My Third Visit To GoaI was on my third visit of 6 days to Goa from 24th to 29th Nov 2019. Visited old churches on 26th Nov. 2019.b)	Surprising SightTourists from all religions, including foreigners in large numbers visit old church in old Goa. It was the testimony of the most favorite destination in Goa for the tourists.c)	 Actual Visit Will Give You The True Perception On These ChurchesAfter visiting all the 3 churches, I understood why the Goans had old church as the most common answer for my question on best sightseeing places in Goa.If you are also one like me carrying the misconception on church then it is a must thing for you to visit old churches in Goa.  Now I have true perception on old churches of Goa as an impressive & must sightseeing place.During this 3rd Goa visit of mine, I visited old church, Dudhsagar waterfall, Mangeshi temple & Shantadurga temple. Old church impressed me a lot & Dudhsagar too. Mangeshi & Shantadurga temples are landmark temples of Goa. Both are good. 5)	The Ever Lasting ImpressionAfter seeing these impressive churches, there is an ever lasting impression in my mind with a following thought - can there be a church in any country of the world more impressive than these old churches of Goa.6)	The Things That Impressed Me Lot At Old Churches Are:a)	The inside baroque architecture on both the sidewall of churches b)	The big green picturesque garden with green trees  c)	Wheel chair & special toilet facility for disabled d)	Food snacks stallse)	Basic facilities such as cold drinking water & washroom  7)	Location & Distance Of Old Church Goa:Old church is located in old Goa at 10 km from Panaji Bus Stand.Use GPS from any place in Goa, it will guide you accurately.

Of the two, the cathedral (or, to give it its full name, the Sé Catedral de Santa Caterina) was consecrated in 1640. This church has an interesting connection to the political history of Goa: in 1510, the first governor of Goa, Afonso de Albuquerque, defeated a Muslim army and captured the city of Goa. To commemorate that victory, the church was commissioned—and since the day of the victory was the feast day of St Catherine of Alexandria, the cathedral was dedicated to her. Accordingly, there are several depictions of St Catherine in the cathedral, including at the altar. There’s lots of gilded decoration, all in good condition, and some beautifully varied styles of decoration in the chapels that line the sides of the church: we did a complete round of the chapels, and saw everything from beautifully painted figures to old tiles and carved stone. No entry fee is charged for the cathedral, but they are fairly strict about behaviour in the cathedral: please be modestly dressed (no shorts or bikini tops!), don’t make a noise, and do not take photographs of religious ceremonies or of people—this includes not taking selfies, group photos, or photos of each other.

It was eventually replaced by a larger church in the 1600s as part of Portuguese Goa's religious expansion. This church houses the ancient bell that was removed from the Augustinian ruins of the Church of Our Lady of Grace in the once famed city of Old Goa. This bell is considered to be the second largest of its kind in Goa, surpassed only by the Golden Bell which resides in the Sé Cathedral in Old Goa.Cars can be parked nearby in market areas which charge Rs. 50 for parking.

I had visited in May 2018 and saw cobwebs thick as ropes behind statues and frames, large Lizards zipping around, and to top off this shocking observation a really rude caretaker who knew nothing but to terrorize those who came to pray by yelling at them in a loud disturbing tone. Fast forward to November 2020, and we went to visit the church from outside (due to the COVID restrictions) standing quietly to worship near the outside staircase. A tall big man waved rudely and “shooed” us then told us go away, you are not allowed here to go away. We did not understand what he said and then he charged up to us to literally see us leave in an aggressive posture. What is with these people??? Very unkind.Mother Mary and Jesus Christ would be most disappointed to see their devotees thrown out of the open courtyard and so rudely and unkindly. No grace here at all. Suggestion: the large aggressive man could have said, thank you for visiting, but as you know we are closed, and are not allowing anyone to stand in the courtyard. My apologies since we would love to have you here another time. Hope you have a good time in Goa.” Learn how to communicate without aggressive gestures (2020) or loud shouting tones (2018).

It is too commercialised i felt but once you enter the fort it’s only you and nature. During monsoon the beauty was exceptional. We simply loved it here. It is possible to trek down or up ( both ways ) to and fro village to fort . Many photographers and historians were spotted on the fort . It has not entry fees .  Parking charges for scooter are 20/- as on date (10.08.2022) .  Don’t be much adventurous in the fear of taking selfie’s as you might end up in a wide ts as all view points are on edge of fort without Bata cases or safety lining. Enjoy fullest your 1 -2 hrs time . Do not drink and litter on fort .,0.9839,5

Real shame because the view of the beach and sea is really nice. Sunsets will be spectacular to watch. One can trek a bit outside the fort to find a good spot ( not recommended for young kids)Rest be advised of steep climb on stairs ( 500 approx) Hawkers selling there wares -  some good , some really entertaining with their one liners.All in all a good alternative to visit than the Aguda Fort.

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,travellover905,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Overhyped tourist attraction.,"Just because this place has been picturized in various hindi movies, esp the famous Dil Chahta Hai... doesnt make this place a good tourist attraction. It is very hot during the day so avoid going there before 4pm when the sun starts to set. The sunset view from the top of the fort is beautiful...but the main problem is the condition in which the fort is. Being a place of historical Importance, nothing has been done to improve it. The steps that take you up to the fort are broad, but risky, unclean with stones and bricks coming out of them. both sides of the steps are encroached by the shop keepers who have covered the whole scenic view around the passage to the fort. Once you reach up the fort, fully soaked up in sweat and in thirst, you find disaapointment. the ground is full of mud and stones that becomes muddy if it rains. weeds and wild plants are growing everywhere with no sign of any cleanliness. 2/3 small vendors are there selling Dil chahta hai ice candies and cold drinks at exorbident prices. view from the top is beautiful worth a watch. when we were coming downhill, it started to rain heavily. the steps became sluggish and dangerous to walk. we stood under a shelter of a local shop who charged 100rs per person to just stand under it. how can Goa become a foreign tourist attraction with all this happening.

I found it to be one of the quieter forts of Goa and much better kept that the overtly explored and exploited Aguada. It’s a short drive from Panjim and takes about an hour to see it well.

You get a magical view of the river from the fort. Beautifully maintained. Extremely clean unlike other government properties.BUT at the back of my mind, I was constantly worried about mumma that we didn’t spend a lot of time and came back quickly. When we came back, we saw an altogether different view. My mumma was taken care well by them and she and the other lady at the reception were laughing and chit-chatting.

After lunch we were given an unexpected treat when my cousin took us to visit the historic Reis Magos Fort. I had been here as a young girl in 1974 when my father was taking us all over Goa as an instructed tour of our heritage. It was absolutely in derelict condition and pretty shocking to think that such an important defence of the former Portuguese colony had been reduced to such a miserable state.Imagine my surprise and delight to find that at some point in time, post that visit, the Archaeological Survey of India together with artists and historians had collaborated to restore the fort to its former majestic glory. The site is breathtaking, perched on the edge of a headland at the mouth of the broad Mandovi River where it meets the Arabian Sea. The massive laterite blocks have been built up again, a seriously steep approach leading up to the fort proper.  All the different buildings contained within, the armoury, the detention cell, the bastions with their huge cannons, the lookout stations, and of course, the living quarters, have been restored and an exhibition of old prints were proof of their authenticity.Every inch of the fort is worth exploring and experiencing the strong winds at the summit besides understanding its perfect location filled us with awe and admiration.  There is also a model of the complete fort as it would have been in its glory days, as well as old photographs and explanatory notes.

Parking is not really an issue as it can be done in the parking area or even on the roadside. Entry fee of Rs. 50/- is charged per adult. Though I do not remember the exact amount, I remember very high Camera charges for DSLR, however clicking pictures with cellphone is free. Initially, there's a steep slope to climb up and they have a facility of drop service for senior citizens. The fort is very well maintained, in fact one of the best around. One of the most attractive attraction for me was the Mario Miranda museum; the cartoons were very nice and cute. Further, it also has lot of details on history of Goa and might interest history enthusiasts. The fort overlooks the Mandovi river and views are superb.Overall, a must-visit place around Panjim.",0.9791,5

It has been restored well and you can imagine what it must have been like to live there over the years.The fort is quite extensive being on two levels built on the side of a hill.  The walkways aren't too steep so most people will be able to access at least some of it.The views across the Mandovi river are superb and worth visiting for.The unexpected part for me was the story of the resistance against Portuguese rule and the eventual overthrow at the end of 1961.I definitely recommend a visit if you're in the area.,0.9652,5

It is the oldest fort in Goa, and has been restored to serve as a Cultural and Heritage Centre. And you can now hold private functions there.What Makes It Awesome?From being a Portuguese defence fortress to being a jail to imprison freedom fighters fighting for Goa’s liberation in the 1950s and then a hospital, the Reis Magos fort has served many roles for the state of Goa. The fort has always had strategic importance as the first line of defence for the old port town of Goa which we now know as Old Goa. With panoramic views of Panjim, Nerul, even Old Goa on clear days, this fort is a photographer’s delight. On some days if you are lucky, one can even see dolphins jumping about in the sea. This is an immaculately preserved fort, sparse crowds, well maintained cannons with neat and crisp signage, pictures that educate and entertain. There is a permanent exhibit of Mario Miranda’s sketches, old maps, photographs and drawings of the fort and its history. Also on offer, are amazing vistas of the Mandovi river meeting the Arabian Sea.And one can just visit it and enjoy this beautiful fort, or book it to conduct weddings, private parties, book launches and anything else you can think of. Do carry lots of water and snacks though as currently, it has no refreshment facilities in the fort.Pro-TipThe fort is closed on Mondays for general visits and has a small ticket of INR 50 to enter the fort.

This Fort is facing Panaji across the water. One can get a beautiful view from the Fort. Please keep in mind that this food does have an entry fee. This he is specifically because they want to limit the number of free tourist or people who do not pay but cause destruction to the place. So basically the fee is utilised to do the maintenance of the Fort. This phone has been restored few years ago. This place is open from morning 9 a.m. to evening 6 p.m.. if you are a tourist in Goa you must visit this place so that you know about the Forts as well. There is also a church beside the Fort.

In fact, we discovered it almost by chance because the road back from Aguada was clogged with traffic and we were looking for an alternate route back to Panaji. We saw the Reis Magos marked on Google maps and asked our driver about it. He had not even heard about it. We made him take us there - since he did not know how to read tha map, we had to tell him to take a right here and go along there...And soon we were driving down a narrow road where the sea kept sloshing up onto the street with every wave crashing on the stone pavement that separated the land from the sea. We felt like Sōsuke in Ponyo.The visit involves some climbing. You have to get tickets for nominal rates (and a larger amount for photography equipment - if you don't want to, you can leave them in lockers at the reception). The climb to the fort gates is steep for a man like me, but there is good news for the elderly - there is a car service for senior citizens.Once inside, the tiny fort turns out to be a museum with the history of Portugese Goa depicted on walls of the rooms. There are beautiful sketches by Mario, too. The view of the seafront is breathtaking and I wish to go back during the monsoon when the sea is more choppy.",0.9657,5

The blue, golden and white combination of colours give it a look of grandeur . We went to visit it in the afternoon which is a time one should avoid as the floor is very hot. Due to the pandemic all precautions were being taken. There were no vendors selling flowers or puja material, social distancing was being maintained well.

Mangeshi_Temple,PAVITRA SHIBAD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Family,Divine and Godly,"Very beautiful and serene temple.The timings currently are 3pm to 6pm all days due to COVID.The temple was previously situated in Cortalim. Upon Portuguese invasion in Goa, many Hindu temples were destroyed. The Portuguese forced people to change their religion to Christianity. Hence the group of Saraswats belonging to Vatsa Gotra shifted the Linga to the village Mangueshi, where it is currently housed now.The temple was rebuilt twice during the Maratha regime and renovated last in 1973.A golden kalash was fitted atop the tall dome of the temple during this last renovation.There is a another fascinating legend attached to the name of the Lord Manguesh, who is an incarnation of Lord Shiva. The ancient legend states that Lord Shiva once lost everything he had in a game of dice with his wife Parvati. He decided to go into self-imposed exile and arrived in Goa.Parvati, unable to stay without Lord Shiva for long, came looking for him in the jungles of Goa. Lord Shiva decided to play a prank to frighten her and disguised himself as a tiger which attacked her. Parvati cried out for help in terror, ‘Trahi Mam Girisha’ (O Lord of Mountains Save Me).Lord Shiva immediately turned himself back into his normal form and the two were united. But the cry for help and the words ‘mam girisha’ became associated with Lord Shiva. In the course of time the words abbreviated to Manguirisha or Manguesh by which name he is known today.A linga which was left to mark the place where the legend occurred was discovered by a local shepherd and eventually a temple was built to house Lord Manguesh.Me being a Saraswat, this is one of my kuldevatas(family deities). I always make it a point to visit when I come to Goa.The peace you feel when you visit this temple is incomparable.Definitely come here at least once.Only suggestion to the authorities is - please make sure all people are wearing masks and following social distancing. Otherwise deny entry.Some people did not follow the precautions and were very unruly; something I observed during my last visit on 16 Nov 2020.Sanitizer was provided at entrance but no one seemed to be using it consciously.When questioned, why they are allowing people without masks, their answer is ""We cant do anything except leave our safety to God"". Not done at all, when at other places heavy fines are taken when masks are not worn and social distancing not followed.Also, certain visitors came in shorts, skirts, sleeveless dresses up to knee length. Modest dressing should be a must-people should maintain the sanctity of this temple, not treat this like a party place just because you are in Goa.",0.9196,5

As Goddess Parvati came looking for him, he tried to prank her by shape shifting into a tiger and frightening her. Seeing the predator in front of her, Parvati shrieked and prayed uttering the following words Trahi Mam Grisha, roughly translated this means “O Lord of the Mountains, save me”. Upon hearing her plea Shiva reverted to his usual form and returned to Kailash with her.Shiva came to be known as Lord Manguesh due Parvati’s words Mam Grisha that remains associated with the land and the tale.

There is even place to stay within the Temple but is restricted. Its always nice to stay and since the same is built arond the temple its gives a clam and plesant feeling. Would recommend to wear clothes which cover your legs completly i.e. full pants or else will have to get the dhoti or chunni to do that as the entry is restricted with western outfit.Again the entry in the main temple very well know as ""Gabhara"" (The innermost division of temple) is restricted, however from the place from where we can see the idol gives a good view. Photography is restricted as it is in most of the temples.Non-Veg is strictly prohibited and the canteen inside the temple premises have some delicious maharashtrian delicacy. For people who would like to have the feel of some goan non-veg food if you step out of the temple there are a few eateries popularly know as ""Khanaval"" who serves authentic goan food mainly fish and sol kadi are one of my favourites.

Mangeshi_Temple,Charan63,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Shiva Temple in Lata Mangeshkar’s Village ,"While visiting Goa, made a point to visit Mangeshi Shiva Temple. It is Situated in the village that is also famous for being the native village of melody queen Lata Mangeshkar. Like all parts of Goa, the road to templetown passes through an undulating terrain though lush green hills. Given it’s a small village, local body has made sure that cars are parked outside the village access road. This leaves the last about 500 meters to walk before one reaches the main entrance of temple. Climbing about 20 odd steps, one crosses the main gate and enters the vast grounds of temple. What surprises one is the temple architecture. Unlike a traditional temple with a pointed step tower above the sanctum sanctorum,  the temple appears like a dome of a basilica. From distance, the temple appears like a church complex. Possibly, a fusion of Hindu Temple Architecture with Portuguese history and Roman Catholic Church styles. The inner hall of temple is decorated with numerous glass chandeliers - again very different from traditional Hindu temples. Temple is however very clean and environs so soothing and serene. When visiting Goa, this should be a must visit site, just like Basilica of Bom Jesus or Se Cathedral. ",0.9604,5

It is at a distance of 1 km from Mardol close to Nagueshi, 21 km from Panaji the capital of Goa, and 26 km from Margao. This temple is one of the largest and most frequently visited temples in Goa. In 2011, the temple along with others in the area instituted a dress code on visitors of the temple. This temple had its origins in Kushasthali Cortalim, a village in murmugao which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. In the year 1560, when the Portuguese started Christian conversions in mormugao taluka, the Saraswats of Vatsa Gotra moved the Mangesh Linga from the original site at the Kushasthali or Cortalim on the banks of river Zuari  to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol village of Atrunja Taluka, which was then ruled by the Hindu kings of Sonde of Antruz Mahal (Ponda), to be more secure Since the time of the shifting, the temple has been rebuilt and renovated twice during the reign of the Marathas and again in the year 1890. The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden kalasha (holy vessel) was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple.  The original site was a very simple structure, and the current structure was only built under Maratha rule, some 150 years after it had been moved. The main temple is dedicated to Bhagavan Manguesh, an incarnation of Shiva. Bhagavan Mangesh is worshipped here as Shiva linga.  He is the kuldevta of many Goud Saraswat Brahmins. The 450-year-old Shri Mangesh temple dedicated to Shiva stands out with its simple and yet exquisitely elegant structure. The temple architecture consists of several domes, pilasters and balustrades. There is a prominent Nandi Bull and a beautiful seven-story deepstambha (lamp tower), which stands inside the temple complex. The temple also has a magnificent water tank, which is believed to be the oldest part of the temple.  The Sabha Griha is a spacious hall which accommodates over 500. Like most temples in Goa, Mangueshi Temple has a large number of pujas being performed daily. Every morning, Shodshopchar pujas, namely Abhisheka, Laghurudra and Maharudra, are performed. This is followed by Maha-Aarti at noon and Panchopchar pooja at night. Every Monday, the idol of Manguesh is taken out for a procession in the Palakhi accompanied by music before the evening Aarti.",0.9848,5

There is a large street food section with food from all over the world as well as many local dishes, whilst we didn’t eat we saw lots of others tucking into take away style dishes.There is a small stage area with music from quite a few different bands throughout the evening and a massive separate scooter/car park area. Top tip is to be very aware of scooters around this area as lots of the riders are tourists who have no “Indian” road sense, you can easily get run over if you’re not paying attention.All the stall holders are happy to haggle and if you are persistent there are some real bargains, I would make sure you have lots of different denomination notes so you can pay the exact price you have negotiated.There is another market up in Anjuna on a Wednesday daytime but this one seemed better maybe because of all the magical lights and general bustle, so happy shopping folks!",0.9448,5

To start there are now 2 night markets and our driver brought us to the other one first, we walked around quickly and realized this was not the one we had been to before. Once we arrived at This one we realized we were at the same place except it was considerably smaller. We talked to a few vendors who explained that most of the foreign vendors have left and now do a bimonthly night market on Fridays. We were disappointed because we had remembered all the unique items we could buy. There are still some of these vendors there and we did buy some unique items, just not as much as we wanted. The food area was great and there was a live band that was decent. Plenty of Indian vendors so a good place to pick up last minute souvenirs, out of the 2 markets this one is more manageable and less crowded.",0.8605,5

Expect to spend around 1.5-2 hours here if you want to walk down every lane, more if you want to stop and listen to the (excellent) live music. I visited on my own as a solo female traveller and felt safe. If you can arrange a return taxi do, but there are plenty available outside. My taxi cost 1400 rupees return to the Lemon Tree, my driver waited outside for me. Be careful on the prices. For most items expect to haggle on everything to between 20-50% of the price initially stated. The 'walk away' tactic works well, although I was pursued for a good 5 minutes down one lane by a disappointed trader who kept slashing his prices in the hope of getting a sale.Entry is free.

There are plenty of food stalls in case you decide to have dinner there. Wood fired pizzas are a favourite here. I personally was a bit dissapointed with the shops as they lacked variety. The shops are selling either Tshirts and dresses (typical Goa style), artificial metal jewellery, rajasthani stone works. These 3-4 types are repeated across these 200 shops and its gets repetitive very soon as you start walking around. For example its the same T shirt at every second shop.

I managed to get a bargain very early on with the help of my sister-in- law who is more familiar with the process of haggling than I am so it was a good start. There is so much to see and lots of 'alleyways' to explore that after a while it becomes numbing as everyone wants your trade/rupees!  There was live music provided and seating arranged to take it all in. The spectacle of the market is brilliant and it gets busier as the night goes on. The array of lights make it quite special but after about an hour and a half we were ready to leave and do battle with the amazingly busy and noisy street outside. Worth seeing for the spectacle itself. ,0.8087,5
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,jason j,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,"Bit of a let down, terrible tourist trap and the organisers beat the animals with sticks! ","We were looking forward to the night Market to be honest as we thought it would be a great opportunity to buy proper local goods and produce. It turned out the opposite as all we found was the same tat that had been on sale all over our tour of India. The same souvenirs, same ornaments, same clothes and same fake jewellery. Tourist trap written all over it. Scams all over the place and luckily we were wise to them already. The place is massive however it's just the same 6 stalls replicated around the place. There's not much choice to be honest. Food was quite good and the people watching is brilliant as was the cheesy euro techno music. The night turned sour however when we witnessed the organisers going around the market literally beating the dogs and cows with sticks until they left the area cowering in corners. It was horrible to see and we confronted one guy who all of a sudden couldn't speak English. We then saw him running around a disused area chasing and beating cows. India has a serious problem with stray animals and animal cruelty and not to mention the horrendous litter situation. They have no care for theirs or anyone elses environment. It's a shame as it left a sour taste on an otherwise great holiday. ",0.3384,4

At the corner there is also a open place for you dance for disco music, after taking the liquor being sold by Titos shop.I could see many foreigners in groups and families visiting this place. Locals also come here in addition to the tourists. one important caution is that you have to bargain to buy anything and also to take care of your wallet all the time. There are many shops being repeated with the same items such as bags, antiques, ladies jewelleries,masks, hats,a collection of spices, colourful hammocks of sizes, shoes and ladies footwares, etc., etc..The shops are opened until upto 1-00 am and transport is available  till then.",0.9313,5

This huge church is well maintained even after hordes of tourist step in to have a look at the church. I, however, am miffed at some people's sheer lack of civic sense in abiding the rules maintained by the church to preserve the church's heritage. One should take enough time to browse through the main hall as you enter and slowly make your way to the elaborate gilded altar where on the right is the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier enclosed in an ornate silver casket guarded by cherubs. If you look closely you can see the mortal remains through the windows in the sarcophagus. Enter inside to a gallery that features the day to day items worn by the revered saint and some painting depicting his life. Exit to the inside courtyard where you can buy some souvenirs of your visit or check out the video show. The backdoor exit leads to the grotto depicting the apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes to Bernadette with a water cascade offering a soothing soundtrack.

Born in Navarre, Spain, St. Francis Xavier (1506-52), was a former pupil of St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order; he was ordained in 1537 and came to Goa in 1542. During his time in Goa, St. Francis was credited with nursing the sick, founding numerous churches, converting thirty thousand people as well as performing miracles. Later he went to Sri Lanka, Malaysia, China and Japan to carry on his missionary work. St. Francis died in 1552 at Sancian Island off the coast of China at the age of 46; his body was later moved back to Goa. The tomb, the gift of the Grand Duke Cosmos III of Tuscany was carved by the sculptor Giovanni Batista Foggini; it took ten years to complete and was erected in 1698. Constructed of jasper and marble, the tomb was set out in three tiers: base, mausoleum and casket. The bronze plaques in the middle depict scenes from the life of St. Francis, and in front of the casket is a fine silver statue of the saint. The interior of the chapel is richly ornamented with carved detail and paintings illustrating scenes from the saint’s life. Once in a decade, the saint’s remains are displayed to the public on the anniversary of his death, 3rd December",0.34,4

Durga, who is often portrayed exuding fury and aggression, appears in a gentler form in Goa. Shanta, in Sanskrit, means peace. According to Hindu mythology, the goddess got her name after she settled a quarrel between Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. According to legend, the quarrel turned bitter and became so fierce that it threatened to destroy the entire universe. Fearing annihilation, Lord Brahma pleaded Goddess Parvati to interfere. Taking the form of Shantadurga, the goddess took Shiva by her left hand and Vishnu by her right and pacified the duo.Thus, the idol of the goddess is flanked by the statues of Shiva and Vishnu. The goddess holds serpents in each hand, representing Shiva and Vishnu.This is the famous kuldevi of the Goud Saraswat Brahmin community.Very peaceful and positive place.

At one moment  Shankar was on the verge of using   the Pashupati Astra , which would have wiped the entire universe . Lord Brahma , the creator , then urged  the Adishakti to intervene .

Shantadurga placed Vishnu on her right hand and Shiva on her left hand and settled the fight.  Shantadurga is holding two serpents, one in each hand, representing Vishnu and Shiva. The original temple at Quelossim (Keloshi) in mormugao was destroyed by the Portuguese in 1566. The goddess was shifted to Kavalem and worship was continued there.

For those who live in the cities & don't get to see much greenery, this is a must do. It's also a great place for children to see & learn few things about spices & spice plants. It's a 200-acre privately owned property & we are taken on a 30-min walk where multiple spices have been grown within 1 acre of land. These spices are supplied to factories who produce masala & other food items.The entry fee is INR500 per person which includes lunch & tour guide service. Even if you don't want to have lunch, you still have to pay the full amount. You either choose to complete the tour, then have lunch or the other way round. Tour guides can speak English, Hindi & Konkani. They have good knowledge of the plants.My family & I visited various temples of South Goa in the morning, then headed to Sahakari Spice Farm for lunch at 2:00 pm followed by the spice farm tour. The Farm closes at 4:00 pm. Do carry umbrellas if you are visiting during monsoon, as the farm doesn't provide them.",0.749,5

Later, after the tour, comes the lunch, included in the 12 dollar cost of the ticket. Very tasty, and varied lunch, for vegetarians, and/or chicken and fish lovers. There is also a stand in which spices, natural medicines, infusions among other products are sold.I have to say, though, that the plantation is huge, and what is shown to us is only a sample, or a short tour. don´t expect a long visit through plantations because it is not planned this way.All in all, a very recommendable experience!",0.9807,5

A ‘so called spice tour’ is 10 minutes walk where water sprinklers installed in ground are a safety hazard. The guide will be showing one plant of each type in a backyard sort of garden to a batch of 20-25 people regardless whether people are able to hear or not. Focus of this place is only and only on selling spices, and to our surprise we bought vanilla stick which we paid for and the counter girl never packed it in our bag.

After the seed is detached from the Apple... The ripe orange red apple is crushed (tradially by feet).. to squeeze out the juice.   These is than put in the clay pots and boiled....and distilled and tormented for about 6 weeks... at this stage there is very little Achohol...

The price was very reasonable, 400 rupees for a welcome tea drink, (which u can sip while reading about essential oils they have and how to mix them for different remedies), guided tour(they take you in small groups- met some lovely people), a small taste of local feni alcohol and lunch (indian food, veg and non veg options). They had english and local speaking guides, which were super friendly and very informative! At the end of the tour they have a little shop where u can buy all the essential oils and products you read about which are also very reasonably priced. We had a great experience! ",0.9796,5

Ticket is 400 for adults and 200 for kids below 7 years of age. This ticket includes a very tasty lunch. After lunch you take a tour with a tour guide it takes about 45 minutes to one hour for the tour where the tour guide tells about different spices and condiments. Tour guides are knowledgeable people with knowledge of Herbs and their effects on the body. And they present the facts in a bit humorous way.

To see those poor elephants being dragged by their ears and hit with sticks for the sake of tourism was truly heartbreaking. The handlers were extremely aggressive towards the elephants...shouting and hitting them to make them pose for pictures.

Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Lee M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Too horrible for words,"Visited as part of an organised tour. Food was included as was a guided tour. People were also encouraged to pay an additional 700rs for an elephant ride or an elephant shower. We were led to a benched area where we were left waiting for quite some time before a buffet was brought out. There was very little on offer, only a handful of dishes were available. We were again left for a considerable amount of time before a guide came. The tour itself was very lacklustre with very little to see. You spent most of it trying to get past other groups. It lasted between 15-20mins. We were then led to where the elephants were. I was horrified to see these beautiful creatures beaten with sticks and kicked to make them walk. I asked the plantation worker who was dealing with tickets, who owned the elephants. She quickly told me that they were nothing to do with the plantation. I found this very hard to believe since the staff clearly supported what was going on and took cash for it. Even having it at the end of the tour and people being lead to the elephants suggests that they are indeed part of the plantation. I came away feeling angry and upset but more so, helpless as I didn’t know what to do to help the two elephants. I have written to the Indian high commission for advice. It’s truly heartbreaking to see what I saw and I do not want the people to get away with it. Please please please do not go on trips that support elephant based activities and please help the two elephants sahakari have. They don’t deserve a life of abuse. ",0.7683,5

The road there from Panjim was a good drive and you have to be careful as some parts of the road are being upgraded. On entry you are greeted with hot lemongrass tea and some brochures on various spices and their applications. The guided tour lasts almost for 25-30 mins with the guide explaining about the history of the place to showing you the spice plants such as nutmeg, cardomom, pepper, cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa etc. He gave us a bit of explanation about each with some benefits. He was very lively and made the explanations lively, however this seemed a very rehearsed routine. We also saw a feni distillery and cashewnut tree, one of the most prominent nuts being grown in Goa/ Konkan.The tour warpped up with a shot of Feni and some water being poured on your back for relaxation. The lunch was tasty with both, veg n non veg dishes and rice/curry. You can buy soft drinks, beer and other drinks at the counter. It was a good break away from the usual suspects  of beach bumming and drinking. It also was a bit informative and the plantation itself is a nice green space if you want to roam around.

Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Nigel H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Interesting but beware of being financially exploited,"The visit was interesting enough but was spoiled by blatant exploitation of tourists with overinflated pricing of products.  If you decide to buy some of the products and you see a sign that says the cost of each packet is Rs 200 each, look at the label on the packets that prices them at Rs 90 and insist on paying only this.  The Feni sample they offer you at lunch is good, but the small plastic bottle you can buy there tastes watered down.  A superior 750ml good quality bottle can be bought cheaply in many shops.  Rs 400 entry feel plus overinflated prices of products and a sense of obligation to leave a top for the person they call ""Monkey Man"" who demonstrates how to climb a palm tree all adds up.  I don't mind paying a fair price, but finding out later that I was charged Rs 200 for sample packets priced at Rs 90 was a bit of a spoiler for me and left me feeling that an otherwise interesting and worthwhile visit was primarily an opportunity to exploit tourists which I found disrespectful - Hence 2 points not 4.",0.9721,5

While it seemed in the contrary that (for the same price) the ""elephant shower"" (which I witnessed) is a nice experience in a river, lasting longer and in nice surrondings (not in a middle of a car park !!).

The entrance fee was Upon arrival is around 400 rupees per adult. As we do not have children I am not 100% on the charge for them. we were greeted by a lady who showers you in fresh, fragrant flowers and put a Bindi dot on our forehead. At this point we were slightly confused as to where to go, we noticed a small hut to the left where people where waiting and we decided to head there. This was the welcome area. We were given fresh hot lemon grass tea whilst we waited for our tour guide. There were informative leaflets dotted round with various remedies to cure any minor health issues. These where interesting to read as I suffer from psoriasis and one of the leaflets where advising which spices/herbs/natural juices where best to cure. Once our tour guide arrived 10 minutes later we made our way around the spice plantation. I would say that this took around 30 minutes. It was very informative, interesting and nice to see where all of our spices actually come from instead of just buying them ready made on the supermarket shelves. Our tour guide gave us small amounts of leaves etc and asked us to guess which spice it was. This kept us interested throughout the tour. We saw the elephant - a 48year old female in the river, she belongs to the plantation and is very well looked after. They do offer elephant showers here for an extra charge but we declined that offer and enjoyed watching her in the water. After our tour had finished we were shown to the open eatery which is inclusive within your entrance fee. The food is clearly cooked fresh using their own spices. However, it is not the best of standards. We did enjoy our meals, they were tasty but we had to watch out for bits of bone which where lingering in the curry!

Its lighthouse and the fort itself have braved the ravages of time and stand like silent sentinels on the Sinquerim Beach, approximately 18 km from Panjim. Built in 1612 as a protection from Dutch and Marathas, it was the most prized and crucial fort for the Portuguese and covers the entire peninsula at the southwestern tip of Bardez. The view from the fort is breathtaking as it overlooks the confluence of Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea. The fort is so named after the Portuguese Word for water i.e. 'Agua' and used to be a replenishing source of fresh water for sailors. In fact, it has the capacity to hold 2,376,000 gallons of water and was one of the biggest freshwater reservoirs of Asia.Fort Aguada has also been used as Aguada jail. A statue in front of the jail salutes the freedom fighters, giving the fort a touch of patriotism.In its heyday, the fort may have been a silent sentinel but today, it is bursting with tourist activities and happy chatter. The mesmerising view of the setting sun combined with pristine water of Arabian Sea from the top of the lighthouse is so picturesque that it can capture the heart of anyone who comes here.four-storeyed light house. Built in 1864 it is the oldest lighthouse of Asia. There was a time when oil lamps were used to emit light after every 7 minutes which was later changed to 30 seconds. The Lighthouse dominates the landscape of the Fort. It was closed to public gaze some years ago and was abandoned in 1976. So, a new lighthouse was built and was named as Aguada Lighthouse. A bell inside the lighthouse later became a part of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church in Panaji. For a small fee, a curving staircase can lead you to the top from where you can have a beautiful view of the sunset.",0.9789,5

Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,AP121,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Lovely place,We have just returned from 2 weeks here. The cottage we stayed in was perfectly functional. It was cleanish with just enough storage for your clothes. We were right by the pool at our  request and I'm glad we were.  It was just a few steps from our veranda to the pool and a few more onto the dining area.  The pool has roman steps into it which was great for me and our granddaughters.The food was amazing and I can honestly say I didn't have one bad dish. The staff in and around the cottages are outstanding! I am disabled and unable to walk unaided. If they saw me sitting on the veranda they would come over immediately and ask if i wanted tea/coffee/drinks and often bought me over breakfast while my husband had a sleep in. Desmond and Lalik were always ready to have a laugh and joke and were very attentive and helpful.The dogs that live in the resort were gorgeous. scruffy but loving. The one downside for me is the fact that the paths and walkways were so uneven and broken that it made walking very difficult.  Even able-bodied people were tripping.The only other thing is the music is very loud round the pool and very repetitive. Oh and the bed was so hard! It was like sleeping on the road!  But thats just a small irk in what was an amazing introduction to GoaWe would both return if the paths were sorted out.,0.9629,5

We were at the beach in the evening also to watch the brilliant sun set.It was good to that they had a manned-life guard station.

The beach stretches for quite a distance, with its white sandy beach where it is serene ,calm and an idyllic setting, breathtaking really to visit. Along the beautiful seashore there are some rock formations ? this is to prevent erosion of the seashore. The beach is not commercialised like most, but there is the odd beach shack where you can purchase food/ drinks.The beach is backed with Pine Trees and Casuarine trees. If anything it is amongst the lesser crowded beaches. This is really a hidden Gem. Its a sunny haven of Sand, Sea and Sunshine and you will surely find a tranquil spot for sunbathing or reading your book. In season there are many water sports available. At the far end of the Beach you will find the local Ferry which will take across to The Tiracol Fort ( runs every 30mins). Ideal area for Anglers to fish..A Warning to swimmers. It is NOT SAFE for swimming near the mouth of the Tiracol Estuary, so beware.The Beach is Ideal for picnics so if you wish to take your own food/drinks and enjoy a wonderful picnic take the advantage.. The Beach is also famous for the nesting/ rearing of Turtles, do be respectful of this area.If you get restless or wish a break from the sun, have a look at the 2 Temples situated nearby.

It is a beautiful and serene beach. Locals often picnic here and Oliver Ridley turtles nest here. There aren't too many  restaurants around and at the extreme end of the beach you will find a ferry crossing that will take you to the Tiracol fort(privatized hotel now).I wouldn't advised inexperienced swimmers to dive into the waters as it can be a dangerous and steep affair.Anglers will find solace here.

It is a beautiful 45 minutes drive through lush greenery. It is worth a visit just for the beautiful drive itself. The fort itself did not have much to explore unlike forts in Rajasthan, but the views of the sea from the fort were amazing. There was no guide available when we visited and not much information available onsite. I wish I had read up about the fort before our visit so that I could better appreciate what I saw there.Important : Fill up the fuel tank from Palolem itself before you start the drive. There are no petrol pumps anywhere on the route from Palolem to Cabo de Rama. At one point, we were scared that we were going to be stranded mid-way without petrol. That's where the next tip is going to help. It seems, everywhere in South Goa that we travelled, the neighbourhood provisions stores also stock up on petrol sold in 1 litre bottles. Looks like there are a lot of tourists who end up like us :-) One such provision store was our lifesaver. We could fill up enough to get back to Palolem without being stranded.",0.9857,5

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Sonia P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Beware on the hike to the Butterfly beach,We were four girls and we decided to hike to butterfly beach through a thick jungle trail. This is the only way if you wish to walk yourself towards the beach. The man made trail goes amidst the forest. You can take a two wheeler upto a certain distance and then hike for around 2 kms. We were walking through and around 1.5 kms later we heard a big cat growl. We stood there for a minute and heard it loud and clear from a nearby distance consistently. We decided to turn back and not risk it.The unfortunate part is that there are no sign-boards or forest department representatives to hint or guide travelers about the presence of big cats in the jungle. We could have landed ourselves into trouble. I advise everyone who likes to hike in jungles to never use earphones while you hike and be very cautious about the sounds you get to hear.

I would not even call it a business because it is not run like one.   What is going to blow you over is a Family Run Farm, which is run with a lot of dedication and truthfulness(I have never used this word in any of my past reviews).The owner Mr Chinmay Tanshiker was handed over a farm by the previous generation which he has turned into a place where people like us can get our kids to show the wonders of nature.Few details of the property1)  Very Good Rooming Options (Mud Houses, Tree Houses, Individual Houses etc).I would recommend the mud houses  to get a feel of what village life is).2) Dining Options As per buffet for the day no Ala Carte, But Fresh Juices and Milk Shakes are a treat.3) They have a inhouse adventure activity setup complete with a zip line, the cost is included in the rooming charges.4) Hiking Activities with include two options depending on the time at hand and your willingness to walk.5) A in house fresh water pool to dive in.6) A tour of the plantation with Chinmay himself, very knowledgeable and he makes it interesting for the kids and adults alike.We enjoyed every bit of our 1 night stay at this place and we want to come back for more.Chinmay himself is a award winning Organic Farmer, his wife is as capable as he is , and to listen to his daughter practice her classical singing is a treat to ones ears.The staff or team that this farmhouse has is excellent, a special mention of Dilkhush who stays true to his name.Thank You  Team Tanshiker Farm We Wish You All The Luck",0.9966,5

It is such a fabulous tour and great insight into traditional and innovative farming practices and the guide was sooo knowledgeable not just about local farming but also spice farming history and how it compares to international practices as well - so interesting!An added plus was they they also showed us through a mud house their family had built and they still live in which was fascinating and of course the buffet provided for lunch was delicious (no dodgy tummies here)!Other travelers staying at our hotel went to a different spice farm and weren't impressed at all, which made us feel even more lucky that we were directed to this one.This really was one of the highlights of my stay in Goa, so if you get the chance give it a go and contribute to an incredible small family business while you have a fabulous experience.PS.

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,Ravi Nagare,,,,"I had a house guest from Mumbai for a mini vacation & we had crammed our days with things to explore and do within four days. One day was marked for the spice plantation..... We called the Plantation to ask if they were open and made reservations with a Mr. Chinmay. Reservations you say?? Yes.... reservations!We were located towards North Goa & the plantation was far down South in Sanguem, near Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary. Mr.Chinmay informed us we would take roughly two hours to reach the plantation. So we figured this will be a full day excursion into beautiful Goa and made reservations for 3 ..... why?? (1) For the one & a half hour tour through the plantation and (2) for the vegetarian meal that is included in the price, more because the food is cooked at home by the owner- Mr. Chinmay’s wife Gauri. Knowing how many people to expect for the buffet spread helps them to get organised to maximise our experience. WARNING: after a certain point there will be no signal on the cell phones but cortuntely after that point the road leads you through winding roads, plenty of greenery & tiny villages directly to the plantation. We did have to stop at one point to enquire if we were on the right route and were told another 200 mtrs & you will see the sign saying Tanshikar Spice Farm.Now for vital information:Parking place- yes.Toilets (clean & rustic) after the long drive- yes.Welcome drink- yes.Tour- 1 & 1/2 hours approx. Vanilla, spices & bees!! Mr. Chinmay is a third generation “plantation-ist” who works from home so the feel is very homely, unlike the other two I have been too which are  more commercial. Mr. C is very knowledgeable about the history of spices & shares interesting tit bits of info about the various spice plants & their habits, about environmental co- habitation, importance of organic fertilisation & use of organic / natural pesticides which go a long way in maintaining the earth’s ecological balance, maintaining harmony of nature etc.  it was most enlightening. He also talked about green coffee, cacao seeds and the benefits of curcumin ( the humble haldi - now the latest fad  being Curcumin Latte when India always knew about the benefits of turmeric in our daily diet)Bee farming- yes.Lunch- yes( a simple, typical Goan vegetarian meal.) A small unpretentious  museum - displaying farming / agriculture instruments used down the ages.A walk through their mud house- almost 200 year old.They have tree houses to live in if one wants  to live there for a couple of nights! Sounded exciting!They have zip line & other adventure sports (we didn’t see where as it had started raining heavily by the time we finished our plantation tour) A small retail outlet to buy spices, pickles, coconut oil, vanilla beans etc. grown / made there.Overall a great experience! What made an impression on my mind is that having studied Commerce & having the option to work & live in a city, earns piles of money, have a fast life, own fancy gadgets, send his children to fancy schools etc. Mr.C chose to live in the family mud house in the back of beyond & make a life & contribute  his bit towards improving the environment! KUDOS to him & his family! Oh!!! and as a parting gift he gave us each a small packet of assorted spices for free!!!!!",0.9959,5

Ms Gauri, the lady of the farm took us around showing us each and every plant and tree and whatever they have in the farm and also gave us all the information about everything. she really has good amount of knowledge about all what they have in their spice heaven and told us even the smallest of the things about the spices. we also got to see their ancestral house which is more than 250 years old. and the best part was to know about the honey bees. the way she explained and showed us the hive and the life of bees, felt to be a bee for sometime and go inside the hive to see all their incredible work. then the home made typical goan food was very tasty which made us to finish almost everything whatever they had prepared for us. they also sell all the spices and other products grown there and trust me, you will not get such organic and best spices anywhere outside. overall our trip to tanshikar spice farm was very informative, productive, interesting and stomach filling. i would suggest to visit the farm any time of the year whenever you are in goa.",0.9932,5

It is run by well spoken couple who take turns in showing around. We were shown around by Mrs. Tanshikar and it was a deep knowledgeable well guided tour. It takes around 1 to 1.5 hrs to complete the tour and depends on your liking's of plants and interaction with the guide. The farm is well laid and has almost all spices which can grow in this climate and few fruit tree varieties. A good tour.The restaurant area is also well done, basic bit clean and proper. The food was excellent, had home made Goan taste and since small groups visit, it was probably made for you only. The items were sufficient. They have shops selling spices and other home made Goan food items,fresh and authentic, but albeit somewhat costly. The use of pebbles for toilet floor and coconut barks for pipes was environmentally satisfying.The old house where they stay is traditional old Goan Hindu villa, if it interests one. Did not stay so cannot comment on that facility. Also did not visit Jungle safari and perennial waterfall.Overall a nice visit, concluded in say 4 hrs. Travel time depends on which part of Goa you are, as this is in southwest interior Goa. Route is scenic. Also visit budbude  talav, which is in same village en-route.",0.9244,5

This is what you need to know.(1) It is a relative short way from the coast, but the roads are not conducive to fast driving so it took us the best part of 2h to cover 60km from Colva.(2) The drive to the Spice farm is amazing, from city, to mountains, via paddy fields to jungle.(3) MAKE SURE THAT THE DRIVER KNOWS WHERE HE IS GOING. OFTEN THEY TRY AND TAKE YOU TO OTHER SPICE FARMS. THEY GET A COMMISSION FROM THEM. THIS ONE DOES NOT PAY A COMMISSION.(4) You have to book in advance as they need to make catering arrangements.(5) You get a fantastic and educational tour and guide through the plantation. Our guide was the owners wife. She made the walk through the plantation really enjoyable. (worth taking mosquito repellent).(6) The tour ends with luch- veggie. Simply food but clean and tasty. You can buy a varity of shakes, we had the cocoa and fresh mango- unbelievably good. Very cheap as well.(7) There is a shop that sells spices. Good place to buy gifts esp the essence oils.(8) The whole place is charming. We all greatly enjoyed it, even our young son!!(9) Cost for tour and lunch was about £5!!

The owner of the farm conducted the group tour of the farm in which we learned about the variety of tree and vine based spices that are grown there, the honey they cultivate, and their methods of harvesting, etc.  We were also given a tour of the family farmhouse/home and a good view of their day to day lives.  We were then hosted to a delicious lunch.  We then took an off-road jeep to a hiking location and hiked about an hour to see a gorgeous waterfall (enjoyed our young French companions!).  Then we had a private cooking class with Tanshikar's wife who taught us how to make Roti and Paratha as well as a dahl and chickpea curry...all were delicious!  We bought spices from the farm and walked away with recipies and techniques to try at home!  A super way to spend a day in the region.  Highly recommend this!",0.9815,5

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,SaSuFinland,,,,"We read great things about this spice farm and attempted to call several times to arrange a tour. They never answered their phones so we decided to rent a motor bike and drive there for a tour. Based on the information on TripAdvisor and in our guide book we thought they were open until 5pm. Well that might be true but don’t go in the late afternoon. We rented a bike and drove for an hour and a half. When we arrived just before 4pm, the owner told us he would not offer a tour as they were done for the day, and to come back another day.  We asked if we might have a short private tour and he said he and his wife had given numerous tours that day already and he would not offer us one. We were highly disappointed and after such a long trip to get there were hoping he would be kind enough to give us even the briefest of tours ( of course we were ready to pay any fee for such a service).   Mind you, they were still open and there were numerous other visitors having lunch and shopping at their spice stand. I understand it’s a family business, and they can’t accommodate everyone, and maybe we were too late, but we wish they had been a little nicer when turning us away. Their tone was very dismissive and not at all understanding that we trekked so far to visit them. Needless to say, don’t go after 4pm... and after our disappointment, we won’t be doing the drive back out there! ",0.9211,5

Secondly our plantation tour is of 1.30 hours and you have arrived after 4.00 pm and you expect us dot tour where as we did 3 tour on that day and we also informed you that we had only two gusts in one of the tour. Their were 20 happy gusts what we had on that day.

You should also have courage to tell true things that we allowed you go in farm free of cost when you requested to have round in farm.

What you told is absolutely right that people where having lunch and some of they were on counter and they all have finished their tour and they were in restaurant.

So plant it before and experience our hospitality and we will never disappoint you.

For your kind information this is not park or picknic place that you can come any time and expects our service this is working and family run spice plantation.

About my tone or voice because I had interaction with you I am having sore throats for last two day so it sound little bit roude that you didn’t understand so please be kind enough with others when you make such allegations.

We farmers always welcoming and that’s what we learned from our parents.

But you were in different mood.

You went on water fall befor because it is closing at 5.00 pm and then decide to come on farm thinking that you can do tour of farm. Plane your things properly. 

Anothe allegation you have made that you asked for private tour that’s right but you didn’t asked to do short tour, at all you are  telling false things.
Have courage to write true things.

So when you read in guide book or on trip advisor you might also read that tour of plantation also includes lunch and I think you are aware of lunch times. 
But any way thanks a lot for suggestions that we have to do tour all day up to late evening too.
But we are not gridi people and we expect extra money. 
We are very much happy in what we have.

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,tanshikarspicefarm,,,,"We all really loved it here. 5 of us stayed overnight in the two treehouses. The spice farm is really in the middle of the jungle. It’s a 3 hour drive from Candolim, but we looked on the journey as part of the adventure, and we saw the countryside, people working in Paddy fields and other crops. Our driver was half farmer half taxi driver so we were lucky to hear all about farming in India on the way. The taxi fare for both ways was £50 in total. I think that’s about average, probably you could get it cheaper but it was a nice car ( with seatbelts, not so common in India) and we felt safe with our driver who spoke excellent English. On arrival at the spice farm we were greeted with some Lemongrass tea and home grown cashews and then shown to our treehouses. It’s pretty basic but fine ( and has a flushing toilet and shower and electricity). We then had lunch. All the meals were pretty similar, all home made with plenty to choose from, and as much as you can eat. nearly all vegetarian. Vegetable curries, Daals, rice, chapattis, salad, pakoras, melon, rice pudding. We had 4 meals altogether. We had a tour of the spice farm, and Chinmay explained all about how his family have developed the farm over generations and how each generation prepares and plants for the generations to come. He knows a great deal about spices and how they are used medicinally. His wife Gauri is the culinary expert. We tasted lots of spices on the way, don’t try the chilli!! Chinmay took us into his house where he lives with his wife and two daughters so we could see a traditional Indian house which was amazing. On day 2 we had a cookery lesson, and Gauri showed us how she prepares the food for the guests and for her family. We all had a go at making a chapatti and a roti and I’ve got a much better understanding of how Indian food is made. After our cookery lesson we went on a trip on a Jeep to a waterfall. By chance they were filming a movie at the waterfall so that was a bit of extra fun meeting the film crew. The water is cold but quite shallow and lovely for swimming. It’s really beautiful, hence the movie set. It’s quite a steep walk up and down to the waterfall, though not very far. Some people we met had a three year old who managed it no bother, but it’s not suitable for anyone who’s unsteady on their feet or nervous of heights. The spice farm trip was an amazing look at the Indian countryside. If you’re into luxury or health and safety in a big way, this is not for you. There are steep drops and beasties and you are really in the jungle. Don’t forget your mosquito spray or you’ll get bitten. I only have one criticism. It’s pretty chilly at night (January) which we weren’t at all expecting, and our two blankets were too small and thin to keep us warm. Our friend said he thought he’d woken up in Inverness!! We didn’t have any warm clothes with us (it’s really hot in Candolim at night time) so we had a cold night, which could have been easily avoided with the provision of a few more ( and bigger) blankets. The whole spice farm experience for two of us including a lovely welcome, an overnight stop, four (excellent) meals, numerous pots of tea, cokes, and lemonade, the spice farm tour, the cookery lesson and the trip to the waterfall was £35. We thought we had heard wrong. So thank you Chinmay and Gauri for giving us such an amazing time. ",0.9985,5

The whole atmosphere in this place was so calm and relaxing. Totally stress free. Very friedly and polite owner welcomed us and we made a tour in the farm. His had a lot of knowledge and stories he shared with us and we learned a lot. It was interactive because there were so few of us. We all could smell and taste the spices he picked from the plants.After the tour we visited the old mud house, also very interesting. And then we had amazing lunch buffet and luckily we vere allowed to as much as we wanted because the food was so good! We also bought some spices from their spice shop and the prices vere very good, not expencive.Even tough it takes a bit travelling to get there it is so much worth it. Highly recommended.",0.9887,5

So we returned within 5  minutes stay. There was no data or call connectivity at that place and 25 kms around and this may be dangerous when your family is traveling in 2-3 cars or there is some emergency. I suggest not to waste one full day since it is not worth. And leave the place will before darkness since it is jungle area with no help seemingly visible nearby. Also there are no shops or restaurants in 30 kms around. So better to avoid since this is not what we plan to visit Goa for. Family safety and convenience is foremost. ",-0.5509,1

,,,,,"We booked to stay here for one night in a tree house. On arrival everything was a little confusing (and a little stressful) as person we first spoke with had very little English and we had no real idea what we were doing. Should you have the same then lunch is served approx 1.30pm. Dinner at approx 7.30pm. Spice farm tour we did at 3pm. Next day we were at breakfast for 9am which was followed by trip to waterfalls. So, following initial confusion everything here was amazing. Mr & Mrs Tanshikar are both wonderful and incredibly hard working people. The amount of effort that went into providing dinner and breakfast was crazy (we would have been happy with toast :- ) The tour of the farm was 100% engaging, entertaining and informative. The following day we went to the waterfalls. Nb: my wife is very scared of heights and was terrified this trip would be on high roads and what not. Turns out it isn't and we felt 100% at all times (even in the boneshaker jeep). The tree house as well was a real treat. Lets not pretend, this will not be your most comfortable night spent in India (it's a tree house) but it will be one of your most memorable. Sat on the balcony as the sun went down, listening to all the different wildlife... this is a memory I will cherish forever. Myself and my wife are both very grateful for the hospitality we received. Value for money is outstanding and this farm should be a must on your itinerary if staying in South Goa.",0.9711,5

The place is well maintained, though I think that it could be portrayed in a grander way and style considering that it is a reflection of India's defence armoury. Perhaps, the presence of educated guides who could explain how and when these marvels have been used in the past by Indian Navy would make a lot of difference in the experience.Visit during early morning or late afternoon hours so that there is respite from heat!You probably will have to exclusively plan for this as I don't think there are any nearby places to visit.🇮🇳🇮🇳",0.8309,5

There were security guards guarding this place. After receiving the entrance tickets, had seen many fighter jets, helicopters etc. that were used by the Indian Navy. It has armaments, weapons, sensors and vintage photographs. Also, there is a replica of INS Viraat warship as well as a mini AV room for the students. This museum caters to the school & college students, aviation enthusiasts, inquisitive tourists, dignitaries etc. Later on, had tea at Cockpit Cafe located within the premises. The entry fees are Rs. 30 per adult, Rs. 10 per child, Rs. 15 per student, Rs. 25 for mobile camera, Rs. 40 for still camera and Rs. 80 for videography.This museum is an interesting, but neglected place in Goa.

Though it seems to have a good collection of planes, their condition was truly pitiful. Rotting machinery all over. I even saw a man standing atop the wing of a plane clicking selfie. Come on! A museum should be engaging and interactive, but here it is left to the visitor to read through a ton of text, and I am sure not many do so as they are busy clicking pics. Honestly, that's what I did too. Because it is so far from other Goan hotspots, it is pointless to explicitly plan a visit to this museum unless you are traveling from or to Goa Airport, which is at stone's throw.

The reviews we had read said that the place was fun, but that it lacked maintenance, and we will have to agree. My boyfriend was super excited about seeing the planes and getting up close, but they were unfortunately in a dreary state.There are no modern aircrafts.Inside you get to learn about Indian military aviation history, however not in a chronological order so to me it seemed a bit messy. There are fans downstairs and air condition upstairs.The place is affordable and a fun thing to do if you want to do something besides lying on the beach and you are a aviation enthusiast!However, it would have been a whole lot better experience had they just kept the clean and maintained the aircrafts.

The beach is around 600-700m in length end to end, at low tide.Though obviously it can't be compared with the endless sandy stretches at Colva & Calangute, Bogmalo has its own charm and is perfect for visitors who do not want to travel far from the airport which is a mere 10min drive away.The beach has its fair share of shops, shacks including high end like Joets and John Seagull, a couple of star hotels and several guest houses in the vicinity.   Life guards are on duty throughout the day.  A small friendly gang of stray dogs and a couple of harmless bulls have made the beach their home!   The surrounding village still retains its old world charm and the locals are polite and friendly.On weekdays there aren't any crowds and the beach is quite  inviting, especially early in the morning.  Visitors do tend to leave their rubbish behind and   cleaners are deployed to keep the beach clean.  Unfortunately, there is no way to stop people from consuming alcohol on the beach and even worse to penalise them for leaving their bottles (glass bottles too) behind.  In the evenings, locals from Vasco and surrounds also come to enjoy the beach.  Weekends can be crowded though its fun to people watch.  In season, the local fisherfolk offer boat rides to Isla Grande which can be seen from the beach.  Dolphin watching rides are available too.  We once saw them throughout the day from the beach itself, albeit some distance off shore.  The Naval Aviation Museum is nearby.All in all, the Bogmalo Beach is nice if you are staying near the airport or dont want to travel far.",0.977,5

It's quite far from canacona and when we reached there were very few people on the beach or rather sea shore. As darkness fell, it became completely deserted and the sea became rough so I had to rush to get my children out of the water. It may be a breeding ground for turtles, so let it be that way.

The sea food especially Crabs are a must have. If you can do let them know you are arriving and how many people are there. The crabs get over in a giffy. The beach is quaint and clean. The waves are just perfect if you want to just float around and enjoy the peace and quiet. As its a nature conservation site, the beach is pretty restricted. The highlight are the turtles lay their eggs on the shore, which are clearly marked.

So it was extra special yesterday to be invited by friends to walk from Palolem to Galgibag for lunch and a swim. You need to take a small boat from Rajbag to cross the river to Talpona, but there are plenty of willing fishermen there who are more than happy to ferry you across for 50 rupees each. It took us about an hour and 15 minutes to reach Galgibag by walking mainly on the beach all the way, but there are some sections that take you through the forest and an oldy worldy village where they still draw water from a well. The beach itself is protected because of the turtle nesting sites so there are no shacks directly on the beach. However there are a couple of cafes situated amongst the trees, my favourite of which is Surya's. Yesterday we ate at Surya's uncle's place next door, Santosh's which was fine too. After lunch we continued our walk right to the end of the beach to the sheltered lagoon area for a fantastic relaxing swim and sunbathe. THAT'S when we noticed that as well as the dreadful roadworks that have cut the village of Galgibag in two (because of the new highway link road being built there) they are aiming to put a bridge over the narrow part of this stunning lagoon thereby destroying one of the last unspoilt places in the whole of south Goa. The construction of this highway is a complete travesty as it passes close to where the turtles lay their eggs and where the mangroves line the shore. All of us were deeply saddened and angered that such a dreadful road had ever been given the go-ahead in the first place. Corruption? Backhanders? Who knows? But this new highway will destroy Galgibag and already it's monstrous roadworks have taken away the pristineness of this once beautiful secluded place. Very, very sad......",0.6835,5

Although the beach is baking in the heat of the sun, but under the shades of trees, it’s really cool and relaxing. The sand is really soft, and the whole area is really clean.

The beach is long and spacious with only a few people on it the day we were there (March 2016).Although it is spacious and beautiful, the waves at Galgibaga were significantly larger than those at Patnem and Palolem (on the same day), so it might not be the best for kids if you're looking for a beach to actually swim in the ocean. There is a front area of the sandy beach (immediately off of the water) that is completely open to the sun and then a larger area behind the main sand that has huge, probably 100ft evergreen trees which give tons of shade and cooler temps. Then farther from the water, behind the fir trees is a row of restaurants. I had read Tripadvisor reviews that rated the restaurant Surya's Beach Cafe as great, but the permanent Goa residents we met all said that Santosh's (next door to Surya's) is better. We tried Santosh's and the prices were right and the beer cold, but we were slightly disappointed with the mediocre food. We didn't ask, but they were super nice people and would probably be willing to run beers back and forth to your spot on the beach if you decided to post up and have beers in the sun all day-- at least worth asking :)Overall, the beach is beautiful and pretty empty, so if you're trying to get in some rest and relaxation in the sun, this is the place. We were staying on Patnem Beach and were able to get a one-way tuk tuk ride (about 20 mins) to Galgibaga for 100 rupees.

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Siddhesh Garg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,A Pristine Beach for Some 'Me Time',"For the ones who prefer less to no crowd, Mobor Beach is a must-visit in South Goa. Facing the outer walls of The Leela hotel, Mobor Beach gives a rare glimpse of solitude. The white sand glistens under the scorching sun and has little to no humans around. My Tip:Take a book by Haruki Murakami, sunscreen, a mat, and your favourite snack (there are no dust-bins nearby so pack an extra bin-liner) on your trip to Mobor Beach. The best way to locate it is via Google Maps or asking the locals for The Leela. The lane right next to the entrance of The Leela takes you to the beach. Sun is the most friendly during early mornings and feels inviting as you are lounging on the white sand after 04.00 PM. Area of Improvement:There are no first-aid medical kits and drinking water facility available. And since it is deserted except for the guests staying at The Leela, it is best to visit before the night embraces the beach.Best,SID",0.8593,5

Even considering that the beaches of South Goa are secluded and undisturbed, Mobor is at the upper rung of solitude. The sea is calm. The shore is flat and hardly dangerous to venture into the sea and have a swim. It’s kids friendly. It’s safe. It’s clean. With the resorts of Holiday Inn and Leela Beach acting as its cover, it’s safe to assume that Mobor will always remain this way. Take a right at the gate to the Leela and you will land up at this paradise.

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Enrique,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Beachcombers Delight,"Mobor beach was our regular morning and evening walk. Going north its about 3km to Cavelossim along pristine beach front. Walk in the surf, on the soft wet sand (easy on the feet), packed sand (use footwear), or dry white sand (you'll never get there) – take your pick – with the promise of a chilled beer from one of Mobor beach shacks.Walking south is where you may pick up some sea urchin shells, starfish or even sea anemones. Why on this beach? The only reason I can think of is that this stretch of pristine beach is also at the mouth of a river, the Sal, in this case. The resulting overflow and sand deposition may be responsible for this, but I'm no hydrologist.There's also a stiff sea breeze. You can see the sand flowing over the beach and creating sandbars at the river mouth. Betul lighthouse is visible from this part of the beach. Watch the fishing trawlers as they go to and from Betul docks about a kilometer up river, and don't disturb the gents fishing on either side of the river mouth.You are alone but not anonymous. If you are a regular walker, the locals know it. Say Hi to Dominic (of Doms) for me. He's a morning walker. The women selling shell necklaces near the resorts also know how long you've been there. Before bathing check the flags. The lifeguards do a great job staying vigilant and patrolling all day. They are vigilant, a sharp whistle got me back from the fourth line of surf!And don't take too long to get here. They're extending the road from Cavelossim to reach the southern-most tip of the beach at the river mouth. Maybe then if you get up early enough you'll get to enjoy before the buses unload!",0.955,5

We loved the peace and quiet of this beach. During the day there were a few tourist (10-15) at a distance (maybe from Leela) who were making the most of water sports provided by an operator there. In the evening, we could only see 1 other couple, and pretty much had the place to ourselves. What more can you want! We found a great shack there, and the good food coupled with the peaceful sound of waves hitting the beach, and a dark night = pretty much an awesome evening!

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,yogesh k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,Beautiful Beach... Clean... Calm and Peaceful...,"There are few places as picturesque as this Mobor-Cavelossim stretch in Goa. Till 1980 this place is barren stretch of sand with one village Cavelossim not developed as a tourist spot. Then Leela, Holiday in, Dona Sylvia Resort and other 5 star hotels moved in at this place, which leads to change this area as a tourist spot.	The Mobor beach is a beautiful, peaceful and clean beach situated at the south of the Cavelossim beach. It is now one of the most happening and popular holiday destination in Goa and is known to be an ideal location for the adventure tourists. The beach is located close to the mouth of the river Sal. Good thing about this place is that this place is not yet commercialized like other beaches in North Goa. Beach is clean, quiet and peaceful, away from city chaos. This leads to this place as a far better place than the crowded north Goa beaches like Baga and Calnagute. Tourist here are mainly foreigner  with rare Indian tourist. You can sit and relaxed on the beach.	Cavelossim beach, Mobor beach, and Betul beach appear as one beach. It is logically separated by respective village area. Different names to beaches were given as per nearby village.	At the beach in Mobor one can enjoy a lot of water sports like water-skiing, wind-surfing, jet skiing, parasailing and banana boat during tourist season. Besides this one can also enjoy biking in the sands which seems to be a favourite activity of the tourists coming to Mobor beach.	The Mobor beach also has many secluded coves and is fairly isolated suitable for those in search of complete peace and relaxation. How to reach :From Dabolim Airport :Distance is 44 Kms, Pre-paid taxi will cost you Rs 1124/- for Non ACFrom Madgaon Station:Madgaon Railway station is well connected to Metro stations by rail. You can get bus to Mobor near railway station or go to KTC Madgaon Bus stand.Distance is 20 Km from Madgaon Bus stand. Auto Rickshaw outside of Madgaon Bus stand will take Rs 400/-, they charge flat Rs 20 per Km to any where in Goa.By Bus... Catch Local Bus to Mobor from Madgaon Kadamba Bus Stand, Bus ticket is RS 20/-. Buses to Mobor stands behind two wheeler parking in side the KTC stand. It tooks 1Hr 15 min to reach at Mobor.

He simply closed the gate on our face. We tried calling the manager who said that he will accommodate us only after 1 pm which was not fitting in our schedule. This clearly shows how biased and greedy the management is towards foreign tourists. They just want to mint money. Their ethics and values are gone for a toss.

The guide shows, makes you feel, smell and even eat sometimes the fruits, herbs and spices. The aroma and flavors kind of explode in your mind. While i am sure that Black Pepper is best in Calicut and so is Cardamom best in Munnar. I think Cashew is best in Goa... and obviously Feni. The only thing surprising was they harvest all this and send it to the mill... where it gets machine pressed, refined, which may not be the best way to extract the goodness and we may end up buying junk. Food served is decent and staff is welcoming... washrooms, which are western, need to be kept more clean. total charges 400 and time is 3 hours. ",0.9875,5
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Prajot Joshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,A walk to get to know about the stuff you should already know ,We liked the concept and the way guests are greeted and welcome here. The lunch served has got a great taste and the way it is served could also be fascinating for some. I feel this place is based on the premise that how ignorant we have  become with the nature and the basic understanding of it. Having seen some of the stuff that we always see well packed  in a supermarket in its original form could be interesting for many.  Just the fact that we have lost touch with nature and the basic understanding of it that we find this amusing was a bit upsetting got me. Nevertheless the location is beautiful and a must visit for city dwellers.,0.967,5

This place will make you completely relaxed from the noise and smoke from the cities.When you visit this place the host well comes you flowers and a welcome drink tea. The tea which they serve is organic and herbal which just relaxes you from the long tiring journeys.The Spice farm is a group tour. the group can be from 4 people to 10 people. and each group gets a professional and experience tour guide who explains the entire spice farm where you can see real and feel the spices which are grown naturally and organically.The other Specially of the Spice farm is that once the tour is over they serve you buffet  lunch which contain both Veg and Non Veg dishes. Most of the dishes are goan delicacies and it equivalent  to Continental taste.And the best part is the total tour comes to you with Spice farm tour and Buffet Lunch for Just Rs.400 ($6) per person which is very cheap.I suggest whoever visit Goa for the First time should add this place in their travel plan.Keep up the good work ""Tropical Spice Plantation team"".

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Lakshmi N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,A good insight on spice plantation,"Its almost an hours drive from the shores of Goa. Once you get closer to the location, the drive resembles a hilly ride! The place has a decent parking space. Once you get in, you are welcomed by the crew members with a nice welcome drink (lemon grass tea) which you don't generally get in restaurants. They group people based on your language preference (I guess they have english and hindi guides). So you might have to wait for a few minutes before they take you through the tour. The guide is really knowledgeable on the spices and the plantation. Its almost an hours walking tour as they take you through different spice trees / plants and explain how its grown / and harvested. Sometimes, you need to be lucky enough to see the real spices as certain things are seasonal. Once you are done with the tour, you get to taste a decent enough buffet lunch. If you are staying in shore side of Goa, you need half a day to cover it. So plan accordingly to spend the rest of the day so that the distance you travel is worth the trip.Its a must visit for city grown people who might not have seen plantations!!!",0.9345,5

However the signages are not adequate and neither is google map very accurate. The drive is through pleasant hilly terrain. There is adequate parking space in the premises. You have to purchase a ticket for a reasonable Rs 400. You first walk across a rather creaky walkway over a pond. On the other end girls welcome you by showering flowers on you and putting a traditional tilak ( a small paint mark)on the forehead. The premises is very cool and the staff very professional. You are first offered a pleasant warm welcome drink.Every fifteen minutes or so you are taken around on a guided tour of part of the plantation which showcases the different spices grown on a demonstration plot.The girl guide is knowledgeable and of pleasant personality. You can purchase spices and dry fruits also. After the half hour tour you are fed a hearty meal. The local buffet spread has interesting menu including two non veg items. You can purchase your drinks. The only improvement I would suggest is the washroom which needs more maintenance. Overall a worthwhile experience.,0.9772,5

I got there with my partner and she went on a 5 minute ride but I declined.  They charged 1400 IRS which was a total rip off. When alone with them after the elephant wash (which is getting in his back in a river and he chucks water over you) they started coming up to us going “give me tip , give me tip for me and the boys”.

A strong hint to give tips. The meal serve after the short tour is mass produce. Only go to this Spice Plantation if you really are very free and have nothing else to do,0.8423,5

The lunch however was terrible to say the least, the yellow rice was colored (while they claim natural), the prawn dish hardly had any prawns and the food was not tasty either.The garden visit experience was also average.

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,TrueIrishWanderer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,A great way to spend a few hours,"My wife and I visited the Tropical Spice Plantation one lovely Friday afternoon for lunch. When we arrived we walked across a long wooden bridge across a lake and were greeted by two members of staff. They ushered us to our table in the restaurant and gave us both a hot lemongrass drink. It was very refreshing. We then were taken to the buffet area and selected our food from large crock pots. There were several vegetable dishes, a prawn curry, and s chicken curry. There was also steamed rice and vegetable rice, and bread rolls. We then purchased cold drinks from the counter. After we had finished the main course the waited brought a plate of water melon pieces and two small individual tubs of ice cream. We were also served a small cup of Feni  - a local 40% alcoholic clear drink, made from distilling cashew nuts. After our meal, we were treated to a small tour of the exhibition area of the spice plantation and we learned many interesting facts about the various spices. At the end of the tour, the guide takes a ladle of cold water, taken from a crock pot, and puts the water down your back from the collar of your shirt. This is to cool your spine from the heat. I was a bit dubious about having this done, but it refreshed me and, in the heat, my shirt dried very quickly. After the spice tour, you can buy spices from the spice shop if you wish. I thoroughly enjoyed my day at the Tropical Spice Plantation and would recommend a visit to anyone. ",0.948,5

Our guide was very knowledgeable( I'm sure they all are) and gave much info on how the spice is processed and what parts are used for what, ie cooking, therapeutic oils etc.Buffet lunch was average, but then you pay less than $10 AUD to enter so you can't expect too much.

Peppercorns, prir piri and a couple of other trees that apparently would have cloves and cinnamon.  The it was back for lunch, which was a bit grim, very sloppy curry, and then the gift shop to sell you stuff.  You didn't get to see the actual farm at all, apparently it is 760 acres",-0.5699,1

The walk across the lake, on the wooden footbridge, is such a crowd-puller! The excellent photo ops keep people floating back n forth over the bridge creating a constant jam 😋We reached around midday on a Tuesday and the place was teeming with tourists.. Our guide Pooja made the walk around the plantation very interesting with her anecdotes and animated conversation! She was well acquainted with the spices and herbs and answered questions from guests enthusiastically! At the end of the tour, we were ushered to the open dining area for a buffet meal.. The food is traditional Indian.. well-cooked, simple and tasty.. i ended up eating twice as much (its so hard to find non-spicy non-greasy meals!) There is a kiosk for buying fresh spices n a plethora of oils produced at the plantation .. and i loaded up on all things exotic 😎Its a well-organised copiously-green place to spend 2 hours learning about ingredients that set our Indian dishes abuzz, with never an insipid moment!

On the other side you're greeted with a shower of petals and a talika.It's fascinating to see all the plants we cook with every day, but never think about where, or how, they grow: black pepper, cardamom, turmeric, vanilla. It's like something from the pages of The Mistress of Spices.At the end of the tour, you get a refreshing dose of cool lavender water down your back and treated to lunch, served on recycled palm leaves.

However, what separates Din Brothers is their honesty and integrity. We had been looking for wedding bands and had started to give up hope as the prices in all the jewellers were similar if not higher than the UK!! One evening, while walking past Zabir's shop, I asked the gold price per gram, and we were immediately quoted half the price of others in the area. Having researched the price of gold earlier that day in the local newspaper, I knew he was being honest  and not trying to take advantage of the fact that we were tourists. He took time to talk to us about how the rings would be made and how the price is calculated. He even reassured us that they would be completed on time or that our deposit would be 100% refunded. In less than 24 hours, our rings were handmade and to an outstanding standard. we absolutely love them. The craftsmanship is turely a cut above the rest. We will definitely be buying more in the future. If ever in Cavelossim South Goa and looking to purchase jewellery, then I recommend you pop in.",0.9815,5

We intend to get married in the very near future so the main purpose of our holiday on this occasion was to have our weddings rings designed and made there. Our next dilemma was which jeweller could we put our trust in to do this for us. We have used various local outlets on previous visits but we felt for this purchase we needed to really check out what was available to us, and as such we happened to come across the Din Brothers.We were greeted very warmly by Shah and straight away we felt confidence and trust in this local family business, which has a very professional but friendly approach.We came to a decision on roughly what we would like but then Shah suggested ideas that would totally personalize our rings and I have to say that his input and expert advice was excellent.Just before we left for home we collected our rings and were over the moon with them. Not only that but the price was very reasonable considering the quality and the time with design etc.In conclusion I would have no hesitation in recommending this jeweller and when we return to Goa we will now only use this business our number 1 in Cavelossim.Superb and thank you.",0.9859,5

I took photos of a pendant I had been given 10 years previously, for which I had been unable to find matching earrings. The photos were from all angles and against a ruler to show the true size. The jeweller discussed my requirements and made recommendations, but ultimately the remit was for earrings (and a bracelet - I got carried away!) to look like they were part of a set with the pendant.  The price was fair, as mentioned and I paid a deposit.  The jeweller made both items within 3 days and the results are stunning,  They are the work of a true artist who knows his craft.  I cannot praise him highly enough. If you are thinking of buying jewellery, don't waste your time elsewhere.  This is the place to go.",0.9423,5

Din_Brothers_Jewellers_and_Gold_Smiths-Cavelossim_South,Julie S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Well over due review,"I’ve been visiting  Cavelossim now for 15 years, and for the last 10 years have not missed a visit to the shop for a catch up with Zubair and the boys. In the early years my husband, friends and I would walk pass, never ventured in just said hello exchanging banter etc.  Then 10 years ago my friend and I went in, sat down, tried everything on, but I still couldn’t be tempted. My friend bought a ring and was extremely happy with the valuation when she got home. Needless to say that day was the start of a wonderful friendship.Every year we would buy the odd silver chains, have items cleaned or repaired etc, never spent a lot of money but it didn’t matter to them because our friendship was more important. Then this year to celebrate a special birthday and anniversary, I had what I always wanted, a diamond solitaire ring. It took me days deciding, then after I explained to Zubair how I wanted it, he made one, and it was perfect. But stressed I was under no obligation to purchase as it was £2,500. My husband who is not the slightest bit interested in jewellery, was well impressed too. LolI paid for a private valuation back home through a well known  high street jeweller. He wrote down a figure and then he asked would I mind telling him what I paid. I did, he raised an eyebrow and passed me what he had written. I was totally speechless, and over whelmed, far more than what I expected.I have the highest regards for Zubair, his brother Mubaishe, whom I got to speak to more in November, and kindly arranged a WiFi dongle for us.Their nephew Wafiq, whom if he’s not in shop you ‘ll see him down Mikes shack on the beach, a lovely young man.I cannot recommend Zubair and the  Din Bros highly enough, for their quality, service, and most of all the kindness we have received over the years.They will be happy to exchange money for you, and advise on anything you want to know about the area.Oh, and last but not least a special mention to Ali the Taylor, next door. My husband finally had 2 shirts made with him, after years of bartering and the quality was superb. I’d like to wish them good luck with the new shop, it looked amazing just before we left, and the refurbishment of the old one.See you next year, to carry on where we left off, with the eternity ring.",0.9985,5

What was good - . Divar island is for peace lovers, it shows u the other side of Goa away from commercial crowd and beaches .it is Green, cute, beautiful..The age old buildings and churches here can take ur breath away, every building is competing with the other in terms of design and colors ... a photographers paradise and feast fr an eye. The ferry from Raibandar to Divar is an experience by itself ... takes about 8-10 minutes to cross the other side . . Ferry services are available till 12:30am ... special ferry services available too, no charges fr humans ... 10 bucks fr car.. There is a 5 star resort ""Devayaa"" or something similar in d island. Fantastic roads in the island What's not there : . Availability of a good Goan style restaurant, there are none, there was one S M Harmalkars which served good BF but the rest were disappointing, . While we did not explore the island much, there's hardly anything u can do except fishing, swim in a pond, visit a church / view point.. Travel off and on the island can get tiring as we did it fr 3 days ... can get very boring in 2 days .

Its free ferry for humans & two wheelers , only for cars you need to buy tickets. It take just 5-10 mins to reach Divar. From there it's almost 10 mins drive to village.  You need to have your own vehicle , as I could not find any cab or rickshaw on the island. Please note that there is no fuel station or petrol pump. You get petrol in bottles at couple of places , need to ask for this , no boards or signage .What to see & doThere is no major sightseeing except for a church. Just ride aimlessly ( I strongly recommend bikes) , enjoy the lush green scenic views , beautiful Portuguese style houses ( really beautiful, u feel like owning one), roads are narrow not much wide but in good condition. Its exceptionally clean. You need max 2 hours to complete your visit to island. Where to EatI could not find any café or restaurant where I could have had a nice meal. Not sure if there are hotels or homestays. i could see few on tripadvisor but couldn't see them while i visited. Carry your own food /drinks on safer side.Overall, it was a very very different and unique experience. Suitable for kids as well.Please note: you don't get island type of feel here, it's more like a old portuguese village, there is no beach.",0.9775,5
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,sachin padti,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,"Scenic ride,  unexplored goa","divar island,  a small island about 10 km from panjim is an unexplored beauty of Goa.  If u have seen the movie finding fanny you will know that , the shooting was done in this island.  The best thing to do is just take a bike and keep riding any where and you don't have to worry about getting lost because eventually you will end up at any of the ferry points which will take you towards panjim. The best ferry point to reach this island is at old Goa near basilica of bom Jesus. The scenery,  paddy filelds, the vintage Portuguese houses , the real goa and the people you can enjoy all this while driving or riding through the narrow roads of this island.  There are some beautiful church,  temples as well as historic places to visit. If you go there please don't litter cos this is a beautiful place and very clean. Just take the free ferry ride (for car you have to pay ) and get lost in this beautiful island.  For some more pictures of Goa,  follow me on instagram @saclorine. ",0.9885,5

Enchanting right from the time we turned off the highway towards Old Goa and rode over the centuries old causeway, which at one time was the longest bridge in Asia. Then we reached the jetty and ferry was just about to leave. I revved up my trusty Bullet into 1st gear and rode over the ramp into the ferry boat. Bike on its stand, we went up to top of the ferry boat and enjoyed the lovely ride to the wonderful island of Divar. We rode around the island, through all its quaint little winding roads and got transported back in time. I think we were the only tourists on the island that day and it just felt as if we've stumbled onto a unknown treasure. Stopped a local chai shop for vada and chai. Went up to see the old church and mandir. Great views from the church. Some guys were putting up flowers for a wedding! We rode back to the ferry boat with a smile on our faces. We had captured a piece of old world charm in the camera of our memories. Thank you to anyone and everyone who have helped keep this beautiful place untouched by the scourge of commerce.",0.9878,5

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Guneet K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,There is a paradise on the other side of Mandovi river,"For a peace and quiet seeker like me, Goa hasn't been the first choice ever for a beach holiday. In my head, Goa has always been about the parties. But on a recent business trip to Goa, I came across an article on Divar island in the airline magazine. So on my day off,   my friends and I decided to explore this island. We hired a car. The magic of the journey starts at the ferry point itself. The ferry ride is short but memorable. It leaves every 15 mins. You take your car on the ferry for 20 rupees. Its this massive, platform ferry. Divar is a quiet village. We didn't see too many people as we entered and it was a Sunday. The church at the top of the hill is one of the most beautiful points I've been to. It gives a 360 degree view across the Mandovi river. The church, itself, is an old, majestic building. Unfortunately, driving uphill, the car started giving trouble. While my friends were panicking about the smoke coming from our car, the generally super anxious me was just excited about being on the hilltop.  It was all so awe inspiring and slightly overwhelming in certain ways. A group of village women was chatting after Sunday morning church and guided us to the nearest and the only mechanic on the island. they gave us directions. The beauty and charm of Divar are as much in its old majestic buildings and natural aura as it is in the simplicity and warmth of the residents of Divar. Everybody knows everybody and we finally reached the mechanic's place. He was a bike mechanic but agreed to see our car. His associate kick started our car and refused to take remuneration. He also did warn us to not drive too much. We took the risk because we had come all this way to Divar and we went further to other places like the step well and this temple at the edge of the river. Then on our way back, our car broke again. There were these two gentlemen who were going in a car. They stopped by, spoke to the car rental fellow and got our issue solved. They also volunteered to drop us at the ferry point because we were carrying all our luggage with us. My point is that despite the inconveniences caused by our car, this was a magical trip because of the people and the beauty. It's a happy place. Isn't that why we travel- in the search for happiness?  (P.S. The nice people who dropped us to the ferry point organise festivals in Goa. Do check out their facebook page.

My cousin lives there, and this meant spending some days during the school vacations, fishing, swimming, football etc.For decades, the villagers refused the govt's generous offer to build a bridge from Old Goa. They were afraid that an additional connection to the world would overrun their quaint, contend, beautiful island life. They travelled in those blue ferries that would frequently get swept by tides etc. But no bridge they insisted.

This island hasn't yet fallen prey to tourist explosion and is relatively quaint and charming. It can only be accessed from a Ferry from Ribbandar (I have heard the ferry escorts to the island from other side of the Mandovi as well). Once on the Island you get to see amazing Portuguese colonial architecture and for a moment you can be mistaken where you really are..as the usual chaos of most of the indian towns is missing.

Arossim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,G A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Quiet Beach,"I went to the Arossim Beach last week when Cyclone Kyarr was threatening to descend upon Goa's sandy shores.  The sea was churning and even at low tide, the water pushed well into the beach front.  Even so, we had some moments when the tide was out and the beauty of the sandy stretch from Velsao - Cansaulem - Arossim - Utorda was clearly revealed.Arossim beach is a few minutes walk from the Heritage Village Resort.  A good tar road leads to the beach, however you need to cross a small rickety wooden bridge over a shallow drainage creek (nullah) to get to the sandy area.  It is probably dry in summer and winter, but this year due to the extended rains, it was full of dubious looking waste water!  The morning after the cyclone hit the coast, the bridge had collapsed and the tide had come all the way across the sandy beach.There weren't any shacks on the beach even though one is clearly visible on Google Earth.  Perhaps they set up temporarily in the summer and winter season.  The beach is beautiful and clean and there were hardly any humans early in the morning.  We were lucky to sea  a rainbow in the sea!  We walked up to Majorda Beach one morning.  This necessitated crossing a couple more shallow drainage creeks, one more at Arossim and another at Utorda beach.  We could have walked further but it started to rain and we didnt want to risk being caught in the high tide with the water coming all the way up to the beach front.  I would like to return in dry and cool weather and walk as far south as possible, perhaps even up to Colva, that would be great.",0.9773,5

Margao_Market-Margao_South,Shihtzuv,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Beware of touts ,"Gandhi and New Market are very colourful and busy markets in Margao.  Gandhi is mainly fruit and veg but New Market is an indoor labyrinth of spices, clothes and much more.  A magnet for tourists but easy to get disoriented inside.  Beware of those who approach you and engage you in conversation- they are being paid to lead you to shop owners who don’t trade in the market - if you do follow and go to their shop on whatever promise you’ve been offered you will be ripped off royally.  Even down to henna actually not being real henna in the tube.  I have travelled extensively throughout India and was very disappointed in such blatant attempts to scam and cheat tourists.

Almost all  the local buses from south Goa ply to this place.  Public transport is best as parking is a huge issue.  A riot of colour and activity, it reflects the lifestyle and culture of the Goan people.  The list for shopping in this market never ends.  Many of the shops are grouped by type of goods. Coconuts, pork sausages, fresh pork, wine, jaggery – yellow and black, mounds of spices, heaps of various dried red chillies, nuts and dried fruit, papads, herbs, berries, clothing, shoes and bags, hats, artificial jewellery and hosiery. Wedding season, brides visit the glass bangle sellers.  Other than livestock, everything else you can think of is sold here including kitchen and bathroom related items.     Most of the prices are fixed.  No need to haggle in this one.  You won’t be cheated except maybe at the section where they sell Goan sweets.  These women play tug of war with customers, each owner trying her best to entice the often bewildered client to her stall.  Buy your sweets from the popular Jackris on the main road or from the single women sitting alongside the alleys.   There is an unexplained excitement of squeezing through the narrow lanes to buy items.  Feeling thirsty ?  Head to the fresh lime soda shop which is near the one and only antique shop in the market.  One section sells fresh flowers and garlands.  Outside the market is a small Hindu Temple.  Here you will find Goan women selling home processed pure coconut oil, plants and pots, home grown vegetables and fruit.  The locals buy roosters and hens here.  Margao Market will add some of the finest memories to your Goa tour.",0.9612,5

We had high expectations from the food but it was way below the expectations. I guess offering unlimited food degrades the quality drastically. Food was horrible, chicken was not even cooked properly, vegetarian was tasteless. Only good thing was the mumbai chat as the raw material must have been bought from outside. Entertainment was boring. There were very few dances. Dancers were taking more time in changing vs dancing. The song was of 3-4 mins and the changing time was 15. In one hour slot of dancing, they only performed 3 songs. Live music was OK.I am not a big time casino lover so I only spent 1 hour in casino. The casino was 5 star. They don’t have a lot of tables but the dealer was helpful and energetic. This was the only best part.Being the cheapest casino in the area, there will be crowd from package tours. Staff was very friendly and supportive. They attended guests nicely. I don’t think I will visit again but my 2 cents, do not have high expectations from food and entertainment.

My wife and I were surprised at how luxurious it was on the inside. It is also cheaper in terms of its packages than its sister casino, the Deltin Royale, but it is a little bit smaller and cosier at the same time. We had decided to have a different Goa trip this time round, and part of that was visiting the two Deltin casinos. Aside from the pricing and size difference, the Jaqk is as much as if not more fun than the Royale. In fact, I would rate the food and the live performances better at the Jaqk, though the Royale was no slouch by any standard.

In Goa, a church and convent dedicated to St Francis of Assisi was built in 1661. The church is still basically a church; the convent now houses an archaeological museum. We bought our entry tickets (Rs 10 per person; children below 15 enter free of charge) and first went in to have a look at the church (though you can see this without having to buy a ticket). It’s a beautiful church, with some fine old paintings, and some statues of various saints, including (naturally) St Francis himself. Photographs are allowed in the church, but not in the museum itself. The museum is not a huge one, but it’s a good collection of artefacts from across eras of Goan history. It starts with various Hindu sculptures, such as hero stones, depictions of deities (some beautifully carved stone statues here), and so on. Following this are artefacts from the era of Portuguese rule in Goa: coats of arms, Catholic sacramental emblems, figurines of Jesus, Mary and the saints, and—most arresting—larger-than-life bronze statues of two famous people: the Portuguese poet Luiz Vaz de Camoes (who wrote in praise of Goa) and the first Viceroy of Goa, Afonso de Albuquerque. On the first floor is a portrait gallery, lined with rather uninspiring portraits of the governors and viceroys of Goa. There are also some currency notes from Portuguese India, as well as information about (and highly enlarged copies of) postage stamps from the same period. On the ground floor, besides a statue of St Catherine (which stands in a covered pavilion in the middle of a grassy yard) are two galleries. The Children’s Activity Centre is one of these galleries, though it has little that’s child-friendly here, just a few adult-size chairs and a large table. But it does have some interesting aerial views of Goan monuments, including a stunning pre-Portuguese Mahadeva Temple. Also on the ground floor is a small but interesting Maritime Gallery, which has loads of information on all things maritime: the maritime traditions and routes of everyone from the Arabs to the Chinese to (of course) the Portuguese; what they traded in, what trade routes they followed, what nautical instruments they used, and so on. There are old anchors on display, and, in the centre of the room, a small-scale model of a medieval sailing vessel, masts and sails and cross-section of decks and all. An interesting museum, and since it’s small, easily managed in less than an hour.",0.993,5

Fruit is fantastic. Just make sure you wash it yourself with clean water. There are people here selling bottles of water .. but .. the water looks very... green 👀 some bottles I had to look twice at, even triple and noticed some bottles even had mould around the bottle tops, like you just wouldn’t ever chance it in a million years and even longer than that.

Our main aim was to buy local Goan sweets and spices which we were able to do after a walk about to see what all was available. Well everything really! We hit the jackpot inside the flower market when we chanced upon a Goan sweet shop called Pascoal Bakery. They had all the local Goan sweets (various combinations of jaggery, coconut and milk) we were looking for, and they were absolutely fresh. Right opposite was a stall selling fresh Goan bread and right next door was a stall selling freshly ground Goan masala mixes. So we were able to complete our shopping within 1 1/2 hours.

Mapusa_Friday_Bazaar-Mapusa_North,Bob the Brit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Bazaar,"(Kshmr, Marnik) - Mapusa Friday BazaarI was visiting Goa out of season, early September. Most of the shops were yet to reopen, many of the beach bars had yet to receive their licences and the tourist markets - I was told - weren’t happening. So I asked a taxi driver (AJ) outside my hotel (Santiago ‘Beach’ Resort) to take me to the Friday market in Mapusa - pronounced ‘Mapsa’. It was a twenty minute or so drive, and when we arrived, around ten thirty, he was unable to park so we agreed to meet up in an hour. I figured an hour would do it. Where to start about the Mapusa Bazaar?Firstly it’s pretty darned large, verging on the huge, but well laid out in a grid. I first encountered dozens of stall holders selling clothes, then fruit and veg, then spices, herbs, plants, bangles, then hardware - knives, pots, ropes and the occasional tech stall offering SIM cards. There are a number of permanent shops that help define the grid layout. Secondly - you’d forgotten I was in list mode, so had I - I was the only Caucasian face I saw all morning, but at no time did I feel intimidated or threatened. I even haggled and bought a chapati pan to make my own flatbreads - down from 190 Rupees to 150 - a little under two quid. Thirdly, it’s an assault on all the senses, sights, sounds, smells, flavours - I was offered some fresh cinnamon that tasted like Dentyne chewing gum, I’d quite forgotten. Finally, unless you’re married (as I once was) to the Captain of the Olympic Shopping Team, then an hour or so is enough to experience everything.A great Friday morning out - highly recommended.",0.1602,4

For our visitors from abroad, these colorful, tightly crammed markets may be an attraction, but for Indians, it is pretty much what we are used to.The market had its attractions, with fish, vegetable, sweets and decorative items sellers sitting cheek by bowl, selling their various purchases. One needs to bargain hard, but I saw that most shop-owners were content if one decided to pass on their shop. The reason for this is that they feel there are always tourists willing to pay top dollar for their stuff.Compared to what I heard, I felt the place was more hype than substance. In the evening, most shops closed early. Items such as cashews and Goan sweets such as Bebinca and Dodol were being sold at rates higher than in more touristy areas.

Mapusa_Friday_Bazaar-Mapusa_North,Mabla3,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Shantadurga Devi of Mapusa in Goa,"Shantadurga Devi of Mapusa in Goa is a pilgrim's' delightShantadurga Devi or Santeri as she is called by locals of Mapusa (Mapsakars) is the most revered form of the goddess Durga. She is said to have settled a fierce fight between Shiva and Vishnu by holding them apart by standing in the middle. (She must have been very strong to do that). The Hindu Goans believe she is the goddess of education, prosperity, beauty and wealth. She has one of the calmest faces I ever seen in a form of Durga. Like mother earth she sits in a nine yard green sari listening to devotees at Dhargal a few kilometers from Mapusa market. The deity was earlier sitting in a large courtyard of a rich merchant in Mapusa market until 1566. During the Portuguese invasion, and subsequent conversion of Hindus; she was stealthily shifted to Dhargal situated in the principality of Sawantwadi belonging to the Marathas. She was the family goddess of Gaud Saraswats (to which I belong) who earlier settled in Goa from the Saraswat region in the north west of India. But, the Saraswats left Goa and migrated elsewhere like South Kanara in Karnataka and parts of Kerala between 1566 to 1756 to escape Portuguese Inquisition. I went to see her original abode near Mapusa market where she is supposed to walk in the night and protect the people of Goa. The Friday market day at Mapusa has continued its tradition from ancient times to this day due to her blessings. Shanta Durga is associated with Shri Bodgeshwar Baba who blesses and grants wishes who visit them and believe in them. I visited both the temples and offered five bananas, five betel leaves, one supari and broke a coconut each on either side of the temple as directed. Shanta Durga told me to plant a Tulsi plant in front of my house (which I had done earlier but of late neglected as I was not present here) and prayed there would good rain in all parts of the country including Goa. I hope she hears me and we have ample drinking water in Bangalore and all the states of the country including Tamil Nadu. Mapusa before the advent of the Portuguese was a pilgrims' delight with so many temples dotting the countryside. There is still a freshwater spring running under the buildings near the Mapusa market and the various buildings surrounding it. Recently, I saw the fresh water gushing out when they were repairing the road in front of the entrance to the market.",0.9911,5

Museum_of,Nanditasr,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,"Funky, with interesting snippets","The place is more a modern art gallery than a museum. Very interesting to see how they have used waste material and discarded items to create all the exhibits. The short film is a great way to understand the philosophy and approach of the artist-cum-curator, Dr. Subodh Kerkar. Much of Goa's (and India's) history and culture is reflected in this modern art, right from the humble chilli, to cotton, to ""Roman Catholic Brahmins"". The place is a bit remote, and very few people seem to know of it, so be sure to have your own transport (or walk 5 km, as I did) and Google maps!",0.7823,5
Museum_of,ninamukherji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Museum of Goa - must see,"Museum of Goa is located in North Goa. A pleasant building with multiple stories. The theme is on Goa, it's links to its Portuguese past, the sea and other quirky things. The sea formed a major part  of the artworks and display. Some fascinating bits of work included the chinaware rare pieces which the artist had placed at the bottom of the ocean in a metal cage for 6 months. He says that when he removed them he found the ocean had filled them with oysters and states that the ocean is a partner in creating his artwork. Another very interesting piece was the Natals display.. The staff were very helpful and gave interesting nuggets of info about the art that was on display. I loved the colourful chillies hanging from the ceiling and the pepper cross. The carpet of mussel shells was dynamic and enchanting and the wall made of plastic bottles (made to look like a wall of wild flowers) was unexpectedly beautiful.  The artist Subodh Kekkar was there when we went. He was very friendly, down to earth and easy to talk to. There's a little cafe attached to the museum. The top floor had a lovely view of the surrounding area - trees and homes surrounding the gallery. They conduct several talks and workshops as well. Though it's not a very large museum and one can do it in 45 minutes to an hour. I would suggest taking an hour or a little more to walk around and soak in the beautiful works of this museum. The place has a soothing and calming atmosphere about it. There is a small store attached that sells prints, natural soaps, jewellery and a few other things.

It houses a rich collection of artwork by the owner, depicting incidents in Goa's history and people's lifestyle. Many of the sculptures are truly eye-catching, of which ones that stood out to me were Goa's Ark, the Motorcycle Pilot, Old Man and the Fish and the Chillies installations.Apart from that, there was also a good collection of paintings by the owner's father, a noted artist in his own right. Many items are for sale. The place has a friendly vibe and is a good place to spend approx. 1.5 hours. The entrance fees is Rs. 100 for Indians and there are no separate charges for photography.I found the various artworks to be well-organized and enticing interest. Kudos to the owners for the same.

It certainly did get me curious, and I made it a point to take time out for a visit during my recent trip. Located not so far from Saligao or the Calangute beach belt, a trail of blue mermaids at strategic points form markers to find the museum, which is located in the Pilerne industrial area. But do keep in mind, it is not some place that is easily accessible ( given Goan taxis charge a bomb for the shortest possible distance) without your own transport. The collection on display is quite an interesting and eclectic mix of sculpture, paintings and installations which make for artists' expression of what Goa mean to them. But the building itself is quite uninspiring and already had huge damp patches on the top level ceiling right at the start of the monsoon season. Not a good sign for a new building which houses a  collection of expensive artwork. Staff around too looked a little disinterested considering this is a brand new initiative. I like to be optimistic and hope these are just teething problems, and this museum will soon become the must visit destination for all art lovers visiting Goa.",0.981,5

Subodh and his wife Sarita had come home for lunch one Sunday and they had mentioned that MoG had just been opened and it was the largest gallery of personal art. In this case out of all Subodh's creations. Paintings, photographs, sketches, lithographs, installations, sculptures-you name it,  it's all there, created, curated  and displayed. I have met very few people like Subodh, one who has both artistic sense and commercial sensibility in abundance. And I'm hoping he will builds this place into a vibrant engaging creative hub, like none other. He is already on track, every sunday they organise programmes which are interesting, a bit hatke as we say in Hindi, and engaging. On 7th august for instance, we met a young couple, Kyla and Tavish who presented a short form of theatre which lasted probably ten mins and it was mostly possible conversations. They have music classes, art classes, lectures, documentaries, conversations. The world suddenly is filled with exciting possibilities and it is really hard top keep track of everything that's happening around us. So it's awesome that people like Subodh are curating to bring them on a platter so our generation does not have to have FOMO!!! And that he's doing it in a gorgeous place like MoG, well , what can one say except a thunderclap and a prayer, may his tribe increase!!!One sour note however. Don't like either the way their cafe looks or does (Om Made Cafe). Please get them to revamp or get someone who fits into your ethos, Subodh. ",0.995,5

When one approaches the 17th century church from the river walking across the Viceroy’s Arch on the left hand side, the sight of this church is unmistakable for its unique dome shaped structure, only of a kind in Goa. Below the dome is a fresh water well.It has more sedate locale from the hustle-bustle of its neighbouring Se Cathedral, the largest church in Goa and Basilica of Bom Jesus. This church has some similarity to St Peter’s Basilica at Vatican City. As one faces this church, just outside its precinct is a small arched structure considered to be the Gate of Yusuf Adil Shah Palace, the former ruler of Bijapur in the late 15th and early 16th century when Goa was part of the Bijapur Sultanate. The motifs on the gate appears to be that of some Indian style carving often observed in temple architecture",0.8979,5

They were not permitted to work in Golconda, so they came to Goa on 25th October 1640& they began the construction of a hospital but the local Viceroy stopped their activities in 1643 and asked them to leave Goa in 1645. However their  leader went back to Portugal to explain to the King, Dom João IV, that it would be in the interest of Christian religion if they were allowed to work in Goa together with the Portuguese priests.Impressed by the determination of the Italian friar, the King gave permission to build the hospital in 1650.

The wooden sculptures inside is breath taking. Some old paintings have been hung on the walls. The private quarters adjacent to the church are pleasant too.

But what is most amazing about it is the architecture, as golden hour light falls on it the whole facade literally glows with golden white hues. Photographer`s delight. Once you enter inside make sure you look in all directions because it has something to offer. Guard tells me that mass is held on request and this is not a ""regular"" church.

St_Cajetan_s_Church-Old,Myo M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Solo,"With a ""beautiful"" front yard garden :)","Among all the churches of Old Goa, this one has the ""most"" beautiful front yard featuring a lovely garden with a life-sized statue of the saint (who the church was named after); and in a way, it's also ""grander"" than the other churches since it has a dome above.Inside the Church though, you'll see things ""less glittering"" compared to Basilica of Bom Jesus and especially Se Cathedral, but still no less impressive than those of the other churches is the ""main structure"" at the altar area at the far end with sculptures of angels carved on its face and a big crown on top; also to be seen are panels (maybe some are like secondary altars) on the two sides along the length of the Church, some depicting the saint and some the Crucifixion, and some big paintings on the walls depicting the life of the saint.This church is just a ""little bit"" out of the way from Old Goa's main area kind of ""clustered"" with Basilica of Bom Jesus (with the tomb of St. Francis Xavier inside), Se Cathedral (with ""glittering"" panels depicting saints & the Crucifixion) and Church of St. Francis of Assisi (with a ""museum of Goa"" in one part of the Church), but it's still very much in a walking distance from those (just about a 5-minute walk all the way to the right on the backstreet after exiting from the back side of Se Cathedral); also after this church (which you should do after those three main churches), another one worth checking out is Church of St. Augustine (just a ruin but still very much worth going to with its pretty tall tower) about a half-hour walk west from here (you'll have to go through the ""main area"" with the three churches again).The direct bus from Panjim takes only like 20 minutes; but if you're coming anywhere from North Goa (like I did, setting out from Anjuna where I stayed while in Goa), you'll first have to take the bus to Mapusa (which is like the ""transportation hub"" for North Goa) and then the buses from Mapusa to Panjim and from Panjim to Old Goa.",0.9629,5

Old Goa has the famous Cathedral with the remains of St Francis Xavier-that is NOT this church. But if you are visiting Old Goa there are many churches all visible and walkable so just go from one to the next!  This one is farther back to the NE direction and had few people. There was only only other person walking around so it was very quiet. The door was open, and hardly anyone around.  It appeared to very well kept and has buildings to the side.  I suggest you go to all the churches to give you an idea of the time periods and styles. The first is a small old stone church, very basic but from the early 1500s!  This is more recent. Generally there is info on the churches year of construction, etc.  Its probably a 5 or 6 minute walk from the next nearest church, very easy!",0.8502,5

St_Cajetan_s_Church-Old,GuelphTraveller,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Solo,Bad Church Attitude,In a country that prays for economic help you would think there would be respect for and consideration for tourists. On the day that I visited this church there was one car parked right in front of the church and in a non-parking zone. This was the Director's car. Despite asking three times if it could be moved and including watching the Director walk right by it - it was made very clear to me that the Director was far to grand and arrogant to consider such a thing for a mere tourist. It is too bad the church does not understand that it is tourists who are bringing employment and business opportunities to their parishoners.Otherwise the church itself is lovely with beaytiful white interiors that highlight a number of baroque style altars and shrines as well as early paintings. The building was constructed in 1661 and has a resemblence to St Peter's in Rome. There are also attractive gardens.,0.9612,5

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,rkmanchi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Private beach that’s secluded because of rocks. Good walks but too many dogs,"Ozran beach is a bit of a mixed bag. But that’s what I would say even about the most popular beaches in North Goa, so Ozran is worth a consideration The beach gets separated from its neighbours like Anjuna and Vagator on account of rocks on either side. This makes the beach private and sparse. The sand is blackish and the sea can be rough sometimes and a rock isn’t too far. But the shore is flat so it’s not going to drown you easily, making this beach safer. There are a few shacks and during the peak season you get the usual booze+beach bed+massage here. But the shacks have been getting away with being very irresponsible with their trash management and that attracts dogs. I haven’t ever been attacked by one but the dogs aren’t friendly with each other and you can sometimes land up in the middle of a dog fight, pun intended. If you are upto it, you can trek over the rocks on the right of Ozran and that will take you into Vagator with a great view of the Chapora Fort. This beach is larger and more habitated.

The artefacts primarily covered the Transportation aspects as well as included the day-day chores not limited to the Cooking aspects, sanitization, eating habits, medical needs, recreational facilities, communication protocols, armory, fishery, plantation and agricultural aspects. They also had a Cafe but was closed due to renovation work as well as due to Covid. Think they should start that and have Light refreshments to offer . Was astonished to understand from Mr. Gomes that this was just 10% of his personal collection and wherever possible all these artefacts have been restored . Located quite close to the Colva Beach , tickets are priced at 300 each and is suitable for all age groups. It was truly a fascinating experience and to dwell into the rich history of Goa was quite enlightening..",0.9851,5

This museum was founded in 2010. It was about an hour's drive to get this museum from our ship as the museum is located in Benaulim. When we arrived the founder,  artist-curator-restorer Victor-Hugo Gomes introduced us to the concept and the idea behind this museum.  Goa Chitra's collection includes local carriages, carts,  pottery, farming tools, musical instruments, furniture and other memorabilia. It also showcases an organic farm which is used to cultivate various vegetables, herbs, spices, sugarcane, and rice—all staples of the Goa area. We were shown around the museum by a tour guide.  The museum contains also contains a gift shop that sells products made by local  artisans.  As this museum is based on the personal collection of Victor-Hugo Gomes, and contains over 4000 items, it reminded me of the antique section of farmer's markets in Canada.

They have also tried to explain the artifacts with descriptions wherever possible.The setup of the museum is in a beautifully house, which has its own water harvesting.The staff is warm and welcoming, the guided tour is very informative. The rooms are literally crammed with artifacts, and if you have have a liking for how things used to work in the old world then this is the place for you.I have lost count of time all three times i visited.I read a few posts that say that the entry fees are high. My take is looking at what and the way the artifacts are maintained, and knowing that it is private museum, i think the fee is well worth it.More over i have learnt that the management take in the school children at discounted prices.

It finally fell 250 years later. Then, after another century, the façade collapsed. Today a lone bell tower stands teeth bared, accursed to its fate. Because of its ghostly appearance, the church has been used as a shooting location for the film, ‘Gumnam’.Definitely a hidden gem in Goa.PS: I am not sure what romantic angle Rohit Shetty saw in this location but he used it for the song, ‘Saathiya’ from the film ‘Singham’.

Not much is left to look at architecture Marvel but it is a must see place that speaks eloquently of the past.  The church was built on top of the Monte Santo (Holy Hill), between 1597 and 1602 by Augustinian friars who landed in Goa in 1587. The church was abandoned in 1835 after the Portuguese government of Goa began evicting many religious orders in Goa under its new repressive policies. The subsequent neglect caused the vault of the church to collapse in 1842. The body collapsed soon after and by 1871, the bell was moved from the tower to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church in Panjim, where it remains to date. In 1931, the facade of the church and half the tower collapsed and by 1938, most of the other parts had also collapsed. Currently only half the tower remains, and it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Goa. ",-0.9768,1
Church_and_Monastery_of_St_Augustine-Panjim_North,Madhulika L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,A stunning glimpse of a ruin,"One of the most important historic areas in Old Goa was ‘Holy Hill’, home to several churches, convents, and other places of religious significance, dating back to the early years of the Portuguese presence in Goa. Of these, one of the most interesting are the ruins of Nossa Senhora da Graca, ‘Our Lady of Grace’, better known as the St Augustine Church, since it was built by the Friars of the Augustine orders who arrived in Goa in 1587 and began building this massive church ten years later. It took five years to build, and was consecrated in 1602.The church began falling into a state of disrepair and neglect in the early 1800s. In 1824, the vaulted roof collapsed, and after that, the rest of the church followed suit. Today, the most prominent structure that still remains is the 46 mt tall bell tower, one of four towers that was part of the church. Fortunately, most tourists focus on the Basilica of Bom Jesus and Sé Cathedral, and very few come here. This is therefore a relatively uncrowded spot, and it’s worth a visit. It stretches over the top of the hill, some walls, chapels and altars still remaining, and a series of signboards—text and graphics—along the far wall explaining the history and layout of the church and its attached convent. At the beginning is a transparent panel on which an architect’s conjectured façade of the original church is drawn—in such a way that if you stand directly in front of it and look straight ahead, you’ll see the still extant tower looming beyond, right in the place on the panel where it’s drawn.We liked wandering through these ruins, admiring the beautiful tilework, the stucco remains, and the occasional carved stone that can be seen here among the structures still standing. If, even almost completely ruined now, this church is so impressive, one can only imagine how magnificent it must have been back in the 1600s.No entry fee is levied for this archaeological site.",0.9633,5

There are only 2 problem with hotel - 1) casino is a biggest let down. Seems like casino is not maintained by the hotel mgmt, it was full of local people, bouncer attitude was too high. If you coming with family then completely avoid it. 2) Taxi service. Hotel is located in a secluded area and there are taxi mafia there. So you MUST have your arrangement for vehicle. Taxi gang would not allow the private taxies to come in and they charge exorbitant amount of money like Rs 800 for 6 KM distance.

The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,Bangalore traveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Exceptional ! ,"Hello all,       I travel a lot and I visit the resort or hotel not by the number of stars they carry but the how the experience is. Zuri white Sands is a 5 star Resort or property in Goa.Yes I did read the reviews first and found out it's good place. So I decided to visit. I was not expecting a great service but thought it is a nice place. I usually don't keep too much expectations. Don't like to get disappointed.Now, day one I reach this place in a Taxi paying 1800 from a different property ( Regalia ).First thing I see is someone from reception waves at me and with a smiling face. We get a welcome drink and my room is set and one bell boy is already with my luggage showing us the room.Brilliant room, exceptionally clean and brilliant view. Usually I don't see such things in 5 star properties.They claim 5 star but do not live up to it. Rooms are spacious and extremely clean.Even if I rub my finger tip on the surface of the table I did not get a bit of dust settled on it. That means they take it very serious when it comes to cleanliness.I personally will give 10 points for reception and rooms . Property is also very well maintained. Every few hours I see people cleaning different areas of the lawn and pathways etc.  I visited the dining area had food and was observing the staff . My god they are so well mannered and extremely calm and polite. But always on their toes. Just awesome. Indians or foreigners will appreciate the staff and the way they get treated. It is a must visit place in my list for December.I did see some guests who don't belong to such a beautiful  place but still come because they have the money and then create a weird noisy atmosphere and make it a horrible place. So if in case any one who so reading this review comes across such an episode Pls Move Away and don't blame Zuri for it !!!! Finally I arrived at this place with in Zuri called Tangerine. The ambiance is 10 points.  It's a place to quench your thirst.There is a decent bar counter which can at least hold 8 bar tenders and let them do their stuff perfectly.I meet this gentleman Mr.Vishwesh asked him what is available and all those basic questions. This person is very polite and knows how to talk to his customers.Very well mannered and knows his job well. He can make lovely Hookahs and awesome cocktails.Was very impressed by his attitude and his drinks. So people if you want to go here ask for Vishwesh.He is the 6th Star in that 5 star property. For Zuri he is an asset. Coming back to Zuri as Property guys this is the best one can visit for a long stay.Hotel is wow. Food is wow 👌I am surely a repeat customer for Zuri.Best part is very clean. Even the Valet parking staff are polite. Security guards are friendly they smile at you. I usually don't see this behavior every where.Zuri has a wonderful staff ( which matters a lot) Zuri Chef knows what to cook and how to make it tasty. It's Wow. Thanks Team Zuri.Cheers and special thanks to Mr. Vishwesh for making our stay so much memorable and fun.Love your team. Yours Loyal Guest.",0.9992,5

I am glad we selected the zuri white sands for staying. I stayed here for 6nights. The location ,the facilities , the hospitality and the room ambience was more than perfect. Really enjoyed the stay along with the food and swimming in the pool. Whether it's a walk to the beach or just relaxing in the pool. This was indeed a very serene experience. During breakfast,lunch and dinner , we really enjoyed the hospitality of Stuarts like Suman, Dinesh,Pankaj who was always ready to serve extra whenever needed. The staff of this hotel are it's real assets. One place that they can improve is the variety of food in buffet lunch and dinner.

Excellent daily room service high standards through out.The hotel needs a little refurbishment and is looking tired in places. BUT don't that put you off. Breakfast a wide choice. We never ate in the hotel  for any other meals as we used the local restaurants / beach shacks all very close by and extremely cheap and I mean cheap. The Hotel bar was never busy except for Happy Hour which we ventured into, once only .The drinks are buy 1 get1 free ( selected drinks and not imported spirits). BUT watch out for the Tax and service charge. The drinks were still double the price than the local restaurants / beach shacks. BUT it was nice to be in a more up market surrounding air con etc.The majority of people we met never used the hotels bar / restaurants  mainly due to the prices . Why pay more when you can get it so cheap outside the hotel ( but not necessary the same surroundings as hotel and its high standards and selection) .A note to the hotel - Keep your prices down in the bar / restaurant and guests would use your facilities more.BUT the hotel does cater for conferences and weddings , so they would certainly would have a ""Captive audience"" who would be prepared to pay these higher prices and these guests could not go to alternative restaurants / beach shacks. Please note the hotel is not over busy, but there are  with  events and the weddings( like any hotel), they  are well planned with lavish decorations and parties out side in the immaculate maintain  gardens . My wife loved watching the colourful ceremonies,dresses and the different decorations..Overall we were extremely impressed with the hotel and would return. Please note that there  are a approx 8 restaurants and 8 beach shacks locally. PLEASE note you are in a third world country so restaurants etc are different and appear dirty / scruffy . But the food is excellent and very cheap. Please note the hotel is located in a very quiet area , so if you want hustle and bustle this hotel is not for you. Chill out Relax and enjoy - especially the beachThere is an excuse for a Casino - we are not gamblers but it was very small room full of men looking to make their fortune. Goodluck to them - this did not offend us.TIP - Don't us the Taxi's out side the hotel there is a cartel and are expensive compared to our taxi we found -double the price ( no negotiation ). However walk pass Johnny's pink coloured bar turn right walk 50 metres and there is a taxi owner called Joe Boy ( opposite the Garden court restaurant ) he offers very good prices and is a lovely family man looking to earn a living. We used him twice  one being a 3/4 day tour to the Waterfalls, ( worth a visit just for the view and swim at the falls,a spice gardens with lunch  and a Cathedral excellent day / price..

The property is a perfect getaway for families with kids especially, as there are enough activities to keep the kids engaged while you put your feet up & chill out.

We booked the deluxe room which is spacious and very calm with all the toiletries that is required and a fantastic shower with 24hrs running hot water.  Due to the ongoing BRICS meet in Goa we had a lot of foreign delegates staying who usually were out after breakfast and we had the whole resort to our selves. Room service is expensive like a tiramisu will cost you 636/- including taxes and so will brownie with ice cream. A mini bar is provided that is chargeable.You have many good food joints nearby and a small shop with some basic items along with alcohol, soft drinks etc named Michael's.PROS:1) Fantastic property of 37 acres with the largest meandering pool in Goa. They have an additional pool and a baby pool as well , all kept in superb condition. 2) We had such calmness every time as we got the last room on the top to the corner and there was barely any noise. Though the beach is a few minutes walk away we could hear the waves.3) Excellent house keeping staff and the lawns were maintained in utmost condition. Hats off.Cons:1) Room needs a little upgrade. It's started to wear out and look tired. As a 5 star you expect nothing but perfection.2)Food needs to be better . Breakfast at the Waterfall Cafe was average and so was the dinner at the same place. Buffet dinner was charged at 1300 pp plus taxes , we got a 25 % discount.
