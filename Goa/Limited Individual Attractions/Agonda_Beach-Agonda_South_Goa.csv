Agonda_Beach-Agonda_South,Bahram,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Wonderful location so-so rooms,"Agonda is certainly gorgeous. It has a largely deserted beach, a sea that is memorable, but be careful waves and the undertow are quite strong, but, as you are careful that this is not) and a sufficiency of caf√©'s and restaurants ‚Äì though the hotel itself produces very good food at reasonable prices, and for our part, we only ever ate in the hotel. And the usual array of shops.The best things about the property are the location ‚Äì right on the beach of one of the nicest beaches in Goa ‚Äì couldn't be better located. And the dining/bar area is a very pleasant, overlooking the sea and right on the beach. The food is pretty good too, and the staff are very pleasant and accommodating.The rooms though are mostly small and ill furnished, aalthough some describe themselves as partial sea facing they are barely that. The ‚Äúbasic‚Äù rooms are just that, and avoid rooms, 107 and 108 at all costs ‚Äì maybe others as well. These rooms are next to the road, which is lit brightly, and there are no curtains to speak up, so if you are sensitive about light, sleep becomes very difficult. The rooms are Pokey and have very little furniture - though to be fair, they do have several electric points. We also had room 117, which was more or less sea facing (it faced te sea, but a little way back) and that was significantly better, though still very sparsely furnished. Do not be tempted to go for one of the basic rooms. They are just not worth it."

It‚Äôs about 2km long but, even though there are plenty of people around, it never feels crowded. It is cleaned daily by a small team of local people. This is a great initiative as many beaches along this coast are ruined by the amount of plastic and general debris that‚Äôs washed up onto the sand. The water is lovely to swim in, although occasionally the waves can be strong, so beware. At the back of the beach are several really good beach huts, caf√©s and restaurants, and behind them a road with many more shops, caf√©s and more rooms for hire. Our favourite beach!"

We went for surfing experience and were pleasantly surprised at all that agonda has to offer. Try the shops for some of the best wares knick knacks you may want to piick up, but please bargain, they are all over priced. Clothes, collectibles, shoes, bags, you name it, beautiful row lined shops with colourful display.The cottages lining the shore looked very inviting, and the foliage and the decor in some of the cottages were a must see.If you are a vegetarian or a vegan ZEST is a must try place, must try their smoothie bowls. Super efficient staff and lipsmacking food, the flavours just burst in your mouth.Parking if you are lucky you will get on the side of the road or in the Green valley resort ground.1 single line stretch from the main chowk on either side of the chowk and  you have seen it all.  The vast expanse of pristine blue water, the unending sky, the water sports, and the smooth as silk beaches will pull you back for more.Unlike other beaches this has a slight incline where you may sit with your legs dangling on the sand at a height and watch the Rock & the sunset. I call it the ""Pride Rock"" from Lion King. The only thing missing was Simba.Oh yes, the sea... criss crossing waves, never ending waves, crashing waves... symmetry or poetry, we could watch non stop.Water and sand and the sky, have your fill at agonda!"

There are endless bars, cafes and some beach side guest houses where you could go and use a lounger. There was a lifeguard the whole time when we visited and the waves were small enough to enjoy lots of swimming. Only downside to the beach is there‚Äôs no shade so with the temperature over 30 degrees we couldn‚Äôt enjoy it for more than a few hours at a time but stick around for the sunset around 6pm, it‚Äôs amazing!"
Agonda_Beach-Agonda_South,kev_russ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Amazing beach,"Did 2 nights in the North, 5 in the South & we chose the right beach. It was the start of the season in October & the beach was amazing, so vast but quiet with little tourists & next to no sun beds. It had your local friendly dogs & cows. The beach was very clean with locals/ volunteers picking up rubbish. We loved our peacefful stay at Agonda."

Agonda_Beach-Agonda_South,chriscubitt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Christmas holiday,"Im currently on holiday in agonda and its a wonderful place , its got a great shanty high street with an array of traditional indian /goan gift and cloth shops and a huge range of beach facing restaurants to one side and street facing on the other,  the local people are lovely and polite and cant do enough to help you with any needs you have .As for the beach its a wonderful stretch of golden sand that is preaty much free of sunbeds scattered but you will get sunbeds to the front of some restaurants that your free to use as long as you are eating or drinking but they certainly do not hound you to spend money at all, ive just had the most wonderful new years eve on the beach with music and bonfires locals and tourists all dancing and socialising together it was such a  memorable evening . I have driven by scooter to palomem and patnam very easily only about 15/20mins ride which are both very nice but my heart is in Agonda ."

Agonda_Beach-Agonda_South,Noakewell1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Quiet, chilled and still a little bit of paradise","Lots of people often moan that all the beaches in Thailand are ruined.. For those people, they should try Agonda beach. Palm-tree lined, not too many restaurants and hotels but enough to enough most palates. The sea is quite rough and there are a lot of cows and dogs about, but that is part of the charm. Really good mix of people and worth visiting."

Agonda_Beach-Agonda_South,Nishant,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A natural beauty,"The best beach i ever visited. Goa is famous for its beaches but people who need quiet and a calm relaxing environment definately needs to visit Agonda. The beach is very long approx 3km and has quite calm and blue sea. The beach is very clean, cleaned everyday. Definately a must go. If ur lucky u might even  see dolphins quite next to the beach. Food and drinks are found in abundance. You can visit anu sea side restuarants and have a beer or food with a mesmerising view of the sea. "
Agonda_Beach-Agonda_South,Gala2812,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Picturesque beach for the quite stay,"I'm not very experienced in Goa beaches but this on is surely a god one. Long and quite, its not crowded nor abandoned. Lots of cafes and lodges along the beach offer shady areas for food and drinks. Mostly foreigners and locals, haven't seen too many Indian tourists. From the left side the beach is limited with picturesque rock formations that is probably the major sight here. From the right there is the mouth of a small river and the locals offer Kerala-style boat trips for an hour or two. The area is quite green covered with coconut, cashew and mango trees, with lots of birds. A big  choice of lodging both on the beach and within a few minutes of walking from it on the hill. The markets are not so big and more expensive than those at Patnem or Palolem. Food is sort of touristic and not cheap (the average lunch bill is about 300-500 rupees per person), and its hard to find authentic local food. We enjoyed Mama's Kitchen most of all out of three or four places we got to try. As of things to do there's the surf school with rentals, dolphin watching boat trips, omnipresent yoga, auyrvedic massages. Beach dogs keep on watching their territories against other dogs and cows but are pretty friendly towards people, especially the tourists whom they surely distinguish from the locals. Most of the time the waves at the beach were big and great for surfing, but the last couple days they disappeared for the quite surface. Generally Agonda is said to have the growing popularity but so far it looks pretty exquisite and charming."

Agonda_Beach-Agonda_South,Jakob Geitner,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Lovely huge beach area,"A huge beach with lots of space and loads of different places for drinks and food. It is safe for swimming, relaxing on the sand or at one of the many nearby resorts or restaurants.Cows and dogs roam the beach which I find a very special thing and they do not bother anyone.It is not allowed to place beach beds on the actual sand so you may have to lie on a towel unless you want to stay with one of the venues right next to the beach.There are a few salespeople trying to sell a boattrip, but otherwise the place is quiet and easy to enjoy!"

Agonda_Beach-Agonda_South,Ashish M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Sea and Sand at Agonda,"Picturesque beach at extreme South Goa. Beautiful, clean and unspoilt. Towards the end of the beach are massive rocks/boulders. They are amazing to click pictures. From this point u can climb a short hill and see an amazing sunset with the surf beating at the base of this rocky cliff. You have to see it to believe how beautiful it is. There are beach shacks ( a lil pricey) and beach huts. The beach huts belong to the pricey resorts. But plan a full day at this place and try and go arnd 2 or 3 in the afternoon to enjoy the sea as well as the sunset. Highly recommend for all visiting Goa."
