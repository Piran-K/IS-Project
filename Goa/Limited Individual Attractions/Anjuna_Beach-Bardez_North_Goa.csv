There are Vultures who are only hungry for money. We thought of visiting beach early morning & have a nice morning walk but there are people who won't let you enter the beach if you do not park wherever they want & pay them money. We really had very bad experience.As soon as we refused to pay them, those vultures started arguing & abusing. Please visit other beaches in Goa."

During our visit to Goa in Feb’20, we visited Anjuna Beach as part of North Goa tour during evening time. The beach had enough place for car park and was situated at a small hike, we reached the beach through steps. The beachside was rocky and one has to be careful to avoid trip and fall.  When we visited, the beach had lesser crowd, we spent some quality family time on the beachside by enjoying the sunset and surrounding."

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Manasa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Tranquil atmosphere and calming waters ,"Unlike Baga and Calangute, Anjuna is fairly less crowded and less noisy with lesser establishments occupying the beach area. Contrary to the other beaches, the water here is blue, the sand is white, and comes with an unusual rock formation (which are quite sharp and dangerous even, so one has to be careful while sitting or even standing on them). There is an air of tranquility and serenity here especially if you visit in the mornings. On a clear sky day, one can see the blue and green shades in the water. Also, there are plenty of assorted pebbles and shells of different colours and sizes that you can pick as souvenirs. If you ever go on a Wednesday, I would suggest that you shop in the flea market during the day and have a nice evening at Curlies or Shiva Valley, enjoying the gorgeous view of the sea."
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Aniruddha Srivastava,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Beautiful beach in north Goa,"Although, there are many beach in North Goa but most of them are crowded and not very clean like South Goa beaches. here, Anjuna beach is different.

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Ruchira Khandelwal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Not a good experience,"Nice place to go to watch the sunset but there is no sandy beach, it is all rocks. Perhaps Google maps landed us on wrong side of the beach. What we found was that seashore was very less area, not many people, and not so clean water. Our visit to Candolim beach post this made us realize that it was a waste of time to visit to Anjuna. May be there is some better side of this beach. I would suggest not to go by Google map. It is better to ask locals."
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Suraj Nayak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Relaxing beach with many shacks,"We love this beach. There are many hotels with beach cottages that are right on the beach. Lots of shacks to look into the sea and have a meal in including the super famous Curlies. This beach is also popular for the flea market that happens on WednesdaysThe beach is not ideal for a swim as it is quite rocky. There are many water sports options available such as parasailing, banana boat and speed boat."

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,amita pandey,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Goa trip,"You recently we've been to goa and we visited this place called Anjuna beach. During off-seasons you won't get much to do or see however from mid-October to February, you can see lots of happening. Many parties, carnivals take place. As its season so prices are bit high so if you are planning to visit or attend any of the happening it's better to go for early bird tickets and booking to avoid any hassle during or before the trip."
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,KALYAN R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,LOST HEAVEN ,"My first visit was in the year 1991 and the beach was full of foreigners and sports activities like volleyball, amateur tennis played, ambience was superb but the beach is now lost in sea and big stones are there and new beach is 2km inside from here. The approach road is narrow and not properly maintained. Authorities must look into the same. Number of foreigners are fewers. Not at all a good sign for a famous tourist place. "
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,A2SV Traveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Not so good,"As suggested by our cab provider we headed to the is beach first to this beach first thing ok our first day of the Goa visit. Perhaps Google maps landed us on wrong side of the beach. What we found was that seashore was very less area, not many people, stuck sound, not so clean water. Our visit to calangute beach after this made us realise that what a waste of time it was to visit Anjuna.May be there is some better side of this beach. My recommendation is that dk not go by Google map. It better to ask locals."

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Melany,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Best hostel,"It's even too hard to explain how this place is how amazing as it is! What makes it so special is its vibe. An artistic, magical, free world where everyone can be its most authentic and genuine self. A community of travelers,  who share and grow together. A family! It's also very close to the beach and a walking distance from the main areas and party life. It's the perfect balance between a chilled life, with a relaxed vibe and the craziness of Anjuna's night life. I could not recommended enough!! :)"

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Anuj Thappa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,A beautiful beach with rocks! and ship view in faaaaaarrrrr end,"I visited this lovely beach in August during my trip to Goa. This beach has a wonderful shoreline, and the sunset here is simply magnificent! with orange reflection on sea water......... Wow experience. The surrounding trees and the greenery make for an amazing scene as well on sea shore. The best things were the huge rocks. The fact that Anjuna beach is not renowned for activities like water sports. For this reason, Anjuna experiences a lot less crowd than most other beaches in Goa. Therefore, the beach is very quiet and you can enjoy the beauty of nature quite peacefully. Moreover, the beach is conveniently located, and hence, can be accessed from all corners of Goa.The Anjuna beach is a lot safer in comparison to some of the other beaches in Goa as i feel. You will also come across a number of budget hotels as well as expensive accommodations near the beach."

Yes I visited at the end of monsoon, however the water is generally murky, beach sand was only dirty yellow on one beach. On a popular beach only concrete erosion busters, no sand. Hinterland is ok for chilling. Want to party, then it’s what people come for..I won’t fly over Indo to come back. Spend your time elsewhere in India. I didn’t visit southern beaches."

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,shovanosneha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Nice beach!,Anjuna beach is undoubtedly one of the  best sea beaches of Goa. Sacks along the sea shore prepares delicious dishes. We tried few sea foods like crab & prawn.
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Krishhere,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Littered and dirty. Avoid ,"Having visited Calingute, Candolim, Vagator, Ozran & Bogmalo beaches in Goa before coming to Anjuna beach, I found Anjuna a huge letdown.  Indiscriminate construction has destroyed the beauty of this beach. The pathway to the beach is very dirty and littered. "
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,NTJOC1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,"Good atmosphere, quiet out of season","High season in Goa ends at the end of March/start of April so when we spent a few days on Anjuna Beach in mid April, we had the freedom of sun loungers and chairs from the many sea front bars/restaurants. I am not sure if it is because it was out of season, but we could use the beds free of charge and we did not feel pressured to buy food or drinks from the respective establishments (although we always did have something out of respect). The sunsets were fantastic here. One negative to the beach is the amount of 'sellers' who approach you;they were often quite relentless and occasionally the bar staff would come out and tell them to leave. I can imagine with the loud speakers on the beach and strobe lighting, this place would be extremely busy in high season. In my opinion, a couple of days here are well spent."

Many an hour looking around and a few items bought. Colourful, noisy and vibrant, as per expected, and lively locals. Partner spent far too much and beers were desperately sought😂 Beware the guys who walk up to you saying you’ve got something in your ear. Scammers who’ll want 200 rupees to clean non existent stones and wax out of your ears. Gets a bit tiring after a while, but a polite but forceful No will suffice. Worth a visit on market day. "

The majority of the roads seem to be small lanes with a rough surface very hard work for a wheel chair. Still hard going with walking sticks. If you found this review helpful give it a thumbs up. Thanks
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Monica Thomas,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Not Good Neither Bad,This is the first time i went on some beach so if we look at my point of view this beach is nor good neither bad but there was a lot of crowd and also water sports are also very costly but you can visit other beaches some of are very good and clean like vagator.

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,CoolTravelFreak,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Decent Affair,Anjuna is famous for its flea market .. This beach is very crowded and not very very neat .. would always prefer vagator or baga ... this is
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Arpit Deshmukh,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Worst water sports,Anjuna water sports people are so hungry for money.  The person who is your spoc  makes false commitments to get the deal. After deal is done you will meet new persons who come with their own Terms and conditions. In middle of each sport they ask extra money to give full ride. That means the amount you have already paid is just for half of the ride only.  They are always ready to argue which makes your experience very bad.
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Isabellajackson,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Dirty,"What could be a pleasant beach, is littered with glass, plastic, nappies, we even saw a dirty needle and syringe in the sand for example.Many of the Indian tourists appear to be large groups of males who just go to the beach to drink alcohol ( then throw the used alcohol bottles in the sea or the sand) and take photos of females.Goa is being ruined by people not taking responsibility for the correct disposal of their rubbish.TAKE YOUR LITTER HOME."

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Mohit Agrawal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Rocky beachbwith great view,Every beach in north Goa has its own special attraction. While others may be famous for night life and sunset. This is slight diffrent. Its a rocky beach and provides and amazing view to beauty ful view

Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,pr_ri_123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Nice beach,"This one is near vagator and a little far from main north goa area but worth a visit. If you are family, avoid it at night as its famous for rave parties."
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,modxsounds,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Noisy beach,"It is a good beach for drink a beer or coffee,or just lay down and watch. But if you want to swim better to go to vagator beach or arampol beach probably the best beach in north goa. If you want to party go to the shiva Valley in anjuna Beach every Thursday night."
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Sukhvinder1955,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Not easily approachable beach,"By the time we reached Anjuna beach, it had started getting dark, so we avoided going down to the beach and had a view by standing on top only. The view was indeed beautiful. The water front here is small as well as not easily approachable. As we reach near the beach, we have to go down the side lane to reach near water front. However the water is nice and clear and the scenario is lovely. We enjoyed the sight and the breeze for sometime before heading back to the Resort."
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,Sharmaedm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Good market,"This market next to Anjuna beach. Good leather stuff available here. I bought a hat. Lot of restaurant,  good food. Bike for rent also available here."
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,CheekyKB,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Really good beach if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Calangute,"It's a better beach than Calangute/Candolim and not as busy, however there are still quite a lot of travellers that frequent this beach. There were more domestic Indian tourists than other cultures"
Anjuna_Beach-Bardez_North,AIS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,"Lots of Fun, Music, Food, Shopping",This is where the Parties are at. Very loud and vibrant. Loads of Shopping and many restaurants and dancing scenes to choose from. Very tourist-y.
