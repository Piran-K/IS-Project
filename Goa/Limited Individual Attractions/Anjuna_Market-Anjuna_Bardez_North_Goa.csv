Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,stothez,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Watch out for a common indian scam,"Basically, this market was before covid 3 times bigger and currently (November 2022) there are just a few sellers with the usual stuff that you can buy in Goa. You can visit it but don't expect too much. Please watch out for the Indian ear cleaner scam (just Google it). There are people surrounding this area, so just avoid them. "

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,lotusdiamond,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Great place in evening for shoppers!!,One of the famous place among tourists is Anjuna evening market but it is closed due to Covid pandemic. Visited this place many times during my visit to Goa. Lot of interesting handicraft and local items are sold here. You need to be hard bargainer.Earlier foreigners use to sell items not required by them but now locals have taken place. Although everything sold is local items and available at most of tourist places but charm of visiting this place is something different that too in the evenings.

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Rhagnar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Colours All Over,"Definitely worth a visit. Hundreds of stalls selling just about everything in the world [that's how it felt!]. The look of all the different materials, smell of leather and spices. Buy any spices you like because they'll put them in air tight bags to take home. Buy anything you want but not straight away. Have a long look round first. Watch out for scooters. Toilets and little restaurants here and there and shade over most of the market. You have to bargain every time, but it doesn't take long to get used to it. Great place."

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Lana Beaches,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,A great market! Just what we wanted it to be like,"The market was awesome! The day we went it was super hot, so get there early. However it is right on the beach. We prefered the Saturday night market. It  also had a band and the BEST burrito booth. Get the chicken burrito! Its amazing, and I am frome California where we have the best Mexican food, so I know a good burrito. Was shocked to find it in Goa! I also bought amazing saris at the night market. The vedors are special there. We went twice during our stay and have still smile thinking about one of my favorite sari ladies."
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Katrin A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Colorful Indian-hippie culture,"Anjuna Flee market is still the place to go and spend some time - ca 3 hours or even full day as you can buy different things there what sellsmen have brought all over India and other countries. You can sit in the cafe, on the beach, just relax inbetween shopping. If you do not like to hang around with hot sun, go there 8 oclock in the morning. Sellers are already waiting you and it is not so hot. Do not leave your visit for too late. Best to go home at least 5oclock in the evening as many sellers packing their stuff and leaving and too much pollution is all around. Move quick if you want to see the place and need something particular as marketi is very big and you can easily spend all your time and do not see all what its offers! Enjoy! "

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Tom M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Average Market,"We had been told so much about this market, its hippy beginnings, how long it has been running, etc and we were so excited to see it. However it sadly didn't live up to the hype.It's all tourist driven now and the prices are jacked high. There is nothing available there that cannot be gotten in the shops in candolim/baga. As we stayed in Candolim it cost us 1800Rupee for return taxi, taking that into account it makes any souvenirs considerably dearer than buying in the towns.All that being said we went for the experience and to say we seen it."
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Harsana Hazarika,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Best place for buying anything you want at the cheapest price,"We went to the market on Wednesday and it was the Anjuna Wednesday market with collections from clothes, jewelries, souvenirs at very very low prices. You need to bargain but you can buy bags of clothes and others for your loved ones because that's what I did because they were cheap i.e 100/200 bucks for each item. Loved every but of my shopping experience/"

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Jakob Geitner,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Huge flee market with opportunities for making a bargain,"Anjuna market, though only open on Wednesdays, is a fun place to visit. They have an enormous selection og clothes, leather handcraft, jewelry and much more. Most things are not good quality or obvious knock-off products. E.g. my friend got a “Mulberry” handbag for just 2500 rhupees.The vendors accept a kind no thank you are do not push too much.If you want to buy something you can easily counter the first price ny bidding 33-50% of what they asked for at just stick with that price which most will accept after a few minutes."
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,samrajj,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,If you have time to while away,Never been to this market even though I had been to Goa many times. Decided to do this in this visit and had to travel quite a distance from south Goa. Parking in the paddy field costs 100 bucks. Hunderds of shops selling the same stuff. If you need T shirts and other clothes you could visit here. Some boutique work are also sold. Prices are much higher than what you can get in calangute. Mostly suited for international visitors who won't get this kind of stuff at this price in their countries.
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Adrianna N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Wednesday market,"Visited Anjuna market. It's big and it's noisy!! Just wanted to warn people to be careful. I went with a friend and we were joined by an Indian lady who said she was from Manchester! I thought she was a guide who would charge us but she had a stall off the main market. She encouraged us to visit and we said we would but she wouldn't leave us. We went to her stall an were manipulated and coerced into saying we wanted items. She had about 3 other ladies with her who were all very clever in their words - calling us friends, don't break my heart, how can you do this to us when we wanted to leave. Unfortunately I felt I had no option but to buy items at a greatly increased price - they talk to you incessantly, don't give you time to think and use your 'niceness' against you.I'm not after sympathy etc - my own stupid fault but please be careful.Only buy if you want something. Only pay the price you're happy with. And if you don't feel comfortable - walk away!However having experienced Manchester lady - this is a lovely market and I would visit again - I'd just take small amount of money with me and no credit card!!"
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Celia G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Massive market,"The Anjuna Markets are an essential visit if you find yourself in Goa on a Wednesday. There are hundreds of stalls selling excellent gifts and souvenirs such as jewellery, clothing and trinkets. Be sure to barter significantly (at least 50% off starting price). It is very full on, people yelling prices and hassling you - so be sure to pop out to the beach or into a shack for a rest or some lunch. "
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,amita pandey,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Goa trip,"Anjuna market is right before Anjuna beach. You get lots of things to shop at very less price. As the market is right before the beach, you can get to see really beautiful Summer hats, scarfs and summer clothes both for men and women. also, you get amazing seashells which are handpicked by Sellers or fishermen which you can buy. You can get done your braids too in different style thou its chargeable but not an expensive one. "

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,n. m.,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Overrated. Be sure to barter down proces by half!,This place is overrated apparently there is a better market happening fridays with food trucks and more of a western or european market fee in vagator area near aria hotel and antares hotel area which we couldn't get to.We went on a wednesday as a day market it's open 10am to 6pm. This anjuna market is literally full of hundreds of stands selling the same things...dresses incense....leather goods...jewelry which who knows what it's made of even though they claim gold plated and silver....healing sound bowls and nic naks.It's ok if you're in the area but dont go out of your way and pay more than 600 rupees there and back for a taxi.Theres plenty of nice cafes and restaurants by the beach eva cafe is a nice one along that beach area and a few others for nice food. We walked to that area for eva cafe from aria beach hotel and it was about 40minutes I bought 3 pasmina scarves and 1 silk and paid 2600 rupees. He initially wanted over 3000.I would prefer buying from shops on the side streets rather than the market...seems saturated and too busy but some may enjoy the vibe.

Tried all these and were absolutely satisfied with the Taste which we finally found after hunting in many restaurants in Goa ... Most of the Resturants serve these dishes but not all can serve the typical Goan flavour as the chef's are not from Goa.. The ambience also is very relaxing as it's away from the Commercial part of Goa ."

Great diversity in the goods on offer and bargains to be had for those people who like to barter but beware the shysters.We allowed an hour but underestimated by at least 2 hours due to the sheer size of places to see.For people watching this is a windfall to the observer. I'm a colour observer and the colours of sarees, spices and paintings on offer were priceless. "
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,MumbaiRiders,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Anjuna Market.,"The Anjuna ""Flea Market"" is held every Wednesday and is one of the biggest market attraction in Goa.

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Paul H,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Don’t Bother....,"Whoever said this was a “must-visit” attraction in Goa must love overpriced hippie tat. Mass produced, cheap, and dirty if that’s your thing. The only thing that I saw which was unique were the hanmocks but the prices being quoted were outrageous. The best this about this market is that it’s close to a few great restaurants. I wouldn’t bother. Save your time especially if you are in South Goa. "
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Teensy_teens,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Watch out for the spice vendors! ,"Be VERY careful with the spice venders. They will tell you one price and then, after you have made your selection they will change the prices completely. It’s a total scam because your purchase is based on weight. Be especially weary of a husband  and wife team who seem very nice, offering recipes for the various spices written in their children’s hand writing. They are especially shady. Be sure the ask the SPECIFIC price of each package and keep a agreed upon running tally. Also, be prepared to fend off aggressive sellers. "
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Austin S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Good local market,Enjoyed visiting the local market  for local food purchases. Simona's  Bakery has some very fresh and tasty Goan treats. Enjoyed the market visit.

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Brian S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,A vibrant market of colour and culture,"The market at Anjuna on a Wednesday is a must for any visitor to Goa. Sprawling over a wide area close to the beach it is a vibrant in-your-face experience of colour, culture and merchandise. Racks of clothes, amazing jewellery and leather bags, sit beside stalls selling spices, hand embroidered bedspreads, inlaid wooden boxes and souvenir carved elephants. You are told: be prepared to haggle. 'Haggle' doesn't come close. They will hook you, reel you in, and before you know it you have agreed to buy. After practice, you develop techniques for saying 'no thank you' firmly and politely. But if you do want to buy something and hard bargain, remember that these people have little money and the price that they end up being prepared to accept may well leave them with a very small margin. We are the ones with money. We call the shots. The difference to us between four hundred and eight hundred rupees is just over four quid. To them it's a day's (or more) wages. Don't haggle too hard."

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,TravelTheWorld,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Okay,I would only recommend this market if you are close by or haven't seen any other indian markets yet.Shops are mostly selling the same things (spice / clothes / jewellery - repeat...) Prices are expensive and you need to fight over prices. some items seem very poor in quality.If you don't make it to Wednesday market you don't miss a lot

You need to barter to get a good price, but there are a few stalls that have fixed prices. If you want to do some shopping while in Goa this is an easy place to do it since there’s a lot of stuff in a small area which is easy to get around. "

All the stalls sell the same things: spice, indian style cheap clothes and fake jewellery, somewhere food. Nothing was intersting from my point of view. Once you have visited one indian market I suggest not to visit this one even if It is pratically on the beach, also this beach do not worth a visit. "
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Eamon M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Anjune. Flea market,Large market on every Wednesday well worth a visit. Everything for the tourist from hand made jewelry to metal work from scarfs  and shawls to fur coats. Cafes and bars with musicians playing.

Haggle, there is a bar in the middle that have live music worth having a Kingfisher while you have a break from haggling!!"
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Dragyn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Good shopping at Anjuna Beach Flea Market,"Good prices at Anjuna Beach but you have to bargain. A bit more ""hard sell"" than at Baga Beach, Goa. Situated at a pretty beach with a number of little restaurants in the market."
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Fleckney,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Wednesday market for tourists,"Worth a visit on a Wednesday, but bargain hard as some of the prices start far too night! The market is not that easy to access, but you can arrive by boat, bus or taxi. If going by bus, you need a bus to Mapusa then another once to Anjuna, which we had done on a previous visit. This time we chose to go by taxi and realised that the market is much bigger than previously imagined as the taxi stops in a field and there are lots of stall on the roadside as you walk towards the beach. Several cafes on the beach when you have had enough shopping!"
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,codling2,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,A Wednesday visit,"If you can travel there by boat, do so. Some great sights including the prison and a porpoise escort. Beware of the ear men. They pretend you have something in your ear, put a spike in and supposedly remove some wax. Its a con and they have also been known to puncture ear drums. Great market. Much cheaper than the shops if you barter and often selling the same stuff as the shops"
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Xamen-Ha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Great Fun and Lots of Choice,"I don’t like shopping but I could have stayed at Anjuna Market for days!!  The sights, the smells, the sounds all assault your senses.  You can buy everything from Saris to beautiful linen shirts to leather sandals.  You have to bargain – it is expected, so never accept the first price you are given.  Bargaining is all part of the fun.  The market is held on a Wednesday and officially starts at 10am, though stalls are being set up earlier and it gives you the chance to browse and bargain before the morning really starts to get hot.Fabulous day out."

It is an amazing market to buy myriad of items  and it has ample option of refreshments. Anyone can visit this market just for window shopping, some items are capable of converting it into shopping.

You can easily spend a couple of hours wandering around & shopping. You can shop for clothes, artificial jewellery & all kinds of knick-knacks. My sister-inlaw picked this lovely quilt with embroidered elephants & my cousin bought a carved ivory lamp. I shopped for precious stone bracelets, leather handbags & funky casual dresses"

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,AndreaH,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Fantastic market,A market that sells everything. Great bargains are to be had. If you barter you can get a great deal. It leads right down to the beach. It is also sheltered from the sun.
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Kimm F,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Market targeting tourists - disappointing,The North end of the market is much better with well designed clothing and jewellery but the other part of the market is full of overpriced tie-die and typical India fare. Stall holders need a firm hand as they often follow you down the street. 
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,NafeeTA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,A great place for souvenirs and good bargains.,"The Anjuna flea market can be found every Wednesday. It has a lot of things on offer. You'll find yourself spending a good two to three hours here. Always remember, any price is negotiable here. This falls on the way to curlies, so you can hit this place in the evening and catch the sunset at the beach."

The market - makeshift tents, bamboo huts and canopies - is spread over quite a large area near Anjuna beach. Trinkets, clothes, jewellery, tea (yeah!) ... there's plenty on offer. Haggle well and check before you buy. Took us a couple of hours to cover the length of the market though we didn't shop for much. A street photographer can happily spend more than that amount of time here! Btw Wednesdays only.Be sure to"

Its no longer what it was famous for - great bargains. Nothing Indian or local about it; most products were either Chinese or procured from the wholesalers.

The hippies/free spirits came together and traded their belongings here ----  clothes, jewels, guitars and whatever they had ---- anything to stay in paradise just a little longer!! The Flea Market is at the far south end of the Anjuna Beach and remains open from 8 am until around 7 pm or so. "

Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Dilip S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,"If It's Wednesday , It Must Be Anjuna Flea Market","We enjoyed roaming through the weekly flea market at Anjuna on 21st Feb . 2018 . Though the market was initiated by the father hippie himself “eight finger Eddie” in 1975 for the hippies in despair selling their wares to facilitate them to stay here for more days , there was no trace of them . Various antique and not so antique things right from Bed sheets ; Binoculars ;  Block printed sarongs ; Camel leather bags , purses and wallets ; Carpets ; Colourful skirts ; Compasses ; Crafted leather jackets ; Different varieties of tea and coffee ; Fancy antique locks ;  Gramophones ; Handicrafts ;  Hippie pants and tops ; Lanterns ; Musical instruments such as Brass horn . Saxophone , Trumpet , Tuba ; Nautical and Surveying instruments ;  Rajasthani puppets ; Sarees ; Sea shell garlands ;  Semiprecious stones such as    Agate, Amethyst , Garnet , Opal , Quartz ; Spices ; Telescopes ; , Tibetan idols made from fish bones ; Tibetan singing bowls ; Tribal jewellery ; etc were available at very expensive rates if one cannot bargain and at the cheapest rates if one is the master of haggling . A thumb rule of bargaining here  is the purchaser can start bargaining from 75 % lower price quoted by the seller . We didn’t purchase anything . We just enjoyed the feeling and at the end quenched our thirsty throats at Sea Breeze Bar ."
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Navigator13213,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Pester pester pester pester...... aghhhh,"You can’t have one second here, even on the beach or cafes, without being pestered either by shopkeepers or hawkers or annoying women telling you ‘beautiful lady, beautiful eyes’ and then of course trying to sell you some crap for 40 times the value. I couldn’t even take a photo on the beach due to them crowding around and shoving cheap necklaces in my face, fighting to pester me. In the end I was so sick of it and so annoyed I fled up some steps, slipped, and broke my arm, ruined my holiday. Even as I was in agony with my bones twisted they still pestered me, so pushy, so rude, so desperate. I was here 15 years ago and it was nowhere near this bad, it smacks of greed and con artists (even the one that offers to clean your ears and fakes loads of gunk being pulled out, really do they think we are stupid) I’m afraid this place is just an annoying tourist money making con trap selling overpriced and poorly made goods, most of the clothes had tears or stains, and I could buy most of it in the UK for less then they were asking, not at all the hippie hang out it used to be, don’t get sucked into it, go and find the real lovely India, one that bucket loads of charter flights hasn’t ruined, if it still exists..."
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Lovers_paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,The Wednesday Flea Market at the Anjuna Beach,"Anjuna Flea market traces its origin to the Hippie Revolution of the 1960’s. Hippies who were running out of money would sell off their personal effects…….everything ranging from foreign guitars and electronic equipment to jwellery and jeans to anyone interested. Thus began the infamous Flea Market at Anjuna. Today this beach-side market still attracts tourists but the sellers are mostly from Kashmir, Tibet, Gujarat, Rajasthan or Karnataka.  This weekly tourist market is also known as the Wednesday Flea Market. Even if you are not in shopping, the Anjuna Flea Market is the place to be on Wednesday's in Goa."
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Frenweh - Richa,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Good for foreigners but not Indians.,All the stalls/ shops at the flea market are quite expensive. I was expecting more local stuff but it wasn't.
Anjuna_Market-Anjuna_Bardez_North,Sixties Travel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Colours of India,"Anjuna market held weekly on a Wednesday is a must if you are staying in Goa. The market is held overlooking the lovely beach. Wander through the stalls and soak up the atmosphere.  Here you can buy almost anything and enjoy a good barter.  It has become slightly more commercialised since the last time I visited some 20 years ago, but I still revelled in the excitement of colour and assault on the senses that this market brings. Easy to get to, just about 20kms into North Goa."
