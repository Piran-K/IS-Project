Some beach huts were also available there in like 2500INR per night and some were under construction. I sat at a restaurant there for sometime enjoying my time with some drinks and a prawn starter. You can easily walk to both the corners of the beach, collect sea shells if you are crazy about that like me and to another corner there is such a crazy view of the beach you can die for but be careful on the path which is full of really big, sharped rocks.

Arombol beach is one of the best beaches I ever visited in Goa. It is clean, quiet and has a long spread for those who want to take a walk. The beach is filled with mostly foreign tourist and very few locals. People are quite laid back and they dont bother you at all. There are several choices of restaurants line up on the seashore to fulfill your palate. The view is quite spectacular in the evening especially when the sun is setting. We had a fun-filled day swimming and ended up having dinner coupled with some beer at one of the many shacks. Overall, it was one of the best beach experience I ever had. The best time to visit will be from September onward as the weather become tolerable. Cleanliness - 4/5Crowd - 4/5"
Arambol_Beach-Arambol_North,jmu0320,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Beautiful but Pushy,"Beautiful beach with stunning sunrises and sets, great eating and drinking options, drum circle, free spirited people, and chill scene. However the vendor pushing can be intense. I found it difficult to relax with people approaching every few minutes trying to sell goods. That aside it is a gem as is Arambol village and I would return."

During peak season, you can catch up on drum circle music every evening. Perfect beach for a long walk or run in the morning. "

Arambol_Beach-Arambol_North,Ayushi Chandra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Amazing beach to spend the day,"We love visiting Arambol whenever we are in Goa as the ride from North goa till Arambol is just fantastic going through mountain passes, local villages and what not.And the beach itself is a beauty, lined with amazing shacks. Love swimming here. The place really livens up in the evening with lot of music, expats and great food. Must visit place in Goa.Would not recommend staying here as it is quite far off from other areas, unless that's what you are seeking. But for that, there are nice beach-side shacks that can be booked."

Arambol_Beach-Arambol_North,RDtravels00,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Beautiful.  Serene ,"It‚Äôs quite a walk thru lanes (on a mountainTop) with the sea on your left.  The moment u reach arambol, u known it‚Äôs totally worth it. August month is low season so we were fortunate to have the beach and the lake to ourselves. Small lake. Chilled clean water.  Scenic quiet place.  Had a super good time.  Lunch at the restaurant shack on the beach.... nothing great, strictly ok food.  But with a  great view !"

Really you have to visit this place to know why it is one of the best beaches in Goa. A combination of beach and mountain plus salt water and sweet water. Best of both the world. Amazing food and nightlife.
