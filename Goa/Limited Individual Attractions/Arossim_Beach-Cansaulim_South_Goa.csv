Arossim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,David D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Glorious stretch of practically deserted beach,"Saturday 3rd December and we made our way to the beach this Beach, from the main road. It is then 500 metres down a lane on the left side of the gate entrance to ITC Grand Goa Hotel It is sandwiched between Cansoulim Beach and Utorda Beach. It is one of the many beaches that combine to create a glorious stretch of 25 kilometres white sandy along South Goa.Along the stretch that we walked there was nothing on the beach apart from a fishing boat on the beach and the fisherman's hut.At the far end of the beach, towards Cansoulim, there are some beach shacks we could see in the distance.There was no one else about so all that was here to be seen were the tyre marks in the sand, made by the lifeguard's jeep and lots of footprints.At the back of the beach are some sand dunes which are lined by glorious tall coconut trees.As we neared nearer Utorda Beach, it's shacks come into view."

Arossim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,G A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Quiet Beach,"I went to the Arossim Beach last week when Cyclone Kyarr was threatening to descend upon Goa's sandy shores.  The sea was churning and even at low tide, the water pushed well into the beach front.  Even so, we had some moments when the tide was out and the beauty of the sandy stretch from Velsao - Cansaulem - Arossim - Utorda was clearly revealed.Arossim beach is a few minutes walk from the Heritage Village Resort.  A good tar road leads to the beach, however you need to cross a small rickety wooden bridge over a shallow drainage creek (nullah) to get to the sandy area.  It is probably dry in summer and winter, but this year due to the extended rains, it was full of dubious looking waste water!  The morning after the cyclone hit the coast, the bridge had collapsed and the tide had come all the way across the sandy beach.There weren't any shacks on the beach even though one is clearly visible on Google Earth.  Perhaps they set up temporarily in the summer and winter season.  The beach is beautiful and clean and there were hardly any humans early in the morning.  We were lucky to sea  a rainbow in the sea!  We walked up to Majorda Beach one morning.  This necessitated crossing a couple more shallow drainage creeks, one more at Arossim and another at Utorda beach.  We could have walked further but it started to rain and we didnt want to risk being caught in the high tide with the water coming all the way up to the beach front.  I would like to return in dry and cool weather and walk as far south as possible, perhaps even up to Colva, that would be great."

Arossim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,kum28,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Peaceful and clean Isolation in Goa,"The beach is a pretty isolated beach. While the same is not a private beach the same is largely used by Guests of Heritage Village and Resort.  Would not recommend the same as a beach to visit if you are not staying nearby as Cansaulim, Varca et all would be more lively. There is a lone shack star fish , try their Tandoori chicken (order 45 min in advance) which is a saving grace in the somewhat empty beach.  We enjoyed as a group of 4 friends as we had the beach to ourselves, or so it looked, including an evening spent at the beach in  tranquility.  SO choose wisely if you intend to go there only if you have own transport at disposal."

There isn't much there other than a great sweep of sand and the Arabian Sea.  At the end of the road you'll find a few locals enjoying the beach plus the Starfish Shack which we didn't visit being on all inclusive.  Walk in either direction and you'll come across a few fishing boats, maybe a few dogs - even some cows.We enjoyed walking in the surf at sunset watching the sun go down before dinner."

Not much place for parking. but, would not be a big issue since, not many people visit at the same time. Also, unlike Colva, late evening time may need extra care as not many people would be around there. A sack is also there near the beach entrance. try their prawns. the golden fried crisp ones were really good. No other sacks are there or, no other restaurants. so, price could be a little higher than some other places. but, overall, very nice place to enjoy"
