Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Dhiraj H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Family,Serene beach,This beach is located around one hour north of Panjim and the drive is scenic. We went to meet a friend who took us to a resort called “ Lela cottages “.We walked to the lovely beach from the resort. Not too busy beach with a long coastline with palm trees lined. Fairly clean. As in most beaches of North Goa parts of the beach was blackened pointing to oil spill. Nice place to enjoy the sunset.

Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Adi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Peaceful vacation family time couple Paradise,"If you are looking for rejuvenation in North of Goa, try this beautiful beach in extreme North just before Mandrem and Arambol. Less crowded, safe for kids, decent crowd, not much of night life and yes best for morning walks and late evening dining on beach side. For stay you can choose many properties. We loved our stay at resort Regalia 4 minutes walk down to beach and a property with best wooden rooms, we stayed in. You may have to ride 50 odd steps if you get rear side rooms, I will say no Gym required."

Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,ShaanBhavnani,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Meant for Surfers not Swimmers,Ashwem maybe flat(uneven but still) so you do feel safe walking way out into the sea still being at waist level...but be careful of rocks at certain points marked (somewhat) by lifegaurds! The waves are constant and strong so if your up for a beating (or massage)...go right ahead! Ideal spot for beginner or novice surfers...ask around for VAYU if your interested!
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Srinath34,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,One of the best beaches in Goa!!,"Ashwem is one of the most calmest beach in North Goa and definitely one of the cleanest. It takes about 30-40 mins to reach via bike/car from Vagator and the directions are a bit tricky as there is no signage around. Follow Google Maps to reach here. The clean sands and very few beach shacks make it more memorable. Those who want a peaceful time and away from the crowd of Calangute and Baga, head out to Ashwem."
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Geet123456,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Beautiful clean beach,"We had a good time. It is a very clean picture perfect beach.

Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,marian_benson,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Disappointing Ashwem and Morjim,"I’m hoping that the debilitated state of the bars and buildings bordering the beach is a result of the typhoon and adverse weather, but think that this is most likely not the case. The beaches were filthy and plastics, aerosols and broken glass were in abundance. The first sand was oily and there was no evidence of a daily sweep. We had expected this in Delhi and other smaller towns, but not on the coast. It certainly is not a haven of white sand and blue sea. "

The beach was golden and stretched for miles but as it was off season we struggled to find many places to stop for a drink or a bite to eat, but the ones we did find were lovely.

You can get a lot of shacks and the food of these shacks are just amazing. The beach has a nice soft sand making it easy for you to walk. The ocean in this beach is not very steep so you can go for a distance. The water is very clean and cool. Although you need to check for Rocks because there are many rocks and few of them are submerged in the water so take care when you go for a swim. I would prefer that you came here and enjoy your weekends. Must come place

Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Ronabir A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,"Clean, quiet beach. Good for families and non swimmers","We visited and stayed for a week just opposite this beach. One of the less crowded beaches with overall cleanliness better than some other North Goa beaches. No water sports except for further north there is a  Kitesurfer school. We saw some people trying to surf and kitesurf on this beach. Shallow slope towards the water allows one to go out quite some way without having to swim, so good for those who want to experience the waves without swimming. So great for kids and younger ones. The best time of the day here is the early morning when you get to see some birds fishing. The area around has many resorts and places where you can hire rooms on Airbnb. "
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Arpit Chopra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Peaceful or Lonely? ,"This might be a thing with individual preferences or perspectives, but, I felt that the beach literally had nothing on it. If you want to get some peace and are looking for a really clean place to just relax and move away from all distractions, then this is it. But, if you are looking for a beach which feels more lively, then go somewhere else.The best place to be for solo travellers and backpackers.

Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,royjay2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,A Hidden Gem of Goa,"Ashvem Beach is situated in the Pernem region in the northern area of Goa. It is a hidden gem with stunning scenery and a range of nice beach hotels and resorts. One can stroll along the 1.5 km of fine sand and listen to the soothing sounds of the lapping waves and the rustle of the palm leaves. Play in the waves and let the Arabian Sea’s warm waters relax your body. Stay overnight at one of the low-cost huts or check out the upscale beach resorts in the quieter area of the beach. To get there, you can rent a bicycle or scooter in Goa or take a taxi or bus."

Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Sachin Mehta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Pristine beaches - clean and uncrowded,"We had our hotel on the beach. It is one of the beautiful beaches in Goa - clean, pristine, very few people and thus less noisy. We didn't even find a plastic wrapper or a liquor bottle strewn across on the beach - perhaps the restaurant owners might be cleaning the beach every day, whatever happened to the hotel owners at Baga and Calangute? Anyways, the sun-set here is truly beautiful and we were at Rococo where in the sun used to set right in front of the pool benches where we used to spend our evenings. There are couple of beach properties on Ashwem and it does make sense to check it out. The only hitch is that the beach is right at the end of Goa i.e. North and the taxi fare from the airport is a hefty 1700 bucks (Government decided though). It took us good 2-3 hours to reach the hotel but then once there it was good.One will find a lot many Russian tourists here - perhaps they also frequent this place simply because it is less crowded.

Unlike baga, Calangute, etc. this is far less commercialised, hence clean and peaceful.

Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Destination652322,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Serene and beautiful ,I went to this beach with my daughter and I must say that this was the best out of the 9 beaches we saw in our trip( all in North Goa). Extremely calm sea here and clean light coloured sand. Best part about this beach was that it is a secluded area and had only a couple of shacks and hardly any visitors here. My daughter Collected many beautiful shells and saw crabs and some other sea creatures also lying around on the beach. I think it is the most beautiful beach in North Goa. 
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Aditya G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,"Clean and silent, as expected",This is one of those beaches that are quiet and always attract fewer people because it doesn't host parties like Baga and Calangute. This is precisely why you should go here. It's quiet and really clean for that very reason. Must visit.
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Compass822483,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Must visit beach,"As i stayed in Morjim and going through nearby attractions,i read about Ashwem beach known for the privacy, less crowded,most relaxing beach with no disturbacnce from people wanting to sell you things , it is perfect beach if you want to spend some quality time with yourself with beautifull sea and sunset. As i reached there it was all that people said about it.As i walked along the Beautifull shore with some rarely seen creatures lying around ,it was like a hidden magical part of goa. There was only 2 shacks opened at that time of month but infact there were hardly 4 shacks for the beach so the menu will be limited , but if peaceful serene environment is what you want then thats the price to pay. But food was tasty enough eventhough it was quite pricey but with that beach in front it is heaven. Must pay visit beach in Goa i would say."
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,akash n,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,A Pleasant Paradise!,"I visited this beach in Sep'18. It is of the beach which was blessed with nature. Alongshore and situated red coloured limestones at the one end of the corner and another end an estuary, a canal joined the sea, so you can enjoy swimming in this too.  Generally, morning 8 AM to 1 PM it is high tide. I have visited Boomerang restaurant which is situated at the shore. There we can have a nice view of the sea.One of the less crowded beach and a little bit careful about the stray dogs.We can have ample restaurants to choose the kind of food but little costly.few general stores are present."
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Mamata,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Peaceful Paradise  Ashwem and Mandrim,"From Calangute on the road of aguada-calangute… , ashwem, morjim, mandrem and Arambol beaches are located. Approximately   around 25 km (50 min) by road much closer to the northern beaches of Calangute and Baga, these beaches are well worth the visit . Ashwem and Mandrem are so quiet and beautiful.  Ashwem beach has rocky structure making it look rugged like Anjuna beach. It also gives you unlimited photo opportunities. It has small patches of greenery. No parking charges at the entrance. Decent food options available. Not at all crowded .. a long stretch of beautiful shoreline. Mandrem is even more beautiful … It starts from the right end of Ashwem and there are wooden stairways created along the road so you can easily go up/ down (beach to road). This is so because the beach is at much lower height from the road atleast 12 feet lower than the road . One can have a very nice view from vehicle as the road is on much higher height. Surfing is possible at these beaches and there is instructor led surfing options here. The beach has small back water like waterbody and it is so safe for toddlers and kids to swim and play(like a natural baby pool) .. you are in the ocean , sands but still lots away from the waves."
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Puneet144,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,A beautiful beach,It is one of my favorites. Stayed on it for three days. Un-matchable peace and quiet.  You go there to rejuvenate yourself. Not to find activity. A little out of the way but thats the charm. Right?!!
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,robeen17,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Excellent Day Trip,"Beautiful scenery, clean beach and great spots to chill out. Ashwem is sans the hustle bustle synonymous to North Goa beaches. The only menace, common to all locations in Goa, is the large number of stray dogs. "

It’s a hidden gem nestled in one quiet corner and offers peace,beauty and tranquility at the same time. Away from the hustle and bustle of the bigger and more crowded beaches u can just sit back and unwind yourself. If you r looking for a little rest and rejuvenation,Ashwem is the place to be."

Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Let's Go Sightseeing,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Long drive,"It will take a bit of a drive to get to the Ashwem Beach. In the non-monsoon season, I can safely say it will be worth it. I, unfortunately, went during the rainy season. Could not enjoy the beach but could see why it is in demand.Even when the sea was rough & the beach was dirty, there was a sizable ground trying to experience the sunset."
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Sharesarun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Worth the drive,It is one of the further beaches and that is what makes it all the more charming .It is one of the cleanest beaches that we visited in Goa.
Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,minddotor,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,"Far, but every bit the effort!","About 180 kilometres of coastline in the state would obviously mean over a hundred lovely beaches to go to! I thought I had seen it all! Thank God, how wrong I was!Ashwem beach is beeeeutiful .. and now ranks 1 on my list.If you are a tourist and don't come here, you have wasted your time and money coming to Goa!Spend the whole day here, charge your self for the whole month, such are the options, which would take a long time to list!Have the time of your lives!"

Ashwem_Beach-Morjim_North,Nelvis R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,My Fav Beach,"This beach is always been my favourite ever since childhood. I am just in love with this beach because it is absolutely clean and away from too many domestic tourist. There very few domestic tourist who visit here but most of them are International tourist. So if you visit this beach make sure you do not dirty or litter any waste. Ensure to keep the nature clean and garbage free. This is one of the cleanest beaches in Goa and has been maintained well. During the summer season it is ideal for a person to take a swim. A lot of water Sports do take place here. People have been busy with activities like paragliding, parasailing, motor boats, rafting. Fishing has been an occupation at this beach as you will see many local Fisher folks. There are number of restaurants in beach shacks across for anyone to refresh or eat. The water is calm  and thus make it ideal for swimming. "
