Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Shalin_Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Party Capital of Goa,Baga has an altogether different vibe which you can't get at any beach. Crowded like always especially Tito's lane and always high on energy. It should be a must visit beach if in GOA and if you are a party animal ;-)
Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Sridhar Reddy,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Very very Bad,"Don’t Go for Tattoo , They are cheating and they are cheaters. For temporary Tattoo also over priced and rude behavior"
Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Simran Yonzon,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Sunset at the beach,"The beach was pleasant but too crowded and little dirty. We went there to see sunset and really loved it. Took some good pictures and was there till evening, met some foreigners and talked to them until late evening. It’s easy to get food and drinks there, but people just dump it whenever they feel like. And the worse part is, you’ll not find a single dustbin there"
Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Vandana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,A good place to take bath.,This beach belongs to the same panchayat as Calungute beach. Hence both the beaches are adjacent to eachother. The waves in this beach are way calmer and makes a good place to bathe.  This is crowded beach  . One can watch a beautiful sunset on a clear sky.  After sun down this place becomes very noisy because of the shacks. A very good place for night parties .
Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Shyamsundar P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Best place to visit,Great place to visit and enjoy till 3PM in night.Have drink dance beach facing location and all.Note- do not drink and through bottle in sand or sea for our own safety.

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Soumya Nayak,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Regular beach,July is the monsoon time when water activities do not take place at this beach. Maybe this is why it just seemed like a regular beach. The restaurants were still open & staff were reaching out to the visitors to dine at their restaurant. There were lot of people but it wasn't as crowded.

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,PANKAJ JAIN,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Worst because of behavior of local people,GOA is nice place to visit but its not worth to go. As local people are really bad with tourist. Tourists hire vehicle over there and local people drove very rash on the roads they will hit tourist car then will fight with you asking for money. They tourist will not fight over there and tourist need to pay money to them and then needs to pay damage to the vehicle owner also from whom they have hired the vehicle. Behaviors of local people is really bad their language and all they are always ready to fight with the tourists. Even on water sports also they treat you like anything as you have already paid for the sports in advance.Overall I would say i will never visit this place again in my life.
Baga_Beach-Baga_North,authorneelesh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,loud or amazing- you decide,"loud and crazy or amazing and crazy- you can call it what you like. For the action at all costs types, Baga has it all - launch rides, speed boating, water scooters, parasailing, shacks, night clubs, loud music blaring all night and food and drink offers of all kinds.For those targetting peace and solitude- this is certainly not the place for you.However we a mid-sixties couple, both teetotallers and one a staunch vegetarian did not exactly get repelled, though our tastes veer more to the south goa kind of laid back environ.The best is to stay in south goa for half the time and switch to Baga for the end of the vacation."

I visited the beach at 6 AM, was so excited to be at the beach early in the morning but I got so disappointed seeing the plastic and beer bottles everywhere. It was filthy. It’s a shame that people go their to party and drink and leave their garbage everywhere. And this responsibility is on to the shack owners who can display fancy lights , play groovy music and arrange seating by the beach but forget to keep enough bins and promote cleanliness among their guests. I left Baga the very same day. "

It’s one the cleanest beaches I have seen. It was post lock down and we were a bit apprehensive in visiting the area.. but you know, unless you visit Baga , your north Goa trip is not complete.

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Sandy_JSR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Vibrant,"Baga Beach is one of the most popular breaches in Goa, be it day time or night, it is always crowded. The long beach with numerous numbers of shacks at beach, makes it most frequented beach. Spotted several tourists enjoying sea bath. One can hire a reclining chair with umbrella and enjoy the sea view and food. The night scene was very noisy due to loud DJ music being played by the shacks for guests to drink and dance. Spotted numerous empty bottles thrown on the beach, a big eyesore, and that made the beach dirty too. While enjoying night view, we had our evening snacks with chicken chill dry and chicken steak at one of the Shacks. To summarize, most frequented and noisy beach"

Local women come by with fresh fruit to sell. We usually stayed right in front of Brittos restaurant. Enjoy!

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,kcalpesh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,What's Happened to Baga?,I went to Baga with great expectations and my memories of 2014 visit to this place. In 2014 this place was awesome despite being very commercial. It had a great deal of charm. If I had rated Baga after my 2014 visit then I would have given it a good 5 stars full.Alas my last visit here in March 2019 was a terrible experience. People from all parts of the world had gathered. It was bad. The crowd had some really rowdy folks who think they are cool if they are in a big group. Lot of eve teasing and terrible behavior by some people.Food joints are overpriced and so are the water sports activities. There are limitations to how deep you can enter the water and a lot of littering of plastic and bottles and other stuff. I seriously felt like I should have never visited the beach and should have just cherished the memories of the previous visit all life.Big time that visitors understand the importance of keeping the beach and its vicinity clean. I think government should charge people for entering the beach and imply heavy fines on littering. Let everyone understand the value of these tourist-friendly places as soon as possible.

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,milma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Typical Goan beach,"Looks like this is the most happening beach in Goa. Its lined with shacks, pubs and restaurants. Go early if you want a beach bed for your self. However the beach closes almost soon after sunset due to security reasons but one can spend time in the shacks"
Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Samy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,Awesome beach,"I my opinion is going for Baga Beach located at North Goa in the state of Goa. There are several beaches in Goa, most of them are over crowded and with hard sand, except Baga which is my favorite one.Nightlife is hard and rock, found musical programs, dj’s night around the beach and up to late night and the cool breezes, which will definitely make you freaky"

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Jones jon,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Paradise for food, music and sports loving persons!!!","When you will first visit the Baga beach you may find it very crowded, but when you will start to explore it, you will find that there are many things to do and experience. ""During the morning time, it's the time to do all the sports activities and enjoy a bottle of beer and eat different sea foods"". During the noon you might want to just lay a bit and rest and enjoy the sunset. In the Night you can have candle light dinner with your loved ones and enjoy some dance till 10 o'clock, as there is no loud music allowed after that. During that time you can do different activities in the market like fish spa, have a fake tattoo for the night etc.                                                                          'This is my honest review'"

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Sangeetha Vikram,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Baga Beach - Excellent night life along with shacks,"On 22nd Dec'19 evening, myself with my hubby got to visit Baga Beach. It is one of the most popular beaches in North Goa.Baga is the perfect destination for those who wish to witness the excellent nightlife of Goa as signature places such as Britto's, Tito's and Mambos have made their mark in their hearts of party-goers. The shacks also come to life in the late evening with some pumping music and mouthwatering food. It is one of the most visited beaches in North and we had spent a memorable evening over there."

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Appyhappy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Baga beach,"Stay in a hotel near beach so that you can walk to beach anytime. Spend your time at beach or hire a scooty and travel nearby tourist spots. Roads are good and driving scooty there is love. Panjim is like any other capital of state with crowd, banks, traffic and all, so better stay by this side of goa and enjoy good food."

Baga_Beach-Baga_North,Al Bi,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,"Too much men, less women","My girlfriend and me decided to go to celebrate new years eve with 2 friends of us at Baga Beach. When we arrived, there was a mass of male Indians.. Fully drunk and ""ready for everything"". They were starring at my girlfriend like she is an animal.. So my whole evening was stressful and I could not really enjoy the party. Less police, too much drunk idiots. Hint: Never go there when you are with your girlfriend - especially when you are from Europe. Catastrophe."
