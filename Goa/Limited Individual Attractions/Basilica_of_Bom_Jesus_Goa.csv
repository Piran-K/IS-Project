Basilica_of_Bom_Jesus,MissRP95,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Sexism and Discrimination,"My parents have been to this church before but this was my first time and I didn't even get to go inside. It was a very hot day and we all wore shorts, we walked inside and the females in the group, including myself were refused entry as we were wearing shorts. However, the males in the group, who were also wearing shorts were allowed in.When we questioned the woman in charge what was the difference between male and female legs, she couldn't give us a proper answer but said to take it up with the Priests. I could understand and would oblige if the rule was applicable for men and women but India is still a backwards society that treats women like second class citizens.I have visted Catholic places of worship all over the world and in hot weather shorts on both genders are permitted. What is worse is that this rule is new as my parents didn't have to follow this before.They offered scrafs to wrap around our legs but most of us refused as it is regression on equality, so we stood at the entrance and waited for those who were allowed in and the woman kicked us out.So very disappointed, Catholicism in most places if worship are not strict on dress rules, so to have acted in this way is embarrassing and shameful.

We hired a guide (he charged 100‚Çπ) and he described the stories and myths so well related to this church; it added more charm to our experience. It would definitely be an incomplete visit if you have not hired guide because seeing pictures or interior may not help much in understanding the history related to them.

With its flying buttresses and ornate facade, it is a fitting icon of Goa's Portuguese heritage. However, questions of architecture aside, this place has some serious downsides.The main problem is that Old Goa has  seven old churches and convents on the World Heritage list. However, every domestic tourist has decided that the only one they need to see is Bom Basilica.  During our visit, there were literally hundreds of tourists jostling for space inside and around the church. In other words, it's a bit of a circus.
