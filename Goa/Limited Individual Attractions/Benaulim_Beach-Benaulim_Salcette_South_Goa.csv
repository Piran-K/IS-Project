Benaulim_Beach-Benaulim_Salcette_South,Ria1104,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Quietest Beach of Goa,"We stayed near this beach for few nights. I must admit the Airbnbs around this beach are really beautiful and are not very costly also. I highly recommend staying in one of them to enjoy the peaceful side of Goa.This beach is not as happening as Baga/Calangute nor is as beautiful as the Palolem/Agonda....yet it has a charm of its own. It is one of the quietest beaches of Goa. There are quite a handful of shacks and bars at this beach namely Southern Deck, Blue Star, Johncy, Dominic. The kish fish curry which I tasted in this beach was probably the best in Goa. Surprisingly food and liquor price at this beach was the least amongst all the beaches we went. However the best part for us was not the shacks. We used to find ourselves a quieter part of the beach, get our own snacks, play our own music and enjoy some lone time away from the crowd. Nobody disturbed us and neither did we disturb anybody.In the daytime too there were some water activities like jet ski (I could not find parasailing or bumper ride here). However I would advise you to try the water activities in North Goa instead of here or Colva as the prices of the water sports were much cheaper in the north than in the south."

Benaulim_Beach-Benaulim_Salcette_South,deepak_misra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,"Earlier sleepy beach, getting popular",Benaulim beach used to be the sleepy cousin of the very popular Colva in South Goa. However it has come of age now and the once largely empty parking is perpetually full and there is a brand new huge parking with a toilet which was missing for many yearsThe new parking is quite convenient and to the south of the beach. The beach has a lot of fishing boats just at the entrance. However the beach gets clean juts moving a few 100 meters north or south and is nice for swimming.  There are sufficient beach shacks to allow one to spend considerable time here. DO note that public transport here like rest of Goa is dismal.Evenings in a nice time to spend here and watch the sunset

Beautiful, peaceful and a fab place for the morning walks/jogs. Did Benaulim-varca-benaulim-colva and back each day, and the whole coastline is pristine. The fishing is on, and early morning and evenings, you get to see the fishermen at work. There's an abundance of dogs and you need to be careful, lest you step on something not so good😊. That is in my sense, the only major negative with the whole stretch."

Benaulim_Beach-Benaulim_Salcette_South,Juliet S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2020 • Couples,Perfect summer beach,"We arrived in Benaulim in March, pre lockdown and are still here in July 2020. In March, several beach shacks were open, we were pleasantly surprised by the free beachbeds and towels, and the excellent food and drink services offered by polite staff in the shacks.  The beach itself was clean, gently shelving and the water was warm and clean. The only negative side still is, and was, the stray dogs. Far too many. Dog poo on the beach. Dogs fighting. Dogs begging for food at every shack. Once the season ends end of May, the shacks close and the dogs roam. The monsoon weather in June brings in an annual wash of oil, a result of tankers dumping the waste at sea and the tide pushing it up onto the beach. The high tides wash away the gentle sandy slopes and built up shack ""patio"" areas making it look so different during monsoon season. Debris is washed up regularly, washed away on the next tide, yet to see the beach being cleaned."
Benaulim_Beach-Benaulim_Salcette_South,androrphin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A lively beach which is also used by local fishermen,"This section of the beach has a large number of shacks, some watersports and local fishermen. As usual the beach is huge, sandy, gently shelving with a large tidal range.It is livelier than Sernabatim Beach (15 minute walk away) but not as boisterous as Colva Beach (35 minute walk), at least when we there in early March. There are probably enough shacks to last at least a fortnight were you to visit a different one eacy time.There are always lifeguards on patrol as the currents can get quite strong. In fact there is a lifeguard station there and we saw some recruits being trained (think Baywatch).As mentioned the local fishermen use this beach a lot and there are several fishing boats around. It's interesting watching them beach their boats and sell their catch directly on the beach."

While the sea was refreshing and the shore was easy to walk, you had to watch where you stepped in the dry sand due to the number of dogs that roam the area and do their business wherever they want.  There were many piles of dog excrement between the sea and beach shacks."

We enjoyed seeing the locals bringing down bulls to give them a very welcome cool down in the sea though the waves were choppy for swimming in. Not the most attractive beach, but one which is good for a day visit, and for trying out the really excellent beach restaurants which are located close to the car parking area, like Pedro's and Johncy's. These places had live music going on at the weekend, and the menus were excellent. "

Benaulim_Beach-Benaulim_Salcette_South,AfricaAtNewYears,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Benaulim Beach to Benaulim Walk,"A pre-dawn, mostly street-lit, 2.5km walk on the paved roads between Benaulim Beach and Holy Trinity Church led to many encounters with packs of stray and set-loose dogs.   If walking alone, letting sleeping ones be, a walking stick and pepper spray helped to deter the dogs, while free-ranging cows, water buffaloes, and pigs were less aggressive when encountered.   Even small groups of walkers or runners seemed to have few difficulties.  Mosquito repellent was needed. Maria Hall and Kadar Supermarket are each roughly 1km from the Church and the Beach, respectively.   Produce, fresh fish, and ATMs are available at the Hall.   The Supermarket stocks most other necessities and close by are a chemist, the popular Hari’s German bakery/cafe, produce sellers, and a Kadar chicken shop. The holiday lights and decorations (photo of display across from Kadar supermarket attached) in Benaulim are plentiful and seemed more devotional and less commercial than in the West.  The 2.5 km walk can easily be extended another 15 minutes by continuing on in Benaulim to the also active and well attended St Sebastian’s. "

Benaulim_Beach-Benaulim_Salcette_South,PJT1009,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Miles of sandy beach,"Benaulim is a quieter resort but still offers lots of restaurants and bars on the beach. Many provide sunbeds during the day.The sea can be treacherous as always on this coastline and the beach is well patrolled by lifeguards. The pale sand is a paradise for children. For walkers, it is an easy stroll along the beach to nearby Colva or the opposite direction to equally low key areas. "
