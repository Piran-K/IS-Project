Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,Anshul G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Family,Hidden gem,"The Betalbatim beach lies between two better-known beaches- Colva and Majorda. However, unlike both beaches, there aren't any major resorts or shopping centers here, and that is why the beach is nearly untouched by commercialism. The beach is one of the cleanest and least-frequented I've ever seen. We saw mostly young families enjoying themselves here, and the nearby beach shack served scrumptious snacks so one could relax on the free beach beds all day!"

Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,Varun Deshpande,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Typical south goa beach,"Calm and peaceful beach about 40 mins from dabolim airport. Relatively underdeveloped compared to other South Goa beaches like Majorda and Benaulim. Only 2-3 resorts that seem to have beach access. The beach itself was very clean, white sand and lots of shells. It has been raining a lot this year so the sand seemed packed and the few shacks that otherwise operate on this beach were closed due to a cyclone warning. The water is clean and warm, perfect for swimming. No watersports or persistent hawkers which I particularly enjoyed. A wonderful beach to just lay back and relax."

Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,sharathr23,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Clean and less crowded beach,"A very nice beach that doesn’t see too many visitors (unlike the commercial beaches). This was very close, walking distance, to the resort that we stayed at so we spent a lot of time at this beach.Clean and well maintained beach, but during the time we visited the shacks were closed. The water level changes as the tides come in and go during the day so one has to be on the watch and alert while playing in the water. A lifeguard is positioned on the beach but only until the evening.Go there if your staying close by and need to be by yourself / your family."

Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,AP121,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Lovely place,We have just returned from 2 weeks here. The cottage we stayed in was perfectly functional. It was cleanish with just enough storage for your clothes. We were right by the pool at our  request and I'm glad we were.  It was just a few steps from our veranda to the pool and a few more onto the dining area.  The pool has roman steps into it which was great for me and our granddaughters.The food was amazing and I can honestly say I didn't have one bad dish. The staff in and around the cottages are outstanding! I am disabled and unable to walk unaided. If they saw me sitting on the veranda they would come over immediately and ask if i wanted tea/coffee/drinks and often bought me over breakfast while my husband had a sleep in. Desmond and Lalik were always ready to have a laugh and joke and were very attentive and helpful.The dogs that live in the resort were gorgeous. scruffy but loving. The one downside for me is the fact that the paths and walkways were so uneven and broken that it made walking very difficult.  Even able-bodied people were tripping.The only other thing is the music is very loud round the pool and very repetitive. Oh and the bed was so hard! It was like sleeping on the road!  But thats just a small irk in what was an amazing introduction to GoaWe would both return if the paths were sorted out.

Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,591dileepn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,A children friendly beach in Goa.,"Betalbatim beach is in South Goa. Unlike North Goa beaches. Our South Goa beaches are very children friendly. They have very gentle slope , very light surf and totally unpoluted and clean. We have very less crowd on these beaches and only those who wish to enjoy the swim and walk along the coastline frequent here. It’s part of a long stretch of beach that starts from Bogmalo beach and runs down to Mobor beach. The fine sand of the beach is so good you can walk on it without shoes or Chappell’s. It’s very popular among the locals hence on weekends people from Margão,Ponda and interior areas throng here for picnic and fun. On Sunday specially the place is like a park where old and young can be seen enjoying. Foreign tourists love this place as they enjoy here I disturbed. The shaded beach allows rest from scorching sun above. For those who like peace and tranquillity and wish to enjoy the beach this is best place, quite a change from the beaches in north like Calangute and anjuna."

Its hardly crowded and has great views and comfortable place to have a picnic. It would be good if you carry your own snacks as there aren't many options near the beach.

Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,Shonali79,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Mesmerizing virgin beach in white sand,"Words can't do justice to the mesmerizing beauty of this beach. One of the cleanest, virgin beaches I have seen - crystal clear blue ocean and striking white sand. This is one of the less crowded beaches, ideal for peace seeking travellers. So if you are looking for an action packed experience, you should skip this and head to North Goan beaches.Also to keep in mind - drinking is strictly prohibited here and venturing after 7 pm is also not allowed. These rules are to avert criminal incidents, notably a brutal gangrape had taken place a few months back. Its advisable to follow law of the land, stay safe and avoid venturing into desolate spots alone."

Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,RKD1984,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Peaceful,We visited for a couple of hrs. It's a very quiet peaceful beach with a handful of beach shacks to choose from for food/drinks. Doesn't seem to be much running up to the beach. Atmosphere was lacking to an extent but we were told that it was end of season so that may have been the reason why. Personally I would choose to stay near Benaulim (not too busy or too quiet) and visit Betalbatim  for an hour or  two.

Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,David D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Lovely stretch of Beach,"This is yet another Beach along the beautiful South Goan Coastline, it is situated between Sunset Beach on one side and Colva Beach on the other.From our base at Gonsua Beach it takes about an hour to walk, round trip, to this Beach. En route walking past Sunset Beach. There is a wonderful stretch of almost deserted white sandy beach between Sunset and Betalbatim Beaches.Like all beaches there are a number of Beach Shacks with the sunbeds and umbrellas for their guests. It looked a bit close together and crowded, there was a good gap between the first 2 shacks and those further down the beach.Beach Cleaners do patrol on a daily basis clearing up, ensuring that the Beach is clean."
Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,sunil4s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Exclusive Beach for those quiet moments,"Clear waters, shallow sea depth & amazing waves make this a must visit. Even the shacks are excellently placed & they dont charge you for the beach beds if you order enough food. Menu is available in English & Russian which tells you the kind of crowds expected here. Mostly East European. Beach is off the main course trail & so hasnt been heavily commercialized which explains the low crowds & the tranquility you get to experience."

Betalbatim_Beach-Betalbatim_Salcette_South,SujaJai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Great beach - very clean!,"Betalbatim Beach was less than 100 M from Nanu's Ressort where we stayed..The Beach is very clean, with a large strip of sand that is over 1 Km in length. Probably because it is lesser known than other beaches like Colva, there was not much crowd on the beach.We had the beach practically to ourselves in the mornings - so we walked, jogged, swam as we liked. We were at the beach in the evening also to watch the brilliant sun set.It was good to that they had a manned-life guard station. The Life Guard was quite active and alert - he did not loll around in the cabin..Very glad that we chose to stay so close to Betalbatim Beach  as we could visit whenever we wanted during the 3 day stay in Goa."
