Church_of_Our_Lady_Of_Hope-Candolim_Bardez_North,Arjun G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Amazing Church in Old Goa,"Visited this special location in Sep 23 and had an amazing time. The grounds around the church are beautiful and well kept. Lovely photo opportunities. Once inside the church, it is steeped with history. I would recommend a tour guide as it helps one to understand the background and context more. There is a very famous ""Miracle Cross"" situated inside the church. It is said it is the last cross that Jesus was crucified on. Whether this is true or not, I do not know. However, I felt in awe of being near the cross and paid my respects by doing a prayer. The ""Bom Jesus"" church is also located nearby and some restaurants and shops doing good food and wonderful souvenirs"

Church_of_Our_Lady_Of_Hope-Candolim_Bardez_North,Prescy Dias,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,"Beautiful, Artistic and Rare Church in Candolim, North Goa.","If you happen to visit Candolim, in North goa, do visit Church of Our Lady of Hope. It was rebuilt in the 16th century.  Just like the other churches in goa, this church too has beautiful altars, but there is something different about it , its style, the bell towers or the beautiful  picture work inside in blue, which is simply mesmerising.In 2013, the statue and  relic of Blessed Mother Teresa of Kolkotta was installed.Even to this day, this beautiful and serene church gives you a sense of peace and wonder at the artistic work done centuries ago and still not tarnished by time."
