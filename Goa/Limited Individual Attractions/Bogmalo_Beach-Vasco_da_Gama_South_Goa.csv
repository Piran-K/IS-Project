Bogmalo_Beach-Vasco_da_Gama_South,Veerbhan T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family,White sand and crystal clear water,"It a beautiful beach with crystal clear water with white sand, you can do water sports including scuba diving and snorkeling. There were no shakes, you can enjoy there for few hours, if you are doing water sports then this can be a one day trip.I made a 4 days booking in Bogmalo Beach resort however I cancelled after going through their reviews and visited this beach on my last day of Goa trip as it is near to airport and I found my decision was right as there is nothing much to do. I feel 1 day is sufficient for this beach."

But not allowed to get into the water due to strong current.Nothing much to do nearby as well .  Cleanliness is also an issue and of course there are the dogs which are little scary especially for somebody like me who is not familiar with dogs .Good place for 1 or 2 days stay max.RgsSantosh H

Bogmalo_Beach-Vasco_da_Gama_South,Nomad C,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Be very careful about seasnakes and other creatures at this beach,"I got bite on the bottom of my foot by something at this beach a few days ago. It felt like a seasnake. I ended up spending a night in the hospital and blowing 150usd. Luckily I didn't receive any venom. Seasnakes are apparently common at all Goan beaches but avoid the end areas at this beach. I made the stupid mistake of swimming outside of the lifeguard area, all the way at the far tip of the beach near where the cross is located (the opposite end from where the big hotel is located).  That area has some cloudy muddy water where I assume seasnakes and other creatures may lurk. So just stick to the lifeguard areas where more people swim. Seasnakes are less likely to stay there. The beach itself is nice. Clean, good sand, not that crowded, and some nice affordable restaurants on the beach. But obviously for me this is the worst beach I've ever been."

Generally you find most of the Goan beaches crowded and many find it truly difficult to find some silence from the mad rush most city dwellers are encountering. This is one such beach where you can find some relative solitude, if you are someone seeking that. The many water sport activities which you find available in most other beaches are absent here. If you are seeking to enjoy plenty of sunshine, serene ocean tides, clean surroundings coupled with some silence and calmness around you, this place will make you happy. There are some eateries & plenty of pocket-friendly accommodation available nearby which will suit most travellers. Plenty of transportation available nearby to ensure that you will be connected as and when you choose to."

The resort is located on the beach and the beach is almost a private beach as hardly anyone other than the resort residents are seen. A couple of shacks and a small market add to the charm of staying at this place. Rather than sitting in the resort bar, it is better to sit in the shack on the beach and watch the setting sun while having your beer.The hotel staff is extremely polite and helpful. I the five days stay i got to know a number of staff by their first names. Madhura and Karishma at the help desk were always smiling and actually helpful.

Not much fish is left in the water due to constant over-fishing by local boats. There are cleaners around the beach.

Their brochure stated that the nearest beach is within 5 kms radial distance so decided to pay a visit.  Bogmalo beach is located around 8 kms away from the Dabolim international airport.  It takes less than 15 minutes to reach here from the airport.  While reaching this place you will come across planes approaching the runway from your left but won‚Äôt be able to watch the actual landing due to high walls adjacent to the road.It is a relatively small beach with a small public parking area right across two-minute walk from the shore line.  It is better to have your own transport as public transport is limited in Goa.  There are few other beaches nearby & they are Bimbel beach, Hansa beach & Baina beach within a span of minutes driving distance.Couple of eateries nearby & many of them offer good food especially Claudis corner, Joets, Dom‚Äôs sea cuisine & off course the Bogmalo beach resort which dominates the entire south beach front area.Sunset view from Bogmalo beach is very nice."

Bogmalo_Beach-Vasco_da_Gama_South,CruisesXpert,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A very under rated beach,"I went to Goa on a cruise and since this is one of the closest beach to the cruise terminal/ Goa port, we decided to go here. There was a pre-paid taxi booth inside the port but since we were meeting a few people outside the port we didn't take the prepaid taxi which turned out to be a mistake as the taxi driver we hired, jacked up prices for return after dropping us at the beach.The beach itself was very quiet on the Tuesday afternoon that we were there. Since it is rated nowhere in the top beaches in Goa, I expected it to be dirty or crowded with locals or both, but to my surprise there were less than a 100 people on the beach and it was very clean. There were life guards on duty which is always a good sign.We sat at Joet's shack by the beach-side. The food was decent, relatively inexpensive and the beer was good. All in all, it was much better than I expected it to be and I would definitely recommend giving this beach a try if you are around."

Bogmalo_Beach-Vasco_da_Gama_South,Ambalavattom,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Sea, Sun and Sand in South Goa","Bogmalo is a seaside village in Goa. The beach is 5 km from Goa International Airport. Vasco can also be reached in 10 minutes (4.3 km). Bogmalo Beach is a clean and quiet sandy beach of about 1.5 km which curves around a bay. This place is not very crowded and is free of beach hawkers. You can also spot a couple of beer bars on the beach and small restaurants.Life guards are stationed on Bogmalo Beach. You must observe their flag warnings because there are strong currents in the sea.We found a few cows wandering on the beach. However they are not a nuisance if left alone.The width of the beach is big enough to permit people to walk, rest or play without bumping into each other. Furthermore, it is a great place to watch sunsets.Travellers can hire two wheelers from Vasco at Rs. 200 to Rs 500 per day. Keep in mind that petrol costs will be extra."
Bogmalo_Beach-Vasco_da_Gama_South,Isha C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Perfect beach to spend 2-3 hours in peace,"This beach is even more peaceful than Palolem and Arambol beaches (known for being relatively quiet). We visited one of the shacks here. A walk on the beach is perfect and since there are no hawkers and people, it is amazing overall."

Bogmalo_Beach-Vasco_da_Gama_South,Priyanka N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Beautiful Beach to Relax,"Bogmalo beach is small but glorious. It had the right mix of local and touristy vibes - people playing cricket, fishermen untangling their nets and beach shacks that serve delicious food. Just sink your toes into the sand and enjoy a quiet sunset or head to the beach bars for a night of karaoke. Perfectly gentle waves for little ones to wade and splash about."
Bogmalo_Beach-Vasco_da_Gama_South,Sailee Paranjpe,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Bogmalo Beach,"If you are staying in the nearby resorts, Bogmalo will surely be on your list but apart from that, if you are around Vasco, give this place a visit. You could also visit the other places in Vasco like the Japanese Garden for the view it has. There is nothing much to do here. You would typically end up spending about less than an hour here. It is one of the lesser crowded beaches of Goa."

Not a very large beach , dominated by a large beach resort with the same name.. most of the time the tide is low and it is not safe for swimming but the sand is good and the beach is clean. There are a few small shops selling artifacts and a couple of beer bars on the beach and tiny restaurants and provision stores.

Bogmalo_Beach-Vasco_da_Gama_South,G A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Small but nice beach near Dabolim airport,"The Bogmalo Beach is a pretty little bay just below the Dabolim airport plateau, on the southern  side.  The beach is around 600-700m in length end to end, at low tide.Though obviously it can't be compared with the endless sandy stretches at Colva & Calangute, Bogmalo has its own charm and is perfect for visitors who do not want to travel far from the airport which is a mere 10min drive away.The beach has its fair share of shops, shacks including high end like Joets and John Seagull, a couple of star hotels and several guest houses in the vicinity.   Life guards are on duty throughout the day.  A small friendly gang of stray dogs and a couple of harmless bulls have made the beach their home!   The surrounding village still retains its old world charm and the locals are polite and friendly.On weekdays there aren't any crowds and the beach is quite  inviting, especially early in the morning.  Visitors do tend to leave their rubbish behind and   cleaners are deployed to keep the beach clean.  Unfortunately, there is no way to stop people from consuming alcohol on the beach and even worse to penalise them for leaving their bottles (glass bottles too) behind.  In the evenings, locals from Vasco and surrounds also come to enjoy the beach.  Weekends can be crowded though its fun to people watch.  In season, the local fisherfolk offer boat rides to Isla Grande which can be seen from the beach.  Dolphin watching rides are available too.  We once saw them throughout the day from the beach itself, albeit some distance off shore.  The Naval Aviation Museum is nearby.All in all, the Bogmalo Beach is nice if you are staying near the airport or dont want to travel far."
