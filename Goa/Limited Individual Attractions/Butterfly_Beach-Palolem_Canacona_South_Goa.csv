Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Navid Khan,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,This is a scam.,"This is a scam. The trek to the beach is long, dirty, unsafe, and you will have to battle insects and mosquitos, bikes and scooters and off-road vehicles while on it. It is about 3 KM from the closest parking for 4 wheelers and 2 KM from the closest for 2 wheelers. The trek is in no way worth the beach. The beach itself is barely a beach, it‚Äôs a tiny cove with boulders on either sides, and a very steep slope into the sea. It is littered with plastic, coconut shells, and general waste. It smells like a toilet. There‚Äôs nothing about this beach you‚Äôd want to make the effort, probably smart to just skip it."

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,D_80808,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Pleasant enough beach seen as part of boat trip,"We spent 20 mins here as part of a boat trip from Palolem. Rs 1000 each, which perhaps was the non-Indian tourist price, and six people + a child in the boat. The trip was supposed to last 90 mins but lasted 75. Saw some dolphins in the bay and nice boat ride. No butterflies spotted though."
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,suresh k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Tranquility personified.,"Very small beach. Cute, absolutely no crowd. No dhabas, etc just the you and the nature. Good to spend an hour or so. Peaceful. If you are a bird lover like me you would be lucky to capture a few of them. You would also be lucky to capture few Dolphins on way to this beach. Of course, not a Bollywood fan. Kaho Na Pyar hai song sequence was shot here."
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,NewBee,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Butterfly Beach, turtle , lord Ganesh Boulder","You can reach butterfly beach via Palolem beach or Agonda beach..We opt for Palolem as I could see more boats on the beach. You need to be a good negotiator.We got Rs 500 per seat .I didn‚Äôt like much about the beach , untidy small beach , not recommended for swimming also.It‚Äôs a small beach in between two mountains, which you need to imagine that it looks like butterfly.The boat person will show you some more boulder which look like (from a specific angle ) Lord Ganesh, turtle . If you are lucky, you may experience Dolphin .Best time is early morning say around 7:00 am Total duration of the trip: 1 to 1.5 hrs , including 20 mins of butterfly beach."
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Rabia,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Overhyped and crowded!,It was on a weekday and around 100 people were there on this tiny spot. Not worth it at all! We left the moment we entered. Thumbs down! üëéüèº
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,sachin b,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Awesome picture perfect beach..!,"It was absolutely wonderful experience to visit the beautiful place near Agonda beach know as BUTTERFLY BEACH. Since the boat rides were closed,we decided to trek through the leopard valley. You need to park your vehicle at the parking area and then walk through the dense forest for about 2-3 km to reach the small but Beautiful and serene beach. Isolated,secluded beach gives you a perfect location for  photography and videography. But if you are traveling early in the morning keep some stick with you and if you are alone or as a couple keep the small speaker on while heading towards the beach to avoid fear since it's very isolated area covered with the trees and there is no sign boards or indicators,just follow the small but main road to reach there. But once you reach there it gives you an absolutely mesmerizing views. It gets slightly crowded afterwards so head early in the morning. Perfect for the couples. If it's raining then avoid. Always ask the details at your Hotel reception regarding the current status."
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Pratush,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Loads of Trash. This Place is full of hype!,I guess this beach has got hyped a lot and when it is recommended by every one on the internet it generally loses it's charm very quickly. You will reach this beach after 1.5 hrs of trek if you're a fast pace walker as it's a trek from the jungle sometimes there is a Thar who can drop you from one point to another which can save time he charges INR 300/-PP while he will also not be able to drop you right to the beach or pick you up from starting point of the parking lot. You can totally skip this place and mute yourself with all the recommendations.
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Manish B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Unique Beach,A very different beach as compared to the other beaches of Goa. A must-visit place while you are going to goa.
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,RitikaSD,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Extremely overrated! ,"We read some great things about this beach and were very excited about our boat trip here. Unfortunately, it was extremely disappointing. It just seemed like a commercial stunt as it was super crowded, we didn't spot a single butterfly and not at all the experience we thought it would be. If you like ticking things off a touristy list and clicking million pictures, you might want to visit here. If not, then please don't waste your time. Also, the dolphins they claim you will see on that boat ride are a rare sight! We ofcourse were lucky in that department either."

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,MaithiliSave,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Awesome beach,"We went to butterfly beach from Palolem beach by a boat. it was 1 hour 20 minutes tour. Butterfly beach is awesome. Water is very clean and clear. There are some rock son which you can take nice pictures. They always say that we may see dolphins, but dolphin sighting is very rare. If you go by boat, you get to spend around 30 minutes on this beach."

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Sonia P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Beware on the hike to the Butterfly beach,We were four girls and we decided to hike to butterfly beach through a thick jungle trail. This is the only way if you wish to walk yourself towards the beach. The man made trail goes amidst the forest. You can take a two wheeler upto a certain distance and then hike for around 2 kms. We were walking through and around 1.5 kms later we heard a big cat growl. We stood there for a minute and heard it loud and clear from a nearby distance consistently. We decided to turn back and not risk it.The unfortunate part is that there are no sign-boards or forest department representatives to hint or guide travelers about the presence of big cats in the jungle. We could have landed ourselves into trouble. I advise everyone who likes to hike in jungles to never use earphones while you hike and be very cautious about the sounds you get to hear. Be safe.
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Sheetal Pradhan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Not worth going to,You can go by boat ride but you cant go to beach because the water is very deep. It is just a small strip of sand. You can access the beach by trekking as well but thats not for families.
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,HIRAL G,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,okay okay,"Hi there..would like to review the much hyped ""Butterfly Beach"". It is around 90 kms away from North Goa firstly. Secondly, the entry to this beach is not very easy. Avoid going by a Car. Two wheelers are preferable. Very narrow way/road to the beach and that to full of stones. Have to walk at least 500 meters to reach the beach after parking and at least 2-2.5 km after car parking. Talking about the beach, it is a clean and small beach. Cannot go into the water as it is deep. Good for photography that's it. Nothing extra-ordinary about the beach. Still wondering why it is so hyped."
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,FotoTraveller24,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Do a boat drive to this beach,its a less explored beach in south Goa. You need a take boat or do trekking to reach here. Sunset from this beach is very good.

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,wandermay08,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Dolphin watching and turtle shaped rock,"We took a ferry from Palolem Beach to Butterfly beach. On the way, spotted dolphins. Strangely the water was green in color and looked heavily polluted. The ferry men will show a turtle shaped rock etc. They will allow 30 minutes approx to chill on Butterfly beach. Nothing great about the beach itself except for clicking pics.Recommended to visit once."

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Yukthi Manjunath,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Butterfly Beach - Not worth the visit,Its a very small beach and accessible only by boat. I really don't know why people speak so high about it. There are better places to visit around instead of this small beach. It might really look and get crowded even with less number of people.

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Sid,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Place worth visiting,It was almost getting to 5.30 pm from Palolem so not sure if we could see the sunset. A 20 mins ride from the P. Beach and it was just a strip of land and got its name as it was shaped like butterfly wings. There is clean shallow water where one could swim freely and was great for the kids. We were luck to see the sunset which was beautiful. Time here was worthwhile.

Bottles, chips packs, plastic bags, shoes, leather bags, cigarettes, diapers...The place has been abandoned by local authorities and took over by the worst kind of tourism.I would personally close the whole place and have people searched before entering the land and of course charge for it.Hard punishment with 5000 ruppees chalan for the ones who are found throwing things in there.Such a shame that it is presented as a dream beach when it's actually a trash bag.Don't go there and if you go just clean up your mess !"

Unlike some other beaches this one is accessible by boat and also by climbing down the headland pathway.The beach has been named due to it's shape, the headland resembles the shape of butterfly wings. This was more obvious from out at sea rather than up close.When we were here, the beach with it's golden sand, was virtually deserted apart from a few visitors walking along the beach.There are no facilities on this beach, so if planning to spend some time here, make sure to bring everything you require including water.Our boat guide did offer us the opportunity to go ashore on to the beach to take some photos, we declined so we continued on our trip to the next highlight.We were pleased to have taken the boat trip which enabled us to see places like this beach."

We passed Monkey Island, saw some dolphins, and landed on Butterfly Bay, otherwise unreachable without a 3-hour bushwhack. It‚Äôs a lovely place with huge boulder rocks, where you can walk around for 20 minutes or so. Then back in the boat to watch the stunning sunset as you cruise back to Palolem. Definitely one of the highlights of my few days in South Goa."

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Ian C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Being spoiled by inconsiderate tourists,"It is a bit of an anathema that a tourist spot is being spoiled by tourists, but this secluded and difficult to reach place is now something of a dumping ground for tourists who leave their litter here and do not take it back with them to dispose of sensibly. It used to be very quiet and was known as the honeymoon and love beach because of its seclusion, sadly not any more.Unfortunately at Palolem beach there are many ""fishing"" boat owners touting for an easier life by offering dolphin and butterfly beach trips and at 400 rupees or so for each person. In a way I can't blame them.If you do go then you need to take your drinks and food for the day with you, but please take it back with you when you leave, its not much to ask."

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Ashish M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Secluded beach... difficult to reach,"Extremely secluded beach in South if Goa. Close to Agonda beach. Really long, circuitous and very difficult dirt track to reach the beach. The last lap has to be walked on foot as it's very Rocky. I saw horses with tourists going to the beach as well. The beach is obviously very pretty but quite small. If you have small children then I would suggest to avoid going there at all. Younger people will find it easier to get there. Older people can also give it a miss as it's really not easy to walk even the last stretch."

You can take a boat to this beach from Palolem or Agonda but I would say trek to this place. It's amazing. search for Leopard valley in google maps and get inside the gates. Keep going straight if you're on 2 wheeler or on walk. With 2-wheeler you'll only have to walk for max 10 mins. And if you're walking all the way it would take 20-25 mins. The place is worth a visit. And I was skeptical about going there by myself being a solo female traveler but didnt find any safety concerns. Go without a second thought but make sure you are going at the day time. Path is through the forest but you can figure out easily"

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Kiraneve,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Butterfly beach,Paid ¬£8 to go on a boat trip to this island. Its pretty but I didn't think was worth the money. If you're the adventurous type then hiring kayaks and paddling over yourself would be more fun and worth while. Its called butterfly beach bevause the bushes are slightly shaped into butterfly wings. On the boat trip I went on we only got to stop off at this island for 20 minutes and the rest of the time we were just cruising around. Which didn't really interest me.

We couldn't go in the morning, but do make a visit early to see dolphins on your way.There is one little shop if you need water or anything, but it is advised you carry your water and snacks with you. We also went further and saw honeymoon beach, but it was not accessible due to high tide so went back to butterfly beach.And please... keep the beach and the sorroundings clean and carry empty packets in your purse/bag and discard it properly, rather than throwing it on the beach irresponsibly!!

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,frobscottled,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Give it a miss,"If you are staying in Agonda and Butterfly Beach is promoted as an island to visit, don't pay heed to it. The boat trip is nice and you should go in the morning for dolphin-spotting, but the visits to Honeymoon and Butterfly island are a waste of time. Small beaches crowded with rowdy tourists who litter and leave the beach dirty. Avoidable."

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Shukulsaab,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Overhyped,It really wasn't that great unless you trek a bit. It was a good experience to travel in a boat to this beach but I didn't find this or even the honeymoon beach any good. You can miss this.
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Sagar Iyer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Pretty little beach,Great little secluded beach between Agonda & Palolem. It's present shaped silver sand beach with rocks at both sides. The water is clear and blue/green. The waves aren't big.There are two ways to reach - First is a nice 2km hike through forest and stones. The other is the easier way out by taking a boat from Agonda or Palolem which costs around 1-2k  but limits your stay to around half an hour at the beach.Great place to hang out and relax away from he maddening crowd.
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Jani H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Beautiful Island,"The boat takes you dolphin watching then drops you off on Butterfly Beach or Honeymoon island where you can relax.During monsoon boats are not working so if you want to see this island then avoid monsoon season when high tides are there. There are no beach shacks there, so you should bring food and drink with you if you intend to stay for a long time. We only stayed here for 20 minutes, but it was enough time to explore the rocks on the beach. Its not safe because of slope so avoid to swim.Would 100% recommend this beautiful place."

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,gauth333,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Small, beautiful and may be dangerous","One of the means of reaching this beach is through a local ferry. The beach is secluded, rocky and surrounded with by formations kinda cliffs. Remember to carry food and water along coz nothing is available at this beach. We found people jumping off the rocks into water but it did'nt seem safe at at all. Locals fisher woman collect mussels attached to the rocks again that looked like a dangerous affair. The beach is really beautiful but take precautions while visiting this place. We did spot dolphins enroute when we took the boat ride which was really cool."
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Nikhil V,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Average,It's a secluded beach compared to other beaches but other than that nothing special about it. The boat ride is fun though and offers many glimpses of dolphins
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,nicolectomas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Beautiful beach,"A gorgeous, secluded beach that you need a boat to access. The boat takes you dolphin watching then drops you off on Butterfly Beach where you can relax. There are no beach shacks there, so you should bring food and drink with you if you intend to stay for a prolonged period of time. We only stayed here for 30 minutes, but it was enough time to chill in the sea and sunbathe, plus explore the rocks on the beach. The only downside is that there is a litter problem ‚Äì lots of plastic bottles thrown on the beach. If you are planning on visiting ‚Äì please take your rubbish with you. Would 100% recommend this beautiful place."

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,srikx,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Small beach, beautiful but be very careful ",The butterfly beach can be reached by boat (recommended)The beach it self is about 40 meters wide (along the water) and about 70 meters inland. Good to spend about half hour. But one needs to keep the following in mind since this beach comes with some level of risk.1. It is not safe during high tide as the currents are strong2. The depth is steep and one needs to be very careful

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,saquib_khan16,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A beautiful isolated island getting commercialised,"It is a beautiful, isolated island, discovered by the Russians and other international travellers to move away and find seclusion from the regular tourist frequented spots such as Palolem and Agonda. The island can be reached by a boat and takes about 25-30 minutes from both Agonda and Palolem. They charge you about 600 for a shared boat (depending on the season) and somewhere between 2200-2500 for a private boat in season (Oct-Apr). It is a wild island with no habitation. On the way you can spot dolphins as well and a unique monkey inhabited monkey island. A once pristine beach is visited by a flock of tourists that come with each boat and is facing the fate of the tourist influx - plastic and bottles all around in its wild bushes and grasslands."
Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Cazalobe,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Soon to be lost,"The beach is indeed beautiful and such a beautiful trip to make with families, friends or anyone really, however, the sad part is that when people visit and picnic they trash the place, we say beer bottles, cans, plastic bags, leftover food, plates, ship packets, and all sorts. The busier it gets, the dirtier it gets, I did not see one garbage bin in site.I loved the natural beauty of the beach but it is sad what people are doing to it"

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,vipultmi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful beach with clear water,"Goa is all about plenty of beaches, but this is one of the beach which should not be missed. However said so, it is not like other beaches of Goa. There are are no vehicle that reaches this beaches. Either u go by boat from palolem or trek. The boat will cost you 2800 for full boat but if u can get another family them you can share the price. We 4 peoplebin family paid 1400 and rest 1400 war paid by other family. They will take you for 1 hr. 3 beaches are covered  in this 1 hr along with dolphin view, but only 1 island they Iill stop either at honeymoon island or butterfly island. Butterfly island is too good to for capturing pictures, relaxing for some time and enjoying the clear water with amazing view. One should go of staying on South Goa"

Another beach, the honeymoon beach was also included in the trip. But we could stop only on one beach. We decided to stop on the butterfly beach. It is known as ‚ÄúButterfly Beach‚Äù because of the shape of the valley. It is located between the Palolem and Agonda Beaches of South Goa, this beach also has a trekking route. If you plan to go in the sea on this beach... be careful of the depths!"

Butterfly_Beach-Palolem_Canacona_South,Karen P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Paradise <3,This beach is paradise for beach lovers especially those who love privacy and peace. We took a boat ride from Palolem beach to get here. They show a few other spots on the 1-hour boat ride which cost 1200 for two of us. We spent 20-25 mins here but it was worth the money!. The beach is small and no stalls so make sure to carry food/water. Make sure to eat well before the boat ride as it's a bit rough and also wear comfortable clothes as they tend to get wet with the spray of the water. A must visit place in Goa.
