Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Aruna Gunawardena,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,Portuguese Invasion Of India ,"The Fort has not been restored properly. Which is sad for a historic, if not iconic place to visit when in Goa.It reminds me of a similar place in Portugal called Cabo De Rocca "
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,KeKu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Ruins of an old fort,"Cabo de Rama is one of the oldest forts of Goa. It has been possessed by different dynasties at different times. There is nothings much to see at the fort as such. Only the ruins are left. Not much looked after by Govt or ASI, seems. However, the views from the fort are fabulous. A good one time visit."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Manish B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Hidden Gem of Goa,"This is an amazing place in south goa. The fort is not so big, but the main attraction is the beach down the fort. Worth visiting place."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Ria1104,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Couples,Instagram-worthy Fort in South Goa,"We visited this fort on our way from Palolem to Benaulim. Its best if you have your own vehicle as we did not see any option of public transport there.We dropped our luggage at the security and went to explore the fort on our own. There is a church at the centre though it was closed when we went. Soon we crossed it and found the way to the pebble beach. You have to trek down a little to reach the waters. There were pebbles all over and walking on the pebbles near the water was quite challenging. We still managed to dip our feet and get few cool snaps. There is a small shop near the top from where the hike starts, selling water, coconut, lime soda etc. We refilled ourselves here and went on to the other less crowded part of the fort. This part had a wall covering the view so getting a cool shot was a challenge. We finally utilized a hole in the wall used as a check point and clicked some pics.This place can get quite hot during summer afternoons so carry umbrella, sunglasses and water. Apply proper sunscreen and wear comfortable shoes else getting down to the pebble beach might be a challenge. There is a restaurant just a turn away from the fort where you can have food."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Tintu Varghese,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,Great place with less crowd,"Cabo de Rama Fort and Pebble Beach: The fort is in ruins, but the view from the top is stunning. The pebble beach at the descent is a must. The sunset view will be great at this spot. We discovered a man asking for entry fees only to find out it was a scam. Despite having threatened to pay, we didn't. But many people fell into his trap."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Seema Shah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Worth a visit,"A short visit, walk around the fort, enjoy the beauty of the church followed by a stone stepped pathweay to the pebble beach. "
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,deepak_misra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Worth Visiting,"This is an ancient fort in south goa and a picturesque and long drive from “main goa”.The fort is largely in ruins and there is not much to see. However there is very dense greenery and one can walk across the walls and see spectacular views of the sea.If you have a sense of history, you can stand there and imagine soldiers keeping a look out.There are supposed to be perennial springs but attractions are not well labelled.  There is also a church which seems to be in good condition and in service but it was closed when I was there.In general you can spend an hour or two here. There is a very steep staircase down to the pebble beach but we did not go down. Carry water and a cap.Parking is freely available.Evenings might be a good time to visit around sunset though we visited in the morning. Combine with a beach visit.Trip might be more interesting if you read up about the history of the place (We did not)SOme of the climbs might be strenuous for elderly"
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,CHETANsurat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Old fort tourist place in South Goa,"Very old fort. tourist place in South Goa.Near beach No entry ticket any food available at fort.It was Portuguese fort, the place was abandoned and, later used as the government prison."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Sandip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Worth a visit !,"Entry to the fort is free and parking available in the front area. The fort unfortunately is in shambles. The complex also houses a Chapel which was closed. Few mins away and one could get down to Pebble Beach , a rocky one with steep steps to get down . The views from the top are amazing ! There is a stall on the way to the beach selling Coconut and Lime water. Best visited during the evening ."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,PreetiChhatre,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Friends,"Nature lovers, photographers, dont miss this fort","If you like to explore new routes, nature, then don't miss this fort while in South Goa.Actual fort is in ruins, but it offers splendid sea views from top.Approach road is motorable throughout, all greens, very nice, There's the Pebbles beach at the base of approx 150 steps. They're rock steps, give a feeling of trekking or excursion. The beach is beautiful. You have to climb back all the steps to exit the fort. So, in a way, going to Pebbles beach is optional. You may roam around atop the fort and leave.We spent about 2 hours on the beach and fort. Carry snacks and drinking water as there are no facilities inside the fort."

Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,wandermay08,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Picturesque view,This is a hidden gem of South Goa. Awesome place to click photos because of the picturesque view. Visited late afternoon. There was a private beach resort but entry is allowed only for foreigners. We did not go on the beach just watched from the hill top. Recommended place to visit and watch the sunset.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,SHAILESH M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Ruins from the Portuguese era,Fairly well maintained. Has good view. Visit early in the  morning when the sun is not so hot as there are quite a few (around 100 ) steps to climb.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Sid,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Great views,Interesting all the way down in South Goa. I loved the drive to the fort but unfortunately was in a van and not on a Bullet. The Fort has nothing much to see except some old ruins. The view from down below in the water with rocks was scenic and also from the top.

Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,ghoomboom,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Ruins of an Old Portuguese fort in Deep South Goa,It was a Portuguese fort but now in ruins. It is about 35 km south of Madgaon. Ride from Madgaon junction to this place is a very beautiful picturesque ride with good roads. There is a small church also in the area. The fort is just on the sea shore and there is a beautiful beach also near the fort. Small isolated beach but the access is rocky. Good place to visit if you take interest in historical ruins.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,ShvRm_Traveller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Small fort cum observation post,"The fort is located off the beaten track from the tourist's point of view. It is small fort, which is currently in ruined state. The entrance gate and the ramparts along side it are in good condition. There is a church inside the fort, which is in use, by the locals. The fort wall on the sea side is in poor condition. There is trail which can be followed to walk around the fort. The fort offers a very good view of the sea and land features around it. The fort is small and may have served as an observation post to keep an eye on the approaches from seaward side.Very few tourists visit the fort and local visit mostly out of curiosity. View from the fort is stunning, especially during the rainy season, however, it is very windy, so the visitors have to be aware of this."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,tedsontop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Very Interesting ,Lovely place to stroll around free entry and some really beautiful views both west and east from the ramparts. Short stop for us but we’ll worth the short detour from main road. 
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,shoyjoseph,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,amazing place with amazing veiws,a must visit place in goa. the view you get from this fort is amazing. you can sit there for hours getting mesmerized by the view. the vast sea view with beautiful shores clad with trees.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Gala2812,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Amazing views,"Quite an easy place to reach by car or by bike. The half destroyed fort built by the Portugese in the second half of 18th century on the place of some former Indian kingdom's settlement. I strongly doubt this place has anything to do with the legendary Sita and Rama except for the name. The not so big area is surely worth of taking time to explore. Amazing views and best vacation pics garanteed. Coconut, cashew and banyan trees (or tree? - hard to say because of its airy roots that become trunks with time) inhabited by the herd of langurs and numerous birds. Langurs are really fun to watch eating banyan fruits or climbing around. Picturesque old walls. Do not forget to have hats, water and sunscreen with you. There are a few nice restaurants close to the location.  "
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Paritosh K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Beautiful Views,A little out of the way from the main roads this is a surely a place to visit for the beautiful views it  assures of the clear blue waters and the scenery. The fort like most forts in India is not quite maintained and would liked to have a bit of info regarding its history but nonetheless a surely needs to be in the itinerary for an off the track experience.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Kerala Wildlife,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Fort Cabo de Rama- a Water-Hill Fort as per Indian Fort architecture,"The fort of Cabo de Rama or Kalhad  fort was built by Shivaji , a Hindu King of Maratha in 1679.It is constructed with Indian Fort Architecture and a combination of Water (Jal Durg) and Hill ( Giri Durg) Forts. Though it is located in a strategic location, it never witnessed a war. The original name given by Shivaji if Fort Khelad. The barren laterite out crop of the cape has some interesting petroglyphs. Apart from its interesting history it is an ideal spot for hiking along the fort walls in the cliff edges of the cape watching sea, fishing activities , local fisherman village, pelagic birds etc. It is not a crowded place. There are few restaurants a km north of the fort. There is a cliff beach with white sand shore is another attraction. Roads and narrow path along the  barren laterite plateau is ideal for  cycling and hiking."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Sandeep N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,An amazing Portuguese fort. Need to be take care by the government,The fort is in bad shape. I wonder why it is not taken care off. Walk inside u will find a small church. Walk further and u can see an unobstructed view of the Arabian see. I would say if u r in group it's a must visit. Won't recommend it for couples as it's isolated.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Rasmita_Ori,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Beautiful view steeped in history ,"Easily accessible Fort. If you wish to see the view however, there are numerous steps to climb. We'll worth the walk though.Do take water with you, especially in November as it get s hot.Alongside the steps to the fort, be sure to look at the amazing trees!"
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,guruprasadhn,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Fort in shambles and located quite far. Good view from the bastions,"If you can spare over 2.5 hours in travel (both ways) from Madgaon and have 45 minutes to spare at the fort you can visit this fort. Nothing great to write back home as there is absolutely no upkeep and you can see complete neglect from the archeological survey or the Government. Canon guns are seen lying in the bush. walkways are bushy. The views from the bastions are brilliant. Good to watch the sun setting from the horizon. Agonda beach is somewhat nearby and we were told that people can take a ferry which goes few kms mid sea for Dolpin sightings. However, we ran short of time and could not go there. Coco beach also has ferry service for dolphin sighting. Cabo de Rama is a far flung place and no public transport option. We went by self drive. The drive by the country side is very charming and soothing to the eyes. The roads are rough at patches and very narrow. Some stretches are blocked with stray cattle and dogs. I did not find the effort spent in reaching the place to be worth it. Can visit once for a tick in the box"
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Achal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Amazing scenery,"Very nice sea view when you reach up on the fort. Vast, peaceful and serene ocean soothes the eyes and soul."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,S_A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Quiet and Beautiful location,This is not much heard of location and is still not crazy crowded like the other Goan tourist location. Really enjoyed our ride from Caravella beach resort and it was adventurous to get around and explore the scenic surroundings. I highly recommend this place to everyone.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Elteejay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Beauty of the wilderness,"For most visitors to Goa, the Cabo de Rama Fort is not on the itinerary. It is a wonderful place to spend a day in isolation, in meditation or just roaming around with just panoramic views of the Arabian Sea."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,freddyg13,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Pirates of the Indian Ocean,"It was a great historical site to visit that doesn't see many visitors, but good and bad. It's not a well-maintained site (thus the lack of tourist) but allows you to take it all in and enjoy the place.  Walking in and around it is very nice and relaxing.  I went with higher expectations, but with a different viewpoint towards sites like these.  In the end, I was still happy with my visit and enjoyed it with monkeys popping in and out of the place."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Stoned_hut,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Less explored by Indian masses.,We were not so very sure at first to visit this place but this place really offers one with the undisturbed waters of Arabian sea.The fort has wonderful views of lush green hills surrounded by the vastnes of the sea.A must try for offbeat lovers.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Deepak Roongta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Silent visit ,"This place is actually hidden from lots of tourists. Situated south of Goa and need attention from Goa authorities. This place really offer nice view of Arabian Sea, but place is quite messed and Government should take initiative to rehabilitate this place. May be they should charge entry fee, if they couldn’t afford expenses for maintenance. This way maybe lots of tourist can be attracted."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,SMLikestoTravel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Beautiful drive,"Cabo de Rama Fort is about 25 kms away from Palolem Beach where we were staying. It is a beautiful 45 minutes drive through lush greenery. It is worth a visit just for the beautiful drive itself. The fort itself did not have much to explore unlike forts in Rajasthan, but the views of the sea from the fort were amazing. There was no guide available when we visited and not much information available onsite. I wish I had read up about the fort before our visit so that I could better appreciate what I saw there.Important : Fill up the fuel tank from Palolem itself before you start the drive. There are no petrol pumps anywhere on the route from Palolem to Cabo de Rama. At one point, we were scared that we were going to be stranded mid-way without petrol. That's where the next tip is going to help. It seems, everywhere in South Goa that we travelled, the neighbourhood provisions stores also stock up on petrol sold in 1 litre bottles. Looks like there are a lot of tourists who end up like us :-) One such provision store was our lifesaver. We could fill up enough to get back to Palolem without being stranded."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,karishma_pb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Good view from here,To reach this place was like almost 1.5 hours. The fort is small not like Aguada Fort.But once you get on the top the view is serene. Do visit once.

Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Eamon M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Access reasonable for disabled ,Accessible for walking disabled not for a wheelchair the church inside the walls is beautiful and looks well maintained. The fort itself although parts are crumbling commands a great view over the bay with the old cannons still lay on the ground you get a great idea of how the place functioned and was defended. Well worth a visit. A helpful vote would be welcomed.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Praveen S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,A hidden gem ,Its a beautiful place with an amazing view and lots of peace... you go there and just enjoy the moment of tranquility.

Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,manojayyappan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,historical,"Amazing views of the ocean atop the fort.One of the oldest(pre-portugese)forts in goa.The condition of the fort is absolutely horrible because of non maintenance inspite of being a heritage site..the fort at aguada is much better comparitively..also the drive to caba de rama through the narrow,guttery roads is tiresome..no other interesting tourist sites nearby makes this a place to avoid in a trip to goa."

Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Dilraj49,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,History's Witness,"Here's a fort whose history is replete with changing ownership, apparently because of its strategic location which offered fantastic views of both the inland and the sea. However, as an interesting tourist spot at present, the access paths may possibly be made somewhat easier for the aged visitors."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,nivedita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Simply wow,"I got a chance to see  Cabo de Rama Fort during my Goa visit this month. First, it seemed like a ruined place, but walk a little far and you get to the see the jewel on the crown. An amazing sight to behold from the top of the fort. The sea side view alongwith sunset , small ships sailing on the sea. It was so beautiful. the sight from top is very much alive in my eyes. Click as many pictures you want, but for a moment just stop and soak in the view for few minutes. "

Do not expect much as the place is in ruins and reminds us of an era gone by... But it's a traveller's delight. Especially if you find beauty in the extraordinary things,  this place will surely enthrall you.  Explore the walls of the fort and then go down via steep rocks to the beach below.  "

The view is nice and you can also trek down to the rocky shore.It only makes sense if you have a vehicle at your disposal - the drive is quite nice There are 2-3 restaurants nearby (red crab, blue ocean and the Cape). The view from the one we visited (the cape) was fantastic and food was good. All in all a good trip!!"
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,TheWorldNut,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,For a one time visit,"Cabo de Rama fort is good if you have your own drive, its largely far from any near by place to stay hence also not much frequented. Its sad that whatever remains of the fort are left are largely not being cared for and the walls are royally spoiled by people scribbling names everywhere. Nevertheless the view from the top is nice and its a decent one time visit. Pro-tip: You can hike down to the rocks next to the sea below for a quite and great time by the sea (needs fitness and good footwear). The water down is really clean.There is not much around, except for a one little restaurant (decent food options here)."

It’s a very pretty walk/drive. The drive from further away would be magnificent."

The beach is wonderful too. However, there is another way that goes from the fort to the beach, past the only church inside. Worth the visit!"
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Rajesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Offers the best view,"You drive through village roads to reach this place. Drive itself is interesting. The entrance of the fort is deceptive. Once you go on top, it offers the mesmerising view of the Arabian sea. The fort offers the best view of pristine sea . This place is a must see if you visit Goa. "

Seems like authorities have stopped taking care of it. But it still has to offer beautiful views of the sea from the top. And with the breeze blowing, it sure makes up for a wonderful experience."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,pratik s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Heritage Fort with the Sea View,Cabo de Rama Fort is a heritage fort which gives a good view of the sea from the top. Sea breeze adds to the fun and the location gives a good view to capture photographs. You can take the jungle trek and reach to the beach as well which is fun too but we did not opt this option as my kid was tired.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Gizmocrystal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Beautiful scenery,"The views are spectacular here. Looking out from the top of the ruins beautiful views across the bay. On the ground level lots of trees and one huge one with the vines hanging down. We managed to see our first monkies here which were hard to spot. The church was closed but building is lovely. On the drive to here the small shacks sit amongst vibrantly painted houses. This really is a lovely place to spend some time. The taxi will wait for you as not a lot to do here once you’ve seen the views. Be ware of being over charged by the taxi, we have had to learn by costly experience. Non the less the drivers have been excellent."

Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Rahul J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Small fort with a view,I visited for only 10-15 min there there were no crowd inside .there is a beautiful church inside and there also parking space ifront of  main gate the stair of the fort are slippery you need to watch your steps and there is a amazing view from the top of the fort but there is no security guard or any care taker of this fort people are have written names on the walls that makes me very sad that they have spoiled a historical monument by writing names on the wall.there must be a caretaker of this place
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Milind Shah,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Old place but good view,"Decided to explore some lesser visited spots in South Goa and hence ended up at Cabo de Rama fort. The approx 1.5 hour drive was very enjoyable with lush green open fields and backwaters. The view of the sea from the Fort was a pure delight. While the place has nothing much to offer in terms of activities, One can sit on the edge for hours watching the sea. The government can surely work a bit on maintaing the fort and it can become one of the top attractions in South Goa. The place also has a beautiful church which just adds up to the beauty. "
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Ankita G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017,"Nothing much left, yet cliff view is amazing",While going to the Cabo De Rama Beach we stoped by this fort. Although nothing much is left to view but the surrounding atmosphere is amazing. The view from the fort provides panoramic angle of the surrounding areas and the sea view from the cliff is amazing!
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Gypsyking1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Cabo de Rama Fort,"Decided to take a detour and visit this fort on our way to Karwar. The fort is quite a long way off from the highway but the road is very good with little or no traffic. We arrived quite early and the place had just opened. The wall of the fort and the moat are quite impressive though it does need some maintenance. Once inside we climbed up to the main view point and immediately felt that the drive was worth it. Spectacular view from the top. There are also some old cannon lying around at the top which is reached by a steep flight of stairs - without any handrails. There is also a very pretty little chapel inside the Fort dedicated to St. Anthony. However, sadly, we could only view it from the outside as it was closed. I would definitely recommend this place provided you are not living too far away. Please note that the view point is not wheelchair accessible."
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,Sonali,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Old fort but with amazing view,We stopped here for some time on our way to Patnem beach.  Though the fort is poorly maintained with nothing much left to see. The view from the cliff is amazing. You can have some beautiful pics for lifetime memory. It takes around half to 40 mins to come from main NH 66 road. It hard to access due to the interior location. There are not many restaurants around.
Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,amrut k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,Nice place to visit,A bit far from the rest of the forts in Goa but quieter. Our resort was close by so went there. If you've car then do take this detour as its got historical value (ref to Ram settling nearby or something as per the guide) and is quite scenic view of the sea.

Cabo_de_Rama_Fort-Canacona_South,George T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Beautiful views,"Surely one of the best attractions in Goa, this ruined Fort is well worth a visit. It is open from 9.30am to around 5.30pm. Entry is free. Climb along the path surrounding the wall and you will be well rewarded with lovely views of the Arabian sea. There are points along the wall where you can climb out. You can sit on the rocks and look at the sea far below.If you are tired of the beaches and even if you are not, one must surely make this trip!"

Opening hours 9 to 5 everyday. View from the fort is amazing. It takes 2 hours to explore the fort. Take a bottle of water and something to eat. Don't trash this place. Bring back your trash. Road trip from Agonda to this place on a scooter is a pleasant experience. "
