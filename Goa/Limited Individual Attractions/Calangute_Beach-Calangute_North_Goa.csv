Calangute_Beach-Calangute_North,Raza,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Taken For A Ride,"I visited Calangute beach for the first time with my family on Jan 2, 2023. The beach is crowded. I saw a number of people standing on the edges of the beach waiting for their chance to get a water sports ride. On reaching Calangute beach, we were approached by a guy that we will get beach beds. We went with him, we didn't get it. We got beach chairs. Now here are some tips for you while visiting Calangute beach for the first time. 1. Look around, talk to 3-4 people before getting a beach chair. You won't get any beach bed. It's too crowded, all occupied. 2. Don't order any food on the beach except the most minimum priced non-alcoholic drink so that u can sit on a beach chair that some shack or restaurant has placed on the beach. Any food u order will b 5 times costly. If u r willing to pay that amount, u r free to do that. It's better u pack some snacks before coming to the beach to eat with ur ordered drinks. 3. Pls book your water sports rides before coming to this beach from established tour operators so that u pay acceptable amount n enjoy hassle-free rides. Otherwise there are many agents here who will take you for a ride - literally and figuratively. You will then end up paying 3-4 times the right price. 4. Enjoy the beach. Walk around. Watch people. Guess the number of states that people are coming from on this beach. 5. If you go for parasailing, check if other passengers with u stepping on the boat don't have alcohol or beer bottles in their hand. If u see that, make an excuse and get off that boat quickly. You don't want to see any drunken hassles n fights on the boat. "

Calangute_Beach-Calangute_North,Amit B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,It's a mixed bag,Visited with family. Beach is with good amount of sand for kids to play... Also with good amount of tides... Also lot of motor sports and boats are available. There is a good merket  selling beachwear etc is situated just at the entry of beach. The only negative point I see is that it is a bit too crowded. While clicking photograph we literally do not see in background any point without people. And this was the only beach in goa for which I was a bit sceptical keeping my scandals a bit away from me. Side note- Road leading to beach is a bit narrow seems can get stuck in jam sometimes !

Busy lanes leading to the beach front with limited parking space (couldn’t locate 4 wheeler parking). During peak season, traffic jams come easy. Entry to beach was dirty, filled with intruders selling something (tattoos, clothes, etc) and a staring crowd. Unfortunately, we went in the sunny afternoon and the sand was red hot. Had to choose a shack adjacent to the entrance and it was expensive. Overall, this is one beach that could be avoided (in peak season) unless you enjoy crowd. May provide better experience in off season."

Calangute_Beach-Calangute_North,srids,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Well maintained,"Looks neat Lot of sports activities. Suggestions to people wanted to do water rides: If you have money don't bargain much with those who are providing the water rides. By looking at the way they work whole day and eating food bought in polythene covers under harsh sun with no roof on top just to earn few bucks, I was really felt bad for those who can earn money only during the season. Beach is very nice and famous. There is 2 wheeler car parking at the entrance to keep vehicle safe. Paid 20/- for almost whole day."

The shack is run by a chap called Makan, a lovely friendly attentive fella that always made us feel so welcome👍🏼 He was constantly moving our umbrella throughout the day so we were always in the shade. Makan’s service of food and drink was excellent, 10 out of 10👍🏼😎👍🏼 bear in mind this is the busiest part of Calangute beach, possible busiest in North Goa so be prepared for an experience😂... for more relaxed options there are numerous other beaches in Goa, or just keep walking for around 500m or so on this beach and it’s a far quieter/chilled beach.

Calangute_Beach-Calangute_North,ghoomboom,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,The happening beach in Goa,"Nicely developed beach in North Goa and one of the most popular ones. Lots of crowd and water sport activities. Long beach and in fact is in continuity to another popular beach of Goa i.e. Baga beach. Reclining beach beds are in plenty but if you want to use one, you are expected to buy some drinks or food. The beach is children friendly and can be visited with families."

Very clean beach but you have to walk through a lot of stench and rubbish strewn paths to get the the beach. Goa tourist authorities need to address the dumping of trash near the beaches.

Calangute_Beach-Calangute_North,nisargraj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,One of the most popular beaches of Goa,"The silent beach - as the local people call it. One of the most famous beaches of Goa, which is slightly less crowded than Baga and Candolim. You will love the blue water and white sand of the beach but if you are planning to take a bath in the sea, it will hit you hard!! At least the day when I visited it, the  waves were very big and it was not easy to take a bath. There are many shacks on the beach, which offer food and drinks at (obviously) higher prices. If you just want to sit on those beds available on the beach and relax, you will be charged INR 100 per hour per bed, which is double than the price of the beds on Baga beach. Watersports are available here. The beach becomes a bit silent at night, so if you just want to hang out with friends, this is the perfect place."
