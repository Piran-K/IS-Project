Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,charms,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Must visit for silence and serenity..,"Less crowded and serene.. ideal for honeymooners, couple, girls.. beach beds with sun umbrellas are priced at 200rs, unlimited period... we rented them after checking out from our hotel, to spend some time on the beach instead of sitting in hotel lobby to kill 5hours.."
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Bhumika D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Tranquil ,"One of the calm beaches of North Goa. If you want happening atmosphere of North Goa, but peace of South Goa, this is the place for you. A lot of decent beach side shacks, serving surprisingly good food. A walk on the beach and breeze will take off all your stress for sure, especially towards senquirine beach. You can walk to lower Agauda fort from there."
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Simran Yonzon,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Visit to the beach,"The beach was nice since it’s nature and I appreciate nature. However, too many people mainly you’ll see mostly locals there, very dirty, not maintained properly and litters are everywhere. We had a good time there (me and my friends). The people there who were selling things and all, they were working very hard and appreciate their enthusiasm. It’s also a must visit budget friendly place for tourists staying in Goa."
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Rahul Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Peaceful beach and less crowded than Calangute,"A peaceful beach in North Goa when compared to Calangute or Bagga. Try walking toward the Sinquerim Beach, this portion is relatively peaceful and less commercial stuff.Beware of Dogs, packs of street dogs wandering and often target small kids. We saw one dog biting a one year old who was playing along and was hardly 10 mtrs from his parents. Luckily nothing happened as many people nearby rushed to help.Sunsets are quite amazing from Goa and can be seen from here as well."
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Vandana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Not recommended for bath,This beach enjoys fierce waves . Bathing is not advisable here.  On the days when the sea is calm one can spot a lot of dolphins. The ferries charge somewhere around 3000 rupees for an half an hour ride which includes dolphin sighting. It's a very clean beach.
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,VeeTee,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,An excellent outing. ,"We reached here at the very start of the tourist season. The beach was beautiful and with comparatively lesser crowds than other beaches. The sunset was a sight to behold.We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves although we missed the experience of the shacks as they were not operational. A comfortable distance from our hotel, Candolim has been our favorite beach destination for the past many years "

Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Somdutt P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Goa in the monsoon.,"Relatively uncrowded compared to nearby Baga or Calungate, it offers a peaceful place early in the mornings. Some beach shacks offer tea and massages even at 630 AM. Great for a peaceful morning stroll, freshened by the sea breeze. De-stress here. We stayed at the Lemontree Amarante Beach Resort, a five minute walk leads to the beach. Watch out for stray dogs on the way though. Some dramatic views in the monsoon. If you are willing to brave a bit of rain, this place is great in the monsoon."

Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Sruthi Krishnan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Great beach to get into water!,Candolim beach situated in North Goa is near the Aguada fort.. The water is shallow and makes a nice place for kids to have a blast. There are lots of shacks and resorts available along this beach for you to pick and stay with the luxurious one being Taj’s Aguada fort and Heritage propertyThis beach also provides a wonderful sunset view and is a great one for morning on evening walks. The only disadvantage being the amount of plastic bottles and glass pieces due to littering by public. Hence please be mindful of the same

With enough official parking space (both 2/4 wheeler) it is quite convenient to drive in. Cleaner, less crowded and with better crowd density (less youngsters) compared to calangute/baga. Not scenic when it comes to watching sunsets compared to Anjuna/vagator. Can enjoy beach sports (including parasailing), night/morning walks and grab a bite at multiple shacks (walk a little farther from the entry point to get quieter, less expensive shacks). Avoid peak sun timings (between 12-3pm)."

Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,lotusdiamond,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Just WOW!!  Finest beach,"Candolim Beach is best beach for family and friends to enjoy your holiday next to beach. Beach area is well maintained and lot of tourist friendly facilities are available. Parking is available. Local police station is just outside the beach. Lot many local shops selling beach wear, sleepers, jewellery but don't forget to bargain hard. Many local restaurants selling se food and other local food just outside the beach.

Lot of shacks, good food , great music ... you can walk upto Sinquerim beach and come back to the main road from Taj Fort Aguada/ Holiday village hotel side. Waiting to be back at the beach ...."
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Hooray H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Also my local beach,"It's beautiful but access is tedious- some paths would be good, especially for older people. Even though the cleaners are doing a great job, it's still dirty & please get rid of these awful flea bitten dogs- 50 dog bites a day at the health centre & the Authorities don't do anything. It's a disgrace!"
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,ashishdeora123,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,great,nice beach 15 from panji its on north goa  aguada fort is near to beach lots of bar and restaurant around it
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Adam J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,"Gorgeous, lazy sands and cool restaurants","A beautiful setting with good quality sand, great swimming, decent watersports and friendly restaurant-bars. If you want a laid-back beach vibe, this is the place. Service is generally very good, though a bit slow, and prices very reasonable. Stay in a guest house just a short stroll from the beach to save money, and as always negotiate in the local shops where prices often start way higher than if you are prepared to walk away and get called back. Food quality is generally good, with most places offering a range of dishes from traditional curries to English style breakfasts etc. Beer and spirits are dirt cheap. Watersports are a notch higher in pricing than the rest - my advice is to push for extra time rather then lower prices and try them when they are less busy. Local sellers will try to flog cheap tat - be polite but firm if you want to be left alone, and don't be fooled by little their little pantomime acts to get your sympathy. Explore the town and try out cooking classes and yoga if you can find it (rare these days), but agree reasonable prices beforehand. Great place for beach chilling and photo-ops, just remember that *you* are in control when it comes to sellers... "

Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,PavlH,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Lovely stretch of beach,The beach is long and sandy and has a number of shacks set up along its length.

Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,MelMul,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Horribly busy,"Horribly busy beach lined with mostly tacky tourist shacks; a cross between Benidorm and Bognor Regis.

The place is crowded and busy .The restaurants serving food and drinks increase the rates by three times.

The best part was , unlike the more popular beaches of goa , Candolim had relatively few people around. You can also pursue some water sports while at this beach. Enjoy the food at the various beach shacks ! "

Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,kev_russ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Nice beach but there is better in the South,"This is a nice beach for an introduction to Goa. Not too busy, well in October it was quiet. Stayed nearby for 2 nights before heading South & it was a nice enough beach to walk along, pet a few dogs."
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Chris D.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,"Great beach, but too many massage offers",This place was definitely a scenic view that cant be beat. We went when it was high tide so it added to less people being there. It was a fun time all around. There are plenty of shacks along the beach.The only issue is that there are a LOT of vendors and massage personnel coming by (every third person was asking if we wanted a massage).
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,KALYAN R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Business,BEST BEACH OF NORTH GOA ,"This is probably the best beach with superlative ambience and high waves. Lots of beach shacks and cafes are there. Highly recommended for sea bathing. Water sports activities are there. Public toilet facilities are very good and neat and clean. Anyone can easily spent a day very smoothly. With 35° temperature, there is no harassment of sticky weather or something like that. Lifeguard available. Views are awesome with excellent sunset. If possible, I will rate this 10. Strongly recommend. "
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Rohan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Strong and Big Waves,"I visited this beach in the morning time, 8-9:30AM alongwith my wife. The waves here at this beach were very large, strong and full of force as compared to 5-6 other beaches we visited in North Goa. The portion of the beach where the tides strike the beach is also slanting which makes a little difficult to walk over there. There are several benches on this beach starting from 100/-, and some water sports. It was a wonderful time at this beach for us, and I highly recommend this beach for visitors visiting this side of Goa. Some of pics while I was having a dip in the sea are attached."
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,John F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Lovely beach,"One of the best bits about Candolim is the beach. Very long but not too deep, shelves quites steeply into the Arabian sea so decent rollers strong enough to knock you off your feet without feeling over dangerous. Lots of shacks for cold beers etc and very popular with Indians (hardly a Brit to be seen)"
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,siddheshparab,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Better facilities, but more crowded than before","I had visited this beach 2 years back, and lot has change since then. A huge pay and park space, a very clean toilet and bathing/ changing center, an Information center, a public garden, authorized eateries and lot more. Pretty much has everything which a tourist needs. But only down side was this added facilities has attracted lot of tourist at this beach, where a few years before you saw limited guests, that too European.Also on the approach road toward the beach, you can see large number of cows digging the garbage bins for food, and also eating plastic :( It was a sad sight. I request that atleast once during your visit please feed those cows with fruits or veggies (you can see many fruit shops or eateries around),"
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Mahendra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Beautiful and clean beach,"Candolim is a very clean, beautiful and plane beach. Sun beds were very near to sea shore and lot of shacks were there and we ate crispy chicken , handi chicken in lunch at Sugar Shack which was delicious. One more special attraction is due to beautifully managed small garden is situated just outside the beach"

Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Sri Satya Sai S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,2nd best beach in North Goa,Condolim is another beautiful beach after Baga in north Goa. This is the best place for water sports as you wont find much crowd like baga or calangute here. Beach is very clean. There is good paid parking place available (Rs.20 for 2 wheeler and Rs.100 for car). There is also well maintained bath room complex (paid) available at this beach. Visitors can get snacks & small restaurants are also available nearby. Accessibility is also good with small shops on both sides of the road towards beach.

Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Ria1104,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Fully Deserted in Monsoon,"After visiting Baga and Calangute when we came to Candolim we found that this beach was completely deserted. Honestly apart from us there were two more groups and thats all. The shacks and all were closed and the place seemed isolated from the rest of the buzzing life in Goa. May be because we visited in monsoons we saw this version of this beach, however in spite of being a party animal I did not hate it....I enjoyed sitting on the sand and spending some lone-time with my partner leaving the hustle and bustle of lives behind. I am pretty sure we experienced the peaceful environment due to the monsoons...when the monsoons are over the place will definitely buzz with nightlife like the rest of Goa."
Candolim_Beach-Bardez_North,Robin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,2nd best after Baga Beach,"The cleanest and less crowded beach where you can have a beer and relax, Good Number of shacks are available offering delicious  seafood"
