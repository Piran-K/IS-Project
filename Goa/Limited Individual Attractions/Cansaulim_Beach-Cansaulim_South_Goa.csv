Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,Viraf Hansotia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Clear sands and clean vibe,"Unlike most noisy beaches, cansaulim beach ,.Mainly accessible thanks to park Hyatt is isolated, clean and compatibly safe. The presence of night duty guards with search lights made it possible for us to venture out after party at 3am. Needless to say nothing was open at that hour but it's Goa....You never know. "
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,Wendy M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful beach but perhaps not safe to swim in,The beach looks beautiful but without a life guard and a bit of rubbish around we didn't venture in.  It was a great place to walk on both in morning and evening. 
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,_lyn_hannis10,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,3 minute walk from hotel.,the beach is long and sandy. Personally I wouldn't swim in the sea as the current is strong.There are a number of beach shacks.
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,PepePitMD,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Good walking beach,Great walking beach during low tide. Safe and full of seashells. Great water temperature. Food options on the beach.
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,TullyG,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,beautiful sunset,The beach is very quiet with several shacks seek ing seafood .We visited at sunset which was spectacular.
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,WhitedogFfred,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Slight improvement to the beach,This is a wonderful long beach although the litter left does reduce the enjoyment there. While some litter is washed ashore there were also some items that should not have been there. The authorities do not deliver what they promise and a simple clear up once a day would make a huge difference to the beach. 
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,jacquelinem449,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Nice clean beach,The water was like a bathtub so warm! It looked clean but not the deep blue one so loves. The sand is very fine and a walk here is lovely 
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,mkh77,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Peaceful place to watch the sunset,"Our hotel backed out onto this beach and I went down most days to watch the sunset as it was breathtaking. The sea wasn't very calm but there were people swimming and on jet skis. The beach itself seemed endless, so it is great for a walk and it was busy but not too crammed full of people. Highly recommend to watch the sunset."
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,Tony H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016,Cycling along the beach,"I cycled along the beach to Colva to go to the dentist after a tooth that I had had root canal treatment in England a few years ago chipped while on the transfer coach. The dentist was brilliant,saw me immediately,and treated me painlessly,sorted a temporary crown. Fixed the proper crown 4 days later. Only cost ¬£100.00 got to be value for money."
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,Alok V,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Nice Beach but needs cleaning,Cansaulim is a beautiful beach with a lot of place to chill out. Only negative about this place it the plastic wrappers scattered all around. Local authorities need to take charge and clean the beach often. Even tourists should be more conscious and avoid throwing stuff.
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,Malcolm T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Long Open Beach,"Sand as far as the eye can see. Sea is not for the timid, waves are for the swimmers. If you want to be quiet and alone this beach will sort you very well. Not many facilities on the beach but informed that more will be built as the season progresses."

Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,Harpreet_Chd,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Quality Beach Time with family,"Ideally suited for the entire family to have a great time, this not so well known Beach in South Goa offers plenty of opportunity for little kids to play in the sand, run around or cycle, and play or swim in the water. Great place to be in the evenings, the setting sun, and the oncoming tides are quite photogenic.There is plenty you can do without getting bothered by touts and vendors, and the near absence of crowding. Head there in the evenings to have a swim, lie around on the sand, and sip on a chilled beer. Wonderful place to have a wonderful time"
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,Kailash Jalan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,"clean, pristine, peaceful","one of the cleanest beaches in Goa perhaps, untainted and serene... not too many shacks... not your typical beach approach roads..."
Cansaulim_Beach-Cansaulim_South,shivdev2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Best Beach of South Goa,I would say instead of visiting other beaches in Goa one must visit this one as it is one of the most clean & calm beach to enjoy the nature in true sense
