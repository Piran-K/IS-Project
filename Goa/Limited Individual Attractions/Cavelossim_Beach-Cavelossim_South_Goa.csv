They are lovely and clean very few hawkers (women selling jewellery). There is a local watersports operation where you can do paragliding and others. A great walk for miles if you choose as long as the Sun is not too high in the sky

Cavelossim_Beach-Cavelossim_South,Amit M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Clean quiet beach,"Lovely beach, very clean and comparatively less crowded by Indian standards. It is a white sand beach with nice powdery sand. The shelving is very gradual making it safe for children and families. There are water sports facilities on the beach but not many eating options. Definitely recommend"

Cavelossim_Beach-Cavelossim_South,Parwathi H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Nice Beach in South Goa,Cavelossim Beach is probably one of the best beaches in South Goa that we visited during our stay here. The beach stretches endlessly and thus is less crowded. The beach shacks here are pretty good for a seafood meal. We spent quiet a few evenings here walking and enjoying the sunset views.

Cavelossim_Beach-Cavelossim_South,niceinitalian_89,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,"Absolutely stunning, pristine environment not spoilt by tourism.","While you might think more about Palomem Beach when referring to Goa, Cavelossim is not less beautiful. Palomem is nicer in itself, but full of tourists and, consequently, full of vendors who constantly harass you. Cavelossim is a long, peaceful stretch of pristine natural beach guarded by thousands of palms, which has been perfectly preserved in spite of the high amount of tourists populating Goa. The sand is as white and tender as flour, and in case you wanna have some party, locals are just few hundred metres behind the beach. To be noted that I went there during the low season, when tourists don't flock to Goa. Still Cavelossim is much quieter than Palomem and other more renowned beaches."
