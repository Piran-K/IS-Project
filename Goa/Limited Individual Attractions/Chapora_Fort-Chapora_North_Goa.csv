Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,LoosePebbles,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,Nice one,"Fort closes at around 5.30pm , so if you intend to watch the sunset from here then make sure to reach here a bit early. Crowded on weekends. Also bear in mind to climb more than 200 steps.. Overall a good place to enjoy a peaceful eve.  "
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Mamata,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Couples,Awesome views,Charpora is a historical and naturally blessed place. Most of tourists go there just to take some great pics and cherish dil chalta hai movie memories . But the fort has lot to offer. The great views on all the sides  . You have to be patient to walk the plain yet rugged terrain of the fort ( more like a table land) . To reach the forest there is no climbing as such except few steps  .souvenir shops covers both the sides of the steps until you reach the main entrance. It is too commercialised i felt but once you enter the fort it’s only you and nature. During monsoon the beauty was exceptional. We simply loved it here. It is possible to trek down or up ( both ways ) to and fro village to fort . Many photographers and historians were spotted on the fort . It has not entry fees .  Parking charges for scooter are 20/- as on date (10.08.2022) .  Don’t be much adventurous in the fear of taking selfie’s as you might end up in a wide ts as all view points are on edge of fort without Bata cases or safety lining. Enjoy fullest your 1 -2 hrs time . Do not drink and litter on fort .
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Manish B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Excellent spot,One of the important tourist places in goa to visit and spend some time and click pictures. A recommended place to visit
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Navin B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Good Alternative to Aguoda fort,"Fort itslef nothing much to marvel about , unless one is interested in history and reads the background of the fort to understand it's significance.Bit of a dampner since they close the fort access at 5.30 pm. Real shame because the view of the beach and sea is really nice. Sunsets will be spectacular to watch. One can trek a bit outside the fort to find a good spot ( not recommended for young kids)Rest be advised of steep climb on stairs ( 500 approx) Hawkers selling there wares -  some good , some really entertaining with their one liners.All in all a good alternative to visit than the Aguda Fort. Climb the fort for the view and then spend the evening at the vagator beach."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,travellover905,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Overhyped tourist attraction.,"Just because this place has been picturized in various hindi movies, esp the famous Dil Chahta Hai... doesnt make this place a good tourist attraction. It is very hot during the day so avoid going there before 4pm when the sun starts to set. The sunset view from the top of the fort is beautiful...but the main problem is the condition in which the fort is. Being a place of historical Importance, nothing has been done to improve it. The steps that take you up to the fort are broad, but risky, unclean with stones and bricks coming out of them. both sides of the steps are encroached by the shop keepers who have covered the whole scenic view around the passage to the fort. Once you reach up the fort, fully soaked up in sweat and in thirst, you find disaapointment. the ground is full of mud and stones that becomes muddy if it rains. weeds and wild plants are growing everywhere with no sign of any cleanliness. 2/3 small vendors are there selling Dil chahta hai ice candies and cold drinks at exorbident prices. view from the top is beautiful worth a watch. when we were coming downhill, it started to rain heavily. the steps became sluggish and dangerous to walk. we stood under a shelter of a local shop who charged 100rs per person to just stand under it. how can Goa become a foreign tourist attraction with all this happening. I doubt."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Alhad,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Worth the climb - for the view,"The view of Anjuna beach from the top is superb. Shops on the climb are a bit costlier than those in Baga, Calangute - you get the same merchandise. Not much of the fort remains now but the remains are enough for a few photos. After all, this is the Dil Chahta Hai fort."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Tintu Varghese,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,Beautiful Sunset view,"Chapora fort, Vagator: This is the famous fort from Dil-Chahta Hai. To get to the top, you have to climb steps. Till you reach the top, you will be entertained by the flea markets lining the streets. The fort is in ruins. Take a trail to the left of the fort to reach where the sea meets the cliff and watch the sunset from there."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Manoj Kammath,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Family,Average,"A great place for tourism.Dil Chahta hei song / Film location,  it's famous for that too .If it was in Thailand or Malaysia , could have been in another level .Here we are bothered about putting entry tickets or car parking rates .No maintenance , Renovation , Cleanliness etc . Same thing for the beaches vegator or Anjuna beach near by .Nature given , so it's there , nothing else we have done . For a walk to hill top and scenic beauty you can go .It's crowdy and not clean and not safe in covid conditions"
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Anand1351,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Couples,Nice views and hike,A decent fort with nice views of Vagator beach and around. Lots of viewpoint although not developed and not very safe.Plenty of vendors offering water and drinks to keep you hydrated.Views are superb and there is a hike to reach at top.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Mason,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Chapora Fort,Nice place for hangout and enjoying the time with family and friends. The fort overlooks the vagator beach and Morgim Beach. Though it becomes a bit crowdy in the peak season but still you can get good spots for clicking pictures. It took me about 3 hours to fully explore the fort. But either go early morning or late in the evening to avoid heat. Parking is available.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Anvita Shukla,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Couples,Stunning sunset,"Due to the beautiful views from this fort, I keep coming back time and again on visiting Goa. Though it's now much more crowded than before, the sunset is absolutely stunning which happens around 6pm in December. Not to be missed when visiting Goa!"
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Thrupthi R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Couples,View was good !,"The view from the fort is amazing. Make sure to carry water, hat and an umberella along, if your planing to go there in the mid day one might fall sick because of the sun and heat. Better go there before 11am and after 5pm."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Deepak Naik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Couples,Visit early morning to avoid heat,"Went here at about 7.30 am, the sun already starting to get menacing. There is a short 10 min climb to the fort which could be energy sapping if gone during the day. Once on top you get a great view of the sea and the vagator beach. Also this was the place where Dil Chahta Hai was shot."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Sourav Goswami,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Couples,"View of the sea is beautiful, if you can tolerate the sun’s heat !!!","Nothing much to tell about the fort... we all have watched Dil Chahata Hain and it’s the one where the friends visited. The scenic beauty of the sea from above (the fort) is really breathtaking. Parking is ample , it takes 50 Rs for 4 wheelers. There are number of small shops, selling nimbu pani/ cold water/ cucumber etc ... you may also buy a sovereign... though it’s available throughout Goa!!!!The only disclaimer: Be ready to climb up the stairs and bear the scorching heat of the sun (May it be the winters)... It’s too much... I sweated like hell and was not at all in a mood to make poses for a photograph. It would be best, if someone visits at the day’s end.... as you can save your sweat , energy as well as have a wonderful view of the sunset... Mothing much to do here, apart from watching the sea and the beaches from above.... I felt, its a bit overhyped!!!!"
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Charnappa N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020 • Solo,Nice place,It's a good place to unwind. The lanes are narrow but they lead u to good locations. I would suggest to try the stalls around but you definitely need to know to bargain
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Basant_Maheshwari,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Good View,"Located between two beaches on either side, the view from this fort is fabulous and pleasing, The sunset is good."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Sujata D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Chapora Fort...dil chahta hai❤,"Place worth visit. You need to climb to reach at the top. The view is worth all the efforts you put to reach there. You have these small shops selling accessories, lemon juice stall etc. U can see Vagator beach from the fort...ultimate view!!"
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Manasa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Best spot to view the sunset,"One of the best spot in Goa to witness a gorgeous sunset. A decade ago, it was almost isolated with very less visitors. But now, there are steps to climb up the fort and lots of shops aligning the staircase. Chapora Fort was and is still one of the best places to visit in Goa but I am a little disappointed that tourists and the local vendors don’t respect the place enough to keep it neat and plastic free. If you want to visit this place, I would suggest you visit after 5 PM and pick a nice spot for a clear vantage point for photography as it will get crowded during the evening. P.S. Do bring your own water bottle and do not litter. There is also a paid parking space located near the fort if you wish to park your bike or car."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,The Great,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Dil,Its some how nice palce its the place where Dil chahta hai film shooted there the viewfrom there isalso nice  
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Sudeep C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Beautiful view of the Sea from the Fort,"This fort is located in Bardez. The road to reach Chapora is narrow but fairly good. You can take your cars. However, i would recommend motor bikes if you are going during peak season / weekends due to limited parking space. The ruins fort itself is large and  devoid of any large trees or structures to provide shade. From one end of the fort you can clearly see the Vagator Beach and it looks amazing with lush greenery below. "
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,ashferns23,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Good view of the sea, poorly maintained","Walked up to the top of the fort one morning and enjoyed great views of the sea and of Vagator beach. While the view is brilliant, the fort is in a real pathetic state and is not at all maintained. Just a bit of the crumbling wall is left to see."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Vipin V,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Old Fort at edge of north goa,"I traveled with family in self driven car, parking facility is available @40 rs for 3 hrs. Don't relay on google maps in goa now, roads ( NH ) are under construction and re routed, it will not help better ask for people, they are very helpful. Fort area is very sunny , don't forget sun scream/  recommend to visit during morning / evening only. "
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Akshay Sharma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,View View and View from the top,This once a fort is located near Vagator beach and is located on a hillock near the beach. Once you reach here there are splendid views towards the sea. Do not miss the photo opportunity and the sunset which is mesmerizing.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,VB_82,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Beautiful view from the fort,"A very nice fort to visit in North Goa. Parking available for nominal charges (I faintly remember it as Rs. 40). There are many stalls enroute for snack, juices and also souvenirs. Some stalls do accept PayTM/UPI. There are some stalls inside the fort as well. The fort is close to the sea and a river, so the view from the fort is superb. It could be a bit tiring as there is no shade in the fort and you are at the mercy of the sun. Initially, there are a few steps to climb as well. The maintenance of the fort is average. Nevertheless, this place is a must-visit in North Goa."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,SubhNeha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Famed fort in Goa,"Good views of the seashore line . Decently maintained. Ample parking space. Its hot up there, so carry ample water.Nothing much of the fort is left there to see except the walls."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Divya K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Beautiful sunset point ,"Visit this place to enjoy the sunset. A good ten minute hike from the parking lot , with unbeatable views of the sea and sunset. Might be challenging for senior citizens to visit, because of the hike. Nice view of the city at night "
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,jatinsingh2000,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Great View. However not being maintained,"The visit to Chapora Fort is worth it for the view which one gets of the Arabian Sea. There is decent parking facilities and a short albeit steep climb to the fort. Hawkers line this climb with water, lime soda etc. the fort itself is not being maintained very well , but for a short 1 hour or so visit you can really enjoy some breath taking views. Visit in winters and enjoy good weather."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Celia G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Good view,This short but steep walk takes you past some market stalls and into the fort. There are great views from up top and it is a free attraction. Can be quite busy. 
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,MumbaiRiders,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Chapora Fort,"After parking my bike at the parking lot at the base of the Fort it was a steep climb up a flight of  stairs to the entrance of the Fort.Beautiful view of  Goa beaches from the summit of this Fort.""CHAPORA  FORT"" in Bardez is  located at a altitude over the Chapora river.Beautiful views from all sides of this Fort .Only the ruins of the boundary fortified walls of Chapora Fort are intact while the entire plateau of the Fort that once house barracks and housing is a empty  wasteland."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,ashish_hm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Excellent views,The views are excellent and worth the steep walk to the fort.. Must visit to enjoy sunset and spend time enjoying the view of ocean from the top of the fort.

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Aniket Barve,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Nice,Best place. View of sea is nice. Near to Vagator beach. One of the most famous Shooting Point in Dil Chahta hai movie.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,shahshail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Must visit,"This is the fort where the famous ""dus saal"" wala dialogue in the movie DIL CHAHTA HAI was shot. The view from atop the fort is mesmerizing. Early mornings and evening sunsets are not to be missed. There's no entry fee. Earlier it used to be a tough climb what with the rocky path (or the lack thereof.. lol!). However, now the government has built stairs of rock, so the climb is pretty comfortable. This is a must visit place when you're in Goa."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Wiggins Philip Villa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Worth the view,"View is breathtaking of the sea .., best time to watch the sunset.  Dil Chahta hai movie been shot here . Worth the view and the climb."

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Manisha Jain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Amazing tourist attraction,"Famous tourist point in North Goa. Dil Chahta hai movie has been shot there. The view from the top is simply amazing with greenery and beach. There are multiple steps to get on the top, which are easy and comfortable to go. On your way to up, there are few eatery outlets and shopping outlets. Totally loved this place."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Aniruddha Srivastava,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,You will not miss anything great if you skip this in Goa,"Other than getting nostalgic by remembering the scene in Bollywood flick 'Dil Chahta Hai', there is nothing to offer. Just a wide view of sea and Chapora beach. Entire fort is in ruins now. You will only see scores of people trying to recreate the scene and taking endless pics. They just don't let others take their pics as there is always one more shot left. We did a mistake by visiting here during noon is not recommended as there is no shade/shelter. If one wish to visit this place then plan early morning or near sunset."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Paul Failoni,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Great View,Takes about 10 minus to walk up to the viewing point. On the way up you pass several street vendors selling ice cream/ food / drinks.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Hooray H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,An Amazing Fort,"This is a huge fort with extensive external walls, perched high on the hill & surrounded by forest.Do you think that the local government will care two hoots about this magnificent tourist attraction?At least Parrikar did something about Reis Margao Fort.Shame. They have plenty of money but just want to keep it for themselves.It overlooks the lovely W Goa Hotel.Full of snakes, no doubt.Be careful, the rocks are very slippery in this season."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,K_Shukla,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,Beautiful place,Very nice place to visit with family and friends. People having difficulty to walk or climb stairs should avoid. Can go there by car or bike. Early morning (sun rise)  or evening visit (sunset) will be best. Plan to spent 2 hours.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Garima,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Awesome,This place is hundred times better than Agoda fort. it is challenging to go up but it's totally worth it. We also crossed the walls and went down to the hill which was best experience of my life. Definitely recommend this over Anh other fort in Goa.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Karpagavalli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,One of the forts of goa,"This fort is built on a hill where river chapora drains into the Arabian sea .this is one of the most sort after tourist destination of goa.view from the place all round is so picturesque .due carry caps,umbrella, sunglasses, sunscreen,water and your camera"
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Ria1104,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Nice to Hang Out for Sometime,We went there on a rainy day and trust me rains can be brutal. This fort is in ruins.....nothing much worthy to see inside. However what attracted us was the splendid views of the sea around the fort. We wanted to spend hours sitting on the wall just enjoying the view but the rain spoiled everything for us. I remember watching the rain start at a distance in the sea and we tried to take picture but within minutes the rain caught us and we got completely drenched.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Combit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,Just adjacent to Hotel W Goa,"I made the effort to visit the fort as I was staying in W Goa which is barely 300 metres from the fort. There is nothing mentioned about the fort or its history nor is there any literature or maintenance for this fort in ruins. All that is left is the boundary wall of the fort and nothing else. Wish Goa tourism wakes up and does something for it. The view from the fort of the sea , vagator beach and Chapora beach is superb and so is the sunset view. As expected there was lot of trash like empty bottles strewn inside , with no sign of any maintenance or any garbage disposal bins."

And the fort is almost fallen but still it has lot of visitors because its bollywood shooting spot. Many movies like Dil Chahta hai were shot here. Sea looks so beautiful here. The entrance is awesome with greenery during monsoon. It is definitely the best location that you must not miss to visit.

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,20travel1972,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Fort Chapora - A fort in ruins with a amazing view from the top.,The fort is in ruins and no entry tickets required. It is a bit steep climb and some good walk from the car park. The fort has no history written anywhere and I still wonder why Goa Tourism has not done this because it is visited by almost everyone who come to the Vagator beach. Still a perfect place for Photography and beautiful view from the top looking at the sea. I would suggest not to miss it during visit to Vagator beach.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Mohan George,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Amazing view from the hill top,* The beach view is amazing from the top.* No information about the history of this fort is displayed on the premises.* No entry ticket required

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Saurabhss7,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Fort Chapora,Wonderful fort with superb sea view.

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Shefali S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Rustic and beautiful,"The 3 centuries old fort is rustic and needs attention by the archaeological department, yet the pictures just look gorgeous in that set up. Made famous by the Aamir Khan starrer - Dil Chahta Hai 😊The view of the Anjuna and Vagator beaches are gorgeous. You would go crazy clicking at sunset. Best to visit around 5.30-6.30 pm to enjoy the before n after lights 😎😍Needless to say one must wear a hat, shades, sunscreen and comfortable shoes. "
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,carol,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Chapora Fort,Lots of lovely beach but very loud bars! The fort gives good views over the ocean. Loads of good restaurants with fish etc around. Lots of English tourists who stay in this area for several weeks or months during the winter

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Ayushi Chandra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Dil Chahta Hai Fort,We visited Chapora fort as we had seen it often in DCH movie. The place is really rustic with remnants of fortifications but amazing views of the sea - probably better than those around Aguada area.A great place for picnic or chilling with friends. Dont go on a hot day - best is it to visit around evening or sunset.

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Rahoul Daswani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,BEAUTIFUL!!!!,"Chapora Fort has an incredible view and it's a place to sit and enjoy the breeze and sunset... Been here twice... The only bad thing is that tourists keep throwing garbage all over the place and that should stop. Otherwise it's worth the walk up... They've now built a walk way as well to go up, which wasn't there earlier. A lot of shops have come up as well selling food and beverages... There is a DIL CHAHTA HAI, juice guy as well over there now."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,PilotRoaR,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Once Beauty now in ruins.,"Chaopra Fort (Also promoted as Dil Chahta Hai Fort)This time it was my second trip to the fort earlier I went there in 2011. In  2011 there was no path to reach the fort....it was difficult but worthy at the time...Now fort is in shambles, lot of work going around but the charm was missing.Pro..1) Few beautiful views from the fort, nice view of Vagator, Agoda and Morjim beaches.2) Beautiful views of sunset and sunrise.Cons..1) With fort in shambles riding minimum 1/2hr to reach fort doesn't help the cause.2) Views are still great but older glory missing.3) too much tourist influx.4) Little over-hyped."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Nlay,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Fort in ruins offering breath taking views!,"Famous as the shooting spot of the famous movie ""Dil Chahta Hai"", the Chapora fort is in ruins. Earlier the access to the fort was inclined path which was slippery and is now being terraced. If you are history buff then this place might turn out to be big disappointment, but if your are a leisure traveler then you will love the views of sea from here. Chapora and Vagator beach are visible from here."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Dinesh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Nice Beach View from the Fort,The beach view from the fort is nice but there is nothing great explore the fort. Better to visit this place in the morning or evenings.

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Dee255,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Nice place for Sunset viewing ,"If you live in the Netherlands, you know that you should not take the Sun for granted ;) If you wish to give all your attention to him while he appears to sink into the sea, Chapora Fort is a good place to be. Once a fort and now just its remains, offers nice views of the sea below. Get away from the crowd, find a lonely rock and settle down with a book or some music in your ears to watch the sun go down :)"
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,ashok_shrikhande,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Chapora Fort,"Chapora fort is located northern Goa overlooking the Vagator beach and lies at a distances of about 10 kms. from Mapusa. The fort overlooks the Chapora river and hence its name. Vehicles go upto the foothills of the fort and around 500 meters steep walk. But it is worth visiting. You can have stunning view of sea as well as Vagator beach, Ozran Beach, Morjim Beach and the mouth of Chapora river."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Ajithkumar S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Awesome place to click most memorable pics,"I would rate this as one of the best places to take the most memorable pics with your friends. Many know this place as the ""Dil Chahata hai"" fort.There is a bit of trekking to get on top of the fort. You will find the localites selling glass earrings which are good to look at. DO NOT buy them, they cheat you by selling it at double/triple the original price.Take water along with you else you need to spend on the juice stall in front of the stall."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,JainManoj_1981,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Absolutely scenic spot,"Many people may have different reviews about this place . Reason- Visiting this place at diffrerent times, in different seasons, with different expectations.I recommend this place foe people who are not for party. One should visit this place early in the morning, from Sept to Mar . If you are reaching by your bike/ car ample parking is available(may be for Rs 20-100). From the parking you have to climbe to the fort with the help of newly constructed Staires which are being built for helping visitors reaching to the top wihout inconvenience.The place is good to sit silent and enjoy the nature peacefully."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,shrikanth j,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Not a must see - as claimed,"This place is famous due to the filming of a few scenes from the modern classic film Dil Chahta Hai. - due to this there are excessive crowds at times, unfortunately most of them tend to litter the place.The only saving grace of the place is the view from the top of the fort - you get one of the best views of Vagator beach & its serene waters."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,pr_ri_123,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Just a hype,"Its just a hyped place due to dil chahta hai movie. There is nothing great about it. But if the weather is great, you might enjoy a good watch with your friends/family."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,modxsounds,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Incredible view of the beach.,This old fort has energy and vibes but also an incredible view of the vagator beach. If you have plenty of time there is a road to the beach from the hill inside the forest but be sure that you have plenty of time before sunset.Also the gates close at 17.00 so it is easy to forget this by the magical view  and the result is the  gates be closed and you to search for a way out.... 😂
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Abhijit Kakati,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Abandoned fort on the hilltop with a mesmerizing sea view,The portuguese built fort is of average size located on a hilltop in chapora. To reach the fort main entrance one has to climb around 100 steps. The walls of the fort are almost broken due to lake of maintainance. Apart from the walls there are nothing inside the fort. The place is little dirty with bravarage bottles and food packet thrown here and there. The evening hours after 4pm are best to visit this place. You can have a mesmerising view of the ocean from the clif on which it is located. There is a trail at the back of the fort through which you can hike. The vegator and the chapora beach can be viewd from this place. No ticket required. One must visit this place if visiting North Goa.
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Abhishek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Great Views,"Great Views from the fort, make sure you are well hydrated and well protected as the sun gets to you. If you are driving down to the fort this is close to Westin hotel , better use GPS."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Aakash Kumbhat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Sunset point,"Another must visit place of North Goa. Skip Aguada Fort to visit here. I spent almost 2-3 hours watching its beauty. Best time to visit the place is just before Sunset because you can watch beautiful sunset from the Fort.After reaching Fort, you would not find anything like a Fort. It has only remains left of Fort. But this thing remains unnoticeable behind its beauty."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,NafeeTA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Worth the small hike up,"This is a very small fort near chapora in Vagator. To reach the top you have to trek for about 10 mins. It's a pretty small trek, or more like a climb up some stairs. But the view you get once up there is definitely worth. You get w breathtaking view of vagator beach and the sunset.  But be sure to get down just a little after sunset as it can ger dark pretty fast and there are no lights on the way down."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Monica,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Sunset and views are quite nice from here,"We went there to watch the sunset and were surprised to see a lot of young girls and boys. You have to climb a little to reach the fort and tgen hold on to a spot if you want to watch the sunset. Its nice and breezy and actually has fun vibe to it. You get the complete view of the city. Which is nice. There is not much light so I would not recommend staying there until late plus the road is quite muddy. Wear comfy shoes so its easy to walk up and climb down. There are guys seeling water, fresh juice, coconut water, maggi and other stuff. There is a cark parking too. "

Closes at 5 PM. "
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,NITISH RANJAN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Some great views ,"Need to hike a little distance, but the little effort is more than worth it. You can enjoy some great views. If you wait for the sunset, it offers a great vantage point. It is open during day only, so check your timings when you plan to visit"
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Sagar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Ruinous beauty,"This dilapidated fort offers some of the best views of the setting sun! The overflowing weeds add a rustic charm to the place. The sights and sounds of Vagator and Chapora beaches on either side break the calm without being too disturbing, and you can easily spend an hour here. Only disappointment here was the unwanted disturbance from a gang playing loud boorish music, so do watch out for that."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,deb1bedouin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,One Portuguese fort in ruins,"This fort stands nature, dirt from local travelers... however it has an wonderful view of the Vagator beach from top otherwise, it's all ruins."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Komator,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Nice fort and amazing views,"The Fort itself isn't that great. But you can walk around as much as you want. You can walk to the cliffs and enjoy the views of the Arabian Sea. And if you feel like walking more through small trails, you can do it. There's a steep access, but once you're on the top, it's all almost flat. Just remember to bring water."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,kirannaren,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Nice Fort on the Hill top facing Arabian Sea,"Nice Fort on the Hill top facing Arabian Sea , need to go by foot up hill for 10-15 mts , once you reach the top the scenes are beautiful ..A fort wall is present apart from that nothing seems to be there inside ..Good place for photography"
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Rohit M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Visit for breath taking sunset but u wud be disappointed the way fort is maintained,Cant believe but yes this is very poorly maintained .Like many travellers i wanted to check this place as DCH shooting happened here many years ago.But yes  its not a must watch but a good watch during evenings .Not recommended for olda age and very yourn kids as the track is not well maintained et all and very bumpy to reach but on top its gives a nice view of vagator beach and sunset ofcourse
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Sujai D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Chapora fort,"View of the Arabian sea from the fort top is beautiful. One can enjoy the estuary of Chapora river from the fort. Vagator beach and Morgim beach(situated opposite side of the river) is clearly visible from here. There is no other symptoms of fort except a broken wall surrounding the hill top. No rooms, not a single tree or shade make the area tough for tourists in a sunny day of November also. However, local vendors are there to supply bottled mineral warer & snacks which is a matter of great relief."

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,jaggy D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,A small Fort,"This fort is different from North Indian Forts, in terms of size and architecture. Although it has a small entrance, it is a spacious Portuguese fort with small walls (like fence). Chapora Fort also famous for ""DIl Chahta Hai"", so many people want to visit this place eagerly. Apart from this, this place has picturesque views of Morjim Beach, Vagator Beach and town. Especially the views of Morjim side, are recommended to visitors. Tourists can go to the beach side through a long trail to Small Vagator Beach and can enjoy the views of Small Vagator and Vagator."

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,BananaLu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Good view!,"We went there because of the movie Dil Chhata hai like everybody, but actually there is literally nothing in the fort area between the walls, it is like a huge empty circle. Nevertheless it is a nice walk and you can get nice viewpoints from there."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,9Tushar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Overrated place ,"Other than the view, nothing great about the place. No amenities other than a parking facility. Good for youngsters to live the dil chahta hai moments. "
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,royjay2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,Wonderful evening views from Chapora Fort,"Chapora  Fort overlooks the Chapora river and hence its name. The fort is located in Bardez, Goa and is just rising above the Chapora river. It is easily approachable from Mapusa which is located at a short distance of around 10 kms. The best time to visit Chapora Fort is in the evening because the sunset sky looks spectacular from here. Moreover when the sky paints everything around especially the Chapora River and beaches of Chapora, in its sunset colour the sight is just out of this world."

Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Aravind Mohan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Good for casual visit,"Thnx to Dil Chahtha Hai movie, this fort has found an interest among the general public. Otherwise, it's yet another Fort in ruins. This place provides an excellent view of the Arabian sea and creek nearby. Chapora Beach can be viewed from here. The climb to the fort is steep through a newly cut route in the hill. Too many hawkers from the foothills."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Elzu23,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,beautiful sunset view !!,"This is the Dil chahta hey fort !! but nothing much to see regarding the fort except the ruined walls... but the sunset view from this fort is awesome ... you can even trek to the vagator hill view & delta view points , relax there and see the sunset ... you will also get to see beautiful views of the nearby beaches from this top view point... ideal time is to visit by 5pm so that you can spend an hour see the sunset and come back."

Experiencing sunset here is what you can look for a perfect day with your close friends."
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Subhranjan89,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Awesome place ,Beautiful place. This is place is very famous for the Dil chahta hai movie. But there is a breath taking view of Arabian Sea and Vagator beach. You will get lots of inputs to take photos. 
Chapora_Fort-Chapora_North,Lovers_paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,"The ""Dil Chahta Hai"" Fort","Once neglected, the Chapora Fort got popularized by the movie Dil Chahta Hai and is now a prime attraction of Goa. It is the best place to capture perfect shots of the Vagator beach, the Morjim beach and the Arabian Sea. Chapora Fort is a great place to make your evenings memorable. A silent stroll and the picturesque sunset views are indeed very pleasing."
