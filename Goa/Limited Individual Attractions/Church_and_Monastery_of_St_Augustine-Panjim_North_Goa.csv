Church_and_Monastery_of_St_Augustine-Panjim_North,sankalansarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Solo,Hidden Gem in a Ghostly Appearance…,"The ruins of the church of St. Augustine (built 1602). Once among the grandest churches in the world, it was abandoned in 1835 due to the religious intolerance of the then Portuguese government. Legend has it that the vault of the church collapsed twice during its construction. The third time round, the architect, to show off, asked for a cannon fired at it while his child was inside. It finally fell 250 years later. Then, after another century, the façade collapsed. Today a lone bell tower stands teeth bared, accursed to its fate. Because of its ghostly appearance, the church has been used as a shooting location for the film, ‘Gumnam’.Definitely a hidden gem in Goa.PS: I am not sure what romantic angle Rohit Shetty saw in this location but he used it for the song, ‘Saathiya’ from the film ‘Singham’. In the comments below are some more pics and a link for an interesting archaeological finding in this place."

There's an interesting associated exhibition room in the museum nearby, but nothing on the site itself. It's a shame, as I would have liked some more information to stimulate the imagination. That said, this is a very interesting site that would be good for children to stretch their legs but not appropriate for those with low mobility."

Over the period of time, this team constructed three churches in the world including the Church of St. Augustine in India. In the early 19th century, the Portuguese government ordered the eviction of many religious groups and orders prevailing in Goa, as a part of its new policy including the Augustine order. Thus, the church was closed in 1938 and abandoned.According to ancient photographs, reports, and writings, the church is said to have a four-levelled structure with four towers surrounding it. After the construction, this was Goa’s largest church for a considerable number of years.The structure was built with red laterite and the height of the church was 46 m. An elaborate excavation has found that the church had four altars, a convent, and eight chapels."

Built in 1602, the process of neglect started relatively recently, mid 19th cent and early part of the 20th century. All that remains is a shell characterised by the four-storey tower that rises in stark protest on the hill. Presently a site of ongoing scientific excavation the complex lies exposed to the elements. The ASI is doing great work preserving what there is and displaying it well. They've also opened up parts of the monastery that have been excavated. Great excitement at having possibly found the elusive tomb of Queen Catherine of Georgia. History unfolding as we visited!"

Church_and_Monastery_of_St_Augustine-Panjim_North,NasehaAlok,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,Ruins which once boasted of life,"Those who are horror movie buffs (hindi) would recognise this structure from movie Gumnaam.Lot of it is collapsed, and the bell removed, still there is sense of loss and isolation that touches you.Once bursting with life, now the structure looks at sky and the visitors with stony eyes remenising about the life it once had. Not much is left to look at architecture Marvel but it is a must see place that speaks eloquently of the past.  The church was built on top of the Monte Santo (Holy Hill), between 1597 and 1602 by Augustinian friars who landed in Goa in 1587. The church was abandoned in 1835 after the Portuguese government of Goa began evicting many religious orders in Goa under its new repressive policies. The subsequent neglect caused the vault of the church to collapse in 1842. The body collapsed soon after and by 1871, the bell was moved from the tower to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church in Panjim, where it remains to date. In 1931, the facade of the church and half the tower collapsed and by 1938, most of the other parts had also collapsed. Currently only half the tower remains, and it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Goa. "
Church_and_Monastery_of_St_Augustine-Panjim_North,Madhulika L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,A stunning glimpse of a ruin,"One of the most important historic areas in Old Goa was ‘Holy Hill’, home to several churches, convents, and other places of religious significance, dating back to the early years of the Portuguese presence in Goa. Of these, one of the most interesting are the ruins of Nossa Senhora da Graca, ‘Our Lady of Grace’, better known as the St Augustine Church, since it was built by the Friars of the Augustine orders who arrived in Goa in 1587 and began building this massive church ten years later. It took five years to build, and was consecrated in 1602.The church began falling into a state of disrepair and neglect in the early 1800s. In 1824, the vaulted roof collapsed, and after that, the rest of the church followed suit. Today, the most prominent structure that still remains is the 46 mt tall bell tower, one of four towers that was part of the church. Fortunately, most tourists focus on the Basilica of Bom Jesus and Sé Cathedral, and very few come here. This is therefore a relatively uncrowded spot, and it’s worth a visit. It stretches over the top of the hill, some walls, chapels and altars still remaining, and a series of signboards—text and graphics—along the far wall explaining the history and layout of the church and its attached convent. At the beginning is a transparent panel on which an architect’s conjectured façade of the original church is drawn—in such a way that if you stand directly in front of it and look straight ahead, you’ll see the still extant tower looming beyond, right in the place on the panel where it’s drawn.We liked wandering through these ruins, admiring the beautiful tilework, the stucco remains, and the occasional carved stone that can be seen here among the structures still standing. If, even almost completely ruined now, this church is so impressive, one can only imagine how magnificent it must have been back in the 1600s.No entry fee is levied for this archaeological site."

The monastery was in inhabited and in use from the 16th to the  early 19th century, but all is left now are huge and impressive ruins that still give a good idea of how big and imposing the place must have been in its heydays.Odd and very specific rules on taking photos / filming in the area are 'clearly' explained by a number of signs around the different parts of the complex and the gardens are the perfect spot for a peaceful break from the crowds and traffic of the main tourist areas."

There's an incredible sense of space and history at the site, despite the fact that so little of it is left for one to see and experience. Climb the gentle slope up to the main site and imagine the wide stairs that once led monks up to the church's doors. Look at the faded tiles left on the still standing walls and use your imagination to fill in the blanks and imagine what it must have felt like to go to pray and reflect within the church. Take a few minutes (and more than a few photographs) of Goa's incredible greenery running amok among the broken bricks that once formed the structure of the monastery. "

It’s a very old church which was ordered to be destroyed by the then government and over the ages it has fallen down leaves the base and a corner of the structure. So once you try to paint your imagination and try to draw the volume of the “once in glory” church – I bet you will be spellbound for a second.

Church_and_Monastery_of_St_Augustine-Panjim_North,Anjali M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Majestic ruins,"The Monte Santo (Holy Hill) at Velha(Old) Goa was the site for the the monastery of the Augustinian order, attached to which was the enormous church of Nossa Senhora da Graca (Our Lady of Grace). The Tower and Church were built in 1602 by the Augustinian friars who arrived in Goa in 1587.All that remains of the Church of St. Augustine is a 46-metre high tower which was once the belfry of the structure. The church was built in the early 1600s before falling into neglect and gradually collapsing between 1842 and 1938. The church’s bell however was shifted in 1871 to the Church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception in Panjim, where it still rings.When it was completed in the 16th century, the grand Nossa Senhora da Graca Church was recognised as one of the three great Augustinian churches in the Iberian world, the other two being the Basilica of the Escorial in Spain, St. Vincente de Fora in Lisbon.The church was abandoned in 1835 due to the repressive policies of the Portuguese government, which resulted in the eviction of many religious orders from Goa. The church fell into neglect and the vault collapsed in 1842. The church's demise began with the collapse of this vault. The body of the church was soon destroyed, but the facade remained intact."

No guides or any help available around, nor any audio video guides available.

However, neglect and the passage of time have led to most of its structure having collapsed.The church is located on a small hill at a 5-10 minute walk from the Basilica of Bom Jesus. The tower of St. Augustine church, which is still standing, remains as the standout point of these ruins. Recent efforts have been made to conserve and restore the place, which have been reasonably successful. These ruins too form part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Old Goa and is a nice short detour from the more popular churches."

This must have been a maginficent church in its day. The church was constructed in 1602 by Augustinian friars and was abandoned in 1835 after a government order to close the monastery. The church fell into neglect and the vault collapsed in 1842. In 1931 the facade and half the tower fell down.
