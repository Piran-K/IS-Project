Church_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Immaculate_Conception-Panjim_North,Rahul Singh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Only a photo op landmark ,"The Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church is located in Panjim, Goa, India. The Church conducts Mass every day in English, Konkani, and Portuguese. The colonial Portuguese Baroque style church was first built in 1541 as a chapel on a hill side overlooking the city of Panjim. It was eventually replaced by a larger church in the 1600s as part of Portuguese Goa's religious expansion. This church houses the ancient bell that was removed from the Augustinian ruins of the Church of Our Lady of Grace in the once famed city of Old Goa. This bell is considered to be the second largest of its kind in Goa, surpassed only by the Golden Bell which resides in the S√© Cathedral in Old Goa.Cars can be parked nearby in market areas which charge Rs. 50 for parking. Visited in October 2022, just clicked some snaps from outside and left."

Church_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Immaculate_Conception-Panjim_North,Nina-USA,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Neglected, poorly maintained and not cleaned regularly besides rude staff.","It pains me to leave a negative review as I am a devotee of Mother Mary :( but she would NOT approve of the lack of cleanliness and maintenance of the interior or the rude staff. I had visited in May 2018 and saw cobwebs thick as ropes behind statues and frames, large Lizards zipping around, and to top off this shocking observation a really rude caretaker who knew nothing but to terrorize those who came to pray by yelling at them in a loud disturbing tone. Fast forward to November 2020, and we went to visit the church from outside (due to the COVID restrictions) standing quietly to worship near the outside staircase. A tall big man waved rudely and ‚Äúshooed‚Äù us then told us go away, you are not allowed here to go away. We did not understand what he said and then he charged up to us to literally see us leave in an aggressive posture. What is with these people??? Very unkind.Mother Mary and Jesus Christ would be most disappointed to see their devotees thrown out of the open courtyard and so rudely and unkindly. No grace here at all. Suggestion: the large aggressive man could have said, thank you for visiting, but as you know we are closed, and are not allowing anyone to stand in the courtyard. My apologies since we would love to have you here another time. Hope you have a good time in Goa.‚Äù Learn how to communicate without aggressive gestures (2020) or loud shouting tones (2018). And please clean the interior thoroughly - put some elbow grease into the job. Lost my desire to ever visit this place again with two negative experiences (very sad) and hope Mother Mary imparts the spirit of love and peace upon those that manage this beautiful place of worship."

Church_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Immaculate_Conception-Panjim_North,Oshin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Serenity,"A place of worship is not usually one that I want to review about, as it holds a greater place in the hearts of people.The reason for the review is to let people know that this is one of the oldest churches which still has mass celebrated in Portuguese. The church is a place where you get to go camera crazy with all your poses but most importantly is a place that gives clarity and calmness to the many who climb it's steps. The experience of witnessing a Portuguese mass was beautiful, not a language you come by everyday."
Church_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Immaculate_Conception-Panjim_North,FaridaAN,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,One timme visit is already more,"It looks beautiful from outside with the stairs leading to the church, but it only looks good on photos. There is a sign showing to cover up, and not to enter if you are not Catholic during the mass, not to take photos inside the church.There is nothing extraordinary in there, nothing beautiful. The cleaning lady came out and saw tourists taking photos and started shouting and screaming at people. Then she turned off the lights and started brushing the floor :) I have never seen something like this in my life, so rude and annoying. Guess she doesn't know that one needs to be quite in the church...."
