Church_of_St_Francis_of_Assissi-Old,DattaBis,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,A legend of Portuguese past of Goa,"This Church is so much talked about, we could not miss it. When we arrived at around 5 on a Sunday afternoon, we were a little disappointed with the exterior view of the main Church, a structure built with laterite blocks. But as we entered inside, it was a splendid architecture, quite well maintained and very imposing, yet inviting and bright. As the mass was going on with organ music being played, we were almost transported back in time. A wonderful experience indeed. However, we could not visit the museum, across the road, as it closes at 5 pm. Best time to visit is morning or early afternoon."

Church_of_St_Francis_of_Assissi-Old,Sangram Mohite,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,church of st Francis of Assissi & Musuem,"The Church of St. Francis of Assisi was built in 1661 by the Portuguese in the Portuguese Viceroyalty of India. The Church of St. Francis of Assisi, together with a convent, was established by eight Portuguese Franciscan friars who landed in Goa in 1517. It is situated in the main square of Old Goa.It is one of the prime tourist places to visit in Goa.

Church_of_St_Francis_of_Assissi-Old,Chinar G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,"Not tourist friendly, badly maintained","Better to avoid this old church as it is poorly managed. It is kept locked most of the time. When we asked if it will open, they said depends on the father as he usually sleeps and has the keys with him during the day. Surroundings badly maintained with weeds, full of wild growth. Very disappointed that a religious place of such historic importance is being managed poorly and don't welcome people. It's not right to turn people away from a church, especially by the father himself."

Church_of_St_Francis_of_Assissi-Old,Madhulika L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,"The heritage of Goa, Portuguese and earlier","Although another St Francis—St Francis Xavier, the patron saint of Goa, and with his remains at the Basilica of Bom Jesus, next door—is probably better known to locals, the famous St Francis of Assisi is almost certainly more widely known, especially outside India. In Goa, a church and convent dedicated to St Francis of Assisi was built in 1661. The church is still basically a church; the convent now houses an archaeological museum. We bought our entry tickets (Rs 10 per person; children below 15 enter free of charge) and first went in to have a look at the church (though you can see this without having to buy a ticket). It’s a beautiful church, with some fine old paintings, and some statues of various saints, including (naturally) St Francis himself. Photographs are allowed in the church, but not in the museum itself. The museum is not a huge one, but it’s a good collection of artefacts from across eras of Goan history. It starts with various Hindu sculptures, such as hero stones, depictions of deities (some beautifully carved stone statues here), and so on. Following this are artefacts from the era of Portuguese rule in Goa: coats of arms, Catholic sacramental emblems, figurines of Jesus, Mary and the saints, and—most arresting—larger-than-life bronze statues of two famous people: the Portuguese poet Luiz Vaz de Camoes (who wrote in praise of Goa) and the first Viceroy of Goa, Afonso de Albuquerque. On the first floor is a portrait gallery, lined with rather uninspiring portraits of the governors and viceroys of Goa. There are also some currency notes from Portuguese India, as well as information about (and highly enlarged copies of) postage stamps from the same period. On the ground floor, besides a statue of St Catherine (which stands in a covered pavilion in the middle of a grassy yard) are two galleries. The Children’s Activity Centre is one of these galleries, though it has little that’s child-friendly here, just a few adult-size chairs and a large table. But it does have some interesting aerial views of Goan monuments, including a stunning pre-Portuguese Mahadeva Temple. Also on the ground floor is a small but interesting Maritime Gallery, which has loads of information on all things maritime: the maritime traditions and routes of everyone from the Arabs to the Chinese to (of course) the Portuguese; what they traded in, what trade routes they followed, what nautical instruments they used, and so on. There are old anchors on display, and, in the centre of the room, a small-scale model of a medieval sailing vessel, masts and sails and cross-section of decks and all. An interesting museum, and since it’s small, easily managed in less than an hour."

Felt as if I was blessed walking in and could feel the great energy of so many saintly souls who might have graced this place. I am not a christian, but more of an universal-hindu, so this is a feeling I normally get when entering some of the greatest Hindu temples of south India. An amazing spiritual experience worth your time."
Church_of_St_Francis_of_Assissi-Old,Uthradi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Beautiful and serene,"The church is located within the ASI administered Museum of Goa.They're tried to build it in the style of St. Peter's Basilica. We have been to Rome and i  can say sincerely that they've succeeded ! The two long corridors leading up to the altar, the central arched nave where the black and gold structure stands in St. Peter's is faithfully reproduced.  The various arched doorways etched in marble with different saints' stories and figurines are also reproduced to a certain extent.  Only the large concrete dome in the center is missing,  due to lack of space, i think...Also some tapestries adorn the walls like in the Sistine Chapel. Don't miss it if you have the time !"

Church_of_St_Francis_of_Assissi-Old,Manish K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Good place to visit,"The Church of St. Francis of Assissi in Old Goa is right next to the more famous Se Cathedral. The convent, that was attached to this church, now houses the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) museum.This church holds plenty of nice paintings depicting scenes from the Bible. The altar is nice to look at. However, as compared to other churches in the vicinity such as the Se Cathedral, Church of St. Cajetan and Basilica of Bom Jesus, this church may look somewhat less impressive.This church is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Old Goa and along with the museum, is worth a short visit."
Church_of_St_Francis_of_Assissi-Old,JerryG6570,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,A church to reflect upon,The courtyard is massive and well maintained which surrounds the church.We hired a guide to throw in a bit more information about this churchThe church is frequented by a lot of tourist from all parts of the world and obviously more Indians from various faiths. This church is located 10km east of Panaji. This church was established by the Franciscan friars of Portuguese origin during 1517AD.  The current structure of the church what we see today was completed in 1661AD. The interiors of this church is mainly of Baroque with Corinthian décor. The ceilings are very high and there is a lot of woodworks plus very intricate floral frescos inlaid. There is a cross of miracles in this church with a lot of legendary stories about it.One can also see steps leading to vaults where bodies of friars were kept. Of course it is closed now with a glass casing.It is worth to see the grandeur of its internal and external construction as well as the historical events that encompassed it.

But anyway, he told the story of St. Francis in detail. The body does not have one hand, one portion of the hand is in ROME and another portion, which is the palm is in Portugal I think.

Church_of_St_Francis_of_Assissi-Old,UMPath,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Stunning interior,The final sight of a group of 3 churches in a massive park with no pushy sales people. This really highlights the difference between the dead hand of Christianity with the more involved Hindu temples. This is a big church with impressive Frescos inside plus lots of paintings  on the walls. As the 3rd of the churches you see on one site it tends to be less important because when you’ve seen one church you’ve seen them all but internally it had the best decoration.

What was most fascinating was the portrait gallery of the Portuguese Viceroys ! History lovers must not miss the place.
