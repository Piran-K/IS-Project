Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,BJtravellernature,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great place,"Simply wow... An awesome place to visit. Calm, greenery. It is around 16 km from palolem beach South goa. When you reach a parking with a shop it is better to walk 2 km or take help of local jeep drivers there to get you down. It is little tricky to ride down. But of course you can drive till the down parking if you are an expert driver and has good vehicle with pick up no issues. We drive half way and parked in a small place and walked a kilometre to reach cola beach. Little difficult for elderly people. But the place is worth a visit. I can see a lot of people staying there there is a beach resort. I don't prefer as it is little interior. But one day trip is definitely worth it."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Yifat C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Beautiful isolated beach,"Nice beach, beautiful view. The drive from Panem was far- including 2 more beaches sightseeing on the way. No need to stat there for more than a night since it is very isolated."

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Harshith358,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Must visit beach in South Goa,One of the best beaches to visit in South Goa. Enjoyed Kayaking a lot. There is a small river which is ending at the beach and the water level is very safe for Kayaking in that river
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Ariana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,This place is so beautiful!,Me and my boyfriend loved this beach- so pretty and unspoiled and really clean as well. I would suggest going in the off season 
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Aakanksha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A must visit!,Awesome place for good food. Silent beach and peaceful backwaters. Loved the kayaking experience. Did it for the first time.Beautiful picturesque place!
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,heena s,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Its very adventurous and uneasy drive,"There are two important things you need to know before you plan this beach.its very secluded and in far jungle area,so its important that you plan early and leave by 6 latest.secondly the last 1 km road to the beach is very dangerous as its steep and unbuilt road,only trained drivers can make it."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Jesse M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Avoid Kayak scam,"The beach is really beautiful. The road to it was fun as I love really bumpy offroad driving and I have a high wheelbase 4x4 but otherwise under no circumstance should you attempt it in a normal car. We went for kayaking in the Lagoon which is one of the biggest scams, they charged us 100 rupees per person for every 30 mins which is fine until you Paddle around the corner and realise they've lowered the water level so much that there is only about  500 meters of water (maybe less actually) so it's effectively a shallow pond that you could wade end to end  (in the water) the whole 'pond' in about 7 mins. So about 2 mins of paddling each way. It will be nice for someone to take an instagram picture to pretend they went kayaking but that's the extent of it.  One comment was that its great for kids that can't swim because it'd be impossible to drown as its only 2 feet deep. I'd suggest negotiating a 20 rupee fee to take a photo if your so inclined. üòâ It's something to do if your bored for 10 mins I suppose."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,PradneshParle,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Outstanding beach! Sunsets are beautiful here üôÇ,"View : The views here are breathtaking during the evening. Access : If you are not staying at cola - you can come either by vehicle or boat ! But if you come by boat let the boatman know accordingly, there‚Äôs a kakolem beach next to cola which also very beautiful. Boat- 2500-3000 dolphins + kakolem + cola and back ~ 3hrs total.If you are coming by 2 wheeler you can go downhill upto 500 meters near beach, but the road is very bad last 2 kms.If coming by 4 wheeler, you‚Äôll have to park up and hire a jeep for going down. Charge is 100 one way per person. If you have big suv 4*4 you can go down if confident in driving!Activity : there‚Äôs kayaking in the lagoon next to sea, 100 per person for 30 mins, but if you have done before and not afraid of sea- do kayaking in sea at agonda, patnem etc. Totally worth it!Stay: Dwarka and Blue lagoon both have nicely located rooms, bang opposite the sea."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Vishal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Picturesque, Beautiful, Clean and Less crowded Beach",Beautiful and picturesque beach. Just 1 shack on the beach. Another one is a private one only for the guests of the respective resort. There‚Äôs a fresh water Lagoon just next to the sea. Water flows from the Lagoon to the Sea through a narrow stream. You can do Kayaking in the Lagoon or you can walk/swim in the lagoon that is only waist deep.1 Km off road from the main road. Then another 2 Kms dirt road to the beach parking. And then a few stairs to the beach area. A Car with good ground clearance is recommended for the last 2km stretch. Some people took their Hatchbacks as well. Not much of a problem if you are a skilled driver or don‚Äôt mind your car bottom touching the ground once or twice.Inaccessibility of the beach makes it exotic and slightly less crowded and clean.No phone signal or internet connectivity. Rely on Resort‚Äôs or Shack‚Äôs wifi.
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Richa Goswami,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,One of the best beaches,"Cola is undoubtedly one of the cleanest and best beach in Goa. Silent and away from the crowd, perfect for relaxing with a great view"
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Amod R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Small , very nice beach",Visited cola in the month of Nov19. Cola beach is small n very clean beach . There's only one beach shack available. There is khol rever get merged in sea on beach . It's a excellent beach to spend your quality time with friends and family. Only problem is beach is 4 km far from village .road to beach is very difficult to drive. Local cab charge Rs.500 to 800 to drop to beach. Shack is very moderately price with good food quality. Service is slow.In all must visit place if u like seclude beach .  
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,pankaj verma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2021 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Best beach of south goa,"This beach is comes one of the best beach in south goa‚Ä¶.the honeymoon cottage very front of beach is wonderful view from the room‚Ä¶.Only one shack is available in the beach but that is good and food was really tasty, prices are quite high but there is no other choice‚Ä¶.If you come with the four wheeler so please keep in mind the low hight sedans are not access-able please don‚Äôt try to enter after fencing point otherwise you will stuck in between and there is only one way for incoming and outgoing which is very undulated and risky.So park your vehicle around 800m away from beach near fence area and you can easily track the beach.If you are going with the bikes then you can reach out till near the beach.You can enjoy here with freshly coconut water with your fav drinks üòä.This place is very peaceful and silent place you will enjoy only the sea waves sounds‚Ä¶There is a small lake where you and your kids can swim coz the sea waves are too high and here."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Surbhi C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Over hyped,"The beach is nice & clean and the unique thing about it is the sweet water lagoon. However, the path to reach the beach is dangerous. Right off the main road, you see the first parking spot. It's a 1.5-2 km jungle trek from there. The road is in extremely bad condition (actually there is no road). You can take your car/scooty/bike further down right before the descending stairs start but at your own risk coz the the path is terrible. Once you reach the beach, there is just one shack/restaurant. You cannot swim in the sea here but can swim in the lagoon or do kayaking in the lagoon. So, overall, we felt it was a bit overhyped based on all the rave reviews we had read about it. "
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,KVSN,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Honestly, not worth the effort!","This place was a let down!The parking that you see first, from there to the actual beach is about 2 kms. The road is bad, very bad and if you have a car which does off roading or no care for it, go on with the car. If you are taking your scooty, drive with utmost care.There is a tiny stall and a restaurant midway, decent. Once you reach the beach, the main attraction is the backwater, the lagoon. We went in February, and we found it moderately crowded, the water had algea in it and honestly, not worth the effort. There is one huge beach restaurant catering to all and some lifeguards. Thats all we could see, we were disappointed. "
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Sachin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,The best beach in Goa!,"The place has a super clean lagoon and a great beach. A bit hard to reach on scooter, but worth it. A real offbeat place that beats everything i have seen in goa"
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Venkata R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Wow,"Hidden gem in South Goa. Its little difficult to get there, but once you are there the beauty will help you in getting rid of all the tiredness. The lagoon type setting is mesmerising. This place is different from all the other beaches in Goa."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Mihir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Truly Secret Beach..Blissful,"Well this small stretch of the Cola beach is called Secret beach coz of two main reasons. It stretches across just about 300 mtrs between two small hills attached with a small beautiful natural lagoon and just 2 small boutique hotels.While it's accessible but the last 1km stretch is  bad road or hardly a road. If u have a bike then u might find it a bit challenging it may have to walk a bit to avoid damage. If u can, get a Mahindra Thar 4X4 .it helps. But not absolutely necessary. Even a regular car can make thru.The beach has just 2 small hotels withind blowing views of the lagoon and the sea of course. Gets booked very fast and I guess it's mostly open just from Oct to may as rains are quite heavy there..The restaurant there is good and serves very nice food. The lagoon is so pretty and beautiful u can consider it a swimming pool of about 3-4 mtrs depth and as long as 800 mtrs or more.TIP: if you wanna visit here , suggest u rather book one of the huts here in either of the hotels..it's expensive maybe INR  10-12K per night but I assure you it's worth every penny, that is, if you get a booking :-)"
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Sarahfairy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A day in paradise ,We booked a boat trip from Agonda Beach with Lord Ganesha Boat and captain SandyHe dropped us at Cola.. It was a spectacular tripThe beach is backed by a freshwater lagoon and feels like a desert islandIt's totally picturesqueThere are around 3 restaurants here and we chose the one you have to wade across the lagoon to get to.. That was a firstA simple menu but a beautiful settingA day a Cola is a mustWe got picked up by Sandy bang on time who then sailed us down the coast where we saw monkeys on the cliffA truly memorable day 
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,LucyHope,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Jungle trek to Cola Beach,"Me and my husband walked to Cola Beach from Agonda where we were staying - it was our wedding anniversary so wanted to venture out and explore. The trip took us best part of an hour due to the heat and some rough terrain but worth the trek for the stunning beach and lagoon. It felt quite busy, more so than I was expecting as it‚Äôs quite remote, but it‚Äôs not a huge beach so could probably feel full quite quickly. Our journey began at beach road at Agonda, then over the bridge and uphill, lastly making a left through scrubland before finally climbing down to the beach past the Dwarka hotel at Cola.  We got a bit lost in the undergrowth but found our way in the end!  Lots of nature along the way including a huge tree full of bats, a wild boar and yet more dogs and cows.  The first view of the beach from the top of the hill was beautiful, it felt like we‚Äôd stumbled on a secret location.  Sweet relief to have made it.  All that was missing was a cocktail in hand.  Frustratingly we couldn‚Äôt buy a drink at the hotel bar/restaurant seeing as we weren‚Äôt guests.  We had a bottle of water with us for the walk but we were craving something icy cold!  We didn‚Äôt stay at Cola long, aside from feeling a little dehydrated the sea was quite choppy with big waves breaking close to the beach, so we had a dip in the lagoon instead.  Lovely to relax for an hour or so before making tracks again."

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Mike P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Perfection,A true hidden gem and an untouched perfect strip of beach. What a lovely 1 night stay we had here. I would recommending staying for either 2 or 3 nights. A perfect getaway from the crazy world. Warning: There is no phone reception here and no Wi-Fi so please make sure you have contact arrangements in the event of an emergency.
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Alexandra G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Beautiful beach,"We arrived by boat from Agonda which was an easy journey. The beach is unspoilt and very clean. There seemed to be 3 restaurants surrounding the beach, elevated on the rocks. We ate at a small one on the left side of the beach and it was very good and inexpensive with very nice smiling staff. Thefresh water laoon is a delight to swim in and very safe for young and old alike. "
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Skinnyrib30,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Cola Beach.. Wasn't all it was hyped up to be!,"We had a recommendation from people we met in Patnem that Cola Beach was a must go place to go for sunset and food.We jumped on the Royal Enfield and headed over late afternoon.Whether it was high expectations from what we had been told we are not sure but there were a few things they omitted to point out to us.Firstly Cola Beach Road on Google maps looks like a circular road. When we got onto it one part of the road didn't exist. To use to the term road is a bit of poetic licence as its not only a sandy dirty track, but it's so bumpy with step hills that the motorbike struggled with people. I wouldn't have wanted to do it on a scooter with smaller wheels although others did. Cars were also trying to get to the car park above the beach blocking up the track.When we finally arrived, covered in red dust from the track we walked down onto the beach to enjoy a swim before sunset. The beach is really small with lots of rocks above and below the water and with rough waves we decided not to go in. Our looked like one of the two restaurants was preparing for a wedding so in the end we decided to give up and head to Agonda for sunset and food.It is a beautiful small secluded beach but its really hard work getting there (no Rickshaws would go on the track) if you don't have a bike.And for safety I would swim bin the lagoon behind the beach as the rocks would make it quite dangerous for swimming in the sea."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Biju Nilgiris,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Good beach.. Less Crowded,Another spectacular beach in Goa. Neatly maintained and good to visit. Crowd is less while compare to other beaches.
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,S Sadhukhan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Best beach among all beaches in Goa,A little beach apart from urban humdrum.

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Avital T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Really beautiful and unique beach,"Really beautiful and unique beach for a day trip or remote peaceful stay. The beach is situated between to hills, with resort and restaurant on each of them, separated by a river where you can bath. So, you have a stripe of sandy beach with river on the one side and the ocean on the other. The restaurants are peaceful and has great view."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Ashish M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Welcome to Goan Paradise,One of the most beautiful beaches that I have seen. It has an amazing fresh water stream leading into the sea. The fresh water stream is only waist deep in the beginning then it gradually becomes ankle deep wading water. The water is Crystal clear with small fish swimming in it. The beach is albeit a bit Rocky. There are couple of lovely beach restaurants where it's priced just like any other beach shacks in Goa. U can spend a whole day here if u wish to and u won't be bored. The approach to the beach is a dirt track which has many ups and downs which can be a bit tricky to navigate on a scooter or bike .. but it's all worth the efforts. Highly recommend.
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,KALYAN R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Business,DEPENDS ON TIDE TO ENJOY,"Cola beach is a lagoon beach with sweet and salt water mix but a lovely one in South Goa,  The 1.5 km dirty track to get here forced people to avoid this beach, but it‚Äôs  a lovely beach and we had a booking at Dwarka Eco Beach resort for 1 night. We don't have any other option as the condition was well informed in advance by our hotel during booking and we trekked for 1.5 km to reach there. It was a mesmerizing experience and we had enjoyed a lot. Strongly recommend but not for older generations or who are physically unfit. We were lucky enough with low tide to view the beach and it's beauty, during high tide beach being sub merged. "
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Samar J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Heartbreaking,"I don't know what happened but the sweet water lake is gone now,the sand of the beach which acted as a barrier between the sea and the lake is gone now, so the water in the lake which use to be arround man height is now getting only upto the ankles. And also when i visited last time in 2015, it was much less crowded. But still it's still beautiful, i just loved cola beach every time i visited that little paradise, i was simply heartbroken this time"
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Chris H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"It‚Äôs a beach, lovely but covered in sea at high tide.","Cola beach is lovely,  the 1-2km dirt track to get here reduces the number of visitors, but it‚Äôs  a lovely beach, warm sea and a Cool fresh water lagoon.  Yes another reviewer arrived at high tide, and at this time there is no beach. But the other time it‚Äôs beautiful.  If you are coming. Head for the Blue Lagoon bar as the other side is harder access due to the private hotel Dwarka.   Prices are good at Blue Lagoon with Budweiser for 90 rupees.   Best time is low tide in the afternoon "
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,A. Pradhan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Best Beach ever seen,"This is one the best beach of Goa. It's a lagoon beach where sweet and salt water mix.

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Falguni Roy Choudhury,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Gem of a beach,I was inspired to go this beach based on reviews and feedback other bloggers.As expected the beach was very nice and so was the resort. The beach is a bit different from other Goa beaches because it as a bit steep gradient into the sea and waves are strong. Water and the each is very clear.The lagoon though has shrinked and not much of a depth in water to swim. Biut its clean and nice for kids.We stayed in Blue lagoon Cola beach resort and stayed on the lagoon side. There is no internet or TV in the room if want to stay connected. Food was good.Overall it was very unique experience and you cannot forget this place.

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Claire B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worth the long walk,"We had hired a car to get to Cola Beach from Majorda and, as many reviews here state, the road to the beach isn't drivable (we were warned so knew what to expect). We left the car at the top of the hill and walked about 1 1/2 km on the dusty dirt track to get to the beach. It was worth the walk, the resort is a sanctuary. A lovely quiet beach, no phone signal (a genuine blessing), and a pretty, shady, fish-filled, lagoon which was really nice to swim in.We ate lunch at one of the shacks and the food was fine, although we did encounter the only grumpy staff of anywhere we visited in Goa! I really wish I had known about Cola beach before arriving as we would have booked to stay here for a couple of days and will certainly do so on our next trip to Goa."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Mithun G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Small strip of beach tucked away in south Goa,"This beach is tucked away in south goa and comes after Agonda when you are driving north from Canacona town. WARNING: it is not an easy place to get it and the drive up to the cliff is not for the faint hearted. Do not attempt this in a hatch back low clearance vehicle as you will most likely be stranded in the middle of no where.. if you have a 4X4 then do give it a shot. Additional heads up.. there are only 3 shacks in this beach. 2 of the 3 have beach hut accommodations and these 2 serve food and drinks to only their guests. You are left with only one shack where you can get something to eat or drink and that place is always over crowded resulting in warm beers and late food outflow. Really cannot blame them because the only route to this place is via the drive to the cliff and they have limited staff and limited raw materials.. These shacks close off for the off season as early as 2nd week of April (As confirmed by Shack owner), so time your trip here accordingly Cheers and have fun.. P.S : once you drive through the life threatening roads and reach the cliff, you will have to walk down about 4 flights of stairs to reach sea level.. and yes you have to climb those 4 flights of stairs to get back to your car. So don‚Äôt forget anything in your car when you plan to go down to the beach :)"

There's plenty of space for everyone though and it was still quiet.  There are also a couple of shacks but very few sun loungers.The sea is rough and quite rocky but there is the fantastic lagoon, which was brilliant to swim in and so warm!!We really enjoyed our day there; it was a little piece of paradise!"

The palm trees surround the lagoon, and it is absolutely beautiful!"
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Kristina K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful but not very accessible.,The beach is amazingly beautiful!! But the government needs to make it a little bit more accessible - the road leading to the beach (1.5km) is a hell for car/moto drivers.

Its a cliff. You need to walk down a 20-30 steps to reach the beach.Beauty of this place is that beautiful sea and exactly opposite to beach there is a lagoon.

Which is saying a lot, because we found that we liked a LOT of the beaches in Goa. So what made this one so special?Cola beach is a bit of a trek by foot (which is how we travelled, 30-45 mins from Agonda)  but it can be reached by scooter/taxi also. The fact that it is slightly off the beaten track means that not many people are there at once, so not only is it fabulously picturesque it is spacious and uncrowded. Not that we found Goan beaches crowded generally but this one just felt extra peaceful.There is only one hotel/bar there, and the rest of the beach is untouched. The surrounding scenery is beautiful, and not only is there a gorgeous beach there is a cooler fresh water lagoon also. You can swim in this, washing all the salty sea water of you, rent kayaks and go kayaking or just take some amazing photos.We loved it. If you're nearby, you'll want to make the time and effort to visit."

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Eber Shibin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Undisputedly, the best in South Goa. ","Cola beach is less visited purely because of the rough terrain you have to drive through and people give up so easily and have no idea what they are missing. I went there by two wheeler, a Honda Aviator and the last 7 km took me a half hr and in the parking lot all I saw was tourist cars and rental bikes. My rear end took a pounding riding through the loose mud and rocky terrain, but it was all worth the pain when I got there. Cola beach has that raw natural beauty that very few beaches can match it and the limited accessibility keeps most of the tourists away. You can't help yourself but talk a walk along the entire coastline lined by brown rocks and coconut plantations. They have fancy wooden cottages on the small hills lining the beach as well. Cola beach is the ultimate bliss finder. Will leave the rest of the explanation to my photos."

The beach takes some finding as the road leading to this is quite rocky and off the beaten track. Once you reach the top steps to begin your descend into paradise you can only describe the view as picturesque. This beach is untouched, totally relaxing and absolutely stunning. There is a blue lagoon with a restaurant and bar above which you can access through the lagoon. We did not dine here as it was a private establishment for their guests. There is another eatery which we had breakfast and took in the beautiful surroundings. The food was enjoyable, the staff where very friendly and there are sun-loungers available to use. We spent a couple of hours here to relax. "

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,Sadaf Chowdhary,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Cola Beach - Hidden Paradise,"This untouched beach with a lagoon flowing inwards into the mainland was a priceless find. Drive from Agonda Beach to this location takes around 25mins on a two wheeler (which is the common mode of travel in south Goa). The last stretch of about 1.5 kms is a narrow, rocky, uncobbled road with treacherous curves and bends (sure to test your driving skills, giving you feels of dirt biking) but the view you are welcomed to after this bumpy ride is worth every effort.The area has a few shacks which serve food and drinks (alcoholic as well as non-alcoholic) - most of them have wi-fi connections and are happy to share the password with their customers - Phone networks are otherwise intermittent. A calm, relaxing day should be enjoyed at this location. A rare phenomenon I experienced here is the distinct dual shade of sand at this beach - black and golden. Also, a walk by the lagoon is recommended - most of it has been acquired by a private property around it, so you may be allowed to loiter around only with permission."

Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,T and M bloggers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Enjoy the tranquility of this place,"Cola beach is a remote beach present in cancona village of Goa which gives you a treat to your eyes that is beyond words. This place not only exhibit a Aqua Blue serene beach with coconut tress on its coast but also a green lagoon where you can enjoy swimming!!Cola beach is not a easy place to reach and so has preserved its natural beauty in these many years. You need to trek about 4km to reach this beauty. And if have good driving skills, you can even drive a scooter to this place. It is steep descend with no paved path full of mud. We visited this place during raining season and found quite risky to drive then. The path  was little slippery, and so we decided to trek half way to beach.If you happen to trek to the beach, you will witness few hidden gems on the way which is usually missed when on bike . On the way to the beach we encountered a small part of lagoon some one km just before it meets  the ocean. The place is scheduled with no tourist or locals near it. You can hear the flow of water and rustling of leaves very clearly here I Weescended near the shallow water body and enjoyed there for almost an hour in the fresh clean water. There was one beach hut on the opposite end of the lagoon where we saw a foreigner meditating with OM mantra in background.About 20 min walk from this place we reached cola beach which withholds one of the most beautiful beach South Goa has to offer you. One end of this beach offers you a endless view of the sea blue coast with no sign of human intervention in between and the other end gives you a glimpse of lagoon made of green water. This perfect blend of salt and sweet water is a perfect dream destination you could ever image. The lagoon of green water is encircled with lush green palm trees behind it which darkens with the depth of jungle.Where to stay :1) Blue lagoon Resort is one of the best budget options to stay here. They have both beach facing cottages and lagoon facing huts and I can't score anyone of them with more points. Both of them have their own beauty.Estimated cost : Rs 1500-30002) Other option is to stay in Dwarka Eco Beach Resort which has equally good and sea view cottages.Estimated cost : Rs 7000-10000The restaurant on the beach is also owned by Blue Lagoon Resort where you can try some sea food and drinks ."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,pritesh tailor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Hidden Gem of Goa.,Cola beach is one of the very rarely heard and seen by most of the tourists visiting Goa. It's really a hidden gem of Goa located at South Goa. The only disappointing point is the road to reach at Beach is not in a good shape. If you have 4*4 vehicle or a car with high ground clearance you can reach there. Because the way to beach from main road is off road and hilly road. But when you reach at the beach you will definitely feel that it worth visiting there. I had a very adventurous trip of cola beach. 
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,The Floating Pebbles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Marvellous!,"This is one of the hidden beaches of Goa. The road leading to this beach is hilly and in extremely bad shape. In a word, the road is dangerous. However, the rough ride is worthwhile once you reach your destination and set your eyes on the beach. The beach is hidden and surrounded by coconut groves. A pristine beach, it has white sand and sky blue water. The beach is almost deserted. The lagoon water is near the beach. The glassy water of the lagoon is perfect for a refreshing bath. The lagoon is the additional charm of this place. There are only three resorts and shacks. Also, you will get no network on your cellphones. Therefore, this is a perfect place for honeymoon and also for people looking for an escape from everyday world. Of all the beaches that we visited in Goa, this blew our mind most. Must visit if anyone is travelling to southern Goa."
Cola_Beach-Canacona_South,kiranvenkatece,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Disappointed !,"I had earlier been to cola beach when the lagoon water was more. Earlier, the lagoon water was spread across the beach landscape which gave an awesome view/experience. But, when we visited this time, the lagoon water was very shallow and was present only at a small corner of the beach. Heard that sand was filled at some places in the shore where lagoon was already present. Hence we were disappointed.This is a good place if you love silent beach to relax! Food in the shack present at the beach is average."

I was aiming for the market as I needed some lighter clothing and I'd read the market had everything I wanted. The sand along this stretch of the coast is pale gold and the sea is calm and empty, hardly anyone swimming so it is nice and relaxing place to just lie down and sunbathe then dip in and out of the sea which I did before and after the market as it was so hot! Colva is a working town with a bus station and lots of shops and locals living there. There are nice little sea front restaurants and bars and the market is fantastic."
