Colva_Beach-Colva_South,Ajanta S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,"Foul smell, over crowded","At this moment, Colva lost its charm. There’s fishing and drying of those fishes happening just near the beach, hence not for tourists. Benaulim which is just 2 kms away is better than this one. Colva is the one, you can skip while in south Goa."

Colva_Beach-Colva_South,Ravikumar T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Crowded but nice... watch out for stray dogs !!,"Hello to all readers and to all staff @ Trip.I was here during 1st week July 2022. I was stationed at Hotel Sea Coin. A budget hotel next to the beach. I chose to stay here so that I can walk onto the beach when ever I wished. It was only 5 mins away. The beach was good and clean. Plenty of stray dogs , so need to careful. The beach is quite windy and it rained almost every day, I was there. Loads of options for eating and bars outside the beach. Tsk tuts and taxis available most of the time. Public transport ( buses) are scarce. I did see a lot of people on rented two wheelers roaming around. Lots of provision stores and one ATM wishing walking distance. I didi not see a pharmacy though. The beach was crowded at peak times. Maybe next time , I will try to go more south to visit Goa's beaches. North for partying. South for peace and quiet. Pics attached."
Colva_Beach-Colva_South,Manish B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Good Beach,Goa is a land of amazing beaches and this place is worth visiting. Neat and clean beach with lots of activities to do. Even you can spend some time eating the delicious sea food here. A must visit place in Goa.
Colva_Beach-Colva_South,Ria1104,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Worst Experience in Goa,"We went to explore the beach for a day during our stay in the nearby Benaulim Beach. It had a proper watersports section but prices were too high compared to North Goa. I would strongly advise to try watersports in North Goa and not Colva as the prices are almost double in Colva.Being unaware of the price difference we tried out parasailing here and enjoyed it no doubt. It looked quite scary from outside but while doing it was super fun. With three dips it costed us around Rs 2000 per person (later in Calangute we found out that this could be done in and around Rs 1200 to Rs 1500 there). Also we decided to order from a shack and relax for a while in their sunbeds. This is where things got really bad.Firstly the attendant asked us how much drinks and food we are going to order. If it was above a certain amount only then he agreed to allow us to use the sunbeds. We ordered 2 feni and a crab dish, left our luggage at the sunbeds and went for a swim. After a few minutes the attendant literally went to the sea and called us out as he claimed that the food was getting cold. In all other beaches we had visited in Goa in that week, never were we called back from sea for any stupid reason. Usually the policy is once you order some item you can use the sunbed and enjoy in the waters as long as you want. I think our attendant basically wanted us to have our drinks and food and either leave or order more. He was not OK with us occupying the sunbeds for that long with our existing order. We were already irritated at this and decided to finish our food, clear the bill and go. During the bill clearing also there was another issue. The attendant had verbally told feni prices to be Rs 80 per peg earlier and in the bill he mentioned Rs 180 for 60ml of coconut feni. Now we were in Goa for almost a week and were fairly acquainted with the liquor prices there. Feni prices were never this high anywhere....even in fancy restaurants and this was just a shabby shack. When we pointed out this and reminded him of the price he mentioned before.....he got furious and denied his earlier statement. He even got into an argument with my boyfriend and attempted to punch him but was stopped by his colleagues. At this I was super annoyed paid the overcharged amount and took my partner out of the place.In most parts of Goa  guests were treated with utmost respect but not in the shacks of Colva. Not only with us, I even saw another group of bachelors getting unnecessarily harassed by another shack attendant. So if you are a tourist I would advise you to stay as far as Colva shacks as possible. Also the beach here was the most crowded in South Goa. I did not feel safe swimming in my one piece swimming costume over here due to the constant irritating glances from a group of guys even though I was with my partner. Better to try out the Benaulim Beach instead of Colva Beach for a relaxing and far more peaceful experience both in terms of a swim or the shacks. This is my third time in Goa and honestly nowhere were we treated like the way we were treated in Colva. Never will I return to this beach again."

Colva_Beach-Colva_South,Vibhor Joshi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,The local beach of South Goa,"As i would describe in my words, Colva is the local beach of mid-south goa. Accessibility: Colva beach is easily connected to almost major places within goa, the local bus service is also very frequent, fairly quick and extremely cheap.Cleanliness: Considering it is one of most visited (read crowded) beaches, i would rate it at 3/5.Eateries: Not recommended. Shacks are average, food is below average, everything is over priced. Head straight to Benaulim (walk southwards for 15 mins while enjoying the Sunset along the beach."

Colva_Beach-Colva_South,Poornima,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Family,Jellyfish scare,"Hi, I am writing to bring to everyone's attention that I was stung by a jellyfish on Colva beach 2 days ago. This happened in shallow water and the beach was crowded. It could have happened to anyone. Lots of jellyfish were lying on one side of the beach so we decided to go to the other side. There it was pretty clean so I just sat where the waves comes to the shore. Within 5 mins, I felt excruciating pain on my forearm. The lifeguard gave a me a cotton ball dipped in vinegar to dab on my arm and said it will take 30 mins for the pain to subside. My arm was swollen and red. I couldn't bear the pain so we went to Margao Hospital and took a tetnus shot. Apparently they had a case in the morning as well. The doctors were very efficient. I was prescribed painkillers and given calamine lotion. By the next day I was feeling a little better. Please avoid beaches where you see a jellyfish or check with the lifeguard before you enter the water. Apparently these incidents have been taking place around beaches in Goa but there are no warning signboards. "

Colva_Beach-Colva_South,androrphin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Busy and lively end of the beach,"If you want lots of beach shacks, never ending water sports and a busy, thronged beach then Colva beach is for you.We stayed on the beach for a full day as a change from the very more sedate Sernabatim beach. As well as the usual European/Russian tourists there are also Indians using this beach so it can get busy just at the beachhead but you can avoid the crowds by moving off to either side.Fortunately there are a fair few beach shacks to accomodate people. The beach itself is sandy with a large tidal range and is basically just a section of the very long beach which lines Goa's coastline.There is a water sports cartel in operation so the prices are fixed.Just behind the beach is Colva itself which has numerous shops and restaurants for you to spend your money in."
Colva_Beach-Colva_South,Adam J,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Family,Goa's Blackpool,"Colva is a touristy beach town, with an unremarkable but reasonably well served beach, and some watersports available, though the owners are money focused and joyless. It's not otherwise picturesque, and feels like a crude and repetitive tourist resort, but it does have plenty of small shops selling the usual fare, if that's your thing. The Garden Restaurant is one of the best in the village, and the rooftop bar of the adjoining guest house is worth a visit. But there's not much else of note. Avoid the small jewellers shops, which have a notorious reputation for fake and overpriced jewellery sold by con men and fraudsters. There are one or two slightly more upmarket clothes stores which sell decent enough fare, though prices are less open to haggling than the smaller shops.Overall, one of the least interesting destinations in Goa, though it's useful for its proximity to the airport and main rail station."
Colva_Beach-Colva_South,EkMusafir,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Most Popular Beach Of South Goa.,"Colva Beach seems to be the most popular beach of South Goa judging by the crowds here on holidays. But the direct approach to the beach was obstructed by a pool of stagnant and dirty water when we visited in December 2019. One has to skirt around some beach shacks to reach the sandy portion along the seaside. There is another approach road going from behind the restaurants which runs parallel to the beach.There are a lot of water sports activities taking place here. If you come during the daylight hours you will observe people enjoying parasailing, water skiing, banana boat riding and swimming in the sea. The beach is always crowded in the holiday season. It is a safe beach for a dip in the sea and there are lifeguards always present and patrolling in their red jeeps.We were sitting at one of the beach restaurants and observing the frenzied activities taking place on the lovely sands. It is a crowded beach and not one where one can relax with a book to read, though there are many sundecks which the Europeans hire from the local vendors, to give themselves a deep tan.Apart from the beach shacks there are also some  established restaurants and hotels on shore, including the state run GTDC Colva Residency. There are many shops where you can pick up souvenirs and memorabilia, as well as Goan cashews and famous alcoholic brew of Goa, Feni."

This beach is visited by local & foreign tourists throughout the year.This beautiful beach is long and sandy. It is lined with shacks, hotels, restaurants, lounge chairs etc. Before entering the beach, there are two small footbridges. It is less crowded than the beaches in North Goa. However, there are fishing boats and stray dogs roaming around in the beach. In the evenings, there is less crowd. Had gone for a stroll and enjoyed the cool breeze. However, there is garbage scattered around the beach area. Watersport activities can be done on this beach.This beautiful beach is an ideal place for families, couples as well as friends. It is a must visit place and should not be missed while in Colva."
