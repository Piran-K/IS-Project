Din_Brothers_Jewellers_and_Gold_Smiths-Cavelossim_South,Bill Strong,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 â€¢ Solo,I truly amazing jewellers,"A truly talented and knowledgeable jeweller. Zubair is an artist deep inside. He is from 3 gerations of jewellers. I bought two silver bracelet from him, both handmade, one antique that he bought from the foothills of the Himalayas. We talked and found a price that was beneficial to both but if I am honest it was me that got the better of the bargain. The antique one in particular was something I have never seen on any of my many travels in India.And then without me asking he offered to put a new clasp on another silver bracelet that I had, which he noticed that I had trouble opening and closing. He did this ex gratis without charge. I recommend this man unreservedly."
Din_Brothers_Jewellers_and_Gold_Smiths-Cavelossim_South,Med,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 â€¢ Couples,Great experience and long term relationship,"There are many jewellers in South Goa. However, what separates Din Brothers is their honesty and integrity. We had been looking for wedding bands and had started to give up hope as the prices in all the jewellers were similar if not higher than the UK!! One evening, while walking past Zabir's shop, I asked the gold price per gram, and we were immediately quoted half the price of others in the area. Having researched the price of gold earlier that day in the local newspaper, I knew he was being honest  and not trying to take advantage of the fact that we were tourists. He took time to talk to us about how the rings would be made and how the price is calculated. He even reassured us that they would be completed on time or that our deposit would be 100% refunded. In less than 24 hours, our rings were handmade and to an outstanding standard. we absolutely love them. The craftsmanship is turely a cut above the rest. We will definitely be buying more in the future. If ever in Cavelossim South Goa and looking to purchase jewellery, then I recommend you pop in."
Din_Brothers_Jewellers_and_Gold_Smiths-Cavelossim_South,Colin W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Dinn Brothers,"I have known Zubair for around 20 yrs, very pleasant individual, and very knowlegable in his work. Spoilt for choice with his array of jewellary and if you want slight alterations he is very accomadating. Take your old jewellary and he will offset the price accordingly. Maybe you have a particular design in mind or its in a UK jewellary book take it out with you or explain what you want & he will make it for you. You will hear horror stories of people buying out in Goa & getting stung, !.... but not from these guys Wether its Zubair or Masood you can rest assured you are getting a bargain.In the shop there will be Tibettan gifts, or Indian gifts or wooden carvings, cloth to make dresses or a suit. Its worth popping in for a look, but get chatting to the lads they are knowledgable at what they do & sell.I send my regards to Zubair & his team & Masood & his team thank a million."

Din_Brothers_Jewellers_and_Gold_Smiths-Cavelossim_South,Trish4007,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 â€¢ Couples,Very Highly Recommended,"My partner and I have enjoyed a number of holidays in South Goa and as such it is a very special place to us. We intend to get married in the very near future so the main purpose of our holiday on this occasion was to have our weddings rings designed and made there. Our next dilemma was which jeweller could we put our trust in to do this for us. We have used various local outlets on previous visits but we felt for this purchase we needed to really check out what was available to us, and as such we happened to come across the Din Brothers.We were greeted very warmly by Shah and straight away we felt confidence and trust in this local family business, which has a very professional but friendly approach.We came to a decision on roughly what we would like but then Shah suggested ideas that would totally personalize our rings and I have to say that his input and expert advice was excellent.Just before we left for home we collected our rings and were over the moon with them. Not only that but the price was very reasonable considering the quality and the time with design etc.In conclusion I would have no hesitation in recommending this jeweller and when we return to Goa we will now only use this business our number 1 in Cavelossim.Superb and thank you."

There were so many jewellers in India, I didnâ€™t know who to trust. I went on Trip Advisor and looked at many reviews. The reviews for Dinâ€™s were amazing. I am happily adding to the great reviews. With limited time and not much of an idea of what I wanted, I visited Din Brothers. They were very helpful, giving me many options and showing me examples of what could be made from my existing jewellery.  The workmanship is fantastic, and very reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend visiting Din Brothers if you are looking to have that special piece made. I guarantee you will be very happy with the friendly , high quality service.

Din_Brothers_Jewellers_and_Gold_Smiths-Cavelossim_South,Jackie S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 â€¢ Friends,The best jewellery and jeweller in Goa,No pressure!! If your thinking of purchasing jewellery in Goa this is the place to go. Zubair puts you under no pressure and listens to what you want with good advise rather than pressuring you and believe me some other jewellers over there sit you down and make you feel like you have to buy something.  The trust works both ways we purchased jewellery that we designed but was short of cash and Zubair allowed us to send him the money. When we got back to the UK we had our jewellery valued to which it was 3 times the value we paid for it. 5***** ..

Din_Brothers_Jewellers_and_Gold_Smiths-Cavelossim_South,Bellydancingqueen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Top Quality Jeweller,"I visited the shop on recommendation, as I was told this was a much trusted jeweller who charged fair prices.  I took photos of a pendant I had been given 10 years previously, for which I had been unable to find matching earrings. The photos were from all angles and against a ruler to show the true size. The jeweller discussed my requirements and made recommendations, but ultimately the remit was for earrings (and a bracelet - I got carried away!) to look like they were part of a set with the pendant.  The price was fair, as mentioned and I paid a deposit.  The jeweller made both items within 3 days and the results are stunning,  They are the work of a true artist who knows his craft.  I cannot praise him highly enough. If you are thinking of buying jewellery, don't waste your time elsewhere.  This is the place to go."

Not only was the result fast and fabulous, he resized and re-plated the others for free.My husband then decided he wanted a ring too and is thrilled with his which was personally delivered to the restaurant that we were eating in one night.It was an absolute pleasure to be customers here and we'll be commissioning them again."

Din_Brothers_Jewellers_and_Gold_Smiths-Cavelossim_South,Julie S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 â€¢ Couples,Well over due review,"Iâ€™ve been visiting  Cavelossim now for 15 years, and for the last 10 years have not missed a visit to the shop for a catch up with Zubair and the boys. In the early years my husband, friends and I would walk pass, never ventured in just said hello exchanging banter etc.  Then 10 years ago my friend and I went in, sat down, tried everything on, but I still couldnâ€™t be tempted. My friend bought a ring and was extremely happy with the valuation when she got home. Needless to say that day was the start of a wonderful friendship.Every year we would buy the odd silver chains, have items cleaned or repaired etc, never spent a lot of money but it didnâ€™t matter to them because our friendship was more important. Then this year to celebrate a special birthday and anniversary, I had what I always wanted, a diamond solitaire ring. It took me days deciding, then after I explained to Zubair how I wanted it, he made one, and it was perfect. But stressed I was under no obligation to purchase as it was Â£2,500. My husband who is not the slightest bit interested in jewellery, was well impressed too. LolI paid for a private valuation back home through a well known  high street jeweller. He wrote down a figure and then he asked would I mind telling him what I paid. I did, he raised an eyebrow and passed me what he had written. I was totally speechless, and over whelmed, far more than what I expected.I have the highest regards for Zubair, his brother Mubaishe, whom I got to speak to more in November, and kindly arranged a WiFi dongle for us.Their nephew Wafiq, whom if heâ€™s not in shop you â€˜ll see him down Mikes shack on the beach, a lovely young man.I cannot recommend Zubair and the  Din Bros highly enough, for their quality, service, and most of all the kindness we have received over the years.They will be happy to exchange money for you, and advise on anything you want to know about the area.Oh, and last but not least a special mention to Ali the Taylor, next door. My husband finally had 2 shirts made with him, after years of bartering and the quality was superb. Iâ€™d like to wish them good luck with the new shop, it looked amazing just before we left, and the refurbishment of the old one.See you next year, to carry on where we left off, with the eternity ring."

We returned and chatted many times and shared family and life stories. Zubair is a true family man with integrity. The service we received was very kind and thoughtful and bespoke.
