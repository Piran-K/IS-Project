Divar_Island-Panjim_North,avinashsood,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Couples,Monsoon Bliss at Mercury Divar Goa,"A gem of a resort situated.on the Divar island(have to take a ferry to reach).The ferry can take cars too.Its about 10 minutes from Panjim city.Tje resort is designed  in true goan architecture.Some rooms face the river.The sitouts on the 1st floor rooms are large and comfortable.The ground floor rooms boast of rear garden stouts,but I guess are avoidable in the monsoons.The bar over looks the river and is made in true goan flavour,with gardens and open Cabanas.The real gem is the food and the service .The kitchen does an extremely good job and all dishes from their extensive menu are done very well.The  pesto pasta we had ,would put most Italian restaurants to shame.Same for the Indian Food.The Murgi Makhani and Biryanies are outstanding too.It's a truly relaxing place where wellness of the soul is of the essence.A must do for a few nights."

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,traveller3502,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Terrible experience,"It is a lovely place and I am sure it has a lot of good people but we had a terrible experience with an individual named Sushant Bhomkar.  We were having tea at a roadside place after sunset with our cars parked in an empty space next to the shack. There were couple of guys talking on the phone in that space. Suddenly one of them asked us to remove our cars. As we were moving the cars, one guy kept abusing and screaming loudly at everyone saying ""my name is Sushant Bhomkar, I manage this entire island"". He was clearly drunk and kept on ranting and threatening till couple of guys in the group calmed him down. I've never had such a terrible experience anywhere as a tourist. I am definitely not visiting this place again."

Sadly the state or India doesn't know how to display history. While Europe portrays its history of WW2 which is 80 years old, we don't know to showcase whats 450 years old."

This serene retreat is heaven for bicycles with plenty of routes. Or take a bus into town and you can walk to various sites from the center. Or enjoy food from a local bakery or restaurant, like Rock Hill. A nice range of guest quarters too, from Mercure Retreat to local families to my fave, Moradia dos Quadros. Or, just enjoy a day trip from Panjim via the free ferry. Just be sure to learn the history there. This island is full of beautiful stories and generations. #ParadiseIsland "

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Cara W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Cultural adventure,"A great little way to spend a couple of hours, ferry cost so little i can't even remember how much it was. We had rented a car so drove straight onto the boat to get across. Once there it really doesn't take long to get from one side of the island to the other. But its the side roads and temples that you want to hunt down. We stopped at a small shop on the high street for a drink (no restaurants were open) and asked a woman where we could find the church/temples and she kindly pointed us in the right direction. Definitely drive to the top of the hill to see the church, temple and cemetery. It's a  friendly place but not a touristy place so you may well get some funny looks! Some very picturesque places on this island. Probably could spend 2 hours here."
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Denise H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Worth a ferry trip over for the views,We travelled by taxi and our driver obligingly drove the taxi onto the ferry for which we paid the princely sum of 7 rupees to go across to Divar Island.  The short trip over by ferry was a highlight together with the drive through the village with a very Portugese flavour to the architecture and a magnificent church on the hill top affording beautiful views of Goa and surrounds.
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,poochamami,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Not much to do but good break from the touristy parts of Goa,"We rode here on a scooter from Marbela beach. It was a fairly long ride but we enjoyed it nevertheless. You have to cross the river to get here on a ferry. The ferry is free and will take you and your vehicle across. Look out for a Mayur Bar & Restaurant. It is a local joint but has great food-both veg and non veg. Also, ask for ""uraak"" which is basically a local arrack, Mild version of fenni but it is yummy."
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Annsley F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Divadi / Divade - Small Island,"Well Known as Divar Island and till date isolated from the mainland and operational by a ferry Boat from old Goa or from Ribandar. It is surrounded by the Mandovi. The Place is about 6 sq km in area and on its own is a treasure. Has its own tradition, a festival called ""Bonderam"", Many Vintage Houses and temples and is well protected by the Locals. There are 2 main areas St. Mathias and Malar. A must Visit if in Goa. I suggest one must take a bike and visit the place, roam around for about 5-6 hours and explore the small yet an amazing island."
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Jacky Bhagat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,A typical Goan place in Goa,You can reach this place from a ferry from Panjim. Bonderam festival is one of the famous here. Try not to miss.

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,5MP95,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Excellent for those loving peace and greenery!!,"Divar island ... we waited to see this place as the pics on the net looked stunning. It was our first trip to Goa staying away from d beaches. This was more like staying in semi - wild environment.Route - Bengaluru - Davangere- Hubli- Ramnagar- Molem - Ponda - old Goa - Divar 12 hour drive from Bangalore including a 2 hour break, an hour fr BF at Dvg and an hour at Molem fr late lunch. What was good - . Divar island is for peace lovers, it shows u the other side of Goa away from commercial crowd and beaches .it is Green, cute, beautiful..The age old buildings and churches here can take ur breath away, every building is competing with the other in terms of design and colors ... a photographers paradise and feast fr an eye. The ferry from Raibandar to Divar is an experience by itself ... takes about 8-10 minutes to cross the other side . . Ferry services are available till 12:30am ... special ferry services available too, no charges fr humans ... 10 bucks fr car.. There is a 5 star resort ""Devayaa"" or something similar in d island. Fantastic roads in the island What's not there : . Availability of a good Goan style restaurant, there are none, there was one S M Harmalkars which served good BF but the rest were disappointing, . While we did not explore the island much, there's hardly anything u can do except fishing, swim in a pond, visit a church / view point.. Travel off and on the island can get tiring as we did it fr 3 days ... can get very boring in 2 days . Food can get very monotonous ... as it is mostly from same restaurants... could see only 3 restaurants on the island wen went looking all with same menu of fried rice, chiken starters.Visit Divar for an experience ... it is an extreme of what Goa is actually known for !!

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Indian Ghummakad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Huge Island ,My Impression was like it will be just a small Island but it's not it a huge one Local Tribes lives there even have kind of Small Market Place and District Highway inside. Government water careers are available which will carry your vehicle from one side to other for two wheeler there is no charges and for 4Wheeler they do charge 10-15 Rupees. Once you enter other side the entertainment will be on other lavel the Enjyoable scenario greenery all around The distance of 2Km there is one Church and one Temple too nearby from where you will enjoy 360 degree view of Divar Island With Beautiful surroundings and peaceful environment you will feel healing air and Bird Songs. It was fabulous visit of mine hope you all will feel the same like meThanks and Regards Anil Thakur 
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,nikhil singh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Nothing to explore at island except church and temple,Need to take ferry to reach island which is a good experience but the island has no major tourist attractions.only good place here is church and there is hardly any place to eat out here.people are good but some time they may misguide you so it's better to carry a map to explore this place
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Shubhankar1994,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Travel back in time,"A quaint village, just half an hour drive from the hustle and bustle of Panjim. A must visit for those who love the retro touch of Goa. Should definitely visit the church on the top of the hill. "
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Sanhita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Traveling back in time,"Visiting Divar Island is like going back in time, with no bridges connecting the island to the mainland the only way to get there is by the jetty. This has ensured minimal commercialization of this island which is very picturesque and lush with greenery, yet unspoiled by the numerous bars & restaurants which Goa is otherwise full of. For a bollywood reference this is where the road trip scene for Finding Fanny was shot."
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Akshaya_Patil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Picture Perfect Village,"If you are not a big fan of beaches or this is your 3rd /4th trip to goa or you want to try out off beat goa then Divar Island Village is apt for you.Getting There:Its in North Goa, near Panjim. You need to reach Raibunder Area. GPS navigation is perfect. Take a ferry to Divar ( ask before you on board , there are 2-3 ferries going to different islands/villages). Its free ferry for humans & two wheelers , only for cars you need to buy tickets. It take just 5-10 mins to reach Divar. From there it's almost 10 mins drive to village.  You need to have your own vehicle , as I could not find any cab or rickshaw on the island. Please note that there is no fuel station or petrol pump. You get petrol in bottles at couple of places , need to ask for this , no boards or signage .What to see & doThere is no major sightseeing except for a church. Just ride aimlessly ( I strongly recommend bikes) , enjoy the lush green scenic views , beautiful Portuguese style houses ( really beautiful, u feel like owning one), roads are narrow not much wide but in good condition. Its exceptionally clean. You need max 2 hours to complete your visit to island. Where to EatI could not find any café or restaurant where I could have had a nice meal. Not sure if there are hotels or homestays. i could see few on tripadvisor but couldn't see them while i visited. Carry your own food /drinks on safer side.Overall, it was a very very different and unique experience. Suitable for kids as well.Please note: you don't get island type of feel here, it's more like a old portuguese village, there is no beach."
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,sachin padti,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,"Scenic ride,  unexplored goa","divar island,  a small island about 10 km from panjim is an unexplored beauty of Goa.  If u have seen the movie finding fanny you will know that , the shooting was done in this island.  The best thing to do is just take a bike and keep riding any where and you don't have to worry about getting lost because eventually you will end up at any of the ferry points which will take you towards panjim. The best ferry point to reach this island is at old Goa near basilica of bom Jesus. The scenery,  paddy filelds, the vintage Portuguese houses , the real goa and the people you can enjoy all this while driving or riding through the narrow roads of this island.  There are some beautiful church,  temples as well as historic places to visit. If you go there please don't litter cos this is a beautiful place and very clean. Just take the free ferry ride (for car you have to pay ) and get lost in this beautiful island.  For some more pictures of Goa,  follow me on instagram @saclorine. "

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Siddharth Bhatia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017,Old world charm,"Divar was like a journey back in time. Enchanting right from the time we turned off the highway towards Old Goa and rode over the centuries old causeway, which at one time was the longest bridge in Asia. Then we reached the jetty and ferry was just about to leave. I revved up my trusty Bullet into 1st gear and rode over the ramp into the ferry boat. Bike on its stand, we went up to top of the ferry boat and enjoyed the lovely ride to the wonderful island of Divar. We rode around the island, through all its quaint little winding roads and got transported back in time. I think we were the only tourists on the island that day and it just felt as if we've stumbled onto a unknown treasure. Stopped a local chai shop for vada and chai. Went up to see the old church and mandir. Great views from the church. Some guys were putting up flowers for a wedding! We rode back to the ferry boat with a smile on our faces. We had captured a piece of old world charm in the camera of our memories. Thank you to anyone and everyone who have helped keep this beautiful place untouched by the scourge of commerce."
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Free@will,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Absolutely serene ,Took the ferry from ribandar to reach divar Island. As soon as we got off the ferry the road opened up. One lane well paved road. The road leading to the the village was scenic with panoramic beauty. Greenery around. Vast expanse of open land. The village is at some height as we had to climb up an incline. The houses are quaint and cozy. The people friendly. If I had to retire this would be the place. We took the return ferry to old goa from another place from where we could see a railway bridge. All in all a must visit to enjoy peace and serenity amid goa. I was so engrossed in the natural beauty that I forgot to click photos. Next time for sure.

The ferry ride is only Rs.7(one way), it was really awesome as you take your car in the ferry and it quickly depart you in the island. The island is another world as I was seen so many churches and Portuguese style of old houses. it resembles the feeling of travelling into a Portuguese village. Worth visiting and I only spent 45 minutes just to one round on the island and visited Se Cathedral and other places nearby."

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Guneet K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,There is a paradise on the other side of Mandovi river,"For a peace and quiet seeker like me, Goa hasn't been the first choice ever for a beach holiday. In my head, Goa has always been about the parties. But on a recent business trip to Goa, I came across an article on Divar island in the airline magazine. So on my day off,   my friends and I decided to explore this island. We hired a car. The magic of the journey starts at the ferry point itself. The ferry ride is short but memorable. It leaves every 15 mins. You take your car on the ferry for 20 rupees. Its this massive, platform ferry. Divar is a quiet village. We didn't see too many people as we entered and it was a Sunday. The church at the top of the hill is one of the most beautiful points I've been to. It gives a 360 degree view across the Mandovi river. The church, itself, is an old, majestic building. Unfortunately, driving uphill, the car started giving trouble. While my friends were panicking about the smoke coming from our car, the generally super anxious me was just excited about being on the hilltop.  It was all so awe inspiring and slightly overwhelming in certain ways. A group of village women was chatting after Sunday morning church and guided us to the nearest and the only mechanic on the island. they gave us directions. The beauty and charm of Divar are as much in its old majestic buildings and natural aura as it is in the simplicity and warmth of the residents of Divar. Everybody knows everybody and we finally reached the mechanic's place. He was a bike mechanic but agreed to see our car. His associate kick started our car and refused to take remuneration. He also did warn us to not drive too much. We took the risk because we had come all this way to Divar and we went further to other places like the step well and this temple at the edge of the river. Then on our way back, our car broke again. There were these two gentlemen who were going in a car. They stopped by, spoke to the car rental fellow and got our issue solved. They also volunteered to drop us at the ferry point because we were carrying all our luggage with us. My point is that despite the inconveniences caused by our car, this was a magical trip because of the people and the beauty. It's a happy place. Isn't that why we travel- in the search for happiness?  (P.S. The nice people who dropped us to the ferry point organise festivals in Goa. Do check out their facebook page. Posting the link below. )"
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,sanchit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Escape from the regular rush; Best Sunset ever,Its a small peaceful island accessible by a ferry which leaves every 15 mins. Approximately 8 kms from Panjim its well maintained and offers option to witness one of the best sunsets. Island doesn't see too many tourist rush and gives you a feel of typical Portuguese colony. Not many eating/ stay options and can be done as a day trip.

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,JimmyDevasia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,Most charming river island ever,"Not much has become famous about Goa's incredible river islands.Divar (or Divade, as called locally) is surely the emerald. My cousin lives there, and this meant spending some days during the school vacations, fishing, swimming, football etc.For decades, the villagers refused the govt's generous offer to build a bridge from Old Goa. They were afraid that an additional connection to the world would overrun their quaint, contend, beautiful island life. They travelled in those blue ferries that would frequently get swept by tides etc. But no bridge they insisted. Thank god that such sentiments still exists, and with great pride and dignity.Hutch shot it's first series of advts (2003?) in Goa...and that large landscape scene with the one tree in the fields (it's been used in many videos later too), is in Divar."

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,ParthUdayShah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,A lovely little island tucked in the hustle and bustle of Panjim,"Divar Island is best reached by Ferry from Old Goa Ferry point.  Closet rail head is Karmali Station on the Delhi-Madgoan route.  Many trains do stop here.  You save at least one hour and about 1500 rupees by taxi by deboarding at Karmali.The Island has just one guest house, the Divar Island Guest House.  The island comprises of three villages and about 40000 people.  Not a particular tourist place, it is ideal for a peaceful vacation and if one wants to know/experience the real Goan way of living.Highly recomended."

Located on the Mandovi river, it can only be accessed by ferry. We took the ferry from Ribander, its hardly a 10 min ride and two ferries are plying simultaneously so ýou hardly have a wait. The ferry carries, people and vehicles and only 4 wheelers are charged a fee of Rs.10/-. You need to have your own vehicle to explore the island if you really want to go all around. There is a bus shuttle that takes people from the ferry point into the island. The roads are great and make sure you visit the church on the hill top which offers a great view. It's not a typical tourist spot and we didn't come across restaurants or cafes. It's more of silent lanes dotted with quaint houses and a laidback pace of life, on a beautiful island."

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Dan D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,If you have the time.,"You can get here by taking a ferry to the Island of Divar, its a picturesque place that you cannot get enough of. From its tallest point you can see the church, its a bit closed on the other days so you might not be able to go inside the church except on a sunday morning or when they have mass at the church. If you mean to enjoy a lazy sunday this the right place to be you can see for miles around from the top, you might not get meals there but bars are aplenty, you can have the local brew and gossip all you want in the local bar.

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Nanditasr,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Pristine!,"I thought the whole of Goa was pristine until I visited this place! Along the water's edge, there are mangroves and endless grasslands. You can see the white churches of Old Goa in the distance. As you get to the heart of the island, there is a small village and a church. (I went to Piedade; I understand there is a similar hamlet to the east, named Narua.) There is a simple eatery called Rock Inn, that serves a thali and terrific fenny and urrack.You MUST access the island by ferry -- you can take your vehicle in it. You can catch the ferry at Ribander (be aware that this is 2 km beyond the Ribander ferry to Chorao) or at Old Goa. If you go on foot: Once on the island, there is a Kadamba shuttle bus."

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,anon_k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Excellent Off-beat Location,"Not a lot of tourists know about this giant island in the Mandovi river. The only way to reach it is via a ferry, which thankfully, will take a car as well. You will need transport because there are no taxis or buses. There is only one main street- real quite and friendly place. Just walk around and enjoy the peaceful setting."

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Veronica K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Friends,Little getaway,This island is an excellent getaway. It's not so touristy and there's far less noise pollution than anywhere I'd been in Goa. We made it to the old church and surrounding little villages on our way from the Divar Island Guest House. If you want a day or two of peace and quiet this is the place to go.
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Veeresh M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Used to be a lovely island now kind of crowed,Divar Island is in the middle of the Mandovi River in Goa and used to be very pretty at one time but is now kind of over-done and looking slightly worn out. Not much to do other than drive around and look for a beer though the Church on top of the hill with the Shiva temple next to it are impressive if desolate. Go with friends and you may have a great time just hanging aroun.

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Vibhor,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,"Lonely island, not a great attraction",Make sure you go on this island on your vehicle and sufficient fuel. There is no petrol pump on island... I think there is nothing to eat also on this island. There is an old church on top of island and nothing else on this island.. It is easy to get diverted on this island and don't expect much help. Take a ferry behind old church to go to this island. Don't go unless you are really free in Goa.

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,NeilD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,Beautiful island with breath-taking hill top views,"Divar is a beautiful island of the coast of Panaji and can be accessed via Old Goa too. The island has ancient history attached to it and the locals know each other really well. Close-knit community. The views from the Divar church are absolutely breath-taking especially sunsets...Where one can see the beautiful see and a larger glimpse of Panaji from afar.To access Divar, ferries are operational that ferry people and cars too at nominal prices making it easily accessible. A worthy day trip!"
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Pratim Karim,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,Little Europe,A beautiful island. You can visit the island in a taxi or motor bike (recommended). The island is very quiet and seems out of the world. We came across only a few people while driving through the most parts of the island. The ferry ride on the river Mandovi is also an interesting experience.
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Bokaa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015,Serene Island,"Cool island to drive end to end.. take a ferry from Old Goa or Chorao Jetty and see 'Our Lady of Piety' and 'St, Mathias' churches. There is a colorful 'gramdevata' temple as well near to 'Lady of Piety' church. This church offers nice vantage point towards Velha, Goa.We visited in December, but it must be in cool in colors in rainy season."
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Kohan R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,Beautiful Island with a lovely hill top church,"Visited this Island as have been to Goa many times and never heard of this attraction before.  You need to take a ferry from the Northern side of the Mandovi River which costs Rs10 and is around 5 mins to cross.  There is virtually nothing on the island, but has a really unique charm to it.  There is a church on a hill top that has some amazing views and is perfect to watch the sunset!  Definitely worth going out of your way to visit!"
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Raju Muthuswamy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Cool Place Visit Once,"We had time on our hands and decided to visit this quaint island. We started from Panaji and took the Ribander ferry to the island.We got lost a couple of times looking for the church but found it after asking the locals a few times.The church is situated on top of a hill and has commanding view of the island. There is temple, too, on top of the hill, which was a surprise.On the way back we took the Old Goa ferry to get off the island. The roads leading to and from the church are narrow but in good condition for a sparsely inhabited island.There are fields on both sides of the road. And, you get many opportunities to take awesome pics."

The island is fantastic as its a mirror reflection of the past once you arrive on the island it naturally carves an imaginary vision in your mind and forces you to think how they used to live here in the past.

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,percyvakil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Solo,Quiet.... very quiet,"Divar Island is an island in the Mandovi river off Old Goa.There are no bridges to get there. I had rented a motorcycle which I took onto a vehicle ferry that I took across the river from Old Goa (the ferry leaves from just behind Se Cathedral).Divar Island has a few open fields, a couple of quiet villages and a few churches. The village was very quiet hardly anyone around, just a few quaint houses and almost no vehicles. There is a little hillock atop which is a church, The Church of Our Lady of Compassion. There's an interesting story I was told about the church. The captain of a ship that was sinking prayed to God for safety and promised that wherever they made landfall he would give the ship's bell to a church. The ship entered the Mandovi river and he gave the bell to this church on Divar Island. Unfortunately the bell was too big and loud. Every time it rang the church windows would shatter. The bell is now at the Se Cathedral in Old Goa."

Do Not miss this place and if you decide to visit this place, do not forget your camera.The 10 minute Ferry Ride to reach the island is a different experience which you should just experience."

Divar_Island-Panjim_North,jayant1985,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Family,The other side of Goa,"Divar island, a 10 minute ferry ride away from Panaji or Old Goa might be your cure for the hangover that relentless partying in Goa gave you. Separated by a narrow creek, Divar, and the rest of Goa seem to be co-existing in parallel universes. You could just get on a random ferry that takes you across from Old Goa, and transports you to another era in a matter of minutes. Do not expect to find anything that you see in contemporary Goa, except perhaps for a 17th century Portugese church and narrow winding roads cutting through a forest that secretly hides a few Old European style homes."

The vehicle can be taken in the ferry. It is only Rs 10/- Drive around a bit. It is scenic with green hills, paddy fields & small lakes. The village has some pretty well maintained Portuguese villas. The views from the hill top are worth the visit."

Cycle around if you can.,"Lovely little place, away from the hustle and bustle of touristy Goa.Hire a bicycle (try Frankie Garcias on Facebook or the Goa Cycling Club group). Just roam around, soak in the scenery. Try the offroads as well. Enjoy the free ferry rides. Totally awesome."
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,VamikaJ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Hidden wonder in Goa.,"The Divar Island, accessible by a ferry is one of the few places in Goa which is still truly Goan and stores the true Goan culture, architecture, style and nature. - The place is still unaffected by tourism and is very simple and raw in itself. - The people are very helpful and simple in nature.A great place to click photographs!P.S.- Do keep some petrol handy, if you're out of fuel, the island doesn't have any petrol pump and you might find no choice but to drag your vehicle back."
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Ankita Balar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Friends,ok kind of place,Island word sounds interesting but actually its just a residential city with not much to do. only place that could be visited is a church. Travelling in ferry can be the other attraction. Thats it!
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,Siddhesh K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Family,Hidden Gem in Goa,I came across this by sheer chance of luck while coming from Old Goa and what an experience it has been. This island hasn't yet fallen prey to tourist explosion and is relatively quaint and charming. It can only be accessed from a Ferry from Ribbandar (I have heard the ferry escorts to the island from other side of the Mandovi as well). Once on the Island you get to see amazing Portuguese colonial architecture and for a moment you can be mistaken where you really are..as the usual chaos of most of the indian towns is missing. Must visit this place before in your next Goa trip.
Divar_Island-Panjim_North,lalith1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,Grand Island,"Very serene island, which can be accessed only by Ferry service either from Ribandar or Old Goa. Lots of traditional Portuguese houses can be seen. The church on the hill in Divar is high light, as you can see all surrounding areas from hill top.  Annual Bondera festival is high light of this Islan where the Islanders participate in dance , music  parade.  Worth a visit for anyone visiting Goa"

We took our Maruti on Ferry and reached Divar Island.it is a very beautiful island and a very good place for shooting moovies. Recently I discovered that a Hindi moovie was pictures end in this island. It was a unique experience . The charges for ferrying our car were very nominal. We discovered so many old houses looking great. We once again visited this place in October 2013. I love this place.
