Although it presents a great sea view, it looks far more awesome in films. In fact, too much of tourist traffic has made the place a bit filthy.

However, on reaching the spot it was found that the Dona Paula Pier was closed along with the view point as the structure was deemed unsafe due to broken piles. It was really disheartening to see the pier in such state. It could have been restored long ago but probably due to reluctance have reached to this state.

We did Jet skiing there but what disappointed me was the high price. Taking 300-400 rupees and riding was of hardly 1 minute on jet skiing. Three of us did it. We gave the jet skiing personnel all the 3 tickets but later he said that you gave only two tickets and started fighting unnecessarily. These people are there to loot the tourists by charging such high prices. Better if you can afford a good hotel in South Goa, then stay there and do sports activities comfortably. On public beaches, they are charging heavy prices, giving less time for rides and are always in a hurry to take the next tourist."

The idyllic rocky tourist attraction lies at the spot where the Mandovi and the Zuari rivers meet and confluences with the Arabian Sea at a distance of 1 km from this point One of the most curious attractions in Dona Paula is a whitewashed statue perched on the rocks near the popular ferry jetty. Sculpted in 1969 by Baroness Yrse Von Leistner, there are different versions to its purpose of origin. According to Goa Tourism Board's website, it is named ""Image of India"" and depicts the figures of Mother India and Young India, one looking to the East and the other to the West. The Wheel of Ashoka is in the middle half, buried in stone, to represent the ancient culture, that nurtured this blend of ideas and emotions. The View from the hill is mesmerizing."

Though tourists and unsuspecting locals frequent the Dona Paula jetty to relive the fantasy of ‘Dona – Paula’ – the daughter of the then Portuguese Governor and the son of a fisherman who were in love but committed suicide from that point due to the opposition from the girl’s parents. This story is only a myth.The truth is that these iconic statues of Dona Paula were gifted to Goa by Mr and Mr Robert Knox around the 1930’s. Carved by a famous European sculptress Yrsa Von Leistner, these statues portray an elderly person pointing to the West, and a child looking towards the East wearing European clothing. The sculptress named these statues as ‘The Far East Travellers’, denoting a peer telling his future generation that they had come from the West and wanted to make the Far East their destination."

Dona_Paula_Beach-Dona_Paula_Panjim_North,Gracious Rodrigues,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,A walk down the promenade,"A trip to Goa has to include Donna Paula.  For me It has been a while thought, but the place does seem to hav its taste of Goan heritage and beauty. Weekends and holidays are generally busy days and the toursits are in plentiful. The walk down the promenade is just lovely and the sea just seems so peaceful. Lots of little stalls sell all sorts of local goodies.  The view from the hill is mesmerizing and the two whitewashed  statues perched on the rocks keep you company. There are different versions to the purpose and origin of the figures. Most popular is it is named ""Image of India"" and depicts the figures of Mother India and Young India, one looking to the East and the other to the West."

Dona_Paula_Beach-Dona_Paula_Panjim_North,Amrinder S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Nice site and view of the sea,Not a great place but worth for one visit as it is the place where they shot the movie ek duje ke liye. The walk to along the river  and staircase leading to the final point is nice. You can enjoy few moments clicking some awesome pics at the entry and the final point. Clean place with not much crowd. We went there in the evening and spent about half an hour. No entry fee.
Dona_Paula_Beach-Dona_Paula_Panjim_North,Abhishek Singh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Visit if you have spare time,"Dona Paula offers a beach, a view point and water sports activity. we had been to Dona Paula view point, spent around 40 mins there. There is a jetty on one side and on the other side there is hillock.There are few stairs which lead to the top where there is small platform providing  panaromic  beautiful view of Arabian sea, Vasco and other parts of Goa. There are eateries, congested parking space. According to me, if you have a spare time then visit this place. "
Dona_Paula_Beach-Dona_Paula_Panjim_North,Backpacker122015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Worth a visit if you are in Panjim,"The view point at Dona Paula offers amazing views of the sea and the river merging into it. Go there at early morning or during sunset time for seeing the beautiful colors in sky and how it looks against the backdrop of endless stretches of water. And don't forget to look around for the statue of Donna Paula as it's kind of neglected and remains hidden behind the trees.To reach this place you can take a bus in Panjim and then from the drop off point you have to walk 10 minutes or so. There is a parking place but it's always full from afternoon onwards. Also there are a few vendors selling lime water, cold drinks and chips. There are also some shops selling hats and dresses where the stuff sold are not worth the price.This place is definitely worth a visit if you are in Panjim. However i would recommend you do so in morning for the view and also as there is less number of people around."

Dona_Paula_Beach-Dona_Paula_Panjim_North,Anton Razumov,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,;),The sea was rough at this time of the year because of the monsoons. I was visiting after a long gap of 24 years. The place is now overrun by a very large number of shops selling cheap clothes and sun hats etc. The best views can be had from the hilltop which provides 360 degree panoramic views.

Dona_Paula_Beach-Dona_Paula_Panjim_North,Alok Nahata,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Famous spot filmed in Bollywood movies,This is a famous spot of Goa with a sea front and the Dona Paula statue. Very nice sea views from the viewpoint. Some scenes from bollywood movie Singham were shot here. Local vendors have encroached the place and spoiled the beauty of this place. They should be given a place outside the venue in a proper manner to encourage more tourists and promote cleanliness. Very beautiful place but not well managed.
