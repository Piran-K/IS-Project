Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Naghee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Trip to Dudhsagar,"I am writing this review for parents who have small kids. i have travelled to Dudhsagar on 15th Jan,2023.  after visiting I realised, it's not a right time as the water flow was very less compared to season time, the waterfall will be continuous. The time taken from south goa to Dudhsagar is 2.5hrs, from there you will be travelling again for 45mins in Dudhsgar driver association SUV to reach the destination. I would advise to start at 6am to reach Dudhsagar from south goa to avoid the rush/queues, its full day trip. The Ticket counter opens at 8am- you pay 585.00rs per head, they give a paper with a WL-number and vehicle number on it. Kids below 4yrs free ( there is no one to check the kids age).  next to collect life jackets- 50rs per jacket. Driver assigned to you, will take you to Dudhsagar waterfalls which takes 45mins and drop you back in the same vehicle. The Road is pathetic, more pits than road because the roads will get damaged frequently due to waters. people with back pain good to avoid this trip. Total -276 vehicles are allowed per day, each vehicle will have 6 passengers. The drivers wont waste time your time, but once you enter the Dudhsagar water fall road, you will have to get vehicle entry done at forest department, you pay 100rs per head, kids below 4yrs-30rs. They will allow limited vehicles at once, so you will wait for your turn almost one hour at this point. One you reach Dudhsagar, you will be given 1.5hrs only. if you are late, then the drivers will ask extra money, you will have to walk to the waterfalls for almost 15mins. This is a big task, Parents and kids must be very careful, the way is full of big sharp rocks, unstable, slippery route, try to leave all the laguagge in the vehicle. On the way you have one changing room and toilets, depending on the crowd, you have to follow the queue. I visited the place around 1PM, its freaky crowded. no place to sit, can't take proper pics. swimmers will enjoy the place. hope this helps."

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,michael,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,Beautiful and worth a visit,Very beautiful falls.  Get there early (8am).  The jeep queue opens around 8:30.  Go to the toilet before you leave the jeep station.

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Mohit Kumar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Great Falls worst Roads india,Very poor management and worst road body will break after travelling. Take care of your small children if going along
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,natholian,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,It could be amazing….,"It could be amazing but the road to the falls needs some repairs so you don’t feel like you are being driven up a dry river bed and when you get there, it’s impossible to find a place to swim because it is just completely full of people, which kind of takes the ‘I’m in nature’ feeling away and makes it a bit like a public. swimming pool."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Roy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Never looses its charm....,"Trek 27 kms to get there...worth all of it...This is my second time...started at 8.30 am after breakfast from Mollem railway station. Through uphill, downhill, dense forest, flat lands, water streams passing by...its exhausting,  painful but once u reach, the beauty is mesmerizing. Took a dip in the cold water for hours. Returned back by 6pm. Had a professional guide ... Dattaraj and Pede.Breakfast and late lunch was just okay."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,fecnitin,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Friends,"Unable to reach the Falls, Ruffians enroute","You won't reach the Falls. Around 10 kms away from the Falls, the locals will accost you, make you park your car in their space and take you to the Falls in their rickety non-AC Jeep. Their contention is that there are a lot of parking issues near the Falls so they are just trying to help us out. The rascals should be jailed and their properties confiscated. I don't understand how such a nuisance is being allowed by the authorities. I wish I knew who to complain to."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Vikramadityabusiness,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,DUDHSAGAR WATERFALL JEEP TOUR and FALLS,"The falls are spectacular in full monsoon but one cannot visit then. At other times the falls are not so spectacular. Access is a nightmare to say the least. The jeep safari (DUDHSAGAR WATERFALL JEEP TOUR) is a poorly run show. Do not go without an online booking.  And even then try to arrive by 10 AM and take the 10 AM slot.  Be prepared to push and shove like one gets into a Mumbai local.  The 11 km ride is very rough and those with a back problem are strongly advised not to go.  Tourists litter the place, feed the monkeys and in general ruin the atmosphere. It is better to take a day train and cross the falls in monsoon."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,kapilkan81,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Family,Natural Milky Mountain,"Beautiful place to visit provided you are getting proper information and guidance. Lot of website charge you approximately 1650 to 2000 per person for water fall, spice garden and lunch but if you plan by your own you may end up paying lesser. Go online and get yourself registered to avoid long que, google dudhsagarjeeps.com.You only need to pay 10 rupee per person for registering apart from this taxi will charge 500 per person to take you inside near the waterfall plus 40 rupee per person charged for life jacket and forest entry fee is 100 per person so total of 650/- charged to visit the fall. Also if you are staying in Calangute you can come to this place in shared taxi which will cost 500 to 600 per person so total cost you visit this place is 1150 to 1250 without spice garden visit and lunch"
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Surya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Great experience,"We wanted to trek to Dudhsagar Falls after watching YouTube videos we thought that trek will be on railway track . But after reaching there , you get to know that you cannot trek without a guide . We were looking for guide and fortunately we met another group of friends like us and they already booked a guide.  price - Rs.850 per person.You get some small shops for breakfast nearby the entrance for jeep safari . Pack some food /snack and water as the trek is 13kms one way .Get some really grippy shoes as the trail is full of mud which is extremely slippery . We went during November and the day before there was little rain so it could be slippery but be prepared for it . Starting you need to pay 100rs/person for trekking apart from which we paid for guide as entrance Its all about the guide you get and the person was really amazing . he is experienced guy for 25 years and he walks on those trails like ice on cake where we were struggling to balance . After long trek , we reached the falls entrance in afternoon and he takes care of life jacket . You will be taken to a place where you will be allowed to swim for sometime ( luckily the guide was so polite for us and he takes care of everything ) .The experience of swimming in the high current of falls with view from bottom of falls was mind blowing . Then while returning we were so tired and half way through the guide arranged a jeep (2000 per jeep and we were 9 members). Note : Words from guide ""During monsoon , they won't let us swim in the place where we get to swim during our trip. As the current of water is extremely strong and you won't be able to go near by . The sound of falls is loud enough that you could listen away from 3kms """
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,ninnisoft,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Family,Astonishing,Astonishing beauty!Must visit!!!It's an experience of a lifetime.There might be quite a few places like this but this experience of such a sky-high waterfall along with swimming and jungle safari must be a unique combo in itself.
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Prakash S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Family,A Good experience away from the salty beaches of goa,"We visited the fall in the month of November 21. The Roads from western goa towards the fall are good. The drive from north or south goa wil take appx 1:30-2h. To visit the fall one has to reach near kullem railway station. There you will fin park & pay options for 100 rs.From kullem railway station to the waterfall personal vehicles are not allowed & one has to hire Dudhsagar fall association vehicle, which cost  3500rs per vehicle which can accommodate max 7 person.One has both options of booking either online or offline for the vehicle. Since the trail is through wildlife reserved area, only 240 vehicles of the association out of 430 registered  are allowed per day to enter the trail.So, if you are planning to visit in a weekend preferably book online from goa tourism site for your visit, else offline booking is also available till 1600 hrs, but for offline booking you will havve to wait in queue. Additionally if you don't wnt to spend 3500 per vehicle you can share with others which will cost you 500 per head. Other expenditures are rs 40 for life jacket & rs 100 per head for the forest entry fee.The drive from kullem railway station isof appx 45 min to the base of waterfall  & it's a complete off roading experience with 2-3 river crossings in between.You get 1.5h after deboarding to visît the fall & comeback, else you can pay additional 200-300 for some extra time.The walk from deboarding pt to the fall will take appx 7-10min. So, the total time from kullem railway station to the waterfall & back will take 3 hrs appx. It's preferable to visit in a weekday to avoid crowd at the waterfall & if visiting on a weekend, come early."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Niks,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Family,Disappointed....,"I have been yearning to visit Dudhsagar for years now. This time finally I had baked it into my Goa plan and I was looking forward to this trip.I was planning to trek up to the waterfall (a 11km trek oneway). However was discouraged by one and all since I had a 10 year old. The main point which stuck was the humidity factor.Hence we finally decided to do the jeep Safari. As per the enquires we did, everyone mentioned that we should reach there before 8am and get a jeep ticket on the counter. We also checked for any online bookings but could not find any.Luckily, our driver showed us an SMS forward on online booking website (dudhsagarjeeps.com). Hence we registered paying Rs.10 per head for a 11am slot (earlier slots were fully booked). This website does not come up on the search engine(maybe because it is a new one).We reached the counter around 8 and we saw a sea of people jostling for jeep tickets. Forget social distancing (do we still fear Covid?) We were told to come back at 10.45am.Around 100-200 meters away from the maddening crowd, we found a Udipi pure veg hotel ( its more like a room in a house). It's a limited menu restaurant run by a couple. We were served fresh, hot and delicious Idlis. As we waited out there, we saw the idlis get over and the couple sweetly preparing upma and poha for the guests coming in. (Goes without saying that the guests would need to give them 10 mins to prepare the dish).We enquired about their lunch thali menu and gave them advance for lunch on our way back. And they did meet our expectation with the yummy thali.At 10ish, our driver called us asking us to get into the online que since there was chaos around. Finally at round 11.15am after all the effort on a humid day, we got a sharing jeep. (Every jeep is permitted to take 7 people.  Kids beyond the age of 4 need a ticket). Life jackets are mandatory and arranged by the jeep drivers.Overall the trip takes around 3 hours (45 minutes up-down and 1.5 hours in the waterfall). However the jeep drivers oblige if you pay them Rs.300 for an extra hour. This happened in our case since 4/5 car wanted to extend and others did not have a choice.(we were told so by the majority group and the drivers as well)From the parking the waterfall is around 1-1.5 kms through a rocky way. You can also see the trains cross the waterfall. I realized it might have been an easier option to take a train between the two stations. In the waterfall are most people stay on the sidelines since the water pond is cold, deep, rocky and slippery. There are makeshift toilets and changing rooms.My two cents if you are want to go -Book your slot online on dudhsagarjeeps.com (I could not find it in the Google searches.  Maybe it is a new process)Cost per person-Registration online -₹10Jeep cost -₹500Life jackets- ₹40Forest entry - ₹100Carry water bottles, snacks or food especially if you are traveling with kids. You don't get anything inside the jungle or near the waterfall. Some people do fill their water bottles and drink water in the waterfall. Though I understand it is flowing water hence naturallypurified. I still find it difficult to do it.There are makeshift toilets and changing rooms.  Dont kknow  how  clean  they are, but  do carry a set oof clothes and towels.If you oarevegetarian/jain or like vegetarian food, do try the Udupi homely food. It is near a parking lot 100-150 meters away from the counter.This would take an entire day unless it gets more organized.  Hence don't have anything else on the agenda for the day. We came across a lot of people turning back without visiting the falls because of lack of jeep tickets or other commitments (flights, had to reach another place etc)With the crowd and management by Goa tourism, would recommend giving it a miss."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,wiscman83,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Half day trip worth visiting,"Visited in Oct 2021 on a wednesday.Reached the ticketing office by around 10:30am and had to wait about 30mins to get a jeep assigned at the cost of 700 perperson.Once jeep is assigned, everyone need to mandatorily carry a life jacket at 40 per person.Once we get started on the journey, within few mins, we will reach the forest entry where we need to pay 100 per person again.Journet is about 40 mins each way through the forest on roads that are rocky and bumpy. We will cross many streams on the way while inside the jeep.Due to lots of jeeps on the road, no parking was available and hence the driver dropped us off about 10mins away from the parking area.Once we get off the jeep, it once again took 30 mins each way to get to the actual waterfall itself.On the way to the waterfall, we need to cross multiple streams coming from the waterfall itself and some are deep and difficult for kids and elders to cross as its all rocky terrain.Not advisable for elderly folks. For kids, its manageable.Numerous folks lost their footwear while crossing the streams on foot, so carry your footwear in ur bag or covers separately while crossing the streams.Once we reach the waterfall, we will have a good view of the falls including the railway bridge. There is a pool of water at the bottom of the falls where people are swimming with their life jackets.overall it was a fun and adventurous trip. Plan atleast 6 hours for the whole trip from Panjim to Dudhsagar and back.And best if you reach early to avoid the crowds and traffic jams on the road to the falls."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Malav S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,dont miss if you are in goa,its a must visit in goa trip of course its bit strenious/hard to reach there as we went on 4th october and jeep service was closed so we have to walk for 10kms or take a train both is not easy but if you manage to reach there view is awsome local giude told us its water fall is running almost all year but there is no facilities at all not even a toilet or one can not get bottle of water 
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Suvidha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Friends,Not doing it for ever again,"Avoid Misleading information on websites.The trek is a 12km ""trek""(one side)The local guides charge extravagant prices, its not even legal (as per norms of Indian Railways) and there is no provision of drinking water. The jeeps are a good way of traveling. And safe too.Once you reach the water falls, the local guides have the monopoly over life saving jackets and don't allow you to enter the waterThere are rarely any forest officers or incharge you can reach out to.If you are still the adventurous kind who is willing to go through 24 km of craziness, then please carry food and water (for your safety) and wear shoes because 24 km in 10hours will suck out the joy of waterfalls"
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,janhavi12,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2020,Amazing Water !!,"The car drops you at a point from there you will have to travel by a jeep.The jeep goes via flowing water & a mini forest . The view is mesmerizing .After Jeep ride  need to hike for 20 minutes  to reach the waterfall. The waterfall is a beautiful site . The water is clean & clear ,  can see colorful fishes.    Crowd is decent , life jackets are provided at a minimal cost. Can swim and have fun."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,True_Traveller_mons,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Dudhsagar waterfall trip,"Travel options: Railways, jeep, bike, trekking etc. nearby airports, Goa and Belgaum.Time of the year to visit: best- July-Sept (monsoon when waterfall is at its best.) Nov-Dec (not so hot, will suggest trekking, less crowded).My mostly unplanned journey start from Pune by Indian railways to Belgaum, bike trip to Khanapur from Belgaum, rest and breakfast and travel by bike to Castle rock and then on goods train or by trail to Dudhsagar.The story: Was suggested to travel by train as it is the easiest and safe medium, we preferred to travel on a bike till Castle rock railway station and then boarded a goods train at 2:30 PM. reached Dudhsagar by 5 PM IST. Always plan your trip with water and food as this place does not have much in this regard. You will love the experience and place for sure.do visit to feel the experience as watching virtually does not help much. There is a trail to top and bottom of the fall, please explore. Leave before Dusk via any means for your safety. Once the darkness falls, there is hardly any option to relax as there will be no people around. Due to unplanned trip, we took it lightly. There was a time when everyone left and we were only remaining in the wonderful location. Place was so quiet, fresh breeze and away from city life. We enquired earlier about the last train which we have already missed as we reached late. There was no train during the night that will stop at this place. We either had option to walk till castle rock and that will take at least 3-4 hours on railway track but that was not feasible as the journey is all through jungle, other option was to walk till Sonalium railway station (not for passenger, only goods train stop in case of some technical help required) which is located 3 kms from Dudhsagar. We preferred the shortest route, by that time it was almost dark and nothing was visible from the railway track. Fortunately, we had out mobile flash light to move forward. It took us around 80-95 mins to reach Sonalium station. On the way walking we heard various sound of animals and that gave us Goosebumps and one scary feeling, this experience cannot be explained via words only. That was our hope to reach alive and without any faceoff with the jungle, fortunately there were some railway employee who suggested to wait for couple of hours to board another goods train (requesting the driver) that will drop us to Kulem station (towards Goa) from where we can get some passenger train to reach Castle rock. We finally reached castle rock station by 2 am and slept empty stomach in waiting room to wake up early, take the bike and leave for Belgaum. Over all journeys was more than adventurous due to unplanned trip. Writing this almost after 18 months, but having each and every experience alive and living at the moment. Next trip will be to reach the top from where the waterfall starts. Do comment your experience as well."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Dinesh Sale,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Solo,Fish Curry Rice at Rushita Resturant (But it's a home),"Many people will speak about water fall and their experience. But I am going to highlight one food place I.e ""Rushita Restaurant"", it is not a restaurant by the way. It is a home where the family serves delicious fish curry rice with good taste and love.It is just before Ticket Counter junction. One of my goa friend said me ""Goa - Go Local"" thanks to him. The goa style fish curry is what you have to try. They served me good fish meal at the time I felt the urge of having good food. The moment I returned from water fall, there are no proper meal places so I enquired locals and found this place. When you visit sudh Sagar, do taste ""Rushita Resturant's"" fish curry rice, and show some love to locals. Thanks Dinesh 9959771673"
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Namishka M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Family,Insufficient time given to spend at the falls,"Once you get to the location is nearly takes 40 minutes(if online booking is done) to get to a location where the cars can no longer access the place. The drivers give you one and a half hour to go to the falls and return, additional time=additional charges. The timing given is useless cause it takes 30 to walk to the falls and 30 minutes to return, I hardly got to spend time at the falls. Its a lot of time and money wasted for a place where you get to spend hardly 20 mins."

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,shruti apte,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,natures beauty,its a must visit place for sure. it has a beautiful scenery. the best part is the waterfall has all the 12 month fresh water 24/7.  its a indeed natures beauty.  the huge span of this waterfall makes you feel the energy and the strength  of the nature.we went into the water for swimming under this waterfall.there is a railway track right between the waterfall and we were very fortunate to have a look at a goods train which passed by the time we were there.the drive and the travelling experience was wonderful. and a bit adventurous as you have to travel through dense forest and cross the waterfall water 2-3 times. i would suggest NOT  to take older people with you for this trip.  jeeps are there to take yo from main road till the waterfall. these rides are a bit expensive.  ALSO BE AWARE OF THE PARKING CHARGES IF YOU ARE GOING THERE BY YOUR OWN CAR.you have to take the jeep and travel its compulsory. do not eat full and travel as the ride is from the forest rout there is no tar road . the road is full of mud and stones and naturally  created.we saw mongoose and peacock on our way.there are 2 temples on the way to the waterfall. if you are interested do visit them for sure. we visited these temple. people living around have faith in these temples as its a dense forest which may have wild life animals to face or any other crises. one of the temple is of the protector of this area ( forest and waterfall) they call him DHUDHSAGAR AJOBA. ( grandfather).for youngsters its a must visit even  it is a bit expensive.
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Ritu89,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Family,Not dudhsagar- disaster,"Hi there,I am actually writing this review as I sit in the jeep on the way towards the dudhsagar waterfalls and I am not just disappointed but appalled at the way my family & I have been treated. We read about the waterfalls online and left only to reach the point beyond which private cars are not allowed. Jeeps are meant to be booked. The line was more than one hour. People were all on top of each other pushing and shoving. No COVID restrictions nothing. With elder members of the family we stood in the line and finally after painstaking efforts managed to get a jeep. Once we reached ten minutes up at the forest department entrance, we were asked to wait until they finish their lunch which meant another forty mins wait in the hot sun with no food. The restaurants are filthy and unhygienic and no organisation. I visit goa twice a year because I love this place so much and bring my friends and family as well. I never expected such an experience. Authorities need to check in on conditions here urgently. People are unhelpful, unorganised and rude here . Very disappointed"
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Jimit S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,Not worth the travelling and expense.,Highly over-rated and expensive when compared to the experience. Not worth at all. I went there with my wife and 3 kids. Travelling to Jeep hire location takes a couple of hours.  Then we need to hire a jeep to take us to the falls which takes approx 45 mins.  From there it is another 15 mins walk. We travelled nearly 3 hours one way to spend 1.5 hours at the falls including 20 to 30 mins walk. The driver was really rude. Also the charges for the jeep is Rs.3500/- which is very expensive. If you go sharing it is Rs.700/- per person.  Then you have to pay Rs.50 per person for compulsory life jacket. The entire trip cost me Rs.7000/- and entire day. The falls are beautiful but not worth to spend so much money and travel.
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Eber Shibin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2020 • Couples,Must Go In Monsoon,"A very challenging trek that goes through a railway track stretch and through the jungles. It is 14 km one way commencing from Collem station. We went during September, the prime time of visit to Dudhsagar. Had to cross some streams in the middle on the way which made for a extremely adventurous experience. While the jeep trip can help you save time, going by foot is the more enjoyable thing to do. "
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Vicky_The_explorer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Monsoon Magic @ Dudhsagar,"Dudhsagar Falls (sea of milk) is a magnificent waterfall located in the Indian state of Goa. It is amongst India's tallest waterfalls with a height of 310 m . It is also on the railway track of Konkan Railways and while on train you can watch the amazing nature passing by. We Recommend -  Monsoon sessions brings with it rains, beautiful waterfalls, greenery and adventure across the Western Ghats of India sub continent.  If you are in Mumbai, take a day train to Goa and enjoy not only this waterfall but many such nature created beauties on the way to Goa. You can also enjoy the scenes while on road and would like to keep coming back in this session. We have been there multiple times and just cant stop taking the train or on road trip next monsoons.Bollywood (Indian movie) – Chennai Express scene’s were shot with Dudhsagar waterfalls as background. Movie had super star actors Sharukh and Deepika in lead roles More Details about the location Distance from Major Milestones (approx.)• 60-65 km from Panjim  |  • 45 km from MudgaonHow to reach?• By Road: Private Taxis will drop you near the entrance of Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary which lies within the boundary of a village called Mollem on Goa- Karnataka Border. From Mollem, Official Management’s Jeeps take you to the fall on chargeable basis as Per Person Charges: Rs. 500 for Jeep Ticket + Rs. 80-100 Miscellaneous charges (for mandatory life jacket, Forest Entry, camera etc.) i.e. Rs. 600 per person.By Train: Strictly Suggested for Trekking enthusiasts only. There is no direct train for Waterfalls but nearest railways stations are Kulem & Castle Rock station from where one can trek to falls. People accompanied with families/aged persons may refrain from using this option.Best time to Visit:While Monsoon as the most amazing views, its also the most dangerous, hence anytime other than monsoons (between October to March) is best to visit •	Visiting the Dudhsagar waterfalls takes around the whole day. It takes one hour for Jeep to reach Falls (one side) from Mollem. Once you reach the destination, you are given 1.5 hours to enjoy at the waterfall before heading back to Mollem.•	Online Booking of Tickets for Dudhsagar Falls is now available. Checkout Goa Tourism website for details & avoid long queues during peak season.•	Do carry your swimsuits with you so as to enjoy the waterfall to the fullest while the Indian Railways whistles & crosses over the bridge right above your torso.•	Though food & water are very much available near the Jeep ticket counter however no such facility is available after that. So, make sure you don’t board the jeep with empty tummy. As for Toilets, yes, the portable types are there at one location after you reach the Falls but still, they are good for Nature’s short call only and hence tourists are advised to use washrooms near jeep ticket counters at Mollem.•	The ride on jeeps is also an adventure in itself and is somewhat bumpy, so people with back aches & those with infants need to be little careful.•	Beware of the monkeys at the entrance of falls (where the jeep will drop you). While they don’t seem to harm anyone but still as a precaution, take good care of your belongings especially food & spectacles."

We had to wait about an hour, while our driver sorted out the jeep & life jackets for us. The jeep ride was very bumpy but enjoyable. The walk to the waterfall took about 15 minutes. It involved crossing rocks and would be difficult for anyone with reduced mobility. The water was very cold.  It is worth the trip."

Go early morning to avoid yourself from tanning and must wear the life jackets before entering in the water. Will also get the the experience of bumpy and beautiful jungle ride which is managed by the forestry department. We found it well worth the time.
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Curious785091,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Nice place to get in the water,Get your tickets on line at least a day before you go.  The ride will be with a total of 8 people - 1 driver and 7 passengers - so be prepared to get to know your neighbor on the bumpy ride to the falls.  You can't help but giggle through it - you're bounced around so much!

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Philip T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Dudhsagar Falls,Goa","This place is over-rated and overcrowded - 150 jeeps of 6 people at a time. 20 minutes jeep ride, 60 minutes only at the falls, and 15 minute walk to get to the pool area.

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,TP Chandran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Honesty at it's peak,"Go early morning. There is Queue for Jeep booking to dudh Sagar. Saw ladies handling the counter. Women empowerment. It's compulsory to have life jackets. available at the counter. Took Jeep no. 86 to dudh Sagar.GA 12 T 0448 driver by Shiva. The ride was exciting but bumpy. We have have to pay entry fee to the Forest department. They check for plastic bottles. Tag it and check out when we come back. Due to the bumpy ride, the purse kept on my lap fell done inside the Jeep. On my return to the hotel realized that I lost my purse. Contacted the Jeep counter, got the no of driver Shiva. Called him told to check the Jeep. He called back in a few minutes that he got it.said all drivers in Goa are like this. You will get back your stuff. Hat's off to customer centric approach. Goa tourism will delevop with such kind deeds."

You can even drink it's water"
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Padam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Good waterfall.. No health & safety ! ,"Dudhsagar falls is a full day affair from Goa.First thing to note is that tickets are sold over the counter and its a queue process. Ticket counter is run by women so women empowerment was food to see. Reached early by 8:00 and queued up . counter opens and we were allocated tickets. We took a full safari jeep. Jeep & jeep driver were allocated at ticket counter and jeep driver took us to jeep. We were then asked to rent out life jackets from adjoining counter, smooth process no issues. Jeep then took us to safari which essentially is a rough and bumpy ride through the wild.We approached entry gate of Reserve area and jeeps queued up for entry permit. We got down and clicked some pictures and flexed our muscles.After about 1 hour + driving .. Upon reaching parking lot of Dudhsagar falls, Jeep parked and we were on foot. A good 20 minutes trek to falls.The trek is honestly a health & safety hazard. I mean on the rocks near falls it is so slippery and risky that God only knows how people make it through. Anyways - good experience seeing the fall, would not say best/smooth experience and yet one thing ticked off the list during visit to Goa. "
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,David W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Beautiful place!,"Well worth the time!This took us around 1.5 hours by taxi to get to from Benaulim, and the  around 45 minutes in a 4x4 to get to the waterfall (then the same back obviously).We found it well worth the time! The walk up through the jungle is beautiful and gives views of the waterfall and surrounding area along with the wildlife. Lots if monkeys to be seen!Tou can hire your own driver and 4x4 for 3500 rupees or tou can opt to wait for other people. We waited for others and it took less than 5 minutes and cost us 550 rupees each. There is then a 50 rupee pp cost to get in the forest and 40 rupees pp for life jacket hire (mandatory). So all in about 650 covers you. You will  need ID or your taxis ID nber in order to go!The water is freezing but once your in it's a great way to enjoy the waterfall!"
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Astrida Mascarenhas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Dudhsagar waterfall,"i visited Waterfall on 30th January 2020. A feast of our lady of Dudhsagar. The railway workers conduct this feast every year along with mass and then serve food for the people. Most of the people around the world doesn't know about it, the near by places people to Dudhsagar come and celebrate this feast and i was the one to attend the same with my family this year for the second time. It's the only day which train stops at Dudhsagar to drop the people. After the feast we went to Dudhsagar waterfall, which is totally astonishing, we can go on the top of the train bridge and top of the Waterfall where ( chennai express film was shoot) After visiting Waterfall we came home by train engine, my experience was amazing. You can't take any meat or alcohol there, only veg is eaten, have tibbe careful at the water if you are having bath. Totally worth, one of the best Waterfall in the world in goa."

The falls is majestic at a awesome height and train passes on the cliff between the upper and lower portion of the falls . The falls ends in a deep large pool of water and you need to swim a 100 meters to reach it , but you can also enjoy in the pool . A maximum of 1 and half hours is allowed and return by the same jeep , another 1 hour drive of 15 km and another 1 hour to Goa"
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Wolves woman,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Avoid toilets onsite,Really nice day out .. 2.5 hour wait to get a seat on one of the many 4x4 so if you can book online or get there extra early it would be ideal.Really good fun in the 60 min 4x4 trip up to see waterfall be ready to be shook about.Lovely pretty waterfall and monkeys are very cheeky and into everything.If you can try and use toilets before you get into jeep as the ones onsite are a human hazard .. my husband used and he wasn’t very well after.Other than that it’s a nice day out. 
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Bhav B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Great Nature spot but has its issues,"We hired a self-drive car to get here and then paid 100 Rupees to park securely. It is best to arrive when we did which is pre 10 am so that you get tickets and entry quick as lines can get busy and long waiting times for Jeeps. Overall it's an amazing place like the drive to the spot itself is a 20-minute jeep safari through mud and water. You can make a day out of it. Lots of time to take photos and enjoy the waterfalls.However...You would have thought that generating such income from tourists they would invest in better road structure. For example, if you had poor back posture or bone structure 9/10 you would get hurt in the Jeep trail as there is just bump after bump after bump. In addition to adding to the fact that the public toilets on the walk to the falls are disgusting beyond basic cleanliness. Everyone is given a life jacket to wear yet nobody follows the rules and simply swim without jackets and take photos in unsafe locations, we even witnessed a child wanting a photo and get swept away in the water because they did not abide by the rules. If you are a woman beware that if you're in a swimming costume the men will obviously stare but it gets to a point where it's uncomfortable and creepy.Overall a good day out but there are many issues with this overcrowded tourist spot with zero regulations enforced."

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Biswadeep M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Nice clean water,"Road to Dudhsagar falls is one hell of a ride in a bolero car. They charge 3500  per jeep, suitable for 7 people. Incase you are traveling alone or with few members you can share your jeep with others. Also, you need to pay 40rs for life jacket and 100rs entry fee per person for the trip. It's a 40mins travel to Dudhsagar falls. From the parking lot it's another 10-15mins walk. Not suitable for older people. I decided to swim, I'm quite satisfied with my decision. No restaurant near the falls so carry food if needed. "
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Rhituparna,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Beautiful but a pain to get there,"You cannot get to the falls in your own vehicle. There are cars which will take you there and for tickets for the cars you will need to stand in a long queue. Please carry cash with you because in our case, they did not accept credit cards or paytm. The queue was long. It took us one and a half hour. I ran hither thither in search of an atm and none of the atms worked. The people at the ticket counter are rude to the core. We had to wait for some friends of ours, but they did not even explain to us what and why we can’t wait. They just yelled at us and said, every car waits for just 5 minutes after you get the tickets and then you need to board the car immediately. The heat, the queue, the rude ticket counter folks were enough to make my mood off. Most of the cars were cars by mahendra. The last car to go the falls was at around 4 pm. So if you have to visit the place, try to reach as early as possible. We reached the place at around 12:30 pm and hence things were troublesome. After a long, tiresome wait, we finally git a car. One car carries 7 people.The ride to the falls was merry. The cars drive through rough terrain and tiny streams. Then they drop you and you need to walk on a stony path with tiny streams and bridges to reach the falls. From the parking, it is around 20 minutes walk to the falls. Ensure you wear proper footwear which are not slippery and can be drenched in water. The cars wait for you while you can spend around 1 hour approx in the falls or maybe 45 mins. I forgot the exact time. Then they bring you back. The waterfalls is certainly beautiful. You can get drenched and play in the water, however, be careful. The path is full of stones and if you are not comfortable walking in such stony slippery paths then this is not the place for you. However, for adventure lovers, this place is a must visit."

Approximately 4 kms on the railway track follwed by through the forest and streams. Best done in the monsoon. You will be drenched, in September, we found no leeches though almost all blogs warned us of leeches, there is no food, so carry your own stock. There is one point where water can be refilled.One must also keep a day to visit the Mollem National park."

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Meet,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,"Crowdy but must if you visit Goa.Date of visiting-29 Dec 19","Try to reach before 1000 to avoid crowd, as after 11 am. chances of getting jeep tickets is very less. You can take Vasco-Kulem passenger train from Madgaao also in morning to save a lot of bucks and time. Try online booking of jeeps one or two days before at dudhsgaronline site or Be patient in queue for tickets for atleast 1 & half hour. Carry 1 photo Id with you for jeep tickets. ₹ 500 for one person above 4 years of age. 7 persons are allowed in jeep and they will adjust pessangers accordingly in other keeps if u r less or more than 7. U can hire jeep in 3500 bucks if u need personal space or comfort. Other ₹90 would be charged for life jacket & forest entry fees. U can pay only for life jacket for kids around 3 yrs(if they luv water sports). Ride in jeep is bumpy and is for around 1 hr. U will get 1hr 30 mins after getting off from Jeepto enjoy falls. Go straight to main waterfall point as u wud be tempted for selfies and all in path. Nice cool water falling straight from rocks makes a nice swimming pool alongwith beautiful fishes. Lifejackets makes swimming easy and effortless. Try to get fruits, eatables with u, as everything is overpriced near ticket counter. For lunch Rushita homemade food restaurant near Church is best option if u wanna try goan delicacies made by mother alikes (they made Veg food on request for us also). In short, a lot of patience is needed to reach there, but it's worth when u get into the water."

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,drunkenmadman,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Big septic tank,After a nice taxi ride to the place to get tickets our taxi driver got the tickets for us no need to stand in a que for them we got in this jeep and we’re hurtled over the roughest ground for nearly 11 kilometres 10.8 to be exact.  when we entered the park if we had water bottles or any plastic bottles they wrote the jeep number on it so if you didn’t dispose of it correctly it would come back to the jeep owner. We thought this was a good thing they were doing for the environment. We got to the falls and had a 20 minute walk to get to the bottom of them up and over big rocks not safe a tall when we got there our guide said you must come swim we politely declined and I said to my girlfriend I’m not getting in that pool of p#€s. There were hundreds of people there we decided to move away from the main septic tank area and move back up the path to the septic tank run of and dipped our feet in the p#€s running of I wasn’t to concerned as the waster was cold and couldn’t feel any hot p#€s. The place was full of rubbish plastic bottles and worst of all people were taking nappies of kids and just leaving them lying beside them while they took photos of themselves smiling and bathing in p#€s most with all there clothes on there was also a nappy nest in between 2 rocks in a small dried up pool where people had thought this must be the nappy bucket. People would just have a sh#te where they were and cover it up with a piece of newspaper. So if you like septic tanks and like bathing in them don’t let me put you of. Such a nice place destroyed by filthy people. I’ve spent better days with the toothache. Before I submitted this review I had to give it one circle I wouldn’t give it any or send my worst enemy here
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Hypat1a,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Filthy and Overcroded,"The entrance was chaotic with a long wait before being stuffed into jeeps for the 30 minute 'safari'. The bumpy dirt track was basically a traffic jam with absolutely no chance of seeing any wildlife. No stopping was allowed for photos, our 'guide' helfully pointed to  a ""river"" and ""train"" and when i asked a question about wildlife said it was too noisy to talk. He still demanded a trip and despite a reasonable one given gave us a scowl and no thanks. Upon arrival we had to clamber on loose rocks with crowds of people to the waterfall. Many people were slipping, it is extremely dangerous. At the waterfall, which to be honest is not particularly beautiful with a dirty old railway bridge crossing in front of it, we were amongst hundreds of people jostling for a place to swim. I recognise that different cultures look at the environment in different ways which may explain so many positive reviews. I was appalled....dirty nappies, plastic bottles, rubbish and even human excrement...nothing would have got me in that water. Shamefull abuse of the environment. If you value cleanliness and appreciate nature ease don't waste your day visiting this rubbish dump and insult to the environment. To make matters worse we were offered an elephant ride near by. Love Goa but will now stick to the beaches."

A must place for visit. I visited on 25th Nov. 2019. Reach Kulem (Collem) in Goa by road or train as per your convenience. 1)	Train Options:Two trains from Pune to Kulem.

Jeeps are the only mode of transport at Kulem to travel to Dudhsagar Waterfall. Dudhsagar Tour Operators Association (DTOA) office is at 300 meter from Kulem railway station as well as bus stand. Walk of 3 to 5 minutes. I have attached photo of DTOA.Ample parking space near to DTOA office.Specific Helpful Information & Tips Are Given Below:If you plan to take bath under waterfall or swim in water, then please wear short & banian type T shirt or swimming costume and arrive at DTOA counter. Also carry towel & extra pair of clothes. A)	DTOA Season:  		Open: October to May.		Closed: June to September. There are trek agencies in Pune who organizes Dudhsagar tour during June to September.

You will receive sms & email confirmation of your booking. I have attached photo of the rules & regulations board at the DTOA office. Do have a look at it. It also contains the website address for online booking. NB: Even if you have online booking confirmation, you still have to be in the queue as each & every visitor is allowed to board jeep in a sequence thru queue. D)	Booking System:DTOA counter opens at 8 am. Surprising Sight: 	Visitors in queue from 6.30 or 7 or 7.30 am. Online booking visitors has to produce original sms or email confirmation.Only one person from the group has to be in the queue with valid photo ID card.Pay the jeep fare for all your members. DTOA staff will confirm your readiness to proceed immediately. Upon your confirmation, the staff will impart instructions related to tour. Only 7 visitors are allowed per jeep so staff will make the permutation & combination of 7 members from the visitors for each jeep.  Then the jeep driver will be called who will take you to the life jacket counter adjacent to DTOA counter. Pay the required money & take life jackets. It is a normal trend in India, for long queue only one counter will be there & not multiple counters. So standing in long queue will become a frustrating process during rush hours.NB: 1)	There is a sitting arrangement for ladies & kids next to the DTOA counter. Photo is attached.2)	There is a paid toilet facility not maintained well. Photo is attached.3)	There are small food snacks centers.4)	Very important thing: If you travel between 8 to 9 am, you save time. Otherwise once the Dudhsagar Waterfall parking area gets full then the jeeps are parked on the side of the narrow road for more than a half or one kilometer or more. In that case any jeep coming to Dudhsagar Waterfall doesn’t travel up to Dudhsagar Waterfall parking area instead it is parked after the last jeep on the side of road. From that point you have to start walking. So, you will lose more time to walk up to the Dudhsagar Waterfall. E)	Jeep System (More than 300 jeeps are there only for Dudhsagar Tour)Follow the driver to the jeep. One member will sit on the front seat next to driver, three members on the middle seat & three members on the rear seat.F)	Jeep Journey From Kulem (Collem) To Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area – 10 kmIt is 35 to 45 minutes very very very bumpy jeep ride thru an uneven graded narrow road with potholes as well as passing thru knee height water at 3 to 4 locations. Forest entry post is there at couple of minutes’ drive.  Pay the forest entry fee.PS: If you have mineral water bottle, show it at the forest entry post. Jeep driver will ask you on it. The forest entry post staff will write a number on the bottle with marker. The same bottle you have to show it on return. If you don’t show then fine of Rs.200. This practice is to keep control on use & throw type plastic water bottle pollution at Dudhsagar Waterfall.  G)	Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking AreaOn reaching Dudhsagar Waterfall parking area. You will find following things:1)	Washroom on the left2)	View point in front (Climb up to see the Dudhsagar Waterfall) – Photo is attached.3)	Change room box on left of view point – Photo is attachedH)	Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area To Dudhsagar WaterfallIt is a 15 minutes easy trek. Before starting the trek, note down the jeep number as you have to travel back by same jeep. The trek starts from right side descending road adjacent to view point. On route there are two more portable toilets not maintained well at some distance. Photo is attached.I)	Dudhsagar WaterfallTotal 90 minutes are allotted for visitors to spend & enjoy at Dudhsagar waterfall. It includes 15 minutes trek from Dudhsagar waterfall parking area to Dudhsagar waterfall & also includes 15 minutes return trek. So eventually, only 60 minutes to spend at actual Dudhsagar waterfall.J)	Dudhsagar Waterfall To Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking AreaOn returning to Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area, get into same jeep to travel back to Kulem (Collem). K)	Photos:  There are following locations for taking photos:1)	From view point at Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area2)	Dudhsagar waterfall parking area to Dudhsagar waterfall route3)	At Dudhsagar WaterfallPhotos attached in this review are tagged & described in an easy to understand way.L)	Restaurants At Kulem & Mollem:1)	A garden restaurant is located at only 15 meter distance from DTOA counter, opposite visitors car parking gate. Unlimited veg non veg buffet facility as well as ala carte. I have attached photo of it.Buffet cost is Rs. 250. If you have stayed at Jungle Book a night before or still occupying the room then Buffet cost for you will be Rs.200. 2)	The next best restaurant is at Dudhsagar Spa Resort in Mollem at 7 km from Kulem. It is after crossing Mollem on Arnod route. There is unlimited veg non veg buffet facility as well as ala carte. Buffet cost is Rs.350.3)	Parvati hotel at Mollem also has restaurant. 4)	There are few small ordinary restaurants in Kulem & Mollem.At night after 9 pm, Mollem is the place with options for food than Kulem.M)	Hotels For Accommodation At Kulem & Mollem:1)	Jungle Book is the best accommodation at Kulem. Very unique first of its kind construction. Has 70 rooms. We stayed at Jungle Book, the room rent was Rs.1500. It is a very very peaceful place near to river.2)	Room rent at Dudhsagar Spa Resort was also 1500. I didn’t like the room layout – open bathroom & toilet in the one room hall with wall partition of 7 feet height in between & open from top & front side. There were curtain for bathroom & toilet in place of door in front. Very strange system I saw for first time in my life. 3)	Roshan Hotel on Kulem to Mollem route is Rs.1500. Rooms were average.4)	Parvati Hotel at Mollem will be in the range of Rs.800 to 1000, I guess. Couldn’t get a chance to see room as staff was not there.NB: The moment you start leaving the hotel they show willingness to reduce price. I experienced this at above hotels as well as other hotels in Goa. Means, you can negotiate.N)	Car Parking At Kulem (Collem):It is available at 20 meter distance from DTOA. I didn’t see any body collecting parking fee during my visit. It is opposite garden restaurant gate or Jungle Book entry gate. Means, car parking is between the gate of garden restaurant on one side & the gate of Jungle Book on the other side.Photo of parking area is attached. O)	Brief Summary Of Our Dudhsagar Tour By Car:1)	Pune to Kulem Journey By Road Via KhanapurWe started at 9.00 am on 24th Nov 2019 from Pune Bibvewadi using Pune to Kolhapur to Belgaum to Khanapur to Mollem to Kulem route. Reached Khanapur at 6.30 pm. It was already dark.Four toll post in Maharashtra from Pune to Kolhapur. One toll post in Karnataka from Kolhapur to Belgaum. We had breakfast in Maharashtra & lunch in Karnataka. On road there are plenty of good restaurant options for food.2)	 Very Important Information On Route After Khanapur To Mollem.I cross checked with one of the shop owner for route from Khanapur to Dudhsagar (Kulem). It was with shock I got to know from the shop owner that there are two forest check toll post on Khanapur to Kulem route & they don't allow any vehicle to pass through after 6 pm as it is a route thru dense forest. I asked for alternative route or solution on it, to which he gave following options:i) Spent night at Khanapur & proceed early morning as per your planned route ORii) Go via Castle Rock, the distance will be more than 30 km ORiii) If you wish to travel now itself as per your planned route & thru the two forest check post then take a chance & follow these instructions:First forest check post is at couple of minutes drive. If they stop, tell them you are going to Hemmadaga. If they don't allow, then return back & decide on above 2 options. If they allow then proceed & there is high probability that second forest check post will also allow.Second forest check post is at little more distance not much.If they stop, tell them you are going to Paali. If they allow, then you are thru to Kulem.We prepared for the forest check post tests as advised by the Khanapur shop owner & started our journey in dark thru the dense forest with narrow road.On route we were in dilemma if the check post asks further questions on Hemmadaga or Paali then what should we answer. We were totally unprepared for it. On reaching first forest check post, we told we are going to Hemmadaga & he allowed us.On reaching second forest check post, we told we are going to Paali. The staff on duty asked for the identity card & car registration number. He entered it in his register & allowed us.NB: If you are planning by car thru the route we followed & if you have girls & womens from your family then try to reach 1st forest check post before 5.30 pm. Road thru the dense forest feels like isolated road with hardly any vehicles that will make a bit scary experience for them. If you reach after 6 pm, then use the Hemmadaga & Paali formula.The best things:The formula of Hemmadaga & Paali worked wonder for us.Narrow road thru dense forest was in a good condition.Google map was working in offline mode on forest route without network connection.Google map did showed & guided us accurately from Pune Bibvewadi to Kulem.We used to cross check with the locals when required to ensure we were on the right route.3)	Mollem to Kulem:After crossing the forest route passing thru Hemmadaga & Anmod, we reached Mollem a small village at 8.30 pm.Dudhsagar Spa Resort is located on left side of road 500 meters before Mollem. We came back to this resort from Mollem to have dinner.After dinner proceeded to Kulem via Mollem.There is a petrol pump on left side at Mollem junction. Took left turn after petrol pump & proceeded straight to Kulem. It is at 6 km from Mollem junction.Took room in Jungle Book at Kulem for night stay.4)	Dudhsagar Tour On 25th Nov 2019Went to DTOA counter at 7.30 am. We were surprised to see visitors already in queue. Our turn came at 8.30 am. Completed the required payment formalities of jeep travel & life jacket. Following was our total itinerary of Dudhsagar Tour:8.45 am to 9.15 am: 	Travel by jeep from DTOA at Kulem to Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area9.15 am to 9.30 am: 	Walk from Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area to Dudhsagar Waterfall9.30 am to 10.30 am: 	Spent time & enjoyed at Dudhsagar Waterfall10.30 am to 10.45 am:	Walk from Dudhsagar Waterfall to Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area10.45 am to 11.45 am: 	Travel by jeep from Dudhsagar Waterfall Parking Area to DTOA at Kulem12.30 pm to 1 pm:	We had buffet lunch at garden restaurant opposite car parking areaAfter lunch, we proceeded to Mangeshi Temple & Shanti Durga Temple in Goa.P)	Nearby Places To See:Tambdi Surla Mahadev temple at Surla is a picturesque green spot to be visited.

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Steve,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Well worth seeing if you are fit and healthy,"I visited on the 11th November 2019 as part of a tour arranged through Tui.Okay, first things first! If you have back or neck problems, aren't particularly mobile or suffer from motion sickness then this tour definitely isn't for you. That's because to get to the falls you are driven over some extremely rough terrain. You get thrown around the jeep, sometimes quite badly when you hit potholes. At the end of the journey to the falls you then have to walk over some more challenging terrain, clambering over rocks and through small streams. However, the end result is breathtaking!You begin the adventure in a small town (the name of which I can't remember). There you have to wait until a four wheeled drive jeep to become available and it's your turn. Beware: this can take over two hours in the blazing sun before your number is called! Even as part of an organised trip I had to wait over an hour.Once in your jeep you join a convoy into the park itself. As I've written above, the journey to the falls isn't for the faint hearted, so beware! Along the way, though, you get to see monkeys (you are encouraged not to buy bananas for the monkeys) and some spectacular views. You ford rivers and streams, so keep your belongs in your lap if you don't want them to get wet.The falls themselves are very beautiful but very crowded. Note: you won't be allowed into the falls area unless you are wearing a life preserver, which your driver will give you. That said, I saw lots of people simply take them off before they went to swim.So if you are fit and mobile and don't mind queuing in the sun then I'd definitely recommend adding this to your itinerary."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Richa G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Beautiful...in love with the place.,I visited this place in mid November. I mentioned the month as it is the most convenient time to visit the Falls. We got to the waterfall road by rented car after a long drive of 2 hrs.from north Goa. There they have parking facility. We parked our car at a parking cost of RS.100/- . From there we bought tickets of Bolero Safari. The Safari takes you to inside the forest in 45 min. After a 15 min tracking you get to the waterfall. It was just Amazing and worth visiting. They allow you to have bath in the fall and lake within it. Enjoyable place for kids too. 
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,trilok2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,dudhsagar,only 240 vehicle is allowed to go rest you can go by walk with guide. Life jacket is must to go in water in water fall. By trek is more adventures rather than by jeep.
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Martin_K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Good but busy ,"We booked through our tour operator and to be honest I would recommend that to everyone. You'll pay a bit more for it but there's no waiting for jeeps and no extra charges for life jackets etc. Be warned there is 20inr charge if you take a DSLR camera. It's an early start from your hotel but with a good guide they'll make the time pass. We had a short walk to change from coach to the jeep which was already waiting with the driver.  The jeep ride can very bumpy and I wouldn't recommend this trip to anyone with back or neck problems. The drive takes about 45 mins and theres is a bit of trekking to the waterfall itself. I'd recommend you have shoes for this as I saw people in flip flops struggling & even our guide had shoes on and he'd done it countless times. The waterfall basin edge is not that big, and is blocked by the selfie crowd who do not go in the water. You just have to push through. The water is cold but not freezing and the fish are mostly at the edge but move out of the way quickly. Getting in and out is difficult because of the crowds and slippery rocks. The waterfall itself is very pretty and if you haven't seen any or many then I can see why people rave about it, but if you're a traveller and have seen others then you may be a bit underwhelmed although theres not many you can swim in. Also forgot tot mention there is no toilet or changing room at the falls, and I didn't check but the toilet at the base are basic at best. Overall it's worth the trip but try and get there early as possible. "

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Themapwalaguy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Dudhsagar waterfalls,"3rd Oct 2019 I was having pleasant sleep in the hostel which i booked and the hostel inmates who beacme very good friend of mine came early in the morning to wake me up saying that ""hey lets go to Dudhsagar waaterfalls"".I gave them a cunning laugh and told them how it was very difficult to reach the place and its not a peice of cake to go there.a few weeks before this incident i already tried to go to the place but could only reach the base of the mountains as there were no jeeps or vehicles at that time of the day.so i actually made fun of these guys saying that no i wont come and you guys dont go as its difficult to reach.eventually i convinced myself to go along with them and then the journey began.i already knew that the base village or the railway station at the base was more than 90kilometres away.Dudhsagar waterfalls is almost 90kms from any beach in Goa as it is in the east end of Goa. One can either hire a cab to reach Kulem Village or just Rent a self Drive Vehicle.The Road is very beautifull to reach Kulem as it is filled with green tree covered roads and many backwater bridges as well as some valley roads.We were 10 people from the hostel and we went on rented scooters.We had local guy with us who was helping us in this journey as he had been there before.Two english girls,one danish woman and one Dutch guy who accompanied us i this tour.It was a good time driving to the place after a lot of heat and sun burn.Whenwe finally reached Kulem Railway station we came to know that the No vehicles go to the top area after 1:00 pm. We were helpless so we decided to take a trek route to the top.The total way hike is almost of 3 hours,which consist of 45 mins walk on the railway tracks and the remaining is the pure jungle walk.The way up is really beautiful but also tiring.The actual Waterfalls is very difficult to reach as it has some dangerous water crossings and the water level rises quickly as the river has huge stones which become slippery to walk on at some places.It is best to take a tour guide as the jungle walk is really confusing and there is place at Kulem railway station which has facilites to buy tickets and hire professional tour guides so that the locals dont scam you which is pretty common in Goa.I myself have bit of a water phobia myself so crossing the heavily flowing was also a task for me,we finally reached the place and wow what a magnificient look of nature,we took some skinny dips in the pond right beneath the waterfall.we couldnt stay for long as the rain came and the river water level can rise in seconds and its not safe to be there and also it was late in the evening and was already getting dark.i am glad that we didint come down all the way walking cause we would just be crawling after the hike.so what we did was we instead came down to a railway station which is start of a mid point of the trek and boarded and illiegal freight train.its dark in the middle of the night we are all dirty and sweaty and tired and hungry abd there we are in the middle of nowhere waiting for a train to come sitting on the tracks.it was afun experience actually and lot of adrenaline rush.Then we finally reached the base and then i remembered that i again have to drive home on a scooter in this chilling wheather and i was all drenched in the water even my shirt hadnt dried up.eventually i managed to drive home safely and then we all miss that day so much that people from differnt countries who didnt know each other in the beginning are now best of friends talk to each other daily like a familySome tips and Suggestion to Go to Dudhsagar waterfalls and get back ina day1.The place is almost 90kms away from City centre or Panjim city which is the capital of goa2.Try to hire a car and go cause you might get really tired when going for the trek and the returning home is also a big task.3.If you dont want to take the hike and walk all the way to the top the just reach the place befor 1:00 so that you can get a jeep all the way up to the falls area.4.Hire a good tour guide who can be helpful at all times you dont know what might go wrong.5.Go to the ticket counter of the spot and take a complete package which includes life jackets as well as the tour guide.6.Carry enough food and water or snacks as well as an extra pair of clothes for the swim.7.Make sure you are not bitten by any leech or mosquitos,due to the density of the huge forest there are various insects and animals."

Falls are about 10mins trek from the parking. Once you reach there the experience is simply exhilarating, definitely worth a visit."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,kuldeep s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Dudhsagar falls - A must visit In Goa,"Apart from ticket management and restroom facilities ,everything is just awesome. Ticket Management system is very poor, Token system starts early morning around 6am and ticket counter starts at 8am, tickets are being issued on the basis of token number. On the day of rush or weekends , if one is reaching around 9am, then one will be able to get the ticket around 2 pm. During all this waiting time , there are paid toilets available but these are in very poor condition.Fun starts once you get your tickets , a total of 7 persons go in one car or jeep to falls, these are government approved cars or jeep which goes for falls. Ticket price is 500 Rupees and 40 rupees for Life Jackets. 30 Rupees is being charged at the entrance of Jungle by government officials.One way journey is 45 mins , one can stay in falls for 1 and half an hour and afterwards again 45 mins back journey.The ride to falls is very bumpy and enjoyable. Falls view is really spectacular, one can enjoy natural beauty , water is very pure . One can enjoy bathing under falls !!Take some eatable and clothes with you if you want to take dip in falls, there are monkeys at falls entrance so keep your eatables safe in the bag from monkeys . Dudhsagar falls should not be missed when one in Goa for any nature lover "
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Kostubh Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"Beautiful fall, Adventurous ride, Jump in the water, Great experience, Must visit place","I visited Dudhsagar during October time along with my wide, 8 years old son and one more similar family. Started my travel from Bangalore on a Friday evening, took a night stay break at Davangere, started early at 6AM from there and reached at the parking / taxi stand by 11:30AM. Roads were good except a 17 kms bad patch.Hired a Jeep (Authorized only are allowed) in approx. Rs. 3000. Jeep ride was hilarious and bumpy. It takes you though muddy roads and crosses apprx. 1 foot deep river. It was an amazing experience. IT took around 1 hr for us to reach at the drop point from where we need to trek a bit to reach at the water fall.Life jackets and guards are available around the fall so that you can jump in to the v. refreshing water. Got to be careful about the current of water which may pull you towards the stream. Even kids can jump in using the life jackets. You can also go directly under the water and can stand on the stones around there.Note: There are no bathrooms to change cloths.During October time, the fall was not at its best but still decent amount of water was there.Check when is it open as it gets closed during the rainy season.I guess, visiting this place just post rainy season would be the best.As far as I know, there are no official trekking around this fall. People go to the bridge by hiring some locals but I did not take that chance with family. You may explore that.There is no official stop of the train which passes by this bridge. You need to track  on your own or take local scooter riders help. They are not authorized so just be careful.There are no shops post taxi stand.Note: Do not eat much before you start your jeep ride. Carry water.Overall: Great experience."

It is one of the best waterfall I have ever seen. You can visit dudhsagar by your own or you can book the package from Goa. I suggest you should book your tickets through any agency. So many tour operators are there in Goa for dudhsagar waterfall. It may take around 2.5 hours to 3 hours from goa to dudhsagar. your vehicle can go upto the entrace of the sanctuary, from there onwards you have to take jeep. If you have booked your trip through agency then he will take care of everything. otherwise you have to stay in a long line for safety jackets."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,hemant,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,WONDERFUL TRIP,"We were referred through a good friend to book our Water Sport Activities with Atlantis Water Sports. We visited their spacious office, the Executives were efficient, friendly and very cooperative explaining in detail, effortlessly, all the inclusions in each package. Finally, we opted for the Adventure boat Cruise around the Mandovi river and the whole experience was really good. We booked our boat tour for 10:00am and I highly recommend to have the boat trip in the morning or evening.  We found it inexpensive considering the safety measures taken and the concern shown to us by the coordinators.  It was really worth the over-all experience and the cake on the icing to our Goa trip. We would give Atlantis a thumbs up and a five star rating."

I had looked up the net vigorously to understand how the trip could be accomplished in the thick of monsoon. We met up at kulem station, our trains though coming from different directions, reached kulem at almost the same time. We had checked into dudhsagar resort and quickly readied ourself for the trek. Our guide Anwar met with us at the kulem station and we began our walk. The first four kms was on the track and then into the pristine mollem sanctuary, onto the Jeep road through the jungle. This was about 6 .5 kms and then through streams and rivulets of dudhsagar falls. On our return we headed to Sonaulim station and sat on the tracks for some engine or train to take us across to kulem.Riding onto the engine was another experience altogether. The engine driver stopped a km away from kulem and we walked to the station jeep parking. In all we walked 17 kms, with breathtaking views and beautiful thick forest. Carrying food was a wise thing because there was nothing available on this quiet road in the forest. It was an immensely gratifying trip"

It is between Kulem and Londa Junction railway station(According to train schedule QLM-Kulem Departure at 15:10pm and Arrival at 	LD- Londa junction at	17:43 pm--- 02hrs 30 mins of Ghat section) However train was running a bit late(Train was 11098 POORNA EXPRESS MAIL - I was travelling from Mangalore to Pune.) You can search for trains between stations using NTES website or app & book tickets on IRCTC website or app. Braganza Ghats are a stretch of hill section at the Goa – Karnataka border-This 26 km ghat section rail road connects coastal Goa to the hinterlands of Karnataka and other parts. The 26 km Braganza Ghat section starts from Castle rock in Karnataka and ends up at Kulem in Goa. Prior to the Konkan Railways this was the only way one could have reached Goa via rail.Both the uphill as well as the downhill trains have commercial halts at Castle Rock and Kulem which also serve as the stations for attachment and detachment of brakes. But, the trains do not have commercial halts at the three en route stations- Caranzol, Doodhsagar and Sonaulim.While descending the ghats, a train - whether passenger or freight - has to stop at all the 3 stations for mandatory brake tests; whereas, the uphill trains are not required to halt unless there is a crossing. .The Braganza Ghat Section is one of the toughest ghat sections in Indian Railways. The ruling gradient here is 1 in 37 which requires the use of bankers. "

Fortunately it was cloudy weather and May season did not heat up us as much as it could. The Pathway is so natural and very good. You will have to park your vehicle and then to take Mahindra Bolero to go inside. Each person costs around 300 and a mandatory 50 rupees for life Jacket. In summer season itself the water fall was good flowing. Our family members took bath in water fall as well. Overall it was a fun to be there.
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,danish a,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Amazing experience... Must visit..,One of the best unexplored place in Goa. Amazing Jeep ride in the lap of nature and the waterfall will mesmerize you with it's beauty. Safe to swim there but life jacket is a must. Only demerit that no changing rooms are there. So if u need to swim prepare itself accordingly.Jeep ride a little bit bumpy but amazing views. I went there with my wife and children. They were 7 and 3 years old. We all had a fun time and a great experience. Women may face problem in swimming as no changing rooms are there.Jeep ride will cost you 500 rs per person and 40rs for life jacket and 50rs for forest entrance fee. Once u reach the waterfall point you will get approx one and a half hour which is lesser time according to swim as I enjoyed swimming there. If u delay in coming u have to pay more as instructed by driver.Fall usually gets closed during monsoon. So kindly check before going there.Don't go there with unauthorized people. Take only Jeep ride which is authorised by govt. It's very safe. Do take water bottles and some snacks along with you as  you will not get anything at the waterfall point. Save your snacks from the monkeys.Have fun. It's A must visit place
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Debasmita M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,"All is good except for the crowd, and no changing room.","Our visit to Dudhsagar Falls was arranged by Fernandez travels. The picked us up at 6.40 from the road 5minutes walk from our hotel, in an A/C bus. The journey to Mahaveer National Park was for 2hours through a beautiful country side. We stopped at Basilica Bom Jesus for 20minutes though and then for breakfast again for half an hour.From Mollem we were transferred to the waterfall in a jeep. The ride was horrible for people sitting at the back as my husband had to endure. But it was pretty scenic. The jeeps drop you at a point 15-20 mins away from the main waterfall and you have to traverse that part on foot. The walk was pretty adventurous as the part near the main plunge pool was rocky. The only problem was that there were no changing rooms and it was difficult for women. The water fall has two Rapids as well and many who cannot make it to the main plunge pool were enjoying there. The main plunge pool has alot of fish and they bite.The main problem was the crowd. They were too rowdy and ill mannered. If I take that out then I would have given Dudhsagar a 5star."

The walk through the forest towards the waterfalls is great with plenty of interactions from the monkeys who will take food from your hand. When you reach the waterfall you are supposed to wear a life jacket whilst swimming, I didn't and nothing was said, although this is mainly directed towards the locals who are not great swimmers. A refreshing dip is most welcome in the heat and don't get alarmed with the big fish that are in the pool. The only disappointment is the ride up, crammed into a four wheel drive with little opportunity to see the views, an open top vehicle would be much better."

The Famous Dudhsagar Fall also located in the area which is a famous destination for domestic as well as international traveller. Dudhsagar fall use to be closed during rainy season because of security reasons of the travellers and also it is risky too when you are visiting during rain due to Heavy water flow. There is two way to reach #Dudhsagar one where you can go by Transportation and which is open with the government permit you have to apply that online to access the destination.

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Ashish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Natures masterpiece,"Well dudhsagar waterfalls was 2 hours drive from our hotel la casa in Siolim...It is situated on Mandovi river of Goa attached to Karnataka border...There is parking area where you need to park your vehicle as it is not possible to go inside dense forest with your car or scooty as the way is very messy with dense forests and shallow water rivers...They will take some parking charges nearly 30 rs then they will guide you to the centre where you will given live jackets...Charge per person is 500 rs with one id submitted....Then a jeep or sumo will carry you inside forest towards waterfalls....Amidst jungle you will be able to see cashewnut trees ,betel nuts,Mango and Jack fruits.....In forest entry also you will be charged 50 rs per person then 30 rs later if you have any photography camera...The jeeps deboards at a place and ask you to spend 1 hour there if extra waiting time then you will be charged separately...The place has washrooms...Then you need to walk downwards by climbing rocks, steep bridge across river and passing muddy area...Please walk carefully as the way  is not smooth you might fall by getting disbalanced....Once you reach waterfalls you will able to see Chennai express movie bridge...The water current was amazing and it was falling like milk but visuals are not that catchy as u see in movie but shallow pond beneath fall is awesome...You could see big and colorfull fishes swimming along with people.....They do not bite you, do not worry....If you are good at swimming then you can go till extreme point of hill from where waterfalls originate...But if you are not a good swimmer then do not go alone till the end even you wearing live jacket...It is pretty deep enough and huge water will exhaust you which will create problem in crossing river...Better you go with a good swimmer till end....You can take mild dips at the corner which is very refreshing and lovely experience....Girls beware of stranger boys who ask you to click pictures along with them as they try to get close...And step properly on the rocks because they are slippery which may cause minor injuries..Protect your mobile so that it may not fall in river...Be cautious otherwise about things which i stated above  you will love this site a lot...."

Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,joannacharris,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,bumpy trek,after a 40min bumpy 4x4 ride it was a rocky trek to the waterfall. flip flops not recommended the waterfall itself was nice but packedliterally hundreds of people all crammed inand the water is full of big catfish... not good if you have a fearthey limit the number of 4x4 that can come in per day but not how many at 1time
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,sky0fblue,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"Go early, it's so busy!","You'll need to hire your own taxi to get there, it's about 1hr 30 mins drive from Agonda.  And once you are there you need to queue for tickets for the 4x4 jeeps which take you on the 40 min BUMPY drive to the base of the waterfall from where it's just a few minutes walk. We arrived just as the ticket office opened at 0830 and there was already a queue and once we got to the lake at the foot of the falls it became unbearably busy very quickly. Nice to have a swim in the falls lake if you can muscle your way through the crush.  Suggest you get there early!"
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,FBirdi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,A must visit when in Goa!,"If you enjoy the outdoors, this is a must visit when in Goa. It starts as a 45 minute ride in the forest to the waterfall. You go with the jeeps through the water until you reach the drop off point. You are equipped with a life jacket. it takes about 15 minutes to trek to the waterfall. Please wear good shoes to ensure you don't slip. Do take a swimming costume unless you want to swim in your existing clothes and then change in a fresh pair. After the 15 minute walk, you reach the waterfall and you can swim if you like. It's a good day out.I do not recommend advance bookings because it's take even more time than those who have not booked."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Carl B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Not worth the drama,"First off, we visited in March which is at the end of the dry season so our expectations were low with regards to water flow. In all fairness, the waterfall was nice and the water flow was still quite impressive.That’s where the good news ends. This three hour trip was a mini test of character. In short, it was painful. We took a taxi as part of a private trip. Upon arrival we were to wait in line to get our tickets for the 4x4 trip to the waterfall. We then had to join a different que to get out compulsory life jacket (we later found out they were far from compulsory). After a very confusing and disorganised wait for our 4x4 (we had to wait for other groups to fill it) we were on our way. The trip takes abou5 40 minutes and it’s rough as hell. Not fun.We finally made it to the falls along with half of India and a third of Russia and every selfie stick ever manufactured. It was so packed and the swimming area isn’t exactly huge. We were told that we had 90 minutes there and to be back at the vehicle by 12:15 for the delightful return trip. We, no surprise, but one of the couples was late. We would have had to wait regardless for our 4x4 was blocked in by the other 50 or so parked up there.The return trip was much the same except for the added bonus of having to frequently stop for the new arrivals heading up along the one way road....genius All in all so not worth the time and energy, far from relaxing!A hint..... it looked to be getting quieter when we finished so maybe an arvo trip would be less painful."
Dudhsagar_Falls-Mollem_National_Park_South,Courtney O,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples, Very busy,We booked this trip to the waterfall expecting for it to be quiet and beautiful but instead found that we had to line up and wait for tickets and rent life jackets we did not need to travel in a Jeep for 35 mins on VERY rocky terrain. When we saw the number of the jeeps leaving to go we realised this was going to be anything but quiet... we figured there could be up to 500 jeeps averaging 6/7 passengers at any given time... so as you can imagine the waterfall it’s self was jam packed. The waterfallItself was beautiful but the size of the crowd ruined the experience. One bonus was feeding the monkeys on the way in and out... but would not go back.. I’m sure there are a lot quieter waterfalls elsewhere that could work out a lot more enjoyable.
