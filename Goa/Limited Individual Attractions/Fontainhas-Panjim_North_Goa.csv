Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Wandering Slipper,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023,A glimpse into the past,"Lovely to stroll through the windy little lanes that are supposed to be traffic free, but let’s remember this is India, and admire the architecture from bygone eras. Great to see that quite a few of these gems are in the midst of rehabilitation."
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,foodeatzers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Old Portuguese houses in Goa,It’s a residential area where people stay in Portuguese styled houses. It’s a great Portuguese architecture.One should visit this place!

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Sanjay B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Fontanas a walk through memory lanes amidst Churches and Latin homes,We took the old Goa (with Nora) and Fontanas (with Vaishnavi) The walking tour was well organised and informative with contextual references to the colonial past. It was detailed exposition to certain aspects of the Church architecture interspersed with local artists inputs. The shift of the admin to Panjim and the rise of the settlement there including the Latin style houses added to our understanding. It was an enriching day for us in Goa.
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,pratyush raj,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Dissapointed by locals,It looks beautiful to see.. till residents start shouting on visitors for clicking pics... Highly illogical... Advice for residents to colour their homes in one colour... People will stop coming... Problem solved..Very bad behaviour by locals
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,BJtravellernature,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Go if you have enough time,Pictures looks great there but dont think it is worth it as there is nothing to see. Just if you have time while visiting panjim you can go just for pictures. But if you are a person who has seen Italy's Burrano no point in going there and wasting time.
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Perfect J,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,Waste of time,what is there exactly to watch or experience.It's complete waste of time.Directly go to north Goa instead or visit the famous temple in that locality.
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,AGK,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Go there to get yelled at on the streets,We had gone to Panjim and specifically to the place to see how beautiful it is and to get some pictures as memories. The residents seem to be irritated with the fact that their house is being used as a prop for pictures. They yell at the tourists unceremoniously on the street. We did not like their behaviour. It’s better to avoid this place for the peace of mind.
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Ankita N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,Photoshopped pictures,"The pictures of fontainhas online are definitely old or photoshopped as the buildings have faded and look nondescript. It is a heritage site and has nice churches and restaurents, splendid architecture. Today I visited this place and they looked just like any other old buildings."

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Geeta M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Old worlde Latin charm,"Fontainhas, Goa's Latin Quarter, is a quaint, beautiful part of Panjim city.  Its lanes are flanked by vibrant, colourful Portuguese style villas with wrought iron balconies.  They are remnants of Portuguese colonial times.  The names of the lanes have links to important dates, eg.  Rua 31 de Janeira (31st January Road) is named after the day when Portugal got independence from Spain on January 31, 1640.  It is best to explore Fontainhas on foot, seeing rows of colourful houses and cottages, quaint bakeries, cafes  and art galleries dotting the area.  Some of the must visit spots in Fontainhas are St Sebastian Chapel, Afonso Guest House, Velha Goa Galleria (for hand painted azulejo tiles and ceramics), Peacock Steps, Joseph's Bar, Maruti Temple atop Altinho Hill.   Some of the famous places to eat in Fontainhas are Viva Panjim and Verandah Panjim Inn."

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Debabrata G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Different Experience,We had a few hours before heading out to the airport at Goa today. Fontainhas was highly recommended by a friend of ours. Truly nice setting - the houses and eateries very well maintained. I am told that they have been repainting the houses after every monsoon. There were a couple of really nice places to eat. A couple of ice cream parlours. The Gitanjali gallery was closed for some reason today - so we missed it. There is a walk which is organised - starts at 10 am and at 3:30 pm. Worth a visit.
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,MM0311,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Couples,Overhyped.. Visit only if in Panjim ,"We drove for an hour from Benaulim to Panjim to see Fontainhas and were disappointed. Its just a few streets with coloured houses - maybe if we had taken a conducted tour, we would have found it better, but as is, it was a waste of our time. Its also overrun by tourists taking pictures which is quite annoying. If you are in Panjim you can visit, otherwise dont bother. "

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Suyash T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Family,Travel sensibly,This used to be a beautiful place especially for photography and videos. But nowadays the residents are not very friendly and don’t allow cooking  photos and videos out side their walls. The bright coloured  walls give you an European experience but unfortunately you can’t shoot photos or videos wherever you like.Even though it’s a holiday destination and most people consider Goa and Panjim as vacation places. And the tourism industry is main source of income. I think people need to be sensible travellers if you are causing nuisance to residents they will be less friendly eventually.
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,deepak_misra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,See if you are in Panaji,This is a must see location if you are in Panaji. However this is not worth coming from far just to see this place. It might be better to take a curated tour with a guide else you will get saturated in a short time just seeing buildings. Buildings are very quaint.  Another alternative is to buy a map for that area and just walk up and down and see the buildings. This will take less than an hour.Remember that afternoons are terribly hot. However there are sufficient cafes and eating places around
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Cia Fernandes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Friends,Frozen in time! ,"A must visit place when in Panjim! The area is Peaceful, delightfully colourful, clean and green!

It’s interesting that many of the PortugueseHouses have either a rooster or a solider  on the roof. Charming cafes, beautiful homes, an art gallery, boutique heritage hotels, artefacts are what you’ll find here. You can get a guide who will be able to tell you the history of all the famous buildings or ramble around on your own and grab a coffee at one of the little cafés.

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Ramona Arena,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021 • Couples,A walk back in time,"I definitely recommend going on a sleepy lazy Sunday, around 4:30/5pm when the sun isn't too strong, the shops are shut and there's not too many people. It's a beautiful charming walk, through narrow lanes, old architecture and beautifully painted villas. You get a feel for what life must have been like in the Portuguese days. Definitely do go on a weekday too, and check out the cute boutique stores, quaint restaurants, cafes and guest houses. "

Visit this area if you want to experience a true feel of Portuguese houses and a small colony. Very serene and calm, the houses are beautifully built with a characteristic design and even the plates bearing the name and house numbers are in similar style and very typical of the set up. We visited the area in the afternoon and the chapel was closed. A very soothing experience roaming around the small alleys of a beautiful and small colony that takes you back into the medieval Portuguese era. Do visit this area to have a very calming and soothing experience. "

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Manasa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Footprints of the Portuguese ,"The best time to truly enjoy this gorgeous neighborhood would be after 4 PM. That way, the sun won’t be too harsh and the lighting would be ideal to take some amazing pictures. The Latin Quarter of Panjim is,truly, a beautiful example of the Portuguese footprint in India. I would suggest you start off this journey by visiting the Immaculate Conception Church first and then walk towards Fontainhas. Make sure that you have a good camera as the streets and the houses are absolutely picturesque and pretty. The quiet lanes, the colourful houses, and cute little stores makes you feel like you are traveling in Europe. If you get tired, you can take a small break at Viva Panjim which is literally nestled inside a quiet lane. There is also Marcou artifacts from where you can buy some lovely ceramics made by the local artists and if you are a book lover, do visit Singbal’s Book House which is one of the oldest bookstore in Goa."

Our guide Lata was very knowledgeable, eloquent and brimming with enthusiasm for the history. There was also a prearranged  meeting with a Goan singer who sang Fado and Goan songs.  The history of the Portugese involvement in Goa over 450 years was explained very clearly by our guide.  The walk also included a visit to bakery where Goan specialities were tried.  My partner and I can highly recommend this walk,  and the presentation was excellent. The walk was by Make my trip"

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,ShvRm_Traveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Old quarter of Panaji,"This is literally the old quarter of Panaji city, where the old buildings from the Portuguese era have been preserved in their original condition. Almost all the buildings are in use as houses, business establishments and schools. Few new constructions have also come up in between.Since there has been no redevelopment in the area, the roads have remained very narrow, which were laid to take care of the traffic, when there were hardly any vehicles on the road. In today's time, however, the roads are usually crowded. Parking is also not easily available in the area. So it is advisable for visitors to walk through this area. Fontainhas is walking distance from Panaji Bus Stand.The area gets its name from a natural Fresh Water Stream located in the area."

And few are being reconstructed.But the best part is that here you would still find the Goan flavour, Goan Culture, people their dressing style ones which you wanna see and learn from.Here you would imagine yourself into some wall paint advertisement as they are all different green blue yellow and other shades.In short when in Goa please remove time to visit here, it’s totally worth if you are in Goa for pictures for social media then this area will give u loads of pics trust me, just visit place you won’t regret."

It was all downhill up to the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The lanes were quiet, a few residents were up and about shopping for groceries, setting off for the day in their scooters. We continued walking for an hour after, through the bylines of some of the most beautiful Portuguese architecture. Many of the old home are preserved and lived in today, some have become cafes, most ideal to get your morning coffee over a croissant. Blue, green, terracotta maroon, and ochre walls, will iron grill work and little balconies. And little grades and gotten plants everywhere. There was even a large well in a small cup de sac, next to which was an ochre home, with an octogenarian reading the morning newspaper on his porch.   The second time we visited, we decided that we needed to know more of the history behind this charming area. Make it Happen conducts lovely walking tours, and we went along with a group of visitors over 3 hours, admiring, listening to the history of the area and even visiting an old Goan's lovely vintage home. There are bakeries, art galleries, chapels that surprise you round a corner. Just... go. :)"

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Krittika M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Your next color palette!,"Where do I even start? Fontainhas is beautiful. Where else will you find a street that has a blue, red and yellow house next to each other and all of them match each other? I would recommend everyone to put on their walking shoes and hit the area in the evening and just walk around soaking in the sights. Most of the houses were built in the later 1800's and 1900's and have beautiful pastel colors. Every fourth house has a vespa parked outside. Just be careful, the locals do not have any patience for tourists standing on the streets clicking pictures. While you're there, you can hit Mamarama for some good authentic Ramen followed by Tito's for a good drink. Also remember that most stores in Panjim close around 7 so if you wanted to get some shopping done, you should do it before you hit the Latin Quarters."
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Glenn P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Portuguese influence architecture,Fontainhas is a very colourful and the oldest Latin quarter. It is a residential area.Tourist cars visiting need to park on the main road to access this place.The buildings are beautiful and the coloured steps and a variety of buildings with different architectural landscapes is what makes this place unique. You can spend a few hours walking through these quaint localities.

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Nesligül D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,What a beautiful surprise to find Latin America in Goa ,"We visited the Latin Quarter of Goa with a feeling of surprise and joy. It was so interesting to find a piece of Brazil or even Cuba in this part of the world. They say that the Portuguese mingled very well with the people in India whereas the British kept their distance. As a result, 26% of Goa’s population are still Christians and speak Portuguese. You can still see many signs in Portuguese. The houses are multicolored and the streets are beautiful. Once the hippies’ paradise, this place isn’t as cheap nowadays. Look for the soldier and rooster signs to see which families supported the Portuguese and which preferred independence. Don’t miss the rich fruit and spice market which unfortunately isn’t listed in the list of things to do in Goa. "
Fontainhas-Panjim_North,misiddiqui2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Little Portugal in India,Fontainhas reminds us about the colonial era. It has the Portuguese legacy. Old houses in the neighborhood are attractive and different from Indian style. Small Portuguese population maintains its identity and culture. It's worth visiting if in Goa for a few days!

If other countries have little India then I would call this place the Little Portugal in Panjim. Lots of lovely boutique shops, nice eating joints and colourful sites. There is small museum/art gallery in one corner and a few lovely white washed churches and small colourful streets!One of the reviews mentions that the person had booked to stay here for two days and found it very disappointing! Well, it is worth a short visit for an hour if you happen to be in Panjim and it has some nice eating joints which you can visit for a meal!"

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,Pedro Manuel P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Indo-Portuguese charming quarters. The most beautiful are of the city,"Along small roads and footsteps climbing up the Altinho hill, Fontainhas is the oldest neighborhood of the city of Panjim. Fortunately in the recent decades it was understood that the old Indo-Portuguese architecture should be preserved and when you stroll around you still see the Goan architectural charm. It has became a lively place, with restaurants and bars and it has to be part of your visit to the city."

The roads are tree-lined and there is a chapel or two. We walked up steep steps all the way to the Panjim High Court, another beautiful yellow coloured building with flowering bushes on the grounds, and walked downhill back to the town square near the church. This part of Panjim is surprisingly hilly and reminded us of walks in little Himalayan towns!"

Fontainhas-Panjim_North,SUDHANSHU-K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Must see If you are in Panjim,"I have noticed that tourists visiting Panjim have one target in their mind , i.e. visiting a casino. Do that but , spare one hour to soak your self in the old glory of Panjim by visiting Fontainhas . This old settlement is trying to preserve the buildings / houses of Portuguese time. The bright colors of the houses and the architecture makes them distinctly different from other houses in Panjim. The place needs attention from the government in terms of providing infrastructure, cleanliness, and making this a better tourist spot. I visited this place in the evening hours and liked the silhouettes of the buildings ."
