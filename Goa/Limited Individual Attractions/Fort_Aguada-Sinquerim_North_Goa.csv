Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Manoj Kumar C V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Fort Aguada,Fort Aguada is situated about 8 km from capital Panjim. This fort was constructed by the Portughese as part of colonial history of india. Presently it is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. Entry fee is ‚Çπ25/- for people above 15 years. It gives a beautiful view of the seashore. There is a water harvesting system inside the fort which used to give fresh water to the ships anchored there. The light house in the fort is one of the oldest in india. It requires about one hour to cover the upper fort. There is lower fort aguada and beach nearby and which is also also a must see as paer of Goa visit.
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Manoj Madhukar Jadhav,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2021,Must visit place in Goa,Must place to visit while in Goa. A little walk and you reach the round-shaped building called Buruj. There are many water sports activities which are done at the shore and beach of this place. There is always a huge rush of tourists here. This is just next to Taj's five-star resort in Aguada.
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Shubhanshu B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,"Avoid sun, go as early possible","Well, I don‚Äôt know much about the historical significance of this fort. Famously known from ‚Äòdil chahta hai‚Äô reference, this place has 2 parts, the bottom jail portion and the top fort area. With separate entry points, one needs to take separate roads to reach each part. Both the spots are clean, well maintained and scenically beautiful. They charge Rs 50/visitor as an entry fee for the fort while it is free of cost to checkout the jail museum. Parking is easily available. We went there around 11am and it was already hot with a bright sun overhead. Both areas demand walking in open and hence, it is easier to enjoy if the weather is pleasant (opens at 9am, mornings are the best time to visit). There are no food joints inside but a few kiosks outside meant for juice, water and packaged refreshments. The natural light and scenery allows for the best photos/selfies. If you enjoy cycling, this is a great track to have fun while covering the fort."
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Sid T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,It was an amazing experience at Taj Fort Aguada .. beautiful resort and ofcoz beautiful people who makes it The Taj..,This was our second visit at The fort. This place continues to amaze us. Outer deck at the reception is just amazing at the time of sunset. Hotel manager Nisha is such a charmer. Makes the experience so much better.
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Amith Kumar S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,A fort with a seaview,"A Portuguese port that was very important back in the days is still magnificent to look at even now. Built around the 17th century, the fort has a beautiful panoramic Seaview witnessing the confluence of the Mandovi river and the Arabian Sea.We reached Aguada Fort in the morning, it was quite hot and honestly the whole experience can be tiring if the weather is too hot. We were lucky that it was not very hot and we could manage walking around in the sun. There is an entrance fee that one has to pay while entering the premises, you can pan online as well. The fort is well maintained and lot of restoration has happened and is still happening which is a good sign.The fort is clean, there are many places one can take photographs, the scenic view from the top of the fort is breathtaking.The lighthouse is very unique and it was being restored when we had visited the Aguada Fort. The lighthouse is not functional though but it would be great to go inside it if at all they do open that for visitors in the future. The fort had a facility to store water, however this is not functioning anymore.The fort timings are 9 AM to 6 PM. There are a few stalls near by selling hats, and some fresh juices to keep you hydrated. Advice you to put your sunscreens on ore carry an umbrella so you do not get burnt. The entire time to explore would be an hour as there is not much to see. Do take some nice photographs and enjoy the views of the Arabian Sea from the fort walls.You can find Aguada Fort at Fort Aguada Rd, Aguada Fort Area, Candolim, Goa 403515."

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Alisha A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,One of the must visit tourist points,"There are two forts: Upper and Lower (situated next to Taj Aguada), both are around 3kms apart. The main fort is Upper Fort, so do check maps properly on this. The fort itself is very nicely constructed, robust architecture, and maintained well. Great for pics. Parking charges are 100, and entry ticket is 25 (available at ticket counter, no need to book online).We tried to visit Aguada lighthouse, around 500m from here, but did not find any visitor path to reach there.Next stop was Aguada Jail, since we reached there around 5:30pm it was closed, but the views of the sea at the entry point was magnificent. There is a path too to walk down to the lower most rocks and feel the waves crashing against it."
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,dennis4156,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Disappointing,"There is actually nothing to see except old crumbling walls, so I would suggest giving it a miss at least during the daytime as it is very hot or carry an umbrella or wear a headgear to shield yourself from the heat. "

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Sandy_JSR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2020,Historical Fort,"Fort Aguada is a well-preserved 17th Century Portuguese fort, along with a lighthouse, standing in Goa,  on Sinquerim Beach, overlooking the Arabian Sea. Lots of history attached to this fort. During our family visit to Goa in Feb'20, we visited the fort.   From parking there was a small walk through rocky pathway. The entry fee is Rs. 25 per head. This historical fort is not very big neither has too many things to see, hence can be covered within 1 hour. The view of adjacent sea from the top of the fort is quite impressive."

Good food and service as expected. Vincent was always happy to help during breakfast hours. People in our next room were a bit of a nuisance with their doors open and talking as max colume but then what can hotel do if I don't complain. Overall a good stay and beautiful location!
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Gaddam C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good,Fort Aguada Nice & Scenic place to visit in Goa. Constructed new light house beside Fort Aguada.. Fort needs some good Maintenance... nice of Arabian Sea from fort Aguada. 
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Aniruddha Srivastava,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Fort Aguada through a scenic road for nice sea view,This historical site is not so big and can be covered within 30-50 minutes. 2 wheeler parking is 50/- and entry ticket per person is 25/- One can also try booking entry ticket through online and get 5/- discount. Overall this place is plain land with one light house (which is closed for public) and nothing else other than nice view of Arabian sea and sunset. But the real beauty is the road from Taj Holiday Village to fort which is very scenic.
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,JE Dolphy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Aguada Fort,"Fort aguada is a place to visit beacuse it will take you away from the beaches of Goa. An hour just required to visit it being on a hilltop the view of the sea is excellent.Though ther is not much to see in the fort, a small light house is there which is closed to the public and a tank for harvesting rainm water  which is also locked. So nothing much but the 4 enclosed walls from where you can get a good view of the surroundings."
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,VVas,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Nice place to visit,The fort has got pretty good view of the sea. Preferred to go in the evening to reach by 4.30. Walking around the fort took us an hour. They need you to scan qr code to buy tickets but the worst part is there is no connectivity and could see lot of people struggling. We went a day before but had to come back since I and wife couldn't connect online. We went back to hotel booked online and came back the next day. Luckily we were staying close to the fort. It's best if u prebook online on asi.payumoney.com.Evening is best time to visit and it closes by 6pm.
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Thrupthi R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Good,"Make sure to buy the ticket online. It cost 20Rs per Adult. They don't sell tickets out there instead one needs to have online eticket to enter the fort. If you think you can buy it online outside the fort, yes u may but phone signals are very poor up there and might waste lot of ur time. Make sure u drink lots of water and carry a hat and umberella"
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Sourav Goswami,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A wonderful spot for viewing the beautiful sunset,"Aguada fort , unlike Chappora fort is maintained by Archaeological Society of India and has a minimal entry fee. It‚Äôs such a cool spot!!! The overview of the sea is really beautiful. There are places, where you may get a shade to save your head from the scorching sun rays, though I would suggest to visit the fort in the evening and enjoy the beautiful sunset from above. Parking is just outside the main gate.Kindly note, due to covid crisis, tickets need to be booked online and per day they sell only 2000 tickets. The figure may seem to be huge but believe me, you won‚Äôt get a chance if you won‚Äôt book a ticket in the morning or may be the earlier day. We went twice üòÇ. First day, all tickets were sold, but we collected all the information as to, how to book tickets and all and finally we visited in the evening the next day. I will be attaching the picture of the web portals, from where you may book the ticket. So, don‚Äôt miss it !!"
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Sam Mathew,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,HORRIBLE,"Lately they have come up with a system of online booking. To avoid crowding at the gate it seems. They couldnt have come up with a more useless system which was absolutely not thought thru. First of all the basic problem with online booking is that there is no range in the area. Airtel, Idea, Voda etc all have less connectivity. The website takes for ever to load and when it does, it takes a 5 or 6 times to get thru. The people manning the counter say they are helpless. They directed to on Smt V Vidyavathi Director. Who never picks the phone. Overall a useless and horrible experience. Never go there with family"
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,deepakmalik777,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Waste of time,"You need entry ticket to get entry though it‚Äôs very cheap about ‚Çπ20/person but actual problem starts when you need to get a ticket.You can book only online and network connection is really terrible of almost all network providers.Fort is super small, almost nothing to see or explore.If you really want to visit then I‚Äôll advise you to book ticket online while you have good Internet (hotel or before reaching there)Overall network coverage in whole Goa is also not so good."
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Arijit S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,An ancient Portuguese Fort,The remnants of the Fort are well maintained with clean paths and easy access.

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Deepak Naik,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Offline ticket counter closed,Due to covid only way to get a ticket is online. Instructions for which is given outside the gate. The QR code cannot be scanned by Google Pay/Phone pe app. Huge crowd created because the asi website was not working. Moreover due to its remote location there was no proper internet connection. Additionally 50 rupees charged for parking. Waste of time and money avoid going to this place at least until the offline ticket counter opens. Could not go inside to see the fort.
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Manuel de Manuel,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Honestly it is not worth spending more than 4 hours and $ 60 to see this.,"If you are staying in South Goa you will need more than four hours in a rental vehicle to get to and from. The price of the rental vehicle with driver is about 60 USD.Honestly it is not worth spending more than 4 hours and $ 60 to see this.In case you are staying in North Goa and you do not have something better to do, you will arrive in less time and spending less money to arrive, but you have to be a little bored with absolutely nothing better to do."

And the litter! Why does the Taj hotel not help? They have taken the most impressive part of it. Surely  they should put something back into the community?Watch out, the area is infested with snakes. Ask any local."

Some uphill walking near the end but we enjoyed the walk. Great for bird watching. We refused to go in when we got there once we saw the ridiculous unfair price, 25rs for Indians & 300 rs for foreigners!!   How unfair is that! It's the principal rather than the cost! We turned back & went to the jail which again was a nice walk & gave a good view of the jail & millionaires palace."
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Shubham Jadhav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Ok ok,The place is not exactly a fort. It's a old tank used to profile water to ships passing by. The only attraction in the fort is the old lighthous

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,_carolynswalsh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Underwhelming,A good tip is to climb the lighthouse for a fantastic view of the fort rather than pay 300 rupees to get into the fort when Indians pay 25 rupees. The lighthouse only cost 25 rupees. There is not a lot to see when you get into the fort but there is a lot of information.
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,S_Venkatesh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Poor Upkeep, Unexciting","Fort Aguada was built by the Portuguese to guard the mouth of River Mandovi from invading enemy ships. It is about 30kms from Panaji, in North Goa. The entrance to the Fort is about 1/2 km long walk over broken rubble path from the main road. Considering the stiff entry fee of Rs.25/person, the neglect of this path, where vehicles are prohibited, is criminal. Inside, the one major structure is the Lighthouse which is locked & barred at the base. Again, a shocking case of neglect. The Fort is nothing more than a long low compound wall from the inside. The large underground Water Tank of historical importance is also locked for preventing entry without any description board. Quite unimpressive. Even the Toilets are badly maintained with drain pipes of urinals missing. Fort Aguada is a striking case of badly maintained & neglected historical site with a stiff entry fee."

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Deepankar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Old fort with nice view...,"Just an old fort, technically just the boundary of the fort exists. If one has visited Rajasthan, then this fort stands no where near. So, nothing special about it. Only good thing is the nice view of the ocean which provides a perfect background for taking pictures. Also, basic facilities need to be improved at the site.."

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,KALYAN R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,NO PROPER MAINTENANCE ,"The Fort is not under any regular maintenance though they are charging ‚Çπ25/- from Indian and ‚Çπ300/- (exorbitant one) from foreigners and no guide. Approaching road is also in very bad conditions. Temperature was very hot in December. Parking charges ‚Çπ50/-. No arrangements for drinking water/bathroom by the authority. Outside shops selling ""lembupani"" @ ‚Çπ30/- for a small glass. Right corner of the fort was closed due to damages. Authority should wake up and develop the infrastructure, facilities like toilet /bathroom a must. Not at all in good condition, overall condition very negative except VIEW from top as it's free of maintenance. "
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Celia G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Waste of money,"Rather than paying 300 rupee for foreigners, we decided to walk around the outside of the fort and found ourselves at the ‚Äònew‚Äô lighthouse. We paid 75 rupee for 2 people to climb a steep ladder to the top of the lighthouse, where we had excellent views back out to the fort and 360 views of Goa. Would highly recommend."

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,rojjy,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Not a penny worth,I m extremely shocked that such a historic place with no maintenance and no guides available no information on sitesIt was my biggest mistake I wasted a day in Goa for this site Plz don't go thereThe route doesn't have  any directions to reach thereThe parking operators are taking 50/- for parking very high ratesThe entry ticket for Indians is 25/- and for outsiders 300/-When u enter it's just a unmaintained fort with all over heat of sunlight no information on points no guides availableMy recommendation is to not waste a day for it
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Manisha Jain,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Needs maintenance,"Scenic view from the top of the Fort is beautiful. But it requires a little bit of maintenance as they charging an entry fee from the tourist. There is also a lack of facilities for food and drinks, near to the fort. The fort contains a large water storage tank beneath it. The charges for foreigners should be reduced as it is way too high. Also, this place also used as prison cells. But when I visited this place, they were filling up those cells permanently.¬†"

Rip off 
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Jakub,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Nice view, but not worth 300 INR","A historic monument offering a nice view of the sea, especially at sunset. Nevertheless, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the foreigner price, 12x higher than normal. Not much to see there, 15mins is more than enough. It‚Äôs better to spend the money on a boat cruise nearby."
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Ria1104,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Overrated and Overcrowded,We visited this fort just before sunset and found it too much overcrowded. Even the part of the fort offering a good sea view was lined with people and there was almost a queue at some good points to take pics. Just a piece of advice...if you are visiting Goa on a peak season avoid this fort as you will not enjoy it at all. Only visit this if you are in Goa in off season.
Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Aditya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Good place to visit,Aguada situated in Southern portion of Mapusa District of North Goa.

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,Geeess,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Because its there,"This is a popular spot in North Goa and as its listed as a tourist spot it attracys busloads of tourists. There is nothing much left of the old fort save the sunset view and the glory is with a hotel which has taken its name!The Aguada fort is a monument to Portuguese construction and engineering. Although parts of it have fallen to the ravages of time, much of it is intact and it remains the best preserved Portuguese fort in India today. Built over three years from 1609 to 1612, it once defended the Portuguese stronghold against Dutch and Maratha invaders.It is named for the fresh water spring that gives the fort a constant supply of potable water, ‚Äòagua‚Äô being the Portuguese word for water and ‚ÄòAguada‚Äô signifying a place where water is collected. So well built and fiercely armed was this fort that it has never fallen into enemy hands."

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,MOHIT RASTOGI,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A Very Small Fort,Fort Aguada situated in Southern portion of Mapusa District of North Goa. It is a very small Fort used to cater Fresh Water to the Portuguese Ships in the past. The place is easily accessible by road. A very little walk and a few steps and you're there. The place is unique but not quite like a fort. May add this place in your list of places in your North Goa trip to visit. Very nice scenes of Mandovi River can be seen from the top. There is a lighthouse there. Presently the place is under renovation.

Fort_Aguada-Sinquerim_North,K_Shukla,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Nice place to visit,"Historical place, with some interesting stories. Earlier used as jail and as light house. You can visit this place on Bike or Car (parking available). Prefer visit in morning or evening (particularly when it's sunny day). Plan for at least an hour; this visit involves some walk (not an issue for young folks) so plan accordingly. Near parking you'll find some stalls of tea/ snacks etc. Washroom (near main gate) is also available but it closes around 4 - 5 PM (no strict timings mentioned though). Visit with family and friends, click snaps and spend some time walking inside the fort."
