Fort_Aguada_Lighthouse-Bardez_North,Geeess,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,"Well, its there","Fort Aguada is an epitome of Portuguese architecture built in the 17th century. Its lighthouse and the fort itself have braved the ravages of time and stand like silent sentinels on the Sinquerim Beach, approximately 18 km from Panjim. Built in 1612 as a protection from Dutch and Marathas, it was the most prized and crucial fort for the Portuguese and covers the entire peninsula at the southwestern tip of Bardez. The view from the fort is breathtaking as it overlooks the confluence of Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea. The fort is so named after the Portuguese Word for water i.e. 'Agua' and used to be a replenishing source of fresh water for sailors. In fact, it has the capacity to hold 2,376,000 gallons of water and was one of the biggest freshwater reservoirs of Asia.Fort Aguada has also been used as Aguada jail. A statue in front of the jail salutes the freedom fighters, giving the fort a touch of patriotism.In its heyday, the fort may have been a silent sentinel but today, it is bursting with tourist activities and happy chatter. The mesmerising view of the setting sun combined with pristine water of Arabian Sea from the top of the lighthouse is so picturesque that it can capture the heart of anyone who comes here.four-storeyed light house. Built in 1864 it is the oldest lighthouse of Asia. There was a time when oil lamps were used to emit light after every 7 minutes which was later changed to 30 seconds. The Lighthouse dominates the landscape of the Fort. It was closed to public gaze some years ago and was abandoned in 1976. So, a new lighthouse was built and was named as Aguada Lighthouse. A bell inside the lighthouse later became a part of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church in Panaji. For a small fee, a curving staircase can lead you to the top from where you can have a beautiful view of the sunset."

There are sellers of juice/ice cream etc; I swear you'll  be running to them! A very twisty winding road past parched and burnt brush to reach a gem of history - if you have an imagination then let it wonder through the port holes and arrow crevices! Plus the caged doors you cannot venture down! Let your mind imagine the pirate ships on the horizon and the battles between the Portuguese and pirates!

We were here yesterday and found that there isn't much to do here except admire the view from the fort. There is no entrance free. You are not allowed to enter or climb up to the lighthouse. Since it is summer, it is also very hot there. Kids may find it boring because it may not interest them. It is an open area and hot at this time of year.The terrain is uneven because of the old eroded rocks and stone bricks. Senior citizens may find it a little difficult to walk around. Not hazardous, but requires effort to walk along the fort walls. If you have a walking stick or walker, it will not be easy."

Fort_Aguada_Lighthouse-Bardez_North,Deepak K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Nice view from the top..Nice Selfie points,Its a historical place which is now defunct. It is fort built overlooking mandovi river. Nice scenery. But the pathways are broken and little dodgy for Elderly and young kids Make sure you wear comfertable shoes when visiting this place. Visit it early mornings or late evening to have the best experience. Its too warm in afternoon as there are no shades here.
Fort_Aguada_Lighthouse-Bardez_North,Kaivan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Old Portuguese fort with a lighthouse ,"Fort Aguada is located 10 kms from Naga and Calangute. This is of historic importance as Portuguese used this as a water base before 2 centuries. Also, the lighthouse helps the ship's to locate the land.One can pay a nominal charge and go to the top of lighthouse. The view is awesome from the top.I will rate it in the top 20 things to do in Goa. "

Fort_Aguada_Lighthouse-Bardez_North,Balraj T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Dil Chahata Hai,The famous fort Aguada - that was seen in Aamir Khan's Dil Chahata Hai song is one of the best tourist spots one should not miss while in Goa. The fort is not big but it has lots of inscription on the small pillars which are found spread over the fresh water storage tank. This tank used to store fresh water and was used by the ships set for sail. It has light house which is not open for public to climb up. The spots is worth visiting during the evening and sunset hours. It is very near from Calangute.

Fort_Aguada_Lighthouse-Bardez_North,CheekyKB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Great local place to visit,"We hired a bike and travelled about 20 minutes outside of Candolim to reach the lighthouse. There is a pathway which is strawn with small local carts selling local goods like souvenirs, hats and drinks. We stumbled on this by sheer accident but stopped all the same for a drink and a rest. The lighthouse had lots of visitors, mainly Indians and it was a really nice atmosphere. Great views."
Fort_Aguada_Lighthouse-Bardez_North,Beattiebear,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Try a visit cose to sunset or sunrise,It's essentially just the four wall and the lighthouse. Having said that the walls are impressively thick. Entrance is free. In addition check out the lower walls at sinquerium beach. Also rode around to the jail on the southern side but the entrance was closed. The road to the fort passes by the river. Worth stopping off here / exploring some.
Fort_Aguada_Lighthouse-Bardez_North,Abhineogi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Nice place to see sunset,First of all it's not a fort (I am considering forts which are in  Rajasthan) . Only a boundary wall and some corners are available. Best time to go there is afternoon. Take some photos. It is very crowded and the path is very narrow. For kids some time difficult to walk.

Nice breeze.... Exotic atmosphere.... 👌👌👌You need to experiance it .....An ideal place for photography lovers.One can also visit the Aguada Jail (mostly under lock & key) on the return leg.I recommend to visit this place either early morning or late afternoon.Carry enough drinking water with you.Note, the fort closes at 6:00 pm....Over - all, a must visit place in Goa !!!"

You need to park your vehicle and just walk a little bit uphill and there you go..You will see many people posing around in a very filmy way and couples holding hands just sitting and watching the lovely view. I loved to watch the sunset from here. It was beautiful. I can keep staring at the sea for hours and for me this place was the place to be. I enjoyed a very quiet and beautiful sunset from here. Beautiful! :)"
