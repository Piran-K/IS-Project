There are a few eateries with free wifi and taxi service; and it is the area has a local community so all sociable from morning till sunset.

Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Dilip S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Turtle Beach,"Olive Ridley turtles , bigger and heavier than tortoises lay eggs between October and March on the Galibaga beach . In the wee hours the female turtle visits the beach . After laying around 100 eggs , the female returns to the sea . The eggs hatch within two months and baby turtles swim to the sea . As these turtles are endangered species , the forest department ensures proper fencing of the nesting area .We saw  three enclosures . Each enclosure carried a date on which the eggs were laid . The eggs were laid on 13th and 22nd February . The beach was the most beautiful and unspoiled one . There was no shack , no tourist except us ,  no vendor and no water sport . Tip : Turtles usually come to the shore in night . So , one can take a chance of spotting them by visiting and staying at the beach in the night . It is beneficial to drive on the Margaon ‚Äì Karwar road to reach the beach ."

Believing in all the rave reviews I set off with my family and was thoroughly disappointed. It's quite far from canacona and when we reached there were very few people on the beach or rather sea shore.

The waves are just perfect if you want to just float around and enjoy the peace and quiet. As its a nature conservation site, the beach is pretty restricted.

I wish the Government does more) One best thing about South Goa is the Unexplored and Unadulterated Beaches, and thank God and the Government for not developing tourism here (Do not want to see it getting ruined like North Goa)  So much Clean, Beautiful, Scenic, Intimate, Exclusive, Safe (they have Life Guards), Non-Commercialized and Serene....in short, a Must!!"
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,howieod,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,So quiet and still unspoiled ,"I almost want to say this a is a terrible spot and you should never go there but to be honest it's amazing and for now unspoiled.    They are building a new freeway just behind the beach and I hope this won't too may tourists from North Goa and the surrounding area. After an afternoon of lazing on the empty beach we had a tasty lunch of crabs, prawns, calamari and a chicken tikka masala at a simple beach shack and the owner kindly let my boys borrow his boogie board."
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Melslittlelife,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,Absolutely beautiful - also called Turtle Beach,"Stunning beach, really worth the visit. The water is clear and not too rough. Apparently the turtles come out more over a full moon. I wish we had been there for that. It looks deserted but if you see the trees, walk to them and you will see a few beach cafes set  into them. We went to Santosh's one, not on trip advisor but really loved it. "

Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,wjw2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"One of the last unspoilt beaches in south Goa, but.....","I have been here many times, but usually on my scooter. So it was extra special yesterday to be invited by friends to walk from Palolem to Galgibag for lunch and a swim. You need to take a small boat from Rajbag to cross the river to Talpona, but there are plenty of willing fishermen there who are more than happy to ferry you across for 50 rupees each. It took us about an hour and 15 minutes to reach Galgibag by walking mainly on the beach all the way, but there are some sections that take you through the forest and an oldy worldy village where they still draw water from a well. The beach itself is protected because of the turtle nesting sites so there are no shacks directly on the beach. However there are a couple of cafes situated amongst the trees, my favourite of which is Surya's. Yesterday we ate at Surya's uncle's place next door, Santosh's which was fine too. After lunch we continued our walk right to the end of the beach to the sheltered lagoon area for a fantastic relaxing swim and sunbathe. THAT'S when we noticed that as well as the dreadful roadworks that have cut the village of Galgibag in two (because of the new highway link road being built there) they are aiming to put a bridge over the narrow part of this stunning lagoon thereby destroying one of the last unspoilt places in the whole of south Goa. The construction of this highway is a complete travesty as it passes close to where the turtles lay their eggs and where the mangroves line the shore. All of us were deeply saddened and angered that such a dreadful road had ever been given the go-ahead in the first place. Corruption? Backhanders? Who knows? But this new highway will destroy Galgibag and already it's monstrous roadworks have taken away the pristineness of this once beautiful secluded place. Very, very sad......"

Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Rashi G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Worth a visit,Galgibaga is worth being visited once of your in south goa. We personally liked it more than palolem but that's just our preference. There is zero commercialisation here and it is mostly empty as there is no 'tourist attraction'. We enjoyed using our power kite here. U can spend an hour or 2 here. Our scooty ride to this place was quite enjoyable.
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Qrio,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,What a beauty?,This place has a lot of calmness. Very less crowded. There is a life guard. This is also a turtle nesting site protected by forest department. Pure beaty!

Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Schanke,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016,Desolate Beach,"We went there to see the turtles, but none to be seen. It is a nice and sandy beach but absolutely deserted, even though there is a lifeguard on duty. There is only one little shack type spot where you can get a snack and beer. We went by taxi from Palolem and did not realize it would be so empty. Luckily we had told the taxi to come back for us or we would have been out of luck for any way to get back to our resort. The place is that deserted. I would not recommend visiting even though the turtles are supposed to be there in November, they weren't.   "
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Tes P. Y,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Beautiful Home of the Turtles,"I wanted to visit Galgibaga Beach because I heard about the turtle laying eggs on the beach here. This place is a turtle nesting ground and a sanctuary for the endangered Olive Ridley Turtles. We reached the beach in around 10am, and it was baking hot. There aren‚Äôt a lot of people here because this place is not commercialized. You will not find any shacks serving food or drink here. It‚Äôs the complete solitude, so peaceful and beautiful. Unfortunately, we couldn‚Äôt spot any turtle so we approached the lifeguards and asked them about the little creatures. The lifeguards told us that the nesting season is in November, and the turtles usually came in at night so it‚Äôs impossible to spot them.We spent some time here anyway because it‚Äôs really beautiful and peaceful out there. Although the beach is baking in the heat of the sun, but under the shades of trees, it‚Äôs really cool and relaxing. The sand is really soft, and the whole area is really clean. I was disappointed that we didn‚Äôt see the turtles, but at the same time, I understood that the creatures needed their space and this place is a sanctuary to them. We tried to leave as little footprints as possible because we didn‚Äôt want to disturb their home."
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,sylvaBzh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016,wild beach in goa,Galgibaga beach is not easy to find but when you reach there you will love it. long beach with white sand and on the right side the river coming in the sea... not a touristic beach and its better like that. 
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,ljad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Other wise known as turtle beach. An unspoilt sandy beach which is lovely.,"Love visiting this beach. It's just miles of Andy beach. Beach huts are few and are tucked away so does it feel like a beach that's like a resort. Is,unspoilt and relaxing. There is a great restaurant called santoosh which I recommend. The sea is rough. But there is a river and lagoon area that is safe for swimming and relaxing."

Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,rohitkatake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Quiet & Decent Place,"Galgibaga is one of the quiet beaches with hardly any visitors around. It is 24 km away from Agonda Beach. On the left hand there is Galgibaga river meets to the sea. If you go to the end of the beach its water around you from three sides thats amazing. You can click some best photos here.The long sweep of golden sand is often completely empty, apart from the occasional fisherman or children from the local village chasing crabs. Galjibaga is a breeding site for the the protected Olive Ridley turtles (leading to its better known name of Turtle Beach) which explains why the beach is so deserted and almost untouched by development."

Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Kendra9041,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Serene and peaceful beach off the beaten path,"If you're looking for a beach in South Goa that is peaceful, serene, and free of beach peddlers, this is the place to go. The beach is long and spacious with only a few people on it the day we were there (March 2016).Although it is spacious and beautiful, the waves at Galgibaga were significantly larger than those at Patnem and Palolem (on the same day), so it might not be the best for kids if you're looking for a beach to actually swim in the ocean. There is a front area of the sandy beach (immediately off of the water) that is completely open to the sun and then a larger area behind the main sand that has huge, probably 100ft evergreen trees which give tons of shade and cooler temps. Then farther from the water, behind the fir trees is a row of restaurants. I had read Tripadvisor reviews that rated the restaurant Surya's Beach Cafe as great, but the permanent Goa residents we met all said that Santosh's (next door to Surya's) is better. We tried Santosh's and the prices were right and the beer cold, but we were slightly disappointed with the mediocre food. We didn't ask, but they were super nice people and would probably be willing to run beers back and forth to your spot on the beach if you decided to post up and have beers in the sun all day-- at least worth asking :)Overall, the beach is beautiful and pretty empty, so if you're trying to get in some rest and relaxation in the sun, this is the place. We were staying on Patnem Beach and were able to get a one-way tuk tuk ride (about 20 mins) to Galgibaga for 100 rupees. The drive is a nice, scenic route and you cross over a pretty cool, rustic bridge over the river, so worth it just for the drive. We even had a monkey run across the road in front of our tuk tuk!"
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Mikael K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Very long and nice beach,This beach suits everybody. Its long and in the south its good for families. On the westside there are waves and very nice. You find many places to eat and stay at along the beach
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,HollisterRanchGirl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,almost-private beach,"If you're looking for peace and quiet and a beach almost to yourself with no shops or salespeople, this is the beach for you.  It took us about 15 minutes in a tuk-tuk to get here from Patnem beach and the drive is lovely (there is a very narrow bridge to cross and taxi would have to go a much longer route).  We walked up and down the beach from Surya's Cafe and it took us a good 20 minutes each way.  We passed only a handful of beachgoers as well as an area where they are protecting the turtle eggs.  It's beautiful and peaceful and a nice change of pace from the other beaches in Goa.  Lovely!"
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,LFredrikJonsson,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Galgibaga,"Beautiful beach, a not yet discovered by the mainstream tourist type of beach. If you go to the south end theres a cliff formation which serves as a natural pier, and behind that you can safely let your kids swim since it isn't deeper than 2 feet (60cm)."

Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Sheila L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends,One of the best under discovered Beaches in the World,"This beach is amazing.  We spent almost the whole day there and watched the sunset.  The beach is huge and there was almost no one else there.  There is reputed to be a restaurant that serves fantastic oyster there, and though we went it was sadly closed for the day.  I was sorry to miss him, as the rumours are grand as to the wonder of those oyster.  Instead we ate at a little restaurant tucked up under the trees and the food was fine.  If you are in Goa take this beach in just for the sheer amazement of being one of a very few souls on the stunning  beach ... which I guess to be at least a mile long.  Plus there is a small sea turtle preservation area on the beach - if you are lucky you will catch the sea turtles coming a shore just after sunset. And there are plenty of bird species to watch."

Undeveloped, clean and beautiful. Costs around 300 rupees in a rickshaw or 500 in an AC car, and takes about half an hour from Palolem beach. There are now a few basic places to stay along the back of the beach - beachfront development is not allowed here due to it being a turtle nesting zone. Pure bliss."
Galgibaga_Beach-Agonda_South,Nickobristol,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A must visit when in Goa,"This is a beautiful place to visit. We spent a day here when we were staying on Agonda beach. We paid around ¬£12 for a return taxi (about 40min each way). The beach is really quiet, There were only 6 other people on the beach when we were there and we enjoyed over 100m of beach all to ourselves. There are a couple of bar/restaurants but they are set back from the beach giving the beach a secluded feel but meaning you can happily spend all day here. "

We walked dawn one morning - from Patnem, then Rajbagh, Talpona and finally Turtle. It was a nice long walk, along the beach and then going through a village to go around the rocks between Talpona and Galjibagh. We were  the only people on the beach when we arrived. It was absolutely clean. We met some local ladies who we then asked about the Turtles. According to them, it was the already the season for the turtles to come but they hadn't arrived yet.  They mentioned climate change as the probable cause. "
