Keri_Beach_Querim_Beach-Arambol_North,Renuka Garg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Best for a short trip at sunrise or sunset,"A secluded and clean beach with beautiful views of the ocean. You can walk down the stone pathway. Be sure to carry water, eatables, sun protection - if you are going in the day. The caves are ok - if you have seen other caves in the country, these could be a little disappointing. No toilet facilities too."
Keri_Beach_Querim_Beach-Arambol_North,Debabrata G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Pristine Beach in North Goa,Very nice and pristine beach next to Tiracol river. We stayed at Fort Tiracol hotel - so we had to take the government ferry to get to the beach. This was worth the trip. Thankfully the beach is not littered with waste. There are not so many people - so you can sit around comfortably. There are enough lifeguards who are there at the beach. There are plenty of eating and drinking options here. Not all of them are inexpensive. But this is definitely worth visiting. Highly recommended.
Keri_Beach_Querim_Beach-Arambol_North,Sid,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 • Family,Furthest beach in North Goa (still a bit untouched),This is literally on the Maharashtra border and one of the quietest beach. It is around 10 kms from popular Arambol beach. There are caves and nice rock formations to take some pics. You can also take a hike up to go to the small caves around the area. Did not have lunch here as there were very few beach shack options and did not look that great.

This is the closest beach to Maharashtra border and a slightly long drive away from Arambol, Morjim but worth spending a day on. There's also a small cave at the far end of the beach if you want to explore during low tide."

Much more serene and peaceful than the busier beaches of Goa, cleaner and more natural. Here there are only about 10 beach restaurants and long stretches of white sand disappearing into the rocks at the far end. Many people live out here to escape the traffic and loud dance parties in Arambol, but still be 15 mins drive away from the action.A beautiful place to live (the apartments are larger and cheaper than the rest of North Goa) and a lovely place for a peaceful and day out."

As it is too far from central Goa very few tourists actually visit here. Much better than than Harmal which has become crowded and commercialised just like other popular beaches of Goa. Maharashtra is just a few kms away from this beach. Tip - If u want to bring in liquor from Goa,this is an excellent route as the checkpost on the border is sparsely manned and vehicles being stopped for checking is very rare. "

Keri_Beach_Querim_Beach-Arambol_North,Alex S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017,A Seashore Marvel,"The lovely village of Tiracol (Terekol) we have the most inspiring Keri Beach. Situated in the North west of Goa approximately 30Kms from Mapusa and 10Km from Arambol. Favourably, a Scooter or Taxi is the best method of getting there. It is the most northern beach in Goa. The beach stretches for quite a distance, with its white sandy beach where it is serene ,calm and an idyllic setting, breathtaking really to visit. Along the beautiful seashore there are some rock formations ? this is to prevent erosion of the seashore. The beach is not commercialised like most, but there is the odd beach shack where you can purchase food/ drinks.The beach is backed with Pine Trees and Casuarine trees. If anything it is amongst the lesser crowded beaches. This is really a hidden Gem. Its a sunny haven of Sand, Sea and Sunshine and you will surely find a tranquil spot for sunbathing or reading your book. In season there are many water sports available. At the far end of the Beach you will find the local Ferry which will take across to The Tiracol Fort ( runs every 30mins). Ideal area for Anglers to fish..A Warning to swimmers. It is NOT SAFE for swimming near the mouth of the Tiracol Estuary, so beware.The Beach is Ideal for picnics so if you wish to take your own food/drinks and enjoy a wonderful picnic take the advantage.. The Beach is also famous for the nesting/ rearing of Turtles, do be respectful of this area.If you get restless or wish a break from the sun, have a look at the 2 Temples situated nearby. Visit the turquoise/White Ajoba and the Ravalnath Temples. Worth a visit.To end your day why not stay around and watch the most wonderful sunset. Its breathtaking."

Keri_Beach_Querim_Beach-Arambol_North,GoAaron83,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,King in the North,Keri beach is the last little gem before you crossover to Maharashtra. It is a beautiful and serene beach. Locals often picnic here and Oliver Ridley turtles nest here. There aren't too many  restaurants around and at the extreme end of the beach you will find a ferry crossing that will take you to the Tiracol fort(privatized hotel now).I wouldn't advised inexperienced swimmers to dive into the waters as it can be a dangerous and steep affair.Anglers will find solace here. The other extreme end of the beach has some isolated and interesting rock formations and also mini cave like tunnels.Be safe and keep this  Elysium clean.

Keri_Beach_Querim_Beach-Arambol_North,ASWINI ACHARYA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Secluded lonely beach,It's located on the border of Maharashtra and Goa. Beach is not suitable for bathing. Water is clean and blue. It's hardly crowded. Journey to the beach is through local villages of Goa. There is a ferry service to take you to the other side of River bank. Suitable for people who loves natural beauty and prefer seclusion.

You can see dolphins quite clearly close to the shore. There's a cafe to the left of the scooter park, I think it's called 'Morning Star' that does the best fish and chips I think I've ever had (and I'm from England!)"

Keri_Beach_Querim_Beach-Arambol_North,Selva P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Trekking along the Rocks from Arambol to reach Keri,"Keri is the top most beach of Goa. It falls in line with Arambol beach -> Paliyem Beach -> Keri beach. Its fun to walk along the shore. We reached Arambol in the car. Started to walk along the shore, have to cross through the shops along the cliff to get to Paliyem, where you can enjoy the swett water lake view and if you have stamina to climb the cliff to enjoy some paragliding. If you walk along the shores of Paliyem( a rocky shore though) you can reach Keri. It was adventurous to walk through the rocks, exploring the caves to pass through the steep hills"
Keri_Beach_Querim_Beach-Arambol_North,vKaushik2,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,"Nice, clean, peaceful beach toward the north end of Goa.","Most people visit baga/calangute beaches in goa, without realizing that the more crowded beaches offer you less. Querim is a nice beach appox 60 kms from Baga toward north, the drive is excellent and the beach is neat/clean/not crowded, mostly foreigeners come here, you can also enjoy paragliding and sit down for snaks & drinks at the shack. The shack is also comparatively 50% cheaper than those in Baga/Calangute.If you want to spend quality time with family or your loved one then this is a good beach to visit during noon or evening time."

Keri_Beach_Querim_Beach-Arambol_North,Wendy C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Off the beaten track,We discovered Keri beach a few years ago and it is definitely the quietest in the area as it is about 30 minster on a scooter from Arambol. It is a very pretty secluded bay. However it is noticeably busier now with more beach shacks having sprung up.  Still worth a visit though. The beach shelves quite steeply so good for swimming. And there are no beach sellers.

Not much people come down here to relax on the beach.. One of the best picturesque beach I have ever been.. The beach is deep and people who knows swimming can enjoy at this place.. Apart from that who wants to try paragliding can use the hillock behind and land on the shores.. People who want some privacy from the crowded beaches of Goa, this is the best option.. "

Throughout the years the Keri Beach has not changed much compared to many others in Goa. A couple of years ago, I walked a few hours along the coast on a path from the Sweet Lake just next to Arambol in the northern direction. When I arrived, the whole beach was empty and I was the only visitor. After having a perfect day and a tasty fish curry in the only shack, I left this beautiful and unforgetable beach on bike."

But once you reach you will love this place. Its like they show in the photos. So scenic. You can go there via ferry to Tiracol fort which is on a hilltop and across the small river that meets the sea.
