Majorda_Beach-Majorda_South,Harry,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Majorda Beach,"I have been going to Majorda and Utorda for over 25years. I was in Majorda from Febrauary to End of June 2020. The beach is very clean and you can walk from here to Colva. Many shacks on the way. Good walk in the morning and you can see fishermen and boats landing on the beach. Dolphins are a regular site .Beautiful sun rise and sunset . During lockdown ,the beach was dirty , which is understandable. I would recommend this beach .             I would also recommend a small resturant at the crossroads of Rainbow corner . The buses run from this corner. This is a local resturants for the locals and don't see any tourists. The name of the resturant is Prakash Resturant. It has limited menue,  but the food is delicious and very cheap. Well worth a visit or have a takeaway.  Resturant is family run. Mother and sons."

Majorda_Beach-Majorda_South,Srinivas S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Peaceful beach with decent shacks in south Goa,"For all the uninitiated, there are two sides to Goa. One is the vibrant, boisterous, party-in-the-air, market filled North Goa. The other is the quaint, idyllic, time stuck, unaffected-by-tourism, beautiful South Goa. If you have picture of Goa in mind as the one with yellow painted houses situated on a narrow lane that leads to a quite beach lined with palm trees then look no further and head to south Goa. We stayed at Majorda in south Goa which is a beautiful village with all the above said attributes of South Goa. The beach has few shacks and we used couple of those during our stay in Majorda. The sea is safe for kids and the shacks serve the necessary food and drinks to keep you going for the day. There were water sports options too and against those were good.There is Utorda beach which is on the same stretch as Majorda if you want to try that. The shopping options around Majorda is limited.Do bear in mind that if you are visiting off season or other than peak season (which is either December until mid Jan), then you may want to check in with the hotel guys ahead if the shacks would be open.Other than that this place is highly recommended."

Some small shells entering the water but nothing too bad. This year there are 9 shacks all offering beds and food. Today we encountered a very blue jelly fish.

The beach is most easily reached via a large carpark past Pentagon restaurant or further along near Pepsi cola house where parking is tighter.Toilets are available at most shacks if you prefer instead of the sea.

Majorda_Beach-Majorda_South,Shonali79,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Soothing beach,"This beach in South Goa is an epitome of beauty, peace and tranquility. Like many other Goan beaches, its blessed with gorgeous white sand and is very clean, but what really sets it apart is that its one of the longest beaches free from the cacophony of crowds. There are just a few foreigners, local joggers and some fishers. A few foreigners I interacted with were all gaga over this beach. Many of them had come down from cold European climates for whom the sun and the warm oceans of Goa are a big draw. Ostensibly, Majorda beach is a gem for the peace-seeking ones, absolutely tranquil and soothing but at the same time, it can be dreary for those tourists who come here expecting dance, booze, music, drugs. This is not the place for them. There are just a couple of shacks here unlike Calangute & Candolim. So, please plan accordingly."

Majorda_Beach-Majorda_South,Sonali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,peaceful & clean beach,The beach is very good and well hidden from general public. The beach is less crowded. I think only foreign tourists visit this beach as compared to locals. Because of which the price of shacks here is slightly expensive. Would only recommend here to enjoy swimming and view and maybe have food outside.
Majorda_Beach-Majorda_South,Iratdog,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Solo,White Sand,"Great beach. During the day it’s fairly busy. It’s where Mish Mar Shack is located. You can get an umbrella and a lounge chair to go with a cold drink all day and half the night. I’ve checked out many of the beach access points down this was, and this I one of the better ones. No tourist crush like Colva. It’s a good way to spend some quality beach time. "

And then I visited a bunch more beaches further south.  This turned out to be my favorite beach because there is great food here, it’s quiet and clean, and the sunsets were so relaxing."
