It's very silent and very close to üåä.In old days in Rewa Hotel, for  holidays in 2 years we enjoyed the stay and local food.Then Rewa hotel was modified constructed some rooms. Then the hotel being houseful, we tried Uncle's, Dream homes üè° wooden cottages just near to Rewa, near Temple.  That was also good hotel ,peaceful and close to üåä stayed there for 2 or 3 vacations. I was searching for the hotels."

Those which are are serving poorly...all high quality restaurants this part of Goa was famous for, are still closed. Beach is dirty, like no one has cleaned here for months. As a tourist, taking a vacation at this time is as scary as opening an establishment is for them....but I guess both parties need to up their ante, otherwise its gonna be a looooooong road to recovery. But you will find lifeguards working and it seems that things are slowly beginning, so hopefully it would be better in a few weeks. Certainly needs attention at present "

I wanted a beach that had a nice beach benches, i wanted a beach with less crowd and with nice food and drinksI just found that in Mandrem beach. The beach is around 30 mins drive from Mapusa. The drive itself is quite a nice one with scenic views. Once you are there there is a restaurant parking spot where u can park your vehicle.The sand the beach are absolutely amazing, there are multiple shacks around this area and they charge around 150- 200 for 2 to 3 beds. The servers will get you what ever drinks and snack you desire to where ever you are.The water and crowd is awesome, there are plenty of tourists around and very well mannered. There are no prying eyes, there are no oglers...pure funwater is not ruff and you can go quite deep into the water, safe for kids as i took my 3 boys into the water, though didnt allow them to venture deep in.Life guards are there in every spot and you will feel safe hereThe shacks do serve amazing food. Russians are in quite a good number here so the restaurants here serve international and local cuisine which is very good and not very expensive.There is no watersport here, it is plain vanilla beach Overall i would rate this very highly and would recommend you visit this beach. You will need a transport to go here.Hope this is helpful"

Mandrem_Beach-Mandrem_North,sarahm76,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Peaceful and a good family spot,"Mandrem beach is much quieter than Arambol  which is about 15-20 mins walk up the shore, less people selling things and fewer sun beds but I thought much nicer overall. The busy restaurant (two shacks over from Riva) had the best lunches on the Mandrem/Arambol strip that we tried, REALLY good local dishes and was always busy. My 6 year old had a great time on the beach, lots of Indian families for her to play with (more Russian in Arambol) and the water wasn't too crazy. Arambol was a bit more for backpackers and a lot more rough around the edges. We loved the chilled out vibe down that part of the coast and easy to get into Mandrem village which is smaller but way nicer than Arambol (especially for the best coffee at Layer Cake!). We spent a week here and loved it."

Mandrem_Beach-Mandrem_North,Ravi Singh Delhi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Best Beach in Goa,"Though many websites are busy promoting Baga beach, no beach is comparable to mandrem beach. It gives expansive feeling as the sea water stretches endlessly kissing the horizon. The entry into the sea is very gradual and smooth and the sea remains shallow for quite a while. This makes the Beach very safe even for small children. Since the beach is about 25 km away from the city not too many casual tourists go there. This allows you to chill without suffering the crowd like other beaches. The accommodation is also very reasonable in comparison with other areas."

Mandrem_Beach-Mandrem_North,yvonne405,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,quiet clean beach away from the crowds and easy walk to other beaches,nice quiet beach with fewer hawkers than other beaches. Sea is nice to cool down in but don't expect to swim as the waves are high and its very shallow. It's better suited to surfing. There are lifeguards on duty and plenty of places along the beach to get food and drinks.
