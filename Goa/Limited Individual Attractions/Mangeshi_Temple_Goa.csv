Mangeshi_Temple,mysterioustraveling,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,Beautiful temple in Goa.,I am always fascinated when visiting religious places around the world. So it is no wonder that I found visiting this site very special. While we were allowed in to see some of the temple grounds it was also very fortuitous that we were able to enter an actual festival. Take time to go visit this temple while you are in Goa. You won’t be disappointed.

Mangeshi_Temple,Amit Aggarwal,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 • Family,Highly overrated. Pls skip,This is #1 item on To Do list for Goa. Pictures of this temple make you feel like something directly from Thailand or Malaysia. We traveled around 50km to see Mangeshi temple and found it to be just another ordinary temple. It can be highly avoidable for tourism purpose. Your precious time can be spent on other things.Note : Please understand that I am commenting on it from a tourist attraction point of view. If you are going there out of faith or love towards God then please excuse this review.

Mangeshi_Temple,LalitaVasu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,Definitely worth a visit when in Goa,"I was visiting this temple for the third time in my life.  The first was in 1971 , second in 2001 and third this month. Not only the temple but the entire area around it has changed drastically. The current structure looks awesome. The blue, golden and white combination of colours give it a look of grandeur . We went to visit it in the afternoon which is a time one should avoid as the floor is very hot. Due to the pandemic all precautions were being taken. There were no vendors selling flowers or puja material, social distancing was being maintained well. Also the darshan could happen only from a far of distance so no one really enters the hall fo the temple. The surroundings were kept very clean. My recommendation would be to visit this when in Goa. It is a very beautifully built and well maintained."
Mangeshi_Temple,PAVITRA SHIBAD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Family,Divine and Godly,"Very beautiful and serene temple.The timings currently are 3pm to 6pm all days due to COVID.The temple was previously situated in Cortalim. Upon Portuguese invasion in Goa, many Hindu temples were destroyed. The Portuguese forced people to change their religion to Christianity. Hence the group of Saraswats belonging to Vatsa Gotra shifted the Linga to the village Mangueshi, where it is currently housed now.The temple was rebuilt twice during the Maratha regime and renovated last in 1973.A golden kalash was fitted atop the tall dome of the temple during this last renovation.There is a another fascinating legend attached to the name of the Lord Manguesh, who is an incarnation of Lord Shiva. The ancient legend states that Lord Shiva once lost everything he had in a game of dice with his wife Parvati. He decided to go into self-imposed exile and arrived in Goa.Parvati, unable to stay without Lord Shiva for long, came looking for him in the jungles of Goa. Lord Shiva decided to play a prank to frighten her and disguised himself as a tiger which attacked her. Parvati cried out for help in terror, ‘Trahi Mam Girisha’ (O Lord of Mountains Save Me).Lord Shiva immediately turned himself back into his normal form and the two were united. But the cry for help and the words ‘mam girisha’ became associated with Lord Shiva. In the course of time the words abbreviated to Manguirisha or Manguesh by which name he is known today.A linga which was left to mark the place where the legend occurred was discovered by a local shepherd and eventually a temple was built to house Lord Manguesh.Me being a Saraswat, this is one of my kuldevatas(family deities). I always make it a point to visit when I come to Goa.The peace you feel when you visit this temple is incomparable.Definitely come here at least once.Only suggestion to the authorities is - please make sure all people are wearing masks and following social distancing. Otherwise deny entry.Some people did not follow the precautions and were very unruly; something I observed during my last visit on 16 Nov 2020.Sanitizer was provided at entrance but no one seemed to be using it consciously.When questioned, why they are allowing people without masks, their answer is ""We cant do anything except leave our safety to God"". Not done at all, when at other places heavy fines are taken when masks are not worn and social distancing not followed.Also, certain visitors came in shorts, skirts, sleeveless dresses up to knee length. Modest dressing should be a must-people should maintain the sanctity of this temple, not treat this like a party place just because you are in Goa."

Mangeshi_Temple,Reghu N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"Lord Mangueshi, an incarnation of Lord Shiva","We were told that Lord Mangueshi is recognized as Lord Shiva only in the regions of Goa. Shri Mangueshi Temple is situated in the Ponda Taluka at a place called Priol. The distance of the Mangueshi temple from Panaji is 22 km.Mythology says that Lord Shiva had once visited the land distraught after losing heavily to his wife Parvati at a game of dice. As Goddess Parvati came looking for him, he tried to prank her by shape shifting into a tiger and frightening her. Seeing the predator in front of her, Parvati shrieked and prayed uttering the following words Trahi Mam Grisha, roughly translated this means “O Lord of the Mountains, save me”. Upon hearing her plea Shiva reverted to his usual form and returned to Kailash with her.Shiva came to be known as Lord Manguesh due Parvati’s words Mam Grisha that remains associated with the land and the tale. The original location where the temple was built is presently the location of village Cortalim, located at the south of the Zuari River. It was during the Portuguese invasion that the deity was shifted Priol, where it remains till this day."

The security guards inside the temple were very rude to devotees and with the priests shout if you stand in front of the deity for a bit longer. This does make the experience unpleasant.

Mangeshi_Temple,Aditya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018,Must Visit if you are in Goa,"If i am in Goa, i do visit Mangeshi as this is our kuladevata. But apart from that actually a must visit place. If possible dont miss the Palkhi which is on every Monday. It is a grand celebration. The view of the temple on this Night is simply magical. There is even place to stay within the Temple but is restricted. Its always nice to stay and since the same is built arond the temple its gives a clam and plesant feeling. Would recommend to wear clothes which cover your legs completly i.e. full pants or else will have to get the dhoti or chunni to do that as the entry is restricted with western outfit.Again the entry in the main temple very well know as ""Gabhara"" (The innermost division of temple) is restricted, however from the place from where we can see the idol gives a good view. Photography is restricted as it is in most of the temples.Non-Veg is strictly prohibited and the canteen inside the temple premises have some delicious maharashtrian delicacy. For people who would like to have the feel of some goan non-veg food if you step out of the temple there are a few eateries popularly know as ""Khanaval"" who serves authentic goan food mainly fish and sol kadi are one of my favourites. Its a home made food."

Mangeshi_Temple,Charan63,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Shiva Temple in Lata Mangeshkar’s Village ,"While visiting Goa, made a point to visit Mangeshi Shiva Temple. It is Situated in the village that is also famous for being the native village of melody queen Lata Mangeshkar. Like all parts of Goa, the road to templetown passes through an undulating terrain though lush green hills. Given it’s a small village, local body has made sure that cars are parked outside the village access road. This leaves the last about 500 meters to walk before one reaches the main entrance of temple. Climbing about 20 odd steps, one crosses the main gate and enters the vast grounds of temple. What surprises one is the temple architecture. Unlike a traditional temple with a pointed step tower above the sanctum sanctorum,  the temple appears like a dome of a basilica. From distance, the temple appears like a church complex. Possibly, a fusion of Hindu Temple Architecture with Portuguese history and Roman Catholic Church styles. The inner hall of temple is decorated with numerous glass chandeliers - again very different from traditional Hindu temples. Temple is however very clean and environs so soothing and serene. When visiting Goa, this should be a must visit site, just like Basilica of Bom Jesus or Se Cathedral. "

We removed and kept our shoes in the designated place and walked barefoot towards the temple. We couldn't walk on the floor as the entire place was too hot due to heat of the sun and there was no cover to get shade. We got blisters under the feet after waiting in the sun to enter into the santum sanctorum. We prayed and came out and literally ran towards the place where our shoes were kept. Pls avoid going with small children in the afternoon to the temple. Best time is morning and evening. Temple authorities could provide a shelter where devotees wait to enter into the sanctum sanctorum. "

It is at a distance of 1 km from Mardol close to Nagueshi, 21 km from Panaji the capital of Goa, and 26 km from Margao. This temple is one of the largest and most frequently visited temples in Goa. In 2011, the temple along with others in the area instituted a dress code on visitors of the temple. This temple had its origins in Kushasthali Cortalim, a village in murmugao which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. In the year 1560, when the Portuguese started Christian conversions in mormugao taluka, the Saraswats of Vatsa Gotra moved the Mangesh Linga from the original site at the Kushasthali or Cortalim on the banks of river Zuari  to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol village of Atrunja Taluka, which was then ruled by the Hindu kings of Sonde of Antruz Mahal (Ponda), to be more secure Since the time of the shifting, the temple has been rebuilt and renovated twice during the reign of the Marathas and again in the year 1890. The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden kalasha (holy vessel) was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple.  The original site was a very simple structure, and the current structure was only built under Maratha rule, some 150 years after it had been moved. The main temple is dedicated to Bhagavan Manguesh, an incarnation of Shiva. Bhagavan Mangesh is worshipped here as Shiva linga.  He is the kuldevta of many Goud Saraswat Brahmins. The 450-year-old Shri Mangesh temple dedicated to Shiva stands out with its simple and yet exquisitely elegant structure. The temple architecture consists of several domes, pilasters and balustrades. There is a prominent Nandi Bull and a beautiful seven-story deepstambha (lamp tower), which stands inside the temple complex. The temple also has a magnificent water tank, which is believed to be the oldest part of the temple.  The Sabha Griha is a spacious hall which accommodates over 500. Like most temples in Goa, Mangueshi Temple has a large number of pujas being performed daily. Every morning, Shodshopchar pujas, namely Abhisheka, Laghurudra and Maharudra, are performed.

Mangeshi_Temple,Dhiraj H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,A peaceful pleasant experience ,"We have been to this temple, located on the lovely Panjim- Bengaluru road , earlier too. And the experience once again has been calming and lovely. If you have a car you have to park it at a distance from the temple and do the half km odd trek via lot of souvenir shops . You can purchase flowers from old ladies to offer to the gods.The temple itself is at elevation. The entrance to the temple, as in most cases in India,is free. However,you should dress appropriately. We saw ladies in shorts being asked to cover their their legs with sheets provided by the temple authorities. You need to take take off your footwear and there is a tap for washing your hands and feet.Photography inside is not allowed. The temple is painted in pleasant white and blue. Inside the temple it is very quiet and peaceful. If you want you can offer money in boxes provided ( although an attendant will encourage you to put it in an open plate). If you have the time sit inside and meditate for some time. The inner sanctum ( to which the entry seem to be restricted) is covered in intricate silver work. There is a very clean and reasonably priced canteen at the rear of the temple where you can sample the local non- nonsense fare.There is ample place on the premises to sit quietly.The temple has this unhurried ambience about it and  is unlike other Hindu temples where priests pester you. There is also a clean use and pay toilet adjacent to the temple. Overall a very rewarding experience."

Mangeshi_Temple,Radhakrishna Mallya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,unusual temple,"Right as one gets down and starts walking towards the temple, its a different feeling.On one side there are commercial shops and vendors, on the other a narrow path way which is quiet... as we climb the steps and move, we can wash our feet and then move to the outer yard and then get into the temple. What vibrations as we enter..was crowded as it was the festival time. May be at othe times you do not need to walk as much, can drive closer to the temple."
