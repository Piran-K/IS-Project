Mapusa_Friday_Bazaar-Mapusa_North,Mamata,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Mapusa Market , Goa cultural visit","This my 25th year of visiting Goa and in every visit we go to Mapusa market. For 2 wheelers , parking is never an issue as you can find some slot in any of the bear by lanes. The market is always over crowded. It is still set in rows and reasonably  segregated with clothes, fruits, fish, speciality products etc. Apart from stall there are many proper stores inside the market. If you take interest in cooking Goan food , it‚Äôs worth the visit . The dried spices are cheap and good quality , tirphala, dried mango slices, kokum, coconut oil is what I buy from hawkers. Fruits are cheaper and you can buy it for your consumption during the stay. The pickles and masala / curry powders are very good. Eg xacuti, Malvani, fish curry powders. Conconut oil sold in buskers bottles is very good for health . It‚Äôs almost like virgin coconut that you can use for head massage, boy massage etc. From the shops  inside the market , we buy wholesale  of beers , port wines   Casews, mango papad , reachado masala etc . I buy from Braganza shop. Francis bakery sells the really good quality tea cakes. There are many though. Check out the pics. If you have passion  for local culture, food do pay a visit. Do a little research on Goa food to understand better the products and it‚Äôs use."

As advised, we  reached the Market by 9 am, just as the stalls were being set up. There was ample (paid) parking just outside the market area. Our main aim was to buy local Goan sweets and spices which we were able to do after a walk about to see what all was available. Well everything really! We hit the jackpot inside the flower market when we chanced upon a Goan sweet shop called Pascoal Bakery. They had all the local Goan sweets (various combinations of jaggery, coconut and milk) we were looking for, and they were absolutely fresh. Right opposite was a stall selling fresh Goan bread and right next door was a stall selling freshly ground Goan masala mixes. So we were able to complete our shopping within 1 1/2 hours. Just as well, because it got really hot after that."

You will get almost everything that is produced locally & nearby & yes you may negotiate if you know the right price tag. Weekly bazar on Friday is popular.

However, I've noticed a distinct fall in the number of vendors and the footfall.  It's now more about clothes than anything else.Having said that, you can buy anything under the sun at this bazaar. Traditional Goa sausages, spices, mountains of fresh vegetables at throw away prices, fruit, bedsheets, shoes, a few antiques, furniture, clothes, etc. etc.I love browsing at this place and can do it for hours on end, however, the excitement has dwindled over the years, just like the vendors.Still a great place to go to."

Mapusa_Friday_Bazaar-Mapusa_North,Bob the Brit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Bazaar,"(Kshmr, Marnik) - Mapusa Friday BazaarI was visiting Goa out of season, early September. Most of the shops were yet to reopen, many of the beach bars had yet to receive their licences and the tourist markets - I was told - weren‚Äôt happening. So I asked a taxi driver (AJ) outside my hotel (Santiago ‚ÄòBeach‚Äô Resort) to take me to the Friday market in Mapusa - pronounced ‚ÄòMapsa‚Äô. It was a twenty minute or so drive, and when we arrived, around ten thirty, he was unable to park so we agreed to meet up in an hour. I figured an hour would do it. Where to start about the Mapusa Bazaar?Firstly it‚Äôs pretty darned large, verging on the huge, but well laid out in a grid. I first encountered dozens of stall holders selling clothes, then fruit and veg, then spices, herbs, plants, bangles, then hardware - knives, pots, ropes and the occasional tech stall offering SIM cards. There are a number of permanent shops that help define the grid layout. Secondly - you‚Äôd forgotten I was in list mode, so had I - I was the only Caucasian face I saw all morning, but at no time did I feel intimidated or threatened. I even haggled and bought a chapati pan to make my own flatbreads - down from 190 Rupees to 150 - a little under two quid. Thirdly, it‚Äôs an assault on all the senses, sights, sounds, smells, flavours - I was offered some fresh cinnamon that tasted like Dentyne chewing gum, I‚Äôd quite forgotten. Finally, unless you‚Äôre married (as I once was) to the Captain of the Olympic Shopping Team, then an hour or so is enough to experience everything.A great Friday morning out - highly recommended."

Well, the market is what an Indian rural market should offer and more.The business is mostly conducted in the courtyard surrounded by permanent shops including a few eateries. The makeshift shops offer you most of your daily needs: vegetables, rice ( look for local red rice), dry fish, clothes, ropes, fruits,souvenirs, flowers,etc. Do visit the market towards the rear manned by ladies selling earthen items.Not much haggling in the market as a whole and the prices are reasonable.The vendors speak the local language but you can get by with sign language and a bit of Hindi and English.Foreign visitors would love the place as it nearest to a chaotic Indian market."

Mapusa_Friday_Bazaar-Mapusa_North,Manish K,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Overhyped, nothing too special","I had heard about the Friday Bazaar at Mapusa and visited it with my colleagues during our recent trip to Goa. For our visitors from abroad, these colorful, tightly crammed markets may be an attraction, but for Indians, it is pretty much what we are used to.The market had its attractions, with fish, vegetable, sweets and decorative items sellers sitting cheek by bowl, selling their various purchases. One needs to bargain hard, but I saw that most shop-owners were content if one decided to pass on their shop. The reason for this is that they feel there are always tourists willing to pay top dollar for their stuff.Compared to what I heard, I felt the place was more hype than substance. In the evening, most shops closed early. Items such as cashews and Goan sweets such as Bebinca and Dodol were being sold at rates higher than in more touristy areas. If one has not seen a vibrane Indian bazaar, one can go here, else it can be avoided. There are a couple of small eateries, where one can sample the local fare and that's about it."

Mapusa_Friday_Bazaar-Mapusa_North,CheekyKB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great daily market with loads of choice,We visited here through the week on a motorbike and the hardest part was trying to park the bike. There were loads. Once parked we made our way around the market. I'd been warned about how busy it was but actually it wasn't busy at all. Maybe we picked the right day to go?There were so many stalls offering everything from clothing to household essentials and all at great process. Bartering also helps even if they say fixed process. The fish market is close by and a must. Take a deep breath and don't breath until you are well away from it. There is also a great fruit/veg market nearly but everything is sold in the Kilo's so far too much for 2 people. A definite must do as the surrounding area is also very good to see. There is a bar upstairs where you can get a drink and people watch.

The seasonal fruits and vegetables are so fresh as if they've just been picked. We purchased some wonderful tropical fruits like yellow passion fruit, chickoo, guava, strawberries, berries, mangoes etc and they all tasted sweet and refreshing. The locals with their produce were all smiles and really inviting which made you want to buy something.  This market is also good for T-shirts, shirts etc. Around the market there are small shop outlets selling dry fruits , pulses etc. Beware this is a very busy market, especially on a Friday and you'll find that most taxi drivers try to convince you that other days are better for a visit (as they can find parking more easily) but you must only agree to go on a Friday.  Hectic but really worth a visit. Enjoy!"

Mapusa_Friday_Bazaar-Mapusa_North,Mabla3,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Shantadurga Devi of Mapusa in Goa,"Shantadurga Devi of Mapusa in Goa is a pilgrim's' delightShantadurga Devi or Santeri as she is called by locals of Mapusa (Mapsakars) is the most revered form of the goddess Durga. She is said to have settled a fierce fight between Shiva and Vishnu by holding them apart by standing in the middle. (She must have been very strong to do that). The Hindu Goans believe she is the goddess of education, prosperity, beauty and wealth. She has one of the calmest faces I ever seen in a form of Durga. Like mother earth she sits in a nine yard green sari listening to devotees at Dhargal a few kilometers from Mapusa market. The deity was earlier sitting in a large courtyard of a rich merchant in Mapusa market until 1566. During the Portuguese invasion, and subsequent conversion of Hindus; she was stealthily shifted to Dhargal situated in the principality of Sawantwadi belonging to the Marathas. She was the family goddess of Gaud Saraswats (to which I belong) who earlier settled in Goa from the Saraswat region in the north west of India. But, the Saraswats left Goa and migrated elsewhere like South Kanara in Karnataka and parts of Kerala between 1566 to 1756 to escape Portuguese Inquisition. I went to see her original abode near Mapusa market where she is supposed to walk in the night and protect the people of Goa. The Friday market day at Mapusa has continued its tradition from ancient times to this day due to her blessings. Shanta Durga is associated with Shri Bodgeshwar Baba who blesses and grants wishes who visit them and believe in them. I visited both the temples and offered five bananas, five betel leaves, one supari and broke a coconut each on either side of the temple as directed. Shanta Durga told me to plant a Tulsi plant in front of my house (which I had done earlier but of late neglected as I was not present here) and prayed there would good rain in all parts of the country including Goa. I hope she hears me and we have ample drinking water in Bangalore and all the states of the country including Tamil Nadu. Mapusa before the advent of the Portuguese was a pilgrims' delight with so many temples dotting the countryside. There is still a freshwater spring running under the buildings near the Mapusa market and the various buildings surrounding it. Recently, I saw the fresh water gushing out when they were repairing the road in front of the entrance to the market."

Getting into the town it appears every man and his Dog/Cow/Buffalo are trying to beat you to that parking spot.Just like when they go to the beach the locals seem to think that they MUST park within 4 feet of the market and Thousands park their vehicles on the road/path make entry to the market difficult to say the least ( mind you legs on vehicle exhaust pipes as you squeeze past !!!! )The Smells of Spice/Fish/Vegetables/Slaughtered Animals/Live Animals/Incense sticks/Perfumes/Sewage !!!!!!!The things you get offered for 100 Rupee's  ??? But wait because slightly further down you will be offered them for 50 Rupee's. You name it you will get it on a Friday at Mapsa market if you can't find what you are looking for ?? Then you have Not looked hard enough.What make's it rather more difficult shopping around the market ?
