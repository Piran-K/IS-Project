Margao_Market-Margao_South,Darlene,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Helpful young woman at Margao Market,"It was our last full day in Goa and we needed to buy our souvenirs.  As we were foreigners, we were not hard to miss.  I had a young woman approach me.  I had my list and we started off.  She took me to each and every vendor I needed.  It would have taken me forever to find what I wanted, if I could find it at all.  She was very pleasant and when we were through, I went to give her a tip.  She would not take it, but we did go to her shop where I purchased a couple of items .  All in all an extremely good experience."

Margao_Market-Margao_South,Vishal W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,An Over-Hyped Market,Quite a few portals had recommended to visit the Margao Market so we did so. And it was quite a disappointment - we had believed it to be a place that'll have some interesting stuff but were disappointed.
Margao_Market-Margao_South,M Sowjanya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020 • Family,Vacation ,I loved this market very much couldn’t venture much inside due to COVID. But I loved the chilli vendor who had Kashmiri chillies with him. Those chillies are fantastic. I missed out his address n number a very nice elderly Muslim man. If anyone can msg me his address or phone number it will be great full so that I can buy chiilies for me in Bangalore.

Parking is too difficult & one ways routes are confusing. Park vehical at a distance & walk.If searched properly, it has too many things to offer."
Margao_Market-Margao_South,drvinaybhaskar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Typical city market,"One can get everything from garments to handicrafts to vegetables to cashews to fashion stores to spices.

Margao_Market-Margao_South,Shihtzuv,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Beware of touts ,"Gandhi and New Market are very colourful and busy markets in Margao.  Gandhi is mainly fruit and veg but New Market is an indoor labyrinth of spices, clothes and much more.  A magnet for tourists but easy to get disoriented inside.  Beware of those who approach you and engage you in conversation- they are being paid to lead you to shop owners who don’t trade in the market - if you do follow and go to their shop on whatever promise you’ve been offered you will be ripped off royally.  Even down to henna actually not being real henna in the tube.  I have travelled extensively throughout India and was very disappointed in such blatant attempts to scam and cheat tourists.  "

Margao_Market-Margao_South,Jackie R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Great local market to visit,This market is used by the locals with few tourists so you really get the sense of India in more ways that one.  The colours and the smells take your breathe away.  There are some lovely fabric shops if that is what you want as I did and very low prices £2. per meter for cotton fabric. Clothes and shoes also available to buy plus spices and local produce.

Wanted leather bag,"Having read the reviews and it not being our first visit to India we chose this “market” to visit.  We had been clear fruit, veg and fish was NOT what we were after.Our driver took us to the market as requested.They were more like a series of shacks you could walk into. Many selling plastic kitchen wear, some pharmacies, very dirty coffee shops (non had tinned Diet Coke).  Some jewellery “shops”.There were NO washrooms anywhere.It was good if you wanted:TextilesFabricsPlastic tatYou could look around the gardens and there was a rest room there."
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Iain P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Not worth it,"This really was a waste of a few hours. Nothing worth buying, nowhere to buy a cold drink. We are not new to India but it was probably the most underwhelming place we have visited. Avoid"
Margao_Market-Margao_South,reggiefern,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,A very bustling market with the best wholesale rates.,The Pic shown is actually of the 'Camera' or the MMC Building that is situated opposite the actual markets ( NEW and GANDHI). Parking is not very easy to find.Recommend go before 3.30 to get parking. Else Go with a driver who can find parking in the by lanes around the market while you shop. Six Entry gates take you into a Labyrinth of passages lined with tiny shops on either side. Well Lit but could use better ventilation. Only the Goan Shopkeepers are helpful and will tell you where to buy stuff if they do not have it. There is also the Gandhi Market across the Old Station Road. Also another Similar Hotspot for bargain Shopping and Wholesale rates.
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Chinar G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Very crowded. Typical market,Crowded market with many stalls. Lots of local vendors selling all kinds of stuff. Crowded during the day.
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Chander_62,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Busy busy busy place. Worth a wonder around,We went first thing in the morning when the stall holders were just opening up. Good time to go if not a keen on buying the sort of goods one gets in the markets.It was nice to see all the different types vegetables which were being sold by most of the vendors.The market got busier by the minute. Good experience to have and I would recommend as a part of one’s tour to Goa.

Margao_Market-Margao_South,RuashaBN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Crowded but worth a visit!,"Insanely crowded and hot place to be at, but its definitely worth a trip even if it means one just strolling pass the little market stalls. You will find that most stalls sell similar goods, but bargaining can be so exciting in this place! The humbleness that the locals display here is just wonderful!"
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Heisenburrito,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,"Not the Best Place to Take the Kids, We Discovered.","We visited during the rainy season, on a busy Saturday, and with two young children. Strollers are out - we luckily didn't bring one since we couldn't figure out how to fold it into the taxi! Take this review with a grain of salt, though, as someone less encumbered would have a decidedly better time here. My rating reflects our experience, bear in mind, and perhaps we ought to have known better. It's a pretty full-on experience and would appeal to backpackers, students, adventurous couples, and people looking for a good deal on standard Indian merchandise and affordable goods. Make sure you haggle! Start at 50 percent off what they ask (even if you're Indian or Indian-looking) and work from there. But don't take the kids, not even on a dare!"
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Gizmocrystal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Good for shopping,"This capital of Salcete Taluka district and Goa’s busiest city. Lots going on here, small streets, market stalls and middle class shops. As expected hassle from one market stall lady who actually followed us until we bought from her. Apart from that the colours, energy and bustle was what I’d hoped from India. Smells from the divine to the revolting! The Municipal Gardens are so lovingly kept and ideal to find a spot of shade to chill. Worth a visit, but check you aren’t ripped off by the taxi’s."

The rest of the market is compact and tends to be a little confusing but worth a visit."

Good way to kill a day. "
Margao_Market-Margao_South,sherlock0079,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,"Good enough to kill time, can give it a miss though","We had some time to kill before we boarded our bus out of Margao, hence we hiked down to this market. The market is a busy, typical old style Indian market, selling everything from fruits & veggies to clothes and cashews. Cashews is a good buy here. This is a good place to visit if you are a foreign tourist looking to take in the sights and smells for an 'authentic' Indian experience. Otherwise give it a miss. But the walk to this place took us past some old houses that showcased Goan architecture - that was very interesting."
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Phalguni P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Must visit,"This is like an all in one market of Margao city. You can find everything and I mean literally everything here. From Clothes to accessories to shoes, groceries, fruits, Vegetables, appliances, jewellery etc etc. There are many small restaurants and fast food take outs in the area too. The area gets very crowded during peak hours & parking is a headache but if you're in Margao it is a must visit. Also for non goans this is a place where you'll find the best of Goan cakes and delicacies, cashews and other dry fruits & liquor too. "

Margao_Market-Margao_South,SridharSathnur,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,A must visit for a good 'market' experience,"The place is always buzzing with people and has stores to suit every need. There is a main one-way street that has the market on the left and there are multiple entrances to the market. Depending on where you enter, you could be greeted with shops that are lined by gifting stores, fruits/vegetables or clothes. I visited the place in December, just before Christmas and had a number of stores selling Christmas decorations, stars, etc. and had hundreds of people busy shopping. The entire place was so colourful, especially if you visit the place in the evening, when the decorations are lit. There are stores inside selling like I mentioned, decorations, gifting, toys, authentic Goan masalas (spices) and condiments, vegetables, fruits, juice counters, cloth stores.The main street that the market opens out into also has a number of stores such as Jewellery shops, dry fruit stores, cloth stores, watch shops and bakeries.If you are getting there by your own four wheeler, parking could be a challenge especially between 11am and 1pm and between 5pm and 8pm. Some stores could be closed between 1pm and 3pm."
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Enrique,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Who Moved My Feni?,"That's the bad news—no feni, or any other tipple because this market falls in the highway zone and is affected by the recent ban. Everything else is still excellent, the goa sausage by the bead, cashews with various types of coating or none, and the famed vinegar. Parking is a disaster, so don't self-drive. Visit this market to absorb the essentials of daily life in South Goa. Take back some of it to enjoy at home. No feni though, as the times they ... changed. Hence the four stars."

Margao_Market-Margao_South,David D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Local market  - worth a look,"This is another market in Margao it is located just down the road from Margao Market (New Market).Predominantly the front of the market is dedictated to the sale of fruit and vegetables. Some of the stalls are more permanent than others, some consisting of a seller sitting on the ground with a large basket near by. Some of the displays of fruit and vegetables are amazing and painstakingly created.Never seen so many chillies great big heaps piled highThe inner part and rear part of the market is mainly clothing, household goods, teas and spices.Definitely a market for locals but is worth a wander around. It is certainly a tantalising experience for the senses, with Its sights, sounds and smells. "

Margao_Market-Margao_South,Dominic S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017,Nice place to shop for dry fruits/jewelry,"Did a bit of shopping for dry fruits.  One needs to bargain.  Most stores quote little less than MRP, but one needs to ask around to get the best price. Only negative is the Kaju ""halwa"" which is not made of kaju at all, but coconut.  Beware of this product. The round box even had an empty plastic cup inside to consume more space!!  But at 60 bucks, what can one expect?  Women's jewelry is also good here - got a sweet deal, but only after visiting many shops and finally finding one where the prices were right.  Some of the shopkeepers were quite surly - not sure why? A bit crowded place, but overall okay for little bit of shopping."

Margao Market is a unique place where you can get flowers, fruits, meat,fish, dress materials, medicines, spices, fresh fruit juices, electronics, liquors etc...You can shop outside the market as well as inside the market.  You will get all the items from flower to fresh vegetables, fish and meat, eggs etc. Fresh fruits, dry fruits etc.  You name it, they have it!  But bargain before you buy.   Also you can avail some imported liquor with trusted shop owners.  After hanging here and there you can enjoy cocum soda or limbu soda.We collected our required spices and started hunting for tender cashew nuts, which we could not find.While purchasing one thing you should keep in mind that quote 50% off on the vendors price!"

Margao_Market-Margao_South,Judith R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,"Busy, colourful market","We went to Margao on the service bus, which took an hour, and cost just 20 rupees each!!  It is worth a trip on the bus just for the experience!!   We travelled back by tuk tuk which was fun and cost 400 rupees plus a tip. That was fun.  The town of Margao is busy and there are 2 markets, an indoor one selling EVERYTHING!!   and a small outdoor one which is mainly locals selling fruit and vegetables. There are some lovely laid out gardens in the middle of the town .  Margao is well worth a visit, if only for the bus ride!"

A place to buy something or nothing . Just an average market but easy to get about and spend a bit of money."

Margao_Market-Margao_South,MatthewFenrir,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Visited and wasn't fussed,"Enjoyed myself but wasn't amazing and so wouldn't rush back. A few tips:1. Go to a place on the edges for good local food. A few of them will be packed with locals, they are the good ones. 2. ""Tea"" means Chai Tea from my experience here. 3. Coffee = white coffee with sugar. Have fun and keep an eye on your stuff. :)"
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Shek Z,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Not so great. But can be tried if time permits,"No harm in trying. Can buy cashews, spices and fancy items for ladies. Before buying cashews check with 3 to 4 shops. I bought cashews from Colva which was pretty cheap then what madgaon market offers. Rest no comments can go for a walk after dinner "

Margao_Market-Margao_South,Trupti W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,Parking is a nightmare ,"Large market with most things available. However, basic stuff is a pain to get . Plus parking is such a nightmare that one has to plan in advance to visit."
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Avinash R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Heaven for Bargainers,"In our trip to Goa ,we spent around 2days in south Goa.So we had enough time to spend on shopping.Madgaon has 2 markets, new market and Gandhi market, both are in close vicinity  about 100mts apart approximately.These markets sell a variety of products varying from spices to watches.Trick is you have to haggle to the core inorder to get a good deal.My wife brought a watch for 200RS.She bargained all the way from 450Rs.We were suggested by a local to buy Zaintyes branded cashew as these are of best quality with nominal price.Overall I would say you should have mastered the art of haggling inorder to get good deals from the merchants."

Margao_Market-Margao_South,Ajex089,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,A must visit,"Its a bustling place and gets busier towards the evening. Best to come there by taxi or Tuck-Tuck as there is no way you find a place to park. While there are better places to shop for typical Indian items one wants to take home, it gives you a good idea of the daily life in Margao. There are some great shops to buy all type of fabric to make beautiful gowns."
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Felino DSouza,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Solo,A congested market,"The new market Margao is thronged by people from South Goa for all sorts of needs ranging from basic groceries to fruits and vegetables to clothing , jewelery and other household items. The place is very congested and parking is a big problem during normal business hours. It is better to avoid four wheeler travel if you decide to go shopping in this market.Wrong parking attracts fines from the traffic cell.There is almost everything available in this market to meet the needs of people from Salcete and surrounding talukas of the district of South Goa."
Margao_Market-Margao_South,Abhishek J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Wonderful Local Market,"This is the commercial hub for locals in Goa. Though this is very much south Goa if the locals need to do their monthly shopping then they need to come to Margao. Be it furniture or anything that the locals would need then they need to go to Margao. For the spice lovers and dry fruit lovers there is no better place to come and buy them but in Margao. And this is how I reached here - some authentic spice shopping.The smell of the spices is evident even before you enter the market here. Apart from spices and dry fruits you can find crockery, clothes and shoes and other items which once can associate with a local grocery hub.The stuff I bought was genuine and I can still smell the spices that I had bought from Goa while attempting to cook something."

Margao_Market-Margao_South,Lena281150,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Sights & Aromas of Margao Market,"Margao Market also called New Market, situated  near the Municipal Gardens in Margao (Madgaon), is a wonderful maze of narrow alleys.   Almost all  the local buses from south Goa ply to this place.  Public transport is best as parking is a huge issue.  A riot of colour and activity, it reflects the lifestyle and culture of the Goan people.  The list for shopping in this market never ends.  Many of the shops are grouped by type of goods. Coconuts, pork sausages, fresh pork, wine, jaggery – yellow and black, mounds of spices, heaps of various dried red chillies, nuts and dried fruit, papads, herbs, berries, clothing, shoes and bags, hats, artificial jewellery and hosiery. Wedding season, brides visit the glass bangle sellers.  Other than livestock, everything else you can think of is sold here including kitchen and bathroom related items.     Most of the prices are fixed.  No need to haggle in this one.  You won’t be cheated except maybe at the section where they sell Goan sweets.  These women play tug of war with customers, each owner trying her best to entice the often bewildered client to her stall.  Buy your sweets from the popular Jackris on the main road or from the single women sitting alongside the alleys.   There is an unexplained excitement of squeezing through the narrow lanes to buy items.  Feeling thirsty ?  Head to the fresh lime soda shop which is near the one and only antique shop in the market.  One section sells fresh flowers and garlands.  Outside the market is a small Hindu Temple.  Here you will find Goan women selling home processed pure coconut oil, plants and pots, home grown vegetables and fruit.  The locals buy roosters and hens here.  Margao Market will add some of the finest memories to your Goa tour."
