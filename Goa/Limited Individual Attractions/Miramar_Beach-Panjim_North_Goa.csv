Miramar_Beach-Panjim_North,Trip Lover,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,A Polluted Paradise,"(Please read the whole article) Miramar Beach is one of the most famous beaches in Goa. It is a vast beach stretching from River Mandovi to the Arabian Sea at their confluence. Beaches are one of the most important venues to go and relax, sometimes even attain complete peace. Miramar beach is non the less. The NO. 1 activity I recommend that visitors must do, at least for a minimum of 2 minutes, is just close their eyes and listen to the the sound of the waves. It is also the ideal 'Sunset Point' in Panaji. But, due to pollution, this beach is loosing its glorious beauty. I request every one reading this article to not pollute Miramar Beach."

Miramar_Beach-Panjim_North,sg2300,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Chance to see dolphin डॉल्फिन देखने का मौका,"Meanwhile, the water is not clean. Garbage waste is also spread just a few distance towards the front of the center. But if you want to see dolphins, then the service of motorboat and steamer is available from this beach. Dolphins can be seen a few kilometers through the sea through them. Tourists often get a glimpse of the dolphin here.इस बीच पर पानी साफ नहीं है। बीच के सामने की ओर कुछ ही दूरी पर कूड़ा कचरा भी फैला मिलता है। लेकिन यदि डॉल्फिन देखने की ख्वाहिश हो तो इस बीच से मोटर बोट और स्टीमर की सेवा उपलब्ध है। इनके जरिये समुद्र में कुछ किलोमीटर जाकर डॉल्फिन देखी जा सकती हैं। अक्सर पर्यटकों को यहां डॉल्फिन की झलक तो मिल ही जाती है।"

Miramar_Beach-Panjim_North,Bhuvanesh P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"ok for a stroll, nothing more","Not much of a beach. its at the Estuary where the Mandovi river meets the sea, so the water is usually a little muddy. Not to mention that its right in the middle of the city of Panjim - so the water & the sand are not too clean. You can go for a stroll there, early mornings are the best time. Otherwise its pretty crowded. You have vendors crowding around the entrance, selling snacks and food - this results in a lot of little all over the place. If you are in the vicinity, drop in, but its not really worth the bother"

Miramar_Beach-Panjim_North,Govind S. Poteker,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Nearest Sunset Point to Panjim,"A short distance from Panjim bus stand, Miramar is the nearest and safest beach any traveler to Goa cannot miss. A visit late in the evening just before Sunset is perfect time to stroll along the beach. One can walk close to another scenic nearby place,  Dona Paula. Since it is close to the mouth of River Mandovi joining the Arabian Sea, on the other extreme side of the beach towards Caranzalem natural and other trash deposit is just a normal. On some days, if you are at the right time then one may catch the locals catch fish using a big net where the people buy fresh fish."
Miramar_Beach-Panjim_North,DrNiranjan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Deserves Cleanliness,"Considering other beaches outside Panjim, Miramar Beach appears less attractive and lacks the cleanliness.Just okay for a short visit in the morning or evening once.  "

Barges and boats outlines in the distant and the Mandovi river meets the sea merging and moving.  It's relatively clean and has a lot going on there.  Food stalls on the road heading to Donapaula... You must be there to find your groove and enjoy what you experience."

Miramar_Beach-Panjim_North,Harsh P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Not a nice experience,"During my visit to Goa early January I came across this beach. I have no doubts in my mind to declare that Miramar is probably the worst beach in Goa. The main reason for this is that it's extremely dirty. Earlier I visited Goa's Baga beach, and it turned out to be quite dirty. However, if a comparison can be drawn between these two beaches, then Baga will be nowhere near Miramar!Once you step into this beach you will immediately notice that it's filled with plastic bags, empty food packets, leftover foods, wrappers, empty bottles, etc. This obviously made walking freely on the beach with a clear mind a very difficult task indeed. In fact, the sea water on the beach appeared unclean as well. Therefore, we were forced to drop our plans of stepping into the sea. Also, there were no lifeguards or some decent cafes nearby."

You get a to add a very new experience to your life. The waves are soothing and relaxing. You can sit there and enjoy sunset. You can also get your feet massaged. We took our music speaker with us so while watching sunset we enjoyed our music. You can also buy food from local vendors and have a quality time. This places helps you forget all your issues and worries and refreshes you from within. You will fall in love with yourself again. You can go here with your friends or loved ones it is equally enjoyable. Wear comfortable clothes and you will be drenching in water so take a extra pair of clothes with you."
