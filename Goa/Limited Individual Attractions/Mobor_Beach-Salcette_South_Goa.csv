Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Siddhesh Garg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,A Pristine Beach for Some 'Me Time',"For the ones who prefer less to no crowd, Mobor Beach is a must-visit in South Goa. Facing the outer walls of The Leela hotel, Mobor Beach gives a rare glimpse of solitude. The white sand glistens under the scorching sun and has little to no humans around. My Tip:Take a book by Haruki Murakami, sunscreen, a mat, and your favourite snack (there are no dust-bins nearby so pack an extra bin-liner) on your trip to Mobor Beach. The best way to locate it is via Google Maps or asking the locals for The Leela. The lane right next to the entrance of The Leela takes you to the beach. Sun is the most friendly during early mornings and feels inviting as you are lounging on the white sand after 04.00 PM. Area of Improvement:There are no first-aid medical kits and drinking water facility available. And since it is deserted except for the guests staying at The Leela, it is best to visit before the night embraces the beach.Best,SID"
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,deepak_misra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Uncrowded clean beach,"This is one of the hidden gems of South Goa. Nestled between 2 top resorts, Leela and Holiday Inn it is easy to miss. The approach is to drive upto Leela and fromthere turn right into a narrow straight path that goes to the service and staff entrance of Leela. It is very narrow and you need to go about 400 meters till the beach. There is space for 5-6 cars and a public toilet and shower which looked reasonably clean.There are a few shacks but the beach itself is very clean and uncrowded. The sand is white.SO this is a must if you want to get away from the crowds and just concentrate on swimming and relaxing.You would need a transport to reach here"

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Sailee Paranjpe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Clean and Less Crowded Beach in South Goa,"In the recent times, the beaches in Goa are getting highly crowded and polluted. Beaches like Mobor are sure to make your day if you are looking for something calm. It is one of my favourite beaches in Goa. Although it is so close to Cavelossim, it is a little secluded. It is clean, serene and has a couple of shacks which serve good food too. The view from the shacks is pretty good."
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Shaheer Fardan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Clean and Beautiful beach,"This is very clean and beautuful beach with two very good resorts Holiday Inn and Leela situated along the beach side. Beach has white sand, not many people around, mainly people from resorts located along side. If you travel further towards south end of Mobor beach, you get to see confluence point of river Sal and Arabian Sea with mountains and clouds at the back drop of it which makes it very beautiful."
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Vaibhav J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Best beach in South Goa,"Unarguably Mobor is the best beach in South Goa.

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Jashojit Mukherjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,"Long , Clean and Flat beach","This beach is one of my favourites in South Goa. It is a clean beach with almost no beach shacks. Crowds are also less. This is absolutely close to several 5star resorts. The beach is flat, long and straight. The approach to the beach is a very narrow lane in front of Leela Goa. Make sure you dont drive onto the beach at the end of the lane as the car can get stuck in the sand if you do so."

Staying at the Leela Goa and having access to this beach on the doorstep is amazing. The golden sands, clear water and cleanliness is outstanding. Not a single sight of any rubbish. There are plenty of nice shacks to eat and drink along the beach with the additional option of sun loungers. Such a quiet and perfect beach with an amazing  view.Vendors supplying the water sports such as parasailing and Jet skis can easily be found. Definitely worth a visit and walk along this perfect beach.  "

Due to the strong sea breeze sandbars were created at the Sal mouth . We walked on the soft wet sand and in the surf . We observed  sea anemones , sea urchin shells and starfish . Banana boating , parasailing , jet skiing , water skiing , wind surfing , etc were some of the sports some tourists were indulging in . We enjoyed a lovely sunset here ."
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,bigbilly1959,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Beutiful,Best beach by far if you are staying in Cavelossim. A 20 minute steady walk on a beautiful beach takes you to the first Shacks. Sea if warm and a pleasure to swim in with stunning scenery as a backdrop highly recommended. Far quiter than Caelossim beach.
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,591dileepn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Serene beach on the south of goa,Mobor beach is the southern most beach on the long stretch which starts from Bogmalo near airport to Mobor in south. Along the beach there are two five star hotels but the narrow approach is exclusively for this beach. It’s fine sand is very tempting to take a swim here. Safe beach for children. Walk to the left edge where river sal meet the sea. Evening is best here as sunset view charming and dream for photographers.

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,kakaanirban,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,White Sand!!,"Mobor possibly has the whitest sand in entire south goa, specially the beach in front of Leela Goa, is extremely broad, and very clean and white. On the southern side there is an adjacent hillock, which gives the beach a feeling of  tucked away on the lap of hills.   A walk down the mobor beach will take you to the Sal river estuary, so it’s an extremely picturesque place, with a combination of White sand, turquoise water, hill and river.This November I visited South Goa beaches from Arossim to Palolem. For the trip report search google with ramblersnaps + South Goa"
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,BalkrishnaShroff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,One of the best beach in India !!,We were staying at Holiday Inn and the beach was just outside. Leela Hotel was on the adjoining plot. From Indian standard it was the cleanest beach I have seen in India. It was a very long and quiet beach which has been given different names at different stretches. Due to monsoon season in September swimming was not possible.Excellent beach for a long relaxed walk !!
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,ShonaSenB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,"Beautiful, clean, quiet and warm!","Nice beach, and easy to wade a bit further into the sea, but waves are quite strong, so swimming is not possible. This is the first and only beach that I have visited in Goa. It is surprisingly clean by Indian standards, and felt good. One can also go for a long walk or jog along the shoreline. There is a  place to shower, behind 'Mike's love shack'. The sun does get very warm around noon and after - I would recommend a morning or late afternoon visit. I went with my husband and his friend who was visiting us over the weekend. Will certainly go back to this beach again."

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,rkmanchi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,What a magnificent beach! I am reluctant to review it lest people get to know,"For those of you whose idea of an outing to the beach is a quiet few hours where you have little else but the sea, the sound of waves, the odd human being, seashells and clean sand - Mobor is the place to go to. Even considering that the beaches of South Goa are secluded and undisturbed, Mobor is at the upper rung of solitude. The sea is calm. The shore is flat and hardly dangerous to venture into the sea and have a swim. It’s kids friendly. It’s safe. It’s clean. With the resorts of Holiday Inn and Leela Beach acting as its cover, it’s safe to assume that Mobor will always remain this way. Take a right at the gate to the Leela and you will land up at this paradise. The wife and kids are going to love this and you won’t have to break the bank and stay at an exotic resort either."
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Georgialou7,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Best beach in Goa,"We found Mobor to be the nicest and cleanest beach in Goa (having visited 4 or 5). It was very quiet in May which made it a nice and peaceful place to sit and read a book. As we went during the quiet season, there was only one beach shack/restaurant on there. This was a lot more expensive than restaurants in the town but convenient."

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,lovetravelling,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Quiet beach,"Pleasant sandy beach, cleaned daily, plenty of bins available along the beach.  Unfortunately the young, domestic/local tourists drop and leave rubbish wherever they stand or sit.  The shack owners do tidy up the beach as much as they can, raking it over and collecting bottles. We like this beach as much quieter than Cavelossim.  Overall while it is not the cleanest stretch of beach it has a good selection of shacks."
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,viral06,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Good experience ,Mobor beach is good but need to clean and need to maintain this beach. We had good walk around beach. People are helpful.

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,squrev,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Serene and clean beach - Must visit,"Mobor beach is a white sand beach located at Cavelossim.  It's a safe and amazing place to relax with family especially when your kids want to have some water and sand fun. Watersports are safest as compare to other north goa beaches.  There are only a few shacks, but most of them serve really good food (little expensive but worth it). Though I had a very bad experience with ""Pearl Beach Cafe"", but other shacks are way too good."
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Yasmina H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Beautiful and Calm!,"Great beach! Secluded and quite with soft sand and nice shacks for food and drink. The water was also clear. Good for walking, too."
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Gajarajan1947,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,yet another  excellent beach in South Goa close to Cavalossim beach,"If you start the visit to beaches from south, the first one will be Betul beach, next is cavelossim beach and the third very close one is the Mobor beach. This is also as good as cavelossim beach, in cleanliness, beauty and the facilities such as bar and restaurants on the beach.  This is very close to Leela hotel. The beach was occupied mostly by westerners, because of its beauty. My Photos will tell the story. I clicked a photo on the sunset too."

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,AshTheWiz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Pristine and Peaceful,"Very calm atmosphere and clean sands are what you can expect at Mobor beach. On the flip side, you have to carry your own supplies of eats and drinks if you happen to visit in the off-season because the shacks here shut shop during the monsoons. But that should not be a hassle as there are wine shops and restaurants close by to cater to that and you can pick up things on the way to the beach."

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,nisasu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,"Clean, serene and safe",This beach is mostly used by the guests of Leela and Holiday Inn. The beach is clean and serene. One one side it is having the view of the sea mixing with the hills and the other side is the open sea. The sea floor is smooth and the slope is not too steep. The waves are calm and not dangerous. One can have fun with you g children.

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Enrique,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Beachcombers Delight,"Mobor beach was our regular morning and evening walk. Going north its about 3km to Cavelossim along pristine beach front. Walk in the surf, on the soft wet sand (easy on the feet), packed sand (use footwear), or dry white sand (you'll never get there) – take your pick – with the promise of a chilled beer from one of Mobor beach shacks.Walking south is where you may pick up some sea urchin shells, starfish or even sea anemones. Why on this beach? The only reason I can think of is that this stretch of pristine beach is also at the mouth of a river, the Sal, in this case. The resulting overflow and sand deposition may be responsible for this, but I'm no hydrologist.There's also a stiff sea breeze. You can see the sand flowing over the beach and creating sandbars at the river mouth. Betul lighthouse is visible from this part of the beach. Watch the fishing trawlers as they go to and from Betul docks about a kilometer up river, and don't disturb the gents fishing on either side of the river mouth.You are alone but not anonymous. If you are a regular walker, the locals know it. Say Hi to Dominic (of Doms) for me. He's a morning walker. The women selling shell necklaces near the resorts also know how long you've been there. Before bathing check the flags. The lifeguards do a great job staying vigilant and patrolling all day. They are vigilant, a sharp whistle got me back from the fourth line of surf!And don't take too long to get here. They're extending the road from Cavelossim to reach the southern-most tip of the beach at the river mouth. Maybe then if you get up early enough you'll get to enjoy before the buses unload!"
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Anoop Kumar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,It is one of the unspoilt beachs in South Goa,"This beach is one of the best beaches in South Goa. The place is clean and has some water sports like para-sailing, water-bike riding, dolphin-view, boat rides etc. It is easy to reach here with good connectivity. One should be careful not to drive your car to the beach sand. I've witnessed someone trapped in this beach by parking their car in the beach sand. There are some good shacks from which you can have decent food/ drinks. The beach water is not so clean, at least at the time of my visit, but it is not dirty as well. You can take bath/ swim/ play in this beach. The sunset view from this beach is very good."
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Christine B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Beautiful quiet beach,"This beach is so long we walked miles. Beach cleaners keep the area very clean and tidy.

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,dipz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Best beach in goa,"This is one of the best beach in goa.  It has crystal clear water and white sand.  Very very less crowded.  We walked from cavelossim beach to mobor beach and it was fantastic,  I can't express it in words. "
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,bv12345,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,The best beach ever!,"We chanced upon this beach while out for a drive. It is hidden, through a narrow road behind the Leela. Parking can be a challenge since the road is pretty narrow and not well made in the last stretch. But the beach in itself is awesome. White sand, soft, clean, warm water. We loved the peace and quiet of this beach. During the day there were a few tourist (10-15) at a distance (maybe from Leela) who were making the most of water sports provided by an operator there. In the evening, we could only see 1 other couple, and pretty much had the place to ourselves. What more can you want! We found a great shack there, and the good food coupled with the peaceful sound of waves hitting the beach, and a dark night = pretty much an awesome evening! I do think that this and the Cavelossim beach is where all subsequent Goa trips are going to be centered around. I dislike crowded places, and this place was perfect!!"
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,John M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Excellent Beach,From Dec 20th til Jan 2nd beach has many Indian tourists from places like Delhi and Mumbai.  Not all but mostly they are very noisy and the peace of the beach is disturbed.  At other times the sandy beach is great with shacks offering free sunbeds and a good selection of food and drinks.  Shack prices vary and the least expensive often provide the best food and service.  For around a fiver you can even have a proper 2 course Sunday roast at Dom's shack.

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,yogesh k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,Beautiful Beach... Clean... Calm and Peaceful...,"There are few places as picturesque as this Mobor-Cavelossim stretch in Goa. Till 1980 this place is barren stretch of sand with one village Cavelossim not developed as a tourist spot. Then Leela, Holiday in, Dona Sylvia Resort and other 5 star hotels moved in at this place, which leads to change this area as a tourist spot.	The Mobor beach is a beautiful, peaceful and clean beach situated at the south of the Cavelossim beach. It is now one of the most happening and popular holiday destination in Goa and is known to be an ideal location for the adventure tourists. The beach is located close to the mouth of the river Sal. Good thing about this place is that this place is not yet commercialized like other beaches in North Goa. Beach is clean, quiet and peaceful, away from city chaos. This leads to this place as a far better place than the crowded north Goa beaches like Baga and Calnagute. Tourist here are mainly foreigner  with rare Indian tourist. You can sit and relaxed on the beach.	Cavelossim beach, Mobor beach, and Betul beach appear as one beach. It is logically separated by respective village area. Different names to beaches were given as per nearby village.	At the beach in Mobor one can enjoy a lot of water sports like water-skiing, wind-surfing, jet skiing, parasailing and banana boat during tourist season. Besides this one can also enjoy biking in the sands which seems to be a favourite activity of the tourists coming to Mobor beach.	The Mobor beach also has many secluded coves and is fairly isolated suitable for those in search of complete peace and relaxation.

Mobor beach is probably one of the lesser visited beaches in Goa which has helped it maintain its unspoiled image. It is easily accessed by the guests of The Leela Goa as it opens out into the beach. Great views and very peaceful. You can also see fishermen toiling away if you visit it in the early morning."

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Swati K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Beautiful beach,"No-one mentions this beach as the place to visit and therefore it remains a hidden jewel. Though its a long beach, we found the best spot behind Leela hotel. Since the place is maintained by Leela, it had no shacks and was sparkling clean. It was amazing to just lie down there and look at the beautiful blue sky."
Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,SteveandNoele,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Fantastic beach location.,"I agree with other reviews that this beach is one of Goa's best kept secrets!Soft sand leading down to The Arabian sea, which can be a little rough at times, but good fun in the waves.Much quieter than Cavelossim beach, as there only two hotels nearby. It has 5 or 6 beach shacks, but my favourite is Mike's Beach Oasis."

Good food and service here. I was intrigued as to where the river Sal reached the sea so we continued our walk south, soon we were on a totally deserted palm tree backed beach. After a mile or so we reached the river estuary and glimpsed the small village with it's collection of fishing boats. A lovely beach, totally undeveloped other than a couple of hotels and shacks at it's northern end."

Mobor_Beach-Salcette_South,Neha J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,"Beautiful, White and Serene beach in South Goa","Decided to go to this beach after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. Stood true to the same. Mobor is one of the centrally located beaches on the South Goan coastline. White sand, extremely quiet and clean, not very crowded and strong currants.Shacks are good but there are popular hotel chains located too there.Jet skii and Parasailing  are the only water sport options available here. But is very expensive and not very good. Not an ideal place for trying water sports in Goa.We are definitely staying here or nearby on our next trip."
