We visited in October 2022. The beach was very dirty. As if, there was a party the day before.But, quieter beaches are bliss in Goa. You can get some good snaps and even swim here.

Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,Ria1104,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Friends,Best Beach to Swim in North Goa,"This beach is a flat beach with beautiful white sand. Usually you can walk deep into the sea without any risk but for some reason the day we went for a swim there, there were red flags all around and the lifeguards were warning us about rip currents. So we tried to stay as safe as possible. We had entered the beach from the entry near the Sinq Resort and this part had hardly any tourist around so we kind of had the entire beach for us. We ordered some snacks at a shack, kept our luggage there and took a quick dip. The best part of this beach I felt was the lack of crowd.....you can wear anything (even bikinis) and get zero stares from strangers. I would highly recommend this place for people staying in North Goa for swimming in this beach instead of Baga or Calangute as the sea appeared much safer here and the crowd is also much peaceful here."

Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,Ken W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Plenty of room for everyone,"The beach is huge and stretches for miles, so there's lots of room for the not too many people.  There are even some locally employed people who clear up the plastic rubbish so trying to give the turtles a chance.  This is really great as some of the other beaches are so full of litter it's terrible to see.There are a few quiet eateries along the back of the beach, and all were pretty acceptable.  No really loud music either.  Superb sunsets!!Definitely the place to come if you want to get away from it all."

Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,marian_benson,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Messy Morjim ,"I’m hoping that the debilitated state of the bars and buildings bordering the beach is a result of the typhoon and adverse weather, but think that this is most likely not the case. The beaches were filthy and plastics, aerosols and broken glass were in abundance. The first sand was oily and there was no evidence of a daily sweep. We had expected this in Delhi and other smaller towns, but not on the coast. The lifeguard was present as the seas were too dangerous to swim in. It certainly is not a haven of white sand and blue sea. "

Enjoy the sunset and that's the best time to come back coz everything thing closed around 7 or so.This calm and Serene beach takes  your breath away. Everytime I visit Goa I ensure I state close to morjim coz of the clear water and less crowd.If you a person who loves quality couple time on a holiday with exceptional ambiences then I would recommend you must visit 😁"

Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,travellingTOM,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,"Warm sea, miles of sandy beaches",Morjim is 1.5 hour drive from GOA airport. You can get there by taxi. Cost 1500 Rs. The place is quite nice. Beaches are big and long with not many people on them. Sea is very warm. Price wise is rather cheap + there is a choice of places you can go and have some fun. Obviously most of them are far from being luxurious - but I don't think you go to GOA for luxury. Stayed in a place called Naga Cottage 30$/night - really not bad for this price. All in all if you want to escape from the city and crowded places GOA and Morjim is a good choice.
Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,Ishit Shah,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Realx and enjoy your swimming at Morjim,"Safest sea in North Goa. if you don't know swimming, even you can enjoy your fun of sea here.

It's broad enough that when you walk down the length of it you are nowhere near the shacks or the sunbathers.The shore has a gradual incline, no sudden dips or drops. At least not as of Jan 2019. One never knows if the monsoon changes something."

Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,Ashish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Early morning walk,Morjim is one of the most beautiful and peaceful beaches of North Goa...We went from Siolim in early morning which is around 7 km by scooty...Scooty should be park at a distant location may be 500 metres away as the road is sandy which creates big problem in driving which often leads to skidding..Take precautions which i stated...Its better to go by walking...As we entered beach during sunrise...I cannot explain you the ultimate feel of  peace and joy inside our hearts..The ear appealing sound of waves and breezes was one of the most cherished moment we had here from mother nature...The whole beach was quite with full of natural beauty and serenity around....We could see shells of turtles..One of the localite told us that female turtle comes here in full moon to lay eggs....If by chance someone gets to know about the area where eggs are layed then a person can inform to police...Police safeguards that area and rewards the person...After 3 months female turtle comes back to take her babies..We were so happy to know about this rule of Goa which protects harmony of nature....It was wonderfull for brisk walks and jogging....Rays of sun falling and waves coming towards makes this place just like a paradise...You can take lot  of beatiful pictures as nature makes ur frame more beautiful visually..I would recommend everyone to go here and see this natural gift to our earth from God..

Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,Raju Muthuswamy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Flat Ocean Floor!!!,"This was my first visit to this beach which is a haven for nesting Olive Ridley turtles.I was just exploring unknown beaches (not visited by me) and I reached this one!The beach is quite a big one.There are life guards at the beach (as are at most of the beaches frequented by tourists).The advantage of this beach is that the sea floor falls away from the beach very, very gently at a shallow angle (another example is the Colva beach in South Goa close to Margao/Madgaon city)This presents a beautiful opportunity for swimmers to wade in to the sea up to their waists and swim parallel to the beach. (Parallel and not into the sea or towards the beach which will be with or against the current - please read up on this technique before attempting it. I am not a good swimmer so I stick to the shallows and swim parallel to the beach).The sand is good. Not that bad. You will find some parts with dark sand, too! 😀.One factor to take into consideration is that there is a river meeting the sea at the southern end of this beach. So, the currents can be unpredictable. This meeting point between the river and the sea also sends the waves in a circular motion at the southern end wherein the waves hit the beach and turn north towards the beach proper and back west into the sea.So, in my opinion it is better to enjoy oneself in the centre of the beach rather than at the extreme southern end.The river that meets the sea at the southern end of the beach is the Chapora River.I found some toilets and baths which were under construction and not operational during this visit.The shacks on the beach have makeshift bathrooms, showers in the open to wash off the sand and toilets (portable toilet booths).As far as food is concerned, there are several shacks on the beach which serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes along with liqueur.Also, there a few handcarts/temporary food joints at the entrance to the beach which sell coconut water, chips, cold drinks and maggi ( our favourite from Ladakh to Morjim!)"

It's possibly the loveliest beach we've ever been to. It's peaceful and calm and, although the sea looks rough, it's lovely to swim in and the sand is even underfoot. "

Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,Louisa V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Very clean and beautiful!,A very long beach that is extremely clean compaired to some of the other beaches in North Goa.  Quite a wide beach from the shacks/resturants to the shore you come down onto soft dry sand then about 100mtrs or so you are down to the shore line.  The beach is mainly flat with rock mounds only visable when the tide is out so giving some lovely rock pools to look at.  You see many people walking up and down the beach and if you're up early enough then you get to see the amazing sight of people doing yoga down at the shore line in the soft yellow sun of a morning - blissful 😊

Morjim_Beach-Morjim_North,Isabellajackson,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Litter,"This beach is better than most, but still ruined by litter and groups of male Indian tourists staring at females whilst attempting to blatantly take photographs of females.You can still find an area not disturbed by beach shacks and loud music but you will still find rubbish in the sea ( if it has been a rough sae).The Indian tourists can be seen openly just throwing away their empty bear bottle on to the sand...On the days I went to this beach I always collected litter from the sea and beach. I do recommend this area, but please respect it and take your litter home with you."
