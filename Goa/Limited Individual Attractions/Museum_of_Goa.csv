Museum_of,Elvis C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Art 🎭,"Time well spent if your interested in art. It's slightly offbeat location means that it has to find special place in your itinerary.No restaurants in a 15min radius, though it has a cafe in case you're hypoglycemic like me.They have a spot on the ground floor for souvenirs and another in case one wants to paint one of their miniature pieces. Semi air-conditioned, well kept and clean overall.They have workshops ever so often. "
Museum_of,SD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,Enjoyable and knowledgeable 1 hour museum trip,"- Excellent museum and likeable to all people incl. infrequent museum visitors.- It shows a short documentary film about the museum's artist/owner background.- Museum houses good paintings, art work (shell and worn out Tyre based).- Got kids section for hands on painting of the souvenirs (it is chargeable)- Entry ticket is 200 Rs. / person but worth it.- Souvenirs cost is little high but worth having it.This museum visit will not disappoint and it is worth visiting even for the non-art people."

Museum_of,Sophie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 • Friends,An unforgettable must-do in Goa!,"To come across MOG was truly an unforgettable experience. We spent the afternoon looking through amazing contemporary art across 3 floors and a rooftop, sipped on chai in their sculpture park while checking out some local artists working there, and taking home beautiful souvenirs and art pieces (yes, they have art for sale made by local artists!) Couldn't recommend it more highly. Subodh Kerkar & his team are doing an outstanding job with MOG!"
Museum_of,wandererlust,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Family,The history of Goa,"This is one place that has to be a must visit when you are traveling to North Goa.

I really enjoyed the place, I suggest you watch the video explaining the artist as it helped to understand the art. I am not really a tate modern type of person but I thought the museum was really thought provoking. I loved the fisherman black and white photos and if I could have got one back to the UK I would have bought one. So glad we were travelling independently as spent a lot longer than I thought we would here."

Museum_of,Annie W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,What a surprise,"I was staying just ten minutes walk away, so decided to visit. The museum is located in the middle of a low key industrial estate, all quite odd! But what a surprise when I strted to look around. Subodh Kerkar's work is absolutely stunning! I'm not a fan od conceptual art usually, but the way he blends his deep understanding of culture and nature with a use of both traditional and contemporary materials is unique. I ended up spending over three hours there. the shop is very nice and has some good things for sale with lovely, friendly and informative staff.  The cafe, just by the entrance, is simple but pleasant and makes for a break if you want to spend a long time looking around.One tip,if you're into photography, go for the outside exhibits early morning so that you don't get everything burned out by harsh midday light.If you're in Candolim it's about a 15 minute, 400 rupees cab ride - and well worth it."
Museum_of,museum of goa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,One of the largest contemporary art spaces in India,"the Museum of Goa should be a must on the Goa trip itinerary of any art lover.

Museum_of,Neha Jain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Art lover’s paradise ,"After seeing MOG’s unusual hoardings everywhere I can’t resist myself to visit this place. And after visiting this art lover’s paradise I am so happy that I didn’t miss this opportunity during my Goa trip. Mr Subodh Kerkar is the proud owner of this private museum which has 100₹ entry charge. Being an artist myself I enjoyed various art installations , paintings, murals, old rubber tyre art pieces and the display of paintings by other artists. The best part is that my young children also loved the positive vibes of this place and enjoyed snacks at the cosy small cafe in the museum premise . For an enthusiastic artist the MOG should be in the list of must visit places of Goa . I am very happy that I get the chance to meet Mr Subodh Kerkar and had a little talk with him regarding various arts. "
Museum_of,Nvz14,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,MOG,"Was pleasantly surprised by the Museum of Goa, Subodh Kerkar’s attempt at bringing Goa to the masses through contemporary art. Unlike most museums in India, MOG manages to give you a museum experience. The displays are interesting and captions well written. The introduction film sets the background for the visit. The museum shop had some interesting things. I would suggest they keep stamps that visitors could use on the postcards and maybe even offer to post the cards. Worth the visit. "

Museum_of,kapurvandana70,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,Great Contemporary art !,Its in an industrial estate area. 30mins from Candolim. Great sculptures. Informative. The best part is the outdoor area. Very well made. The tickets cost Rs 100/- for Indians. And Rs 300/- for international tourists. It closes at 6pm. The timing should be extended as casinos & other places are open till late. There is a small cafe in the building where you can try coffee. Car parking is available.

Museum_of,Rohit Parashar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,A must visit place in Goa!,"Beautifully conceptualised, executed and maintained property.

Well, a visit to Museum of Goa must surely be added to your list of a 'must see'. Director of the museum Subodh Kerkar's thought process while documenting the history of Goa, is very interesting. You will be transported to another era with his amazing sculptures, photographs & a collection of paintings by other artists."
Museum_of,Rachita G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Very beautiful place !,"The place is a modern art gallery. Very interesting to see how they have used waste material and discarded items to create all the exhibits.

Museum_of,Nanditasr,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,"Funky, with interesting snippets","The place is more a modern art gallery than a museum. Very interesting to see how they have used waste material and discarded items to create all the exhibits. The short film is a great way to understand the philosophy and approach of the artist-cum-curator, Dr. Subodh Kerkar. Much of Goa's (and India's) history and culture is reflected in this modern art, right from the humble chilli, to cotton, to ""Roman Catholic Brahmins"". The place is a bit remote, and very few people seem to know of it, so be sure to have your own transport (or walk 5 km, as I did) and Google maps!"
Museum_of,ninamukherji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Museum of Goa - must see,"Museum of Goa is located in North Goa. A pleasant building with multiple stories. The theme is on Goa, it's links to its Portuguese past, the sea and other quirky things. The sea formed a major part  of the artworks and display. Some fascinating bits of work included the chinaware rare pieces which the artist had placed at the bottom of the ocean in a metal cage for 6 months. He says that when he removed them he found the ocean had filled them with oysters and states that the ocean is a partner in creating his artwork. Another very interesting piece was the Natals display.. The staff were very helpful and gave interesting nuggets of info about the art that was on display. I loved the colourful chillies hanging from the ceiling and the pepper cross. The carpet of mussel shells was dynamic and enchanting and the wall made of plastic bottles (made to look like a wall of wild flowers) was unexpectedly beautiful.  The artist Subodh Kekkar was there when we went. He was very friendly, down to earth and easy to talk to. There's a little cafe attached to the museum. The top floor had a lovely view of the surrounding area - trees and homes surrounding the gallery. They conduct several talks and workshops as well. Though it's not a very large museum and one can do it in 45 minutes to an hour. I would suggest taking an hour or a little more to walk around and soak in the beautiful works of this museum. The place has a soothing and calming atmosphere about it. There is a small store attached that sells prints, natural soaps, jewellery and a few other things. Thoroughly enjoyed this visit to the museum and hope to go there again sometime."
Museum_of,K.C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Interesting,"While all of the art was by a single artist, the entire concept and range of work was interesting and interactive. A good hour or so spent exploring Goa through the artist viewpoint, there is also a cafe cafe where one can have a cuppa tea to ponder upon the artworks."

Museum_of,Ajeet N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Museum mediocare,"Visiting the museum is an arduous journey from panji along curvaceous rustic roads. It would have been worthwhile had the exhibits been extraordinary. The theme is 'the sea' woven around the culture of goa. Some exhibits in wood are good. Tyre art is unique. The painting section is about fisher women. Gandhi's heartbeat was a nice concept, but the rate is too low at 38."
Museum_of,JonPeele,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,Worth the trip!,The museum of Goa is a very pleasant building with multiple stories and has artwork inside and outside the building.   I was impressed with how well the library was kept and how helpful the staff were in explaining the pieces.

Do not be put off by the Industrial Estate address.
Museum_of,Manish K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"An art gallery, not a museum, but worth a visit","To begin with, two clarifications are in order:1. Museum of Goa is not a museum, but a private art gallery.2. It is not located in Saligao, but in Pilerne Industrial Estate, though not too far from Saligao.Museum of Goa is housed in a single building with 4 levels. It houses a rich collection of artwork by the owner, depicting incidents in Goa's history and people's lifestyle. Many of the sculptures are truly eye-catching, of which ones that stood out to me were Goa's Ark, the Motorcycle Pilot, Old Man and the Fish and the Chillies installations.Apart from that, there was also a good collection of paintings by the owner's father, a noted artist in his own right. Many items are for sale. The place has a friendly vibe and is a good place to spend approx. 1.5 hours. The entrance fees is Rs. 100 for Indians and there are no separate charges for photography.I found the various artworks to be well-organized and enticing interest. Kudos to the owners for the same. That said, there is an outdoor gallery and some other artworks still being worked on. It should be an even better place, once these are complete. The place also has a small cafe, but it was closed when I visited."
Museum_of,Shandy49,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Stunning pieces by the owner/artist,An art gallery including imaginative pieces of recycled art including sculptures paintings and large installations.

It has an entrance fee before you can see the gallery. I liked some of his creativity on canvas and sculptures with modern art. Some of the arts inspired by Gandhi made of wooden spikes is interesting. Three floors full of paintings and art work from Mr. Kerkar who himself sits there. Most of the work displayed is available for Sale at a price. If you love art, it is a place I can recommend with some fresh ideas on creativity!"

Museum_of,Gunjan S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Fun way to know more about Goa,"When I discovered that the price to enter this museum was 100 bucks,  I was surprised! I mean this is expensive, just to visit a museum. But as I encounter artworks one after the other, I was amazed by the hard work put behind it. Every artwork was different and unique. I got to learn a lot about Goa here. Totally worth visiting this place! "
Museum_of,Menaka M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Very nice place ,"MOG is superb place to visit. Even the kids love it... there are so many things made with spoons, with waste material and with many more things. "
Museum_of,Indira D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,A welcome initiative in the limited Goa art scene,"An attractive installation of giant chillies made of different textiles at the arrival hall of Dabolim airport is a good way to pique people's interest in this new addition to the Goa art scene. It certainly did get me curious, and I made it a point to take time out for a visit during my recent trip. Located not so far from Saligao or the Calangute beach belt, a trail of blue mermaids at strategic points form markers to find the museum, which is located in the Pilerne industrial area. But do keep in mind, it is not some place that is easily accessible ( given Goan taxis charge a bomb for the shortest possible distance) without your own transport. The collection on display is quite an interesting and eclectic mix of sculpture, paintings and installations which make for artists' expression of what Goa mean to them. But the building itself is quite uninspiring and already had huge damp patches on the top level ceiling right at the start of the monsoon season. Not a good sign for a new building which houses a  collection of expensive artwork. Staff around too looked a little disinterested considering this is a brand new initiative. I like to be optimistic and hope these are just teething problems, and this museum will soon become the must visit destination for all art lovers visiting Goa."

Museum_of,Dextron17,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Private art gallery,The name is a misnomer its a private art gallery and not a museumHowever the art collection is thoughtful and worth a viewVisit if you would like a dive into the historical past of Goa
Museum_of,chintarao,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,A Misnomer,"Museum of Goa it is not. It is one artist's private gallery, housing mostly his own works. And like in any gallery -- and unlike any museum -- all the works are for sale. The quality of the art is a matter of opinion and taste, but that this is not the museum of Goa -- or even a museum of Goa -- is certain. If you're interested in Goan history and culture visit one of the several museums in Goa. They may not be the world's best, but they are what they purport to be. "
Museum_of,alzoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Business,Art works very pleasant,"Although it was located very far from my place of stay ; spent one evening there to have a look at the various art works there. Very entertaining as we had a guide too ,who went into the intricacies of many of the works there. So a very enlightening visit . One can meander around and get a good feel of the whole museum .If one plans to go after dark , make sure you know the way , it's pretty confusing and not a lot of people on the streets know of it!"
Museum_of,Jaybird,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Inspirational Art,"British visitors would call this an art gallery rather than a museum but so much of the inspiration for the works is based on a deep understanding and influence of the culture and where it is rooted within world history. I found many of the pieces both fascinating and moving at the same time. It is worth watching the film show right through as the undeniable enthusiasm of the owner is contagious, perhaps something he understands from his past life as a doctor. Visit with an open mind. Take time to read the descriptions and understand the message being conveyed"
Museum_of,Mary P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Lovely space,I love wondering around this place.  The artwork does change but some of the long term exhibits are really quirky and interesting

Museum_of,Sibel A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Good & teaching video is fine,We visited the museum and at the beginning we read that 3 times a day a video show is present and finished our visit when 13.00 oclock video is started it was useful.I learned there thst the first ship in the world was built to carry the King Keops of Eigpt to his grave pyramit .I have been to Eigpt but did not learn this there. Navy part of the museum was better.Fans work well and it was cooler thsn outside.Clean toilets inside.Very cheap tickets.
Museum_of,kavanshah007,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Not worth if you are not art lovers ,"We had visited museum on 5th December 2016. It's private museum located in industrial area. Location is very weird,as there is nothing else to see near by. You go specially to see this museum. Also there is entry ticket of 100Rs per person. And as I am not art lover I did not like it much. "
Museum_of,Samuel C O,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,Very Interesting and Worth visiting,I visited this place in Aug 2016. It was such a surprise to me. This was my first visit to a museum of Contemporary Arts. It just gave me a great deal of joy that day. Worth visiting the place. The artist is just a awesome person. I cant put a lot of those things I saw and felt in words. It is definitely a place worth visiting in Goa.
Museum_of,BobbyDesai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016,Lovely evening of Jazz and cocktails,"Some friends took me to this lovely property in the middle of an industrial estate that houses an art gallery and offers the space out for theatre and music. There was a Dutch jazz band that played some great music led by a vivacious dead and trumpet playing lady who spoke flawless English despite being of Dutch origin. There were snacks and sangrias and assorted cocktails on sale at reasonable prices and the Dutch couple who run the place, Noreen and Jack were very warm and welcoming. A must visit place the next time you have an evening free in Goa."
Museum_of,MMtravels,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,Eclectic collection of modern art,"I really liked this gallery. It was a refreshingly different way of showing off Goa. His passion for supporting young artists and making it available, as well as appreciated, by all walks of society is commendable. I quite liked that it was in the industrial estate - stress free parking and lots of space. It's very well signposted or there are helpful blue statues on the side of the road along the way to confirm that you are on the right track. Well worth the visit. It is only a modest entry fee. Most of the art is by the founder but don't let that put you off. Subodh has very broad talents using all types of media and his works are fabulous. "

Museum_of,nandini vaidyanathan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,A place which is all heart,"When Anil and I went for a documentary on Amrita Shergill to MoG, dome six months ago we were surprised to see a place of this kind in the thick of an industrial area. Subodh and his wife Sarita had come home for lunch one Sunday and they had mentioned that MoG had just been opened and it was the largest gallery of personal art. In this case out of all Subodh's creations. Paintings, photographs, sketches, lithographs, installations, sculptures-you name it,  it's all there, created, curated  and displayed. I have met very few people like Subodh, one who has both artistic sense and commercial sensibility in abundance. And I'm hoping he will builds this place into a vibrant engaging creative hub, like none other. He is already on track, every sunday they organise programmes which are interesting, a bit hatke as we say in Hindi, and engaging. On 7th august for instance, we met a young couple, Kyla and Tavish who presented a short form of theatre which lasted probably ten mins and it was mostly possible conversations. They have music classes, art classes, lectures, documentaries, conversations. The world suddenly is filled with exciting possibilities and it is really hard top keep track of everything that's happening around us. So it's awesome that people like Subodh are curating to bring them on a platter so our generation does not have to have FOMO!!! And that he's doing it in a gorgeous place like MoG, well , what can one say except a thunderclap and a prayer, may his tribe increase!!!One sour note however. Don't like either the way their cafe looks or does (Om Made Cafe). Please get them to revamp or get someone who fits into your ethos, Subodh. "
Museum_of,0103Annie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,“Don't Miss This Museum!”,"If you like arts and want to see one of the best Museum in Goa, don´t miss the MOG. You should spare a good 3 to 4 hours to visit it. Great examples of Art by Subodh Kerkar, he is the founder Director of MOG. You can plan to spend an entire day there with the options of Cafe and shop. We had not originally planned to visit the MOG on our recent trip to GOA, just because we did not have time. But we found ourselves in the general area with an hour or so to kill, and decided to go for it! We were so glad we did! What a great museum! Loved this museum. Every room has amazing pieces that I was so excited to see. I love spices art the most. Best part is they also taking classes. I wish to join one day. Entry fee is veryyy veryyy reasonable. Treat for an art lover. Great. Must go. Thanks . "
Museum_of,Pushkar L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,A must visit for Art lovers,"Subodh Kerkar is a well know name, not just in Goa but across the art landscape of India and the world. Museum of Goa is his baby. Situated in an unlikely place- a dull industrial estate, this art space has been constructed with thought and passion. The three storied building houses many installations/artworks/paintings etc by Kerkar and other artists as well. The wall panels are well descriptive and the art works are quite interesting. However there is almost no interactive element in the works displayed. A small cafe provides some real food after one has had quite some 'food for thought' going through the museum displays! I would like to see some affordable small arty stuff to buy from the art shop though. Overall, time well spent!"
Museum_of,The_Wanderlust_Story,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,A must visit for history and art lovers,"It was an unplanned visit. We took a detour while looking for a petrol pump and found this gem. It's located in an industrial estate, an odd place for a musuem. But as soon as you enter, you forget the industrial part and find yourself in a world of arts and creativity. They have portrayed the history of Goa and life of Goans down the centuries through wonderful paintings, sculptures and artifacts. A must visit place for art and history buffs. They have many activities for artists, kids and art  enthusiasts. I absolutely loved spending time there and learning about Goa, its history and culture."

Museum_of,LiverpoolTrish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016,Nice way to spend a couple of hours,"From Candolim you can get a bus to Pilerne from outside the football ground opposite Newtons supermarket and ask the bus lad to give you a shout for the museum. It is a bit of a walk from the bus stop though, we got a tuk tuk who waited for us there and brought us back for 500. Lot's of nice things to see there, it is lovely and cool inside and has a nice outside area where you can have refreshments, and we got to meet the artist himself who was lovely and friendly."
