There is no guide but little plaques with some information about aeroplanes, engines and few naval ships. Better to visit early morning or post 4/5pm as the museum is out in the open and itâ€™s very hot during mid day. Also carry good amount of cash as they do not accept cards or online payments and there are lot of souvenirs to shop from!"

Naval_Aviation_Museum-Mormugao_North,Vikrant,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Interesting. Must visit place.,"I was lucky enough to pay this place a visit on my trip to Goa. It is little known attraction near to the airport. In fact it is the only one of its kind in India.The cost is minimal, although there is an extra even smaller charge for a camera license.Was bigger, and better laid out than I had expected, and is a good history of Indian Naval Aviation. Lots of retired aircraft on static display, as well as various aero engines and missiles etc.There is a cafÃ©, and well maintained toilet facilities. Lots of parking is also available.Despite the midday heat it was an enjoyable few hours of mostly unknown aviation history. If you are an enthusiast, or even have a mild interest. Itâ€™s a great excuse to do something away from the beach for a few hours."

Naval_Aviation_Museum-Mormugao_North,ShvRm_Traveller,,,,"The Naval Aviation Museum is a must visit for the reason that the people hardly get to see these aircrafts anywhere else.Hardly anyone knows what the Navy does and being an Indian it must be a must visit place for all the young children atleast! The place is well maintained, though I think that it could be portrayed in a grander way and style considering that it is a reflection of India's defence armoury. Perhaps, the presence of educated guides who could explain how and when these marvels have been used in the past by Indian Navy would make a lot of difference in the experience.Visit during early morning or late afternoon hours so that there is respite from heat!You probably will have to exclusively plan for this as I don't think there are any nearby places to visit.ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³"

This museum is taken care by the Indian Navy and is a popular tourist attraction.This military museum showcases the rich history of the Indian Naval forces. There were security guards guarding this place. After receiving the entrance tickets, had seen many fighter jets, helicopters etc. that were used by the Indian Navy. It has armaments, weapons, sensors and vintage photographs. Also, there is a replica of INS Viraat warship as well as a mini AV room for the students. This museum caters to the school & college students, aviation enthusiasts, inquisitive tourists, dignitaries etc. Later on, had tea at Cockpit Cafe located within the premises. The entry fees are Rs. 30 per adult, Rs. 10 per child, Rs. 15 per student, Rs. 25 for mobile camera, Rs. 40 for still camera and Rs. 80 for videography.This museum is an interesting, but neglected place in Goa.

Naval_Aviation_Museum-Mormugao_North,Vikrant,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 â€¢ Couples,Love them planes!!,"It was disappointing to see the plight of this so called museum when I visited this last month. Though it seems to have a good collection of planes, their condition was truly pitiful. Rotting machinery all over. I even saw a man standing atop the wing of a plane clicking selfie. Come on! A museum should be engaging and interactive, but here it is left to the visitor to read through a ton of text, and I am sure not many do so as they are busy clicking pics. Honestly, that's what I did too. Because it is so far from other Goan hotspots, it is pointless to explicitly plan a visit to this museum unless you are traveling from or to Goa Airport, which is at stone's throw. I would not recommend folks to visit this museum."

When enquired, the staff told that the covers are put to protect planes from rusting and rain. They will uncover the aircraft after monsoons by end of Aug. Good effort to maintain the planes in these heavy rains also."

Naval_Aviation_Museum-Mormugao_North,Vikrant,,,,"My boyfriend is a big aviation enthusiast and we agreed to go to the museum for a couple of hours. The reviews we had read said that the place was fun, but that it lacked maintenance, and we will have to agree. My boyfriend was super excited about seeing the planes and getting up close, but they were unfortunately in a dreary state.There are no modern aircrafts.Inside you get to learn about Indian military aviation history, however not in a chronological order so to me it seemed a bit messy. There are fans downstairs and air condition upstairs.The place is affordable and a fun thing to do if you want to do something besides lying on the beach and you are a aviation enthusiast!However, it would have been a whole lot better experience had they just kept the clean and maintained the aircrafts. Such a great potential for a cool museum!"

,,,,,I havenâ€™t seen a Super Constellation in decades. Iâ€™m always surprised at the size relative to Airliners today. Itâ€™s a bit rough from thirty years outside. I didnâ€™t try to get inside; it was wired shut. Really cool Russian Autogyro Helicopter. I saw one at the Airport so they might still use them. Harriet Jump Jet too. If this isnâ€™t worth 50 rupees what is?I had lunch here because the food looked good and it was the cheapest price Iâ€™ve seen anywhere in India. Spot on attraction.

This place was of his intrest  and very informative to him.The real old Aircrafts are maintained well.The exibits can be touched and felt.the place is neatly maintained.there are models of Aircraft carriers and warships also. There was previously entry for an passenger  aircraft but presently they have closed it. Hope they would open it so that kids can have a look of its cockpit. It is located right behind the Goa Airport. we got a chance of spotting one fighter jet take off right from the museum."
