Old,Sandy_JSR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,History & Heritage,"North Goa houses most popular and crowded beaches like Baga, Calungute etc. and numerous pubs & restaurants and thereby becomes first choice for the tourists. On the other hand, South (Old) Goa contains several famous and heritage churches including Basilica of Bom Jesus which contains the relics of Saint Francis Xavier, Se Cathedral, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, etc. These churches are generally noiseless. We stayed at North Goa and hired a vehicle for a day trip to South Goa that included visit of Old Goa churches, Panjim city and its beaches etc. Old Goa is a lovely city with rich history and heritage. It was worth taking a break from crowded beachside to witness rich history and heritage of Old Goa."

Old,TarlCaboto,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Worth a short visit if you are bored of beaches,Old Goa is basically full of churches dating back to the Portuguese colonial times.

Old,Raymond W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,More Than Just Bom Basilica,"Most domestic tourists congregate at Bom Basilica, which is extremely crowded at all hours of the day. A few make it across the road to the Se Cathedral. The other sights of Old Goa are very quiet and peaceful. We had several World Heritage churches to ourselves. For lovers of peace and quiet, try the Augustinian Convent ruins, the beautiful interior of Cajetan Cathedral or the charming Viceroy's Arch. "
Old,vdhoot,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,charming part of town,"If you happen to be in Goa and spend all the time at the beaches, you may have missed something. a saunter through Old Goa can take you back in time quickly and how.. Don't miss the Basilica church and the even more stunning ruins of the St Augustine Church that collapsed in 1832 out of neglect as the Portuguese rulers banned Augustinian friars from the country drove decades earlier. The ASI is seeking to restore the beautiful complex, with original tablets still intact inside.  The Archaeological Museum is also interesting, though we were a bit surprised it's closed on all Fridays. Plan accordingly. "

Old,alex_24sh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Churches & Convents of Goa: UNESCO World Heritage Tour Plan on Motorbikes,"The seven WHS objectives lie within a 10-15min walking distance circle; however a more convenient and ""local"" way to explore them is by rented scooters. We started in early afternoon from Calangute and after a 50min trip we reached Old Goa quarters. The road was pretty tough with alternating clogged village and faster expressway segments, but in the end manageable even for beginners like us. We didnt spot any western-style cafes or restos around, so consider bringing some F&B along. 1. Basilica de Bom Jesus, Se Cathedral, Church of St Francis de Assisi, The Chapel of St CatherinePark your bikes in front of the shops by the entrance of Basilica de Bom Jesus, then after visiting it cross the main road to Se Cathedral and Church of St Francis de Assisi. These three churches make out the main touristic core of the site, so be prepared for the usual dose of noisy tourists, loud guides, and colonial opulence. Head towards The Chapel of St Catherine for a more tuned-down feeling, an ochre-colored small jewel nestled in its own small garden where tourist flows recede and the magic of olden days starts to work its way through. Enjoy a well-deserved hydration break with coconuts and plenty of water at the small shop just in front of the exit.2.  Church of St CajetanA short few minutes ride through the forest will lead straight to  the Church of St Cajetan. Despite its being modeled after Vatican's monumental San Pietro, the virtual absence of tourists will allow for an improved spiritual experience of the place. As you exit the church's compounds, head down right for a short glimpse of the Viceroy's Arch.3. Our Lady of the Rosary, Church and Monastery of St AugustineHead back the same way and up the small hilly road ending in the small, but exquisite Our Lady of the Rosary. If you are lucky enough to arrive here jist before sunset, then you are in for a treat. The silent, breezy halls filled with art and history. The view of the river with its lush forrested banks slowly filling with mist and mistery. What remains of St Augustine's is not much, but the scenic tower with the sun setting through its arches does make for a sight to remember. You can easily take the road leading to Panaji, and through some scenic old villages with goan mansions and portuguese chapels, just from St. Augustine's. Allow for plenty of unwind & relax time once back to your accommodation area to make up for the energy well spent."
Old,AniKNar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Unusual place!,This is an unusual place with churches and actually only churches! So don’t expect to find an old town. But the history is interesting and we recommend taking a guided walking and driving tour. We took ‘Make it Happen’ and Anthony was a excellent guide. Wear above knees and cover your shoulders! There’s not much to see in Goa so this can be recommended and worth a half day!
Old,michaelkP3149LN,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples, Very  average ,"Old Goa like Panjim nearby has seen better days, scruffy and faded. Although reflecting a period in history looking back we wonder if worth while bothering.For Panjim and Old Goa sad to say the cruise liners have it right.Half a day for some photos of Panjim, quite pretty, half for Old Goa.See it if you must, unlikely to be a highlight."

Visiting the old Churches (very very old) and as well the Fontanos Goa village was memorable. The Portugese architectures of the houses and a few restaurants there are located in a secluded quiet area. However please note the people residing in this old goa village are not very friendly.

From here it is an easy walk to the Se Cathedral and the archeological museum. We got a good idea how the city was laid out 400 years ago. The architecture of the churches is Portuguese. They are in good condition,  but not much is left of the once bustling city around them. The ruins of the destroyed Augustine monastery are still impressive. "

In a guide, it said, the jungle is retrieving back the town, which is very true. But just outsid the town, we discovered a plantation, which was a fantastic discovery. Old Goan buildings in the 3rd generation, and the ownder knew every plant and it's healing power and poeple from all over Goa come there to eat, as he makes genuine old Goan food as it was made 200 years ago. To see the nice  and fantastic things in India, you just have to go by yourself on a scooter or find a local who takes you around. And then it's great!"

Old,Pushpendra K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,The Picturesque Architecture,"Goa’s former capital was considered the ‘Rome of the East’. You can still sense that grandeur, as you wander what’s left of the city, with its towering churches and cathedrals. Its rise under the Portuguese, from 1510, was ephemeral, as cholera and malaria outbreaks, forced the abandonment of the city in the 1600s. It is a UNESCO World heritage site. Managed really well. Clean and good place to relax and study Portuguese rule in Goa. Some of the most imposing churches and cathedrals are still in use and are remarkably well preserved, while other historical buildings have become museums or simply ruins. It’s a fascinating day trip, but it can get crowded: consider visiting on a weekday morning. White washed Goa Cathedral and “Basilica of Bom Jesus” are the must visit places!Fused with Christian and Muslim culture, the Old Portuguese architecture have turned up to be cute guesthouses on clean narrow lanes behind the busy seashore road with the views of the offshore casinos and island backdrops. There are plenty of inexpensive shops for clothes, electronics and street food. . There are activities available near this place at Diwar Ferry point; where one can opt for Crocodile and Backwater sight-seeing by boat. Fantastic experience guaranteed"

Interesting things you will find here is basilica of bom Jesus, Se cathedral, museum of Christian art, wax world museum, St Augustine remains, and much more.  But u won't find any beach here if you are wondering. Apart from this you can visit divar island by taking a free ferry ride from the viceroys arch,  there is a peaceful and serene beauty across the mandovi river,  which you can watch from many points in old Goa.

Old,KUCH N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Best Place,"Old Goa to immerse in southern European splendor. From the early 16th century, during the evangelization of Asia, this land endured one of the most violent crusades ever witnessed in India. The same era also brought in styles of Renaissance and Baroque architecture to India. That legacy, under the aegis of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and also classified as UNESCO World Heritage Sites stands tall in Old Goa today. A region that enthralls tourists with its calm, beautiful buildings surrounded by huge swathes of green landscapes—that and more is Old Goa."

Old,Sarah247100,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Average as far as history goes,"I have been fortunate to travel to many places and I always enjoy seeing historic parts of countries. Old Goa was not at the top of the list by any means.  The buildings that are meant to be heritage sites are not really looked after, they are not clean or well kept.   The whole place is littered with rubbish? Why are the Indian government not paying for people to litter pick, maintain and clean the churches? The chapel was probably the best kept and the gardens there were delightful.  One of the churches would not allow tourists as they had a sermon on. Also if you wear sleeveless items, over the knee, shorts, t-shirt, you are considered inappropriate and cannot enter the church.  I feel India could make more money from tourism if they keep places like Old Goa in good order and more signs explaining the history. "

Old,HeyJude433,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Old buildings,Old buildings crowded with people. It has some picturesque walks and is quite a busy street trading area. It’s the sort of place you visit once.

Old,Beattiebear,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Worth half a day visit - go early to avoid the heat ?,Seems there is often onfusion between velha goa (a town) and old goa which is the former colonial capital and an interesting collection of religious / historic buildings approx. 500 years old. It's busy (isn't everywhere in India). Therefore recommend a walk up to St Augustine tower. This building is more ruin than building but farther from the madding crowd so much quieter and some nice views.
Old,Shital S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Original Goa,"I am writing this review quiet late.. almost after 4 yrs.. The reason was my recent visit to Goa.. Goa is a tourist attraction.. which has everything for all ages.. for varied interest ppl.. The visit of Goa is incomplete without visiting old Goa..Once ur vehicle enters the old Goa.. The Air, The Feel everything changes.. Visit churches and explore the original Goa.."
Old,Suzan Badgley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Colourful Historic Portuguese town full of character,"Fused with Christian and Muslim culture, the old Portuguese architecture now houses cute guesthouses on clean narrow lanes behind the busy seashore road with views of the offshore casinos and island backdrops. Plenty of inexpensive shops for clothes, electronics and street food. White washed Goa Cathedral is a must just for it's spectacular size. Wondering alone as a woman I felt no worry, received open smiles and water to wash my sweaty toes. Passion for street photography? Enjoy the contrasts of colour, ruins and bright saris. Try the Step-on Step-off bus or othee long distant local rusty busses to venture to other locations!"

Old,ViaBen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,"Unique architecture, history, art and crowds","Old Goa is what is left of the Portuguese colonial capital from the 16th / 17th centuries and it is now a combination of tourist attractions, cultural heritage and Catholic pilgrimage - all surrounded by busy and bustling tourist markets.What is left is a number of big and small churches and convents in different states of repair and conservation, some used as cultural venues and tourist attractions and some still mostly places of worship.The 'centre' of Old Goa is the wide green esplanade between the Se Cathedal and Bom Jesus church that is ideal to rest, have picnics and enjoy the views.The markets at both sides of the area sell all sort of tourist tat and snack foods and the area is very, very popular with tourists and therefore can get very crowded.I recommend you reach or leave the area following the secondary road by the Mandovi river - slower than the main road, but with amazing views and a few quaint villages."
Old,Free@will,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Old world charm ,This is the real goa that one should definitely see and not the popular one that dots the beaches. Old goa is rustic yet urban. Clean and cozy. The architecture is distinctly unique with obvious traces to Portuguese rule. The churches are magnificent. The small eateries are full of flavor and fragrance. A must visit. Please visit the erstwhile palace of Adil Shah It's a magnificent edifice full of history. 
Old,frend09,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Must do,"Goa is not just about its beaches, check out Old Goa definitely, go for walks. There are heritage walks also available."
