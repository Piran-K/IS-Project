Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,TheNoelbaba,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Paradise lost,"This is my home ,once upon a time a paradise of calm ,quiet ,filled with many kinds of birds.The place has become so bad ,everynight its haunted by blaring music from the hotels on the beach ,i come to spend a week in my home but dread to go as there is no sleep at nights ,music without any rythym or sence is blaringvtill morning ,vibrating the air and the foundations of old houses.Its a pity ,looks like the environment ministry is given a blind eye to the place and the distriction of the environment"
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Ferzyn N,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Disappointing,"A rocky tiny beach, that has an access through steep steps.  Not the kinda beach that you want to go chill in your swimwear with a Budweiser in hand. The shacks are very limited, they don't offer comfort but the basic infrastructure of being in a shaded place. Not worth the trouble to head to a beach where one cant even swim as there are loads of hazardous rocks lurking below the waves.  "

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,kohlid,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,GREAT BEACH,This is an isolated beach and is difficult to access.You have to descend down from a cliff.This helps in keeping the crowds away and the beach clean! Mostly frequented by foreigners.
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Hooray H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Little Vagator,"I always knew it as Little Vagator.Made famous because of Thalassa, which had incredible views over it, perched up on the cliff behind, until they were forced to leave!Of course, the Government has provided no facilities; road/path, toilets, cleaning so you will be welcomed by the usual litter & mangy dogs- 60-70 bites a day in Goa! Check at the local Hospital or Gov Clinic, if you dare to visit!The Gov does not realise that we live in the 21st Century."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,meenakshimuthusamy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Neat place,The place is very neat and has a silent atmosphere.It has a beautiful look and good place for the time pass.
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Kokan Tourist,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Ozran Beach of North Goa,Ozran Beach is hidden beach of North Goa. Ozran Beach also call as Small Vagator. It is not very popular other North Goa Beaches. Ozran Beach appears less crowed as compare of Vagator & Anjuna Beach. You can enjoy here for swimming as well waves also. On Ozran Beach you can see a large number of Palms tree. If you go near resort there you can see rock which is curved by the Shiva Face and it's look amazing face on the rock.
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Got Keried Away,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Couples,Shiva's Face,We came to this beach to see Shiva's Face which was really cool but the beach was lovely as well. It was cleaner then Anjuna beach. We did go just at the beginning of monsoon season so there weren't many people. 
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Varsha V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Laid back beauty.,"Since we stayed at alcove resorts right on this beach, it was easily accessible for us. We just had to take a few stairs to reach the beach. It's a wonderful beach with beachrocks / boulders along the shore. It was very peaceful. We had a great time and enjoyed a beautiful sunset here. There were two shacks near the beach. other than that you won't find anything for a long stretch. If you walk along the beach, you would reach Vagator beach. It's the perfect place to relax. And if you are staying in North Goa side, take resorts with access to beaches like this. Its worth it."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Krishhere,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Beautiful beach - not crowded ,"The Ozran beach with is also called little Vagator beach or smaller Vagator beach is located between Anjuna beach and the  big Vagator beach. It is a wide stretch with rocks jutting into the sea.  Sitting on the rocks and feeling the waves come and hit you is a beautiful feeling.    During high tide, the sea comes and covers some of these rocks. The beach is more or less clean. Some stray dogs are around. The best part is that the beach is not at all crowded. Great view of the sunset. "
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Timothée H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,great,nice quaint beach very peaceful and less crowded than vagator beach. I recomend to go there in the evening like this can go for a swim and then enjoy the night life nearby

Has huge number of stairs to get down and explore the serene beach. The trance music that keeps playing at the shack is amazing. Must visit attraction.
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,rahulshonak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Rocks all over,"This is first time i went to this beach. Its located next to Vagator beach. But to reach here, you need to climb don 93 steps (counted by myself). So be aware if you taking kids along. We needed to take kids in our hands (Godi). And there were many sea plants coming out on sea shore. Doesn't appeal nice when you enter sea for fun."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Amardeep Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,"Rocks, Sands and a Nice Beach","Ozran is a beach with rocks protruding out into the sea. These rocks get submerged in the night during high tide and in the morning when the water recedes, one can see rock crabs, and few fishes that get trapped in the pool of water in these rocks. Overall a nice beach to visit."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Komator,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Very nice beach,"Ozran Beach is one of Vagator's beaches. It's very nice, quite clean, with some places to hang out and relax. When we were there, we weren't allowed to swim because of the ""strong"" waters... but in any case, it's worth."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,dmplbksh90,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Best beach ,"If you want peace and serenity, this is the place. Ozran is very peaceful place and the mild breeze relaxes you so much that you hardly feel any pressure or tension of your life. The way to reach at this beach is quite tricky and adventurous but once you reach here, it's worth the pain. This place should be on your bucket list. PS : If you are too sanskari or bhakt of Indian culture , stay away from this place. "
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,SoloMTraveler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,Must Visit,It is a tedious process to reach this beach yet worth to go there. You can reach here from vagtor beach through left side rocky area.Great place to enjoy your vacation calmly.
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,SerendipityIndia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Nice peaceful beach - a bit rocky,"Ozran is located near the more popular Vagator beach. It is not as popular and hence more calm and more peaceful.It is a bit rocky and if waves are strong, try not to go inside the sea as you may accidentally cut yourself."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,TheTravelography,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,Silent Beach To Chill and Relax,It is quite a silent beach in comparison to other beaches like Vagator or Baga. Getting there isn't easy so you'll have to come from Pappi Chulo road to get here. 
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,sachin padti,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,"Beautiful view,  just like a paradise. ","hi,  you might have visited vagator beach or the hill top parties but just close to this place there is a paradise known as Ozran. This place is not so crowded as lots of people doesn't have any idea about this place.  The best time to visit this place would be after 5 . You can also take your bike and ride to the top cliff and just sit over there and enjoy the beauty.  Check some of my recent pictures from this place and if you like them than follow me on instagram @saclorine for more.  Have a nice day. "
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Elegantslummin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,A life lesson,"You know life is a mix of rocky and serene where you got to be attentive all the time - that is Ozran. Go out of the way, enjoy, be careful of the rocks!!"
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,rkr84,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018,A nice Beach,A good and a calm beach. we went a bit late at night. at that time there was a little crowd but the restaurants at the shore was good.
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,rkmanchi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Private beach that’s secluded because of rocks. Good walks but too many dogs,"Ozran beach is a bit of a mixed bag. But that’s what I would say even about the most popular beaches in North Goa, so Ozran is worth a consideration The beach gets separated from its neighbours like Anjuna and Vagator on account of rocks on either side. This makes the beach private and sparse. The sand is blackish and the sea can be rough sometimes and a rock isn’t too far. But the shore is flat so it’s not going to drown you easily, making this beach safer. There are a few shacks and during the peak season you get the usual booze+beach bed+massage here. But the shacks have been getting away with being very irresponsible with their trash management and that attracts dogs. I haven’t ever been attacked by one but the dogs aren’t friendly with each other and you can sometimes land up in the middle of a dog fight, pun intended. If you are upto it, you can trek over the rocks on the right of Ozran and that will take you into Vagator with a great view of the Chapora Fort. This beach is larger and more habitated. Approach to Ozran beach is from the right of a resort called Alcove. "
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,rdonna100,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Rocky beach,Beach was little dirty but quaint and nice. Also it is a combination of rocks and sand at the beach so must be careful
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Anuj V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Very clear beach with black sand and rocks formation,This is also known as one of the nude beaches in Goa very close to Vagator Beach. Beach is clean with superb waves and is totally safe. There is a shack with the name of Shankar which you should avoid at all cost. Service is too slow and not at all customer friendly. Rate wise it was reasonable. No facility to take fresh water bath after enjoying in sea
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Dishaa S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,beautiful unexplored,this is one of the uneplored and hence unspoilt beached of north goa. a little rocky but brilliant. they way to the beach is through the way next to antares restaurant.

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,TrevorSaldanha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Ozran - The Little Vagator Beach,"the Ozran Beach is also called the Little Vagator Beach, because is is like an extension of the Larger Vagator Beach and can be accessed from it as well. Even though it is smaller than the Vagator Beach, Ozran is also a Very Popular Beach with quite a few Good Resorts & Beach Stalls offering you Good Local food. It is however quite Rocky & you can swim only in areas where there are no Rocks, or else it is not safe. The Beach is Clean, Calm & Serene & is good for Long Walks stretching both Vagator & Ozran, Swimming, Lounging in the Sun or enjoying the Stunning Sunsets."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,shrutiahuja9,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,One of best beaches in Goa,Must visit if you wish to enjoy the beach in a secluded environment. The food at adjoining Shiva Place is nice. Must enjoy a sunset here whenever you visit Goa.

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,SAURAV001,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,best Sun-set to view in GOA,"It's a little turning before the Agoda Fort which will take you to the best beach in North Goa. The sand itself is different from what you get in other beaches. It's soothing to your feet, doesn't feel the heat but the coldness. You can quietly sit on the rocks and enjoy the Vollyball, or you can go to Thallasa Restaurant and enjoy some exquisite cuisine of continental, if you get to get the seat. It took away my tiredness of riding during the day and enjoyed the Sun melting in the water."

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,lvs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,Nice quiet beach,"Little vagator is a small beach but quaint and laidback. Unlike the other 'throbbing' beaches of goa, only a few venture to this smallish one. Has a few shacks and one hotel overlooking the beach. Good for being in the sun, jumping into water, sunsets or just plain 'relaxing'. Safe for kifs and non swimmers. "
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,chandknee,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Small and cute,"This beach is a tiny beach, also known as 'Chhota Vagator'. Less crowded than Anjuna, it is the better beach to go to in the are. There are a lot of shacks to order food and drinks from, and to get to it once must climb down a cliff from the Vagator area."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,charlesnsc73,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Also known as little vagator,"This beach is a little hidden gem. Getting to this bit of sand is rather dramatic in the sense that uve got to climb dont a cliff...thats if u want the added drama. But now days theres a stair way right down to the beach by the side of Andares restaurant. This bit of sand is advertised on many a forum as being a topless beach...well not anymore, those days are far since over. As this aint as secluded anymore as it used to be. The beach is overlooked by some big time restaurants like Thalassa , Andares and Zaffran. So back ur bathing gear as u can enjoy a dip in the lovely warm waters followed by a beer at one of the lovely places that overlook the beach. Its a lovely place to be.....and yes the sunset at this beach is wowwww especially from the hill side view points."

It is not commercialized like other beaches, even compared to beaches like Vagator. Beautiful really. The food offered at the shacks is basic, but tasty and not over priced as in other places."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,TrevorSaldanha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,The Smaller Vagator Beach,"Ozran Beach is also called the Smaller Vagator Beach, as it is located right next to the Bigger Vagator Beach & you can easily walk along from the Vagator Beach to the Ozran Beach and back as well. The main difference between the two Beaches is that the Ozran Beach is much more Rocky than the larger Vagator Beach. The Ozran Beach however has many Resorts lining it & also has many more Restaurants & Shacks all along, where you can chill out having your drinks & savor local Goan food as well. The Sunset Views from Ozran are also scintillating, as is the case with all other Beaches on the Western Coast of India."

Spent a full day with fresh air, joyful motor boat ride a nice sea bath, and lot of enjoyment. To the left, another World famous beach, Anjuna and to the right, the 17th century made Chairs Fort are noteworthy places to visit. Simply mind blowing."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,joashu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,small peaceful beach,The Ozran is a small beach accessible after climbing down a steep flight of steps.  It also adjoins the two vagator beaches.  the separation point being a small rocy out crop that you can clamber over.  On the extreme end of the vagator beach are rock carvings made by some artist.  A turtle and a mans head supposed to represent Shiva.
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,KRohit1984,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,Crowded and dirty beach,"Had read a lot of good reviews of Ozran Beach on Trip Advisor so decided to go there. As already mentioned in most posts, to access the beach you have to climb down a load of steps.Unlike what most posts say, I found the place completely crowded and the water had a lot of sea waste. I did not even try to venture into the sea and left the place within an hour.Would recommend Ashwem beach over this place."

Most of the time it was quiet, especially in the mornings, some afternoons there seemed to be the Goan Game of who can play what the loudest, normally from the far end of the Beach near Shivas face Carving. We would visit again in March, this may be noisy in Dec/Jan when the main season and Christmas are upon it. Be aware of strong currents on some days, it nearly caught us out on one day, only a few meters into the sea. "

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,charlesnsc73,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Quiet secluded beach,This beach lies between anjuna and vagator beach. To get to this beach one has to climb down a cliff but this adds to the charm and allure of this quaint beach also known as little vagator. Up on the cliff overlooking the beach are well known hotels thalassa and ozran heights with zafran restaurant. The beach itself was nicknamed ozran after the israelies who used to frequent this beach. Used to be very popular at one time as a topless beach...But not anymore it's now one of the mainstream beaches of Goa very popular with the locals and a must visit.

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Sachin,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,A small beach down the hill,"Ozran beach is also known as Little Vagator and is a small beach interspersed with rocks and clear shallow beach. The beach is down a small hill slope and has no established pathway leading to the beach so one must be careful with children and elderly. A lot of restaurants overlook the beach from the hilltop but the beach itself has only 2-3 shacks. It's also crowded depending on time of the day with evenings being most crowded. It's worth visiting only for people who want to avoid Calangute and Candolim, not worth the venture for people looking for a happening environment. But lastly, you have a breathtaking view of a perfect sunset from the beach or the hilltop."

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Amrita M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,Fabulous beach in North Goa,"This beach is not for water sports. Ozran beach is also known as little Vagator beach and is beautiful, less crowded and perfect to hang around with buddies. There are rocks towards one side where we sat and idled away the time post spending a lot of time taking dips in the sea and running alongside the shore. The shacks here also offer the same laid back ambience. We were there for lunch and left after the sunset."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Goaexotic,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Family,Quiet & scenic,The beach is just next to Vagator but slightly tough to reach as you have to climb down around 50-70 steps to reach.The beach is clean with a few shacks.lots of popular restaurants on top of the hill which give fantastic views of the sea.Thallasa being the most poular of them.Please do not litter the beaches and keep Goa clean

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,medha_pr,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Beautiful Rocky Beach,"One of the most beautiful beaches in Goa - Nature at its best !Tip: Approach is through long, steep steps. So wouldn't advise if travelling with elderly or very small kids."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Suhas R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,Magical Sunset point!,"If you wish to witness the best sunset point in Goa you can't afford to miss this place. Once you reach the hillocks keep an eye out for a very narrow, almost missable flight of steps that leads you straight down to the Ozran beach. The beach is clean, clearly not visited much by the usual masses and is only for the chosen few who know were to go to Goa, when in Goa. Grab a beer, position yourself on the rocks, feel the spray of the waves kiss your face and wind caress your hair while you witness the majestic sunset."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Vineet B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Must visot romantic beach in North Goa,"This is one of the beat beaches in North, it is like a bay and not a very long beach. There were very few beach shacks perfectly situated, most scenic and romantic. You will have to climb down ladders to reach the beach fom parking, but worth every bit of effort."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Manish K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Solo,Nice peaceful rocky beach,"Ozran Beach is also known as the Little Vagator beach and is on the other side of the hill from the Big Vagator beach, towards Anjuna. It's a nice small beach to visit particularly during the sunrise and sunset periods. Not much crowd, but teeming with resorts and restaurants. You can spend some time on the large rocks around this beachor relax on the sands."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Nilesh S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Nice Little beach,"This beach is between Vagator and Anjuna both much famous beaches then this one but then this place is so very peaceful as less crowd and even have much much better eating place near by. Starting by name Shiva or name sake every where. Plus Restaurant like Thalassa specialize in Greek food particular Mousaka, Costly place but worth it as it sits right on top of rocks with panoramic veiw of surounding."

Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,drn85,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,Beautiful and calm beach...,"Ozran Beach is located in North Goa on the way to vagator beach. We were on the way to thalaasa and found out this beach in between. It's a great experience even though we can't experience the taste at thalaasa. The beach is nice, shallow water and can enjoy keeping in mind of the bad waves especially on monsoons. The coconut trees on the banks and the rocks  near the sands give an awesome look. Any way it was a nice  experience even though it was a serendipity."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,RomaHaryani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Serenity,"If you want to get away from the usual crowd, this place is pretty cool. Cleaner and secluded. Loved my time here.."
Ozran_Beach-Bardez_North,Jignesh P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016,Small or Little Vagator Beach.....Wrongly named as Ozran Beach...,"For sure this is one of the best place to visit in Goa. Very secluded, less crowded. You can spend hours of relaxing time here at one of the beach shacks. Though they are not very hi-fi but who cares when you are getting an awesome place to relax. This place is not easily searchable hence ask for Little Vagator Beach or Small Vagator Beach near Ozran Heights Beach Resort. "
