Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Amit Shah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Palolem Beach - The Best,One of the best beaches of South Goa and highly recommended for view and scenery.. The crystal clear waters will drive you for a lovely swimming memories... The dolphin show is the USP of this place but was supposed to start from mid October 22 and so we were bit disappointed as we visited in 1st week.. How ever the beach and sunset views will keep you occupied... There are also small beach facing huts which one can enjoy for 1 or 2 nights stay..

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Richard L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Friends,Best beach in India,Surprised that the beach has not been ruined by Russian skyscrapers. Still Indian beach life at its best. Get it while you can.
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Riju Dixit,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Disgustingly Dirty,"This beach is 100% avoidable. The main access is covered with dog and cattle poop. When the kids went closer to the waters to dig & play, they dug up more poop. They call the beach - Poop-o-lem."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Ria1104,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Couples,Best  Beach in Goa,"This might be the most scenic beach in Goa. Morning, afternoon, evening whenever you go here you will be mesmerized by its beauty.  Last time I visited this place on a day trip from Benaulim but could not get enough of the beach. So this time I decided to stay at least for a day here.The only con of this beach is that it is located far away from the main hub of Goa so it might take a long time to reach here. We started from Panaji at 4 and it was quite dark when we reached there. My boyfriend was very scared while driving in that dark but I won't say there was any safety issue. Still its better to reach here before dark if you are not sure about the direction. Our stay was just behind the Art Resort Cafe so we just walked over to the beach through the cafe everytime. I must say at night the beach looks magical. Though we dont see much clublife on the beach but the entire beach is set up with beautiful candle light dinner arrangements by the shack guys. There are beautiful cabanas also where you can sit and enjoy your drinks. Surprisingly the drinks here are super cheap compared to North Goa but just an advice....always check the menu before placing any order.The morning view of the beach was far more beautiful. It was much calm and peaceful. We rented a kayak and went deep inside the waters till an island called Monkey Island and spent quite some time relaxing in the waters. Best part of the beach was that it was mostly filled with foreigners and so I happily wore my bikini when I went for a swim without any awkward look from men. It was my birthday that day so my boyfriend arranged for a shack to beautifully decorate their cabana at some minimal charge and we had a wonderful time there cutting cake, enjoying our drinks and having a tasty dinner while enjoying some soul soothing music.It was honestly the best beach experience for me in Goa and even though I might get bored of Baga or Calangute one day I can never get bored of Palolem and would definitely go there again and again.I highly recommend you to visit this beach if you are in South Goa and its better if you can stay a night or two here (you will even find beach huts right on the beach). Do not miss out kayaking in the waters. Also it is one of the safest beach in Goa to go swimming. Other than this you can also try out the boat ride to Butterfly Beach if you are interested. Also if comfortable....ladies do put on your favourite swimwear here without fear. If you don't own one feel free to shop at the local stores."

A must do is the Backwater small boat trip at the North end of the beach, just around the corner. 50 minutes for a small fee. Just me and my wife slowly punted up the creek spotting Kingfishers, Cormorants Eagles, Kites and more. The highlight was when our guide fed the eagles and Kites! Dozens swooped down providing us with a spectacular aerial show! Amazing, well worth the small fee!!! Would highly recommend!!!!"

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Amit J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Beautiful Beach,"Palolem beach in South Goa is one of the most beautiful beaches in Goa. The water here is very clean due to lesser crowd compared to beaches in South Goa. Shacks are less which also means a cleaner beach. Other than a dip in the sea, activities to do here are parasailing and a boat ride for dolphin spotting and a visit to Butterfly and Honeymoon Islands. Definitely a must visit place for a day trip."

Next day visited the beach at 7 AM for Sea Kayaking. Initial instructions were provided by the Kayak owner. Digital payment options were available . He also provided a water proof bag to keep our belongings during the kayak session. The sea was serene. I have done kayaking in the river but this was my first sea kayaking experience. Saw jelly fish. Later had breakfast at one of the shacks and enjoyed the sea view as more visitors came for kayaking. Visited the beach during afternoon for lunch and it was nice as well.

I used to prefer north side all party and crowded beach but this year i decided to go for some peaceful place. And i can say paloleam beach does not let me down. I stayed near the beach so every morning i use to go there for a walk. There is not much crowd ( except in weekend, but that too you i cannot say more people compare to north goa beaches), the beach is clean, you can take share boat ride to butterfly beach or by kayaking.

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Sid,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,A bit too commercial,"Found it like the Calangutes or Candolims of South Goa. Comparatively more crowded than any of the South side beaches with long strips of shops and restaurants. The interesting thing there is the ferry rides to smalls islands e.g. Monkey Island, Honeymoon Island and the famous Butterfly Island. One thing about South Goa is the “clean” water in every beach in South Goa."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Lokendra262,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Beautiful Beach,"I nice beach to watch sunset, do kayaking, boat tour and watch dolphins.Boats can be hired from the shore. generally they take 3000 to book entire boat for 1 - 1.5 hour trip which includes Dolphin siteseeing, visit at Butterfly Beach and Honeymoon Beach (15 mins each)"
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Vandana H,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Family,Palolem beach,Really bad beach... very dirty... never to go there again... water was calm... but totally an over rated beach.. no privacy... lots of dirt thrown on the beach.. sand was very dirty very expensive boat rides... not worth the visit...
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Bulbul R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Couples,Nothing memorable,"Me and my husband went to visit Palolem beach in Canacona. The place was dirty, dusty and crowded. The visitors couldn’t care less about the safety guidelines for Covid-19. The boat service to Butterfly Island was closed and so was most of the spices and souvenir shops. Very few shops were selling low quality spices and that too was not local produce. The visit was a total flop."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Sachin Zanje,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Couples,One of the best beaches of South Goa,"I would rate Palolem in one of the top 10 best beaches of India.It is extremely beautiful surrounded by a mountain, a small island ,blue sea and white sand.Palolem has something for every individual. There are many options for sea food here.Best part is that this beach is very good for swimming because waves are mostly calm in palolem also you can enjoy kayaking here.Island trips and boat trips are also available. "
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,fozjon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,lovely beach,this may have been my favorite of the beaches we visited in Goa. Very scenic and walkable. Water also nice. Good for adults and for kids. There were plenty of people at this beach and nice choices for cafes and bars. We were surprised at the number of foreigners who were there staying in the beachside cabins.
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Jumana N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,Take a boat to Honeymoon Beach & watch dolphins,"Palolem Beach is a clean, less crowded beach. Must dos:1.

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,ShabbirBaldiwala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Family,Clean and beautiful,"One of the less frequented beaches but definitely a more serene of the Goa beaches. Down South, another not be missed one. Flanked by coconut trees and a sandy beach, this beach should be an excellent swim. The waves during a ride enhance the experience. The beachside cafes provide good Goan delicacies"
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Shiv S Dutta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,The most beautiful beach in Goa,"I feel it is the most beautiful, tranquil, and cleanest beach in Goa. You can spend an entire day here as there are lots of activities that happen on this beach. You can go for boating to monkey island, honeymoon island & butterfly island. There are mostly foreigners here on this beach. There are shacks and beach facing guest houses here. In fact, there is a market just few meters from the beach where you will find many cafes, shops, and hotels. I spent the entire day here and I still feel it was less."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Shirli A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Best beach in Goa,"One of the best beaches in the world. A quiet Goan beach from Oct to Dec' - busier after this. Lovely experiences, shops, restaurants & people."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Sarahfairy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,A very busy beach resort ,We were staying at Agonda and we were pleased we did stay somewhere quieterHowever Palolem is a great place to visit and had lots of shops restaurants and activityWe got a cab from Agonda and very excitingly a tuk tuk back which was great fun.We walked to the very far end of the beach to Sundowner.. A bar with the most amazing views that you get to by wading across a stream on the beachWe had lunch at Zest a lovely tranquil spot on the beach road.. Delicious quasidilla!Frenetic but worth a day trip 
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Adam J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Family,Beautiful beach resort,"Mostly soft sand, warm sea, good facilities and beach front restaurants. Some excellent guest houses on or near the beach front, ranging from Indian to western styles, some with music playing at reasonable volumes. Check out the wonderful peninsula bar, cut off from the mainland at high tide, but serviced by 'the boatman' who will ferry you across for free (though some shift workers have been known to try to charge a fee - tell them you know it's free and wink, you'll get across with no charge).Overall this is one of the nicer beaches of Goa, and while sometimes quite crowded, it is definitely worth a visit. As always, avoid the scams and negotiate hard on prices, because they will!Some wonderful photo ops."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,LucyHope,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Hippy paradise,"We got a tuk tuk from Agonda to Palolem which was a fun experience in itself!  We love the peace and quiet of Agonda beach but we wanted to mix it up a bit so came to Palolem for a livelier party atmosphere.  The place was heaving with both locals and tourists, roads filled with bustling stalls, music booming from a whole host of different bars.  We came during Holi so lots of people covered head to toe in colourful Gulal powders.  It was a true celebration of peace, love and boho hippy vibes. Palolem Beach is in the shape of an arc and is lined with a fabulous combination of coconut palms and rainbow coloured shacks.  The sea looked very inviting so after a couple of cocktails at a Cuba themed bar (in fact it could’ve actually been called Cuba) we had a swim.  It was nice to not have to deal with rough waves - Agonda and Cola are lovely beaches but I found the sea too choppy at both, so Palolem was a welcome change.  For lunch we ate at Dropadi Bar & Restaurant, where we ordered the crab soup amongst other dishes.  It was recommended to us by a Goan local and he was right - it was delicious.  I first heard of Palolem because of the Matt Damon movie The Bourne Supremacy, as the location was used for the opening of the film, so I’ve been wanting to visit for some years.  A fabulous beach for party vibes, a relaxing swim and for people watching."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,k4zdh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Three days stay,"Enjoyed the three days we had in Palolem, the beach is clean the people are polite and helpful.  Restaurants we used were clean and food good.  We went on a boat ride around the river, Fed the eagles and the boatman explained everything to us, and answered our questions.  Different age groups were staying there, but more of a back packers place.  Bay is lovely and the sea a bit calm than North Goa. "

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Sumalee K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Something for everyone.,I was a little nervous about Palolem beach as everybody tells you something different. And now I can see why.I was lucky to be able to stay for a few days in Palolem. The south of the beach is very relaxed with many chilled beach shacks to hangout in and some good waves. The centre of the beach has many more tourists and those that love to be in a group. But the north end of the beach is like another place altogether.At the southern end the water is shallow for a long distance and this makes it perfect for kids to play in and there is also an amazing island just out to sea. I hung out at Cozy Nook which had a perfect view of the beach.Want to chill and read; want to surf; want to wade in the peaceful shallows or want to party? Palolem is for you.
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Maps813183,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Palolem Beach,"Peaceful chillout beach. It's like Goa used to be 20 years ago.  Travelled down to Galgibaga beach, the furthest south in Goa before Karnataka, which is a turtle nesting site about 6 miles from Palolem. Then onto Patnem about 3 miles from Palolem all with the same peaceful vibe. In Palolem we stayed in a hut that lead directly onto the beach. Fabulous."

There are many choices for restaurants along the beach.. But don't. miss out on some really good food in town.

In the evening they set up little romantic tables instead.The beach gets cleaned every day 3-4 Times A day by these fantastic ladies, they are doing a fantastic job cleaning up after all the tourist, they also take away seaweeds etc... I think this one of the cleanest beaches around. The palmtrees that surrounds the beach are totally amazing.. there are coconut pickers he'll of a thing to do for a job. The Arabian sea is warm about 26c. The sunsets are just gorgeous and you see it. every. I'm back for the third time and just love it.....

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,David D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Enjoyable 2 days here,"We stayed 2 nights in beach huts, 31st January and 1st February, along this popular beach The beach is situated in crescent shape bay with Canacona Island (Monkey Island) at one end and a raised piece of land jutting into the sea with its tall coconut trees, where Silent Noise Club is located. It's golden sands stretch for just over a mile.It is lined with bars, restaurants and holiday accommodations, primarily beach hut style. There was also a number of tattoo places and a few shops. We did visit a couple of the bars, a great place to sit with a cold drink and watch the sun set.We found the beach to be both safe and clean, with the beach cleaners very visible.It is a great place for walking, we did walk along the beach up towards Monkey Island, some great rock formations.Along the beach are places offering kayaks for hire and there are a plethora of colourful boats used for boat tours. There are no water sports like parasailing or jet skies on the beach.There are sunbeds and umbrellas along parts of the beach, these are for the shack, restaurant and hotel guests. There is plenty of room for visitors to spread out on towels and beach mats and enjoy the sunshine. There were a small number of beach sellers but in fairness they were no trouble.When we were here it was not overly busy so it was peaceful, can imagine getting very busy at times.There are Lifeguards on duty along the beach."

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,tedsontop,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Not to everyone’s taste ,"Like most things it all comes down to taste. Palolem I guess is best described as like “Marmite” you either love it or you hate it. If you want a quiet beach offering long uninterrupted walks with toes in sand and sea around the bay, then this is NOT your cup of tea. It isn’t mine. It is not a patch on Mobor/Cavelossim Beach and gets only two stars from me in comparison, as it is far too crowded. It is however very popular so is offering something that people want, but it’s just not for me."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Colchestercastleview,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,No sun beds again,"Papers indicated yesterday 50% reduction in tourism. Today the authorities fine smokers on the beach and insist all sun beds be removed from the beach! When will Goa learn that they are now competing with Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and so many other destinations where they understand what hospitality means. Tourists are so important to the Goan economy but they are being taken for granted. Over the last few years taxi and tuk tuks make up the fare on a whim. The rubbish problem just gets worse. There is no idea about toilet expectation from tourists.Get your act together or face the consequences!!!"
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,RAUN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,A MUST VISIT !!,"Being in GOA and not visiting Palolem is like missing out on a lot. One of the best beaches in Goa as well as the people and food over there are great..!! Don't take my word for anything, but visit and be mesmerized by the beauty and fathom the peace from within like never before."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,PratikMavani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Quick walk visit,I find it dirty as entry has too much quantity of cow dung and cows. Has so many vegan restaurants and sea food restaurants. Half day visit is enough if you don't want to take any boat trip or to do any sort of water sports activities.

Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Hiorns1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Busy but not too busy,"Lovely beach lined with restaurants, beach huts and bars. Litter pickers come everyday as do the hawkers, cows and dogs. We were there on NYE and it was crazy. Fireworks going off at least for 20 mins. It could get too busy and overdeveloped as there is very few empty spaces left. Boat trips up the river and to honeymoon beach which is full of rubbish:(Cheap tuk tuk ride to Patnem beach which is less developed. "
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,kev_russ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Good beach but stay in Agonda,"We stayed in Agonda & did a couple of trips here, few quid in a tuc tuc or taxi. The beach is nice but there are a few touts so you get abit of hassle. We went in October so it was quiet but still abit busy. Nothing compared to the very quiet Agonda beach."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,pradeepjbims,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,The place is overcrowded - go for patnem beach if you want some space,First day we spent at patnem beach and its far better than Palolem beach in terms of crowd . Palolem seemed over crowded . Beach and water is good . you can spend some time There are lot of shacks on the beach.
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,Sneha_Pingle,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Serene clean relaxing beach in South Goa,"Tough this beach is at a distance from madgao, the main railway station of south goa ad goa airport, this is one of the best beaches in goa if you want to spend some quiet, relaxing time on beach with not much of crowd and pubs around you. This beach has no usual water sports but has activities like sea kayaking,  dolphin watching trips,  backwater trips, island  lunch experience, stand up paddle and unlimited space to play football and other sports. It has decent beach huts, shacks serving you good alcohol and food. This is a beach for people to spend some laid back time on beach and enjoy nature and goan culture. There are many centers offering yoga for short term as well as long term duration. There is music at night on beach but not very loud. On weekends there are places where you can dance your heart out.To reach this place, one can hire a cab from madgao station prepaid taxis costs 1100 rs and local cabs costs 1000. We chose to hire an auto rickshaw just to enjoy glimpses of local villages on our way to palolem, it was for 800RS. The other option is to catch a train from madgao to canaconna which is just 30 mins journey and then catch a vus or rickshaw to beach. There are many stay options at palolrm, even if you do not prebook your stay, you can find a good bargain for stay options right on beach.On weekend all the shacks served fresh grilled sea food of your choice turning the beach into good place to have sea food. The prices also went up for the services offered.Note - Carry cash with you as many small vendors do not accept any other form of payments, however  restaurants accepted credit cards and payments thru other wallets.Overall a beach for peace and nature lover to spend quality time on beach with nature."
Palolem_Beach-Canacona_South,pamtravelling,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Great place but...,"Half moon shape beautiful bay surrounded by palms, nice sand and atmosphere. Few minutes walking or tuktuk to Patnem beach more quiet. But...maybe because we stayed in the pick season: many many people mostly indian, bungalows and huts extremely overpriced for the quality they offer, extremely expensive taxis that do not allows to be picked up by taxi coming from outside Palolem (5000rps to Mandrem 60km when in Rajastan or UP for the same season 150km for 3000rps), atm machines are far from the village at least 4km all with long queues in front...."

This awesome south goa beach have everything, that a beach can offer with mesmerizing beauty, superlative sunset, few extremely beautiful shacks and beach huts. Location is great and the most important part is it's ""U"" design thats makes it fully visible from any point of the beach. In 35°C temperature, you will not feel bad as no sweating or stickiness. Very much neat and clean as cleaning of rubbish continues in the morning and evening. Sunset view is nothing but exceptional and Highly satisfying one. Strongly recommend for family visit. "
