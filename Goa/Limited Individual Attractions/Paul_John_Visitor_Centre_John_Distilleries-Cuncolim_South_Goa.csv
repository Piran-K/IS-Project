Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,Anant T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Friends,Highly recommended,"I must complement the company for informative tour, explaining the science and art of whisky making. The tour culminated with a tasting session which introduced me to the subtle art of whisky drinking. I must complement Bhavish and Jaggannath for making this a experience to remember. Thanks. Highly recommended"
Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,Aarushi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Fantastic experience - 12/10!,"Very informative and exciting tour to understand the single malt making process. The tour was led by Allisteer who was clearly a subject matter expert! His enthusiasm for whiskey, the patience to answer all our questions, and jokes made this an unforgettable experience. Definitely a must-experience for anyone with an interest in malts!"

It is a classy place where the visitor center itself gives the first and best impression. Before going here we need to book on the website. I booked on Saturday evening and on Sunday I got a call from them giving me advise on how to reach the center and best time to visit etc., I booked for the 3 pm slot. On reaching the place Mr. Bhavish was there to welcome us along with his team. After initial introduction we waited for few more guests to join then the tour started. First a Video presentation and then the single malt distillery visit. Very interesting and informative. After that there is tasting session where you can taste 5 varieties of Single malt. The presentation and explanations given by Bhavish was the high light. He was very energetic and his presentation made the trip lively. We can buy Single malt and other whiskies produced by John Distillary here. Bought one also. All in all a good start to our Goa visit."

It was a small group, just 10 persons. Bhavish was very helpful with all questions asked by everybody. The Whiskey tasting experience and the information he shared about each step to enjoy the drink was informative. Overall enjoyable experience. Keep up the good work."
Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,Ganadhish K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Nice whiskey tour,"After visiting distilleries in Scotland, I thought we must experience the one in our backyard. Since number of visitors were few, there was lot of freedom to spend enough time at different stages of production and ask questions. The tasting was also leisurely with detailed explanations. All the whiskeys we tasted were quite good. My favorite was Edited.Website shows time as 11 to 4, but the tours starts at 11, 1 and 3. This is nowhere mentioned on the website. So we had to wait almost 1 hour for the tour. When I told the manager that they should indicate timings of tour on website, he started lecturing me that I should have called before coming. This is not mentioned on the website.I suggest the properietors to update their website to indicate tour timings and train the manager to be more customer friendly and open for suggestions. Apart from this visit was nice."
Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,WarrenDC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Worth a visit if you're in South Goa ,"Great tour. Impressive surroundings. The tour started with how the brand started. Then moved on to what makes a whisky. We were shown the distillery and the various processes in fermenting, distilling, barrelling and bottling. We then did a five tastings of their whisky - the manufactoring and barrelling process differed slightly between them which causes a big change in their taste and smoothness. Tour with tasting and gazing at the gift shop takes about 2 hours. Very interesting tour. I would recommend it. A premium tour IMHO "
Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,Sumeeta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,A must do !,"Desperately wanted to visit one of our own distilleries being a big whisky drinker. This one was located within a 20 min drive from the  Radisson property at Cavelossim where we were staying, so had no excuse not to go.Glad we did. Bhavesh & Alistair made our girls trip a memorable one. Although my Whisky knowledge is not bad, I got some further information which was great. The property is located in the middle of nowhere but easily assessible by car. The welcome lounge, the shop and the tasting room are all placed in an amazing house. Very tastefully decorated and cleanliness is outstanding. I am very fussy about restrooms,  I was impressed. The tour lasted about an hour or so and we all left feeling we had some good fun including the tasting session which allowed us to experience not just some of their range but also how Whisky tastes, smells & feels while drinking and post drinking. I liked their Bold and their Brilliance range. Alistair is a brilliant guide and very knowledgeable.There is so much more to Goa than just run of the mill activities that most tourists/holiday makers go for. Our visit to Paul Johns was one of those unique experiences I believe all should experience, even if you don't drink.P.s: I was pleasantly surprised to know that The Big Banyan range of wines came from Paul John group. I tasted their red while staying at The Kumarkom Lake Resort, Kerala and in my opinion was the best in India that I have had."

Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,MysteryShopping1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,An informed taste of one of India's globally recognised Whisky brands.,"We entered as a couple of whisky novices.  We left as two whisky beginners, knowing there was much to learn but our first taste of whisky tasting and production was excellent.  Smooth presentation, informed and passionate guides and pride in an up and coming Indian whisky that is beginning to gain global recognition. The tour was great, and you got to see the practicalities of whisky making in a real live environment.  A shame they can't give you a discount per bottle bought as part of the tour, but they do have some limited edition bottles.  For anybody curious about whisky, this will both feed and sate the curiosity - and you'll have fun whilst doing so."
Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,Deepak Mehta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Family,Must visit for whiskey lovers,"It was a great experience to visit the single Indian malt creators at best. The tour guy was exceptional in explaining nuances of the whiskey creation, learnt a lot about different alcohol in the tasting session. Must visit for the newbies who have interest in single malts. I also got to visit down cellar below which has different casks from jack daniel to Portuguese cask. Keep going Paul john"
Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,Mriganc B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Business,This belongs on the Mount Rushmore of Indian whisky,"Disclaimer: I was an employee with the parent company of this center till 2014.For me personally, the transformation of the place from a impersonal rundown factory into one of the best Single Malt Whisky experience centers in the country is amazing.The place is out of the way.. South in a North obsessed Goa and well away from the beaches and cities/towns. It also doesn't offer anything to munch and these are the only 2 negatives I can think of. It is surrounded by industries and comes across like a lush green oasis in the middle of an industrial estate. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, with knowledgeable and passionate guides to take one through the experience. The place has an amazing vibe that just begs one to sit down and enjoy a drink with a buddy.The whisky is in its own class and there's enough written about it online that nothing needs to be added here."

Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,Pruthvi Bhojani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Highly recommend,"Shoutout to Pankaj for an amazing distillery tour!Right from when you enter the center you realize you made a great choice of choosing to be there, the ambiance, the aroma, the color, the architecture, the interiors everything is made to bring a smile on your face.Our tour guide was Pankaj, we were given a personal tour. He explained everything so throughly, for what is charged for the tour even if he gave us the 30% information of what he gave during the tour, we would’ve been more than satisfied but yet he chose to explain everything in utmost detail, what is the malt consistency, the fermentation process, the ‘head, heart and tail’, the way they uses the barrels, everything was explained nicely and seeing his passion for the whiskey lighten up the hidden whiskey lover in me.Then came the tasting, even though I’m not a pro, the ambiance and his explanation made me feel like one. Paul John is an absolutely amazing Single Malt which make us Indians proud, the flavor profile is very rich and the varieties they offer has something for everyone. The fact that this type of experience is present is India is actually a pride. Amazing Whiskey, Amazing Experience, Highly recommended to everyone!"

You must take a tour which also involves tasting of their flagship single malts, there are three packages 300, 600 and 1k. Under 1k package you will get to taste 5 of their single malts. And that’s worth the visit. Positives1. Experience 2. Exposure to whiskey distillation process3. Tasting sessionNegative 1. Distance from colva beach is 15km."
Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,LalitaVasu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,The Making of Single Malt Whiskey,We were on a trip to explore little known but worth visiting places in Goa.John Distilleries (Paul John Visitor Centre) in Cuncolim is one such place. The visit commenced around 3 pm with a group of about 12 participants. The  first item on the trip was a video about Paul John and the history of the Distillery.  This was followed with the visit to the various parts of the distillery.  The entire process of making single malt whisky is explained in detail. The finest section is where the barrels are stored for maturing the whisky.  The next step in the tour is whisky tasting session where the visitors can taste various types of flavours of whisky. The participants then are given time to explore the exhibit cum shopping section where some quaint and interesting souvenirs including miniature bottles of various whisky can be bought by the visitors. You will leave this place not only with souvenirs but also a lot of sweet memories.

Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,Raiden,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Good effort!,Good - pretty informative. Tour guide did know his stuff. Whisky tasting was the icingBad/Needs Improvement - the overall experience needs to be improved. The visitors should be left wanting more.AV to be more immersiveTour should be more interactive rather than one way communication from the guide.Overall - great effort to begin with!!! Kudos to the team
Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,Y4world,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Factory tour,"Had gone to Factory for a tour, was welcomed with friendly people. It was a short Video from the Owners what inspired them for him to start. Later was given a educational tour inside the factory on various stages on Making Whiskey. Learnt something new."
Paul_John_Visitor_Centre_John_Distilleries-Cuncolim_South,TheWorldNut,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,The journey of a Single Malt,"A great place to see what goes into your single malt. The tour is pretty informative for the patrons and the facility is nice. Our tour guide though seemed informed however was pretty impatient with the group, which was kind of a put-off (else could have been a 5 star experience). Apart from that it was great to go around and see various processes, right from extracting the sugars out of barley to maturing in casks and then finally sipping it during the tasting session. Great and beautifully decorated place, with tastefully selected souvenirs."
