Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Indira K S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,Captivating view,"The entry ticket is ₹50 for adults & there is a steep climbing in case there are elders, might be a painful for them. The view from the fort is beautiful, with view or the sea and the coconut trees. Also, the coco beach for dolphins view is also another attraction close by to the fort."

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,sriporna_chakraborti,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Unmissable,"Beautifully restored the fort is a steep climb from the parking lot. There is an entry fee and dedicated parking. The climb is totally worth it with stunning views and an elegant fort, which form beautiful backdrop to pictures. It has many quirks like the hot oil pouring on enemy area, solitary confinement cell etc. There is a small art gallery, exhibiting paintings and cartoons by the one and only Mr. Miranda.  I found it to be one of the quieter forts of Goa and much better kept that the overtly explored and exploited Aguada. It’s a short drive from Panjim and takes about an hour to see it well. Good shoes are much advised. The moss growth on the laterite rocks in the monsoons made it really slippery, but saw may kids and elderly negotiating it well, with caution. It has to be on the must visit list in Goa."
Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Srishti Misra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Must visit when in Goa,Unlike Fort Aguada this one isn’t that popular because of a short steep climb. If you don’t mind a short 5 mins climb then this one is a must visit.
Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Dhiraj H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Family,Well restored fort,This fort is located very near Panjim. Burn like all places in Goa you will need your own vehicle to reach this renovated fort located next to a church and the sea . The ticket office closes at 5 PM and the entry fees is Rs50. There are free parking inside the ticket office compound. As it is a fort you have climb a bit. The restoration has been done quite well. It’s a small fort and you get an amazing view of the area around. The room with Mario’s paintings could have a section devoted to the great artist. There are excellent photo ops.
Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Bhavik Mody,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Reis Magos,"Reis Magos Fort is a Portuguese fort atop a hill overlooking the Mandovi River on one side and Aguada Fort on the other side. It was also used as a Jail during the freedom movement of Goa. It is a well maintained and beautiful fort. Not large in area but has a very beautiful view of the Mandovi River, the Aguada Fort and the sea. Good place to visit."

Entry ticket is 50/- per person, parking is free but any kind of camera other than that of mobile phones is allowed by paying 250/-. Entry to fort is a steep climb of about 100 meters. From entry gate itself one can see beautiful views of Sea, a church, and the monument itself. Once inside, you can see some history and cannons placed on top of fort. There are enough spots for shutter bugs in this small yet beautiful fort."
Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Anvita Shukla,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Couples,Piece of history,"Located in North Goa, this restored fort has served as a hospital, jail from the 17th century. It's been only 3-4years since it has been open to the public. The views are really nice and people are also less when visiting. Worth a visit for history lovers."
Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Wanderer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Can't thank enough for this lovely gesture!,"Visited this gorgeous Fort with my sister, nephew and mumma. Looking at my elderly mumma, I was told at the ticket counter that the fort needs a lot of steep walking and climbing. They do arrange a drop till the entrance gate but it still needs a lot of strength walking. We thought of dropping the plan and going back when they themselves suggested that mumma can wait at their reception while we take a stroll at the fort. We found this workable but we were lil worried too.We were dropped by them in a van till the entrance gate. What I saw: Gorgeous would be an understatement for such a majestic fort. You get a magical view of the river from the fort. Beautifully maintained. Extremely clean unlike other government properties.BUT at the back of my mind, I was constantly worried about mumma that we didn’t spend a lot of time and came back quickly. When we came back, we saw an altogether different view. My mumma was taken care well by them and she and the other lady at the reception were laughing and chit-chatting. I was surprised and really happy to see this. Goan people are way too sweet. Can never forget this and can’t thank enough for this sweet gesture."

Built centuries ago by Portuguese Rulers to guard the River Mandovi from entry by enemy ships, the Fort looks as good as new - neat, clean & well maintained. Numerous stairs lead up & down from the ramparts of the Fort. A large number of well-maintained Guns are positioned on the ramparts as of yore. An excellent exhibition of photographs showing every phase of History of Fort Reis Magos, from construction by Portuguese Rulers to Gandhiji’s Freedom Struggle during British period to War of Liberation in 1961. In the basement Gun Loops, another excellent exhibition of photos of life in Goa in different ages is neatly arranged. Entry fee of Rs.50 for Senior Citizens is well worth many times over. The sweeping views of the Mandovi River from the ramparts of Fort Reis Magos are an endless delight to behold. A visitor would need atleast 2 hours to do justice to all that Fort Reis Magos offers."

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,naomiheredia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Breathtaking View,"My daughter and I were in Goa for a wedding and we had a day free to spend with our favourite cousins and their darling children. After lunch we were given an unexpected treat when my cousin took us to visit the historic Reis Magos Fort. I had been here as a young girl in 1974 when my father was taking us all over Goa as an instructed tour of our heritage. It was absolutely in derelict condition and pretty shocking to think that such an important defence of the former Portuguese colony had been reduced to such a miserable state.Imagine my surprise and delight to find that at some point in time, post that visit, the Archaeological Survey of India together with artists and historians had collaborated to restore the fort to its former majestic glory. The site is breathtaking, perched on the edge of a headland at the mouth of the broad Mandovi River where it meets the Arabian Sea. The massive laterite blocks have been built up again, a seriously steep approach leading up to the fort proper.  All the different buildings contained within, the armoury, the detention cell, the bastions with their huge cannons, the lookout stations, and of course, the living quarters, have been restored and an exhibition of old prints were proof of their authenticity.Every inch of the fort is worth exploring and experiencing the strong winds at the summit besides understanding its perfect location filled us with awe and admiration.  There is also a model of the complete fort as it would have been in its glory days, as well as old photographs and explanatory notes. And an extra special section is a display of nostalgic prints of the drawings of the celebrated Goan artist, the late Mario Miranda.If you have the time and inclination for history, I would strongly recommend a visit."
Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,VB_82,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A very well maintained fort,"This fort has been restored a few years back and it has been very well maintained so far. Parking is not really an issue as it can be done in the parking area or even on the roadside. Entry fee of Rs. 50/- is charged per adult. Though I do not remember the exact amount, I remember very high Camera charges for DSLR, however clicking pictures with cellphone is free. Initially, there's a steep slope to climb up and they have a facility of drop service for senior citizens. The fort is very well maintained, in fact one of the best around. One of the most attractive attraction for me was the Mario Miranda museum; the cartoons were very nice and cute. Further, it also has lot of details on history of Goa and might interest history enthusiasts. The fort overlooks the Mandovi river and views are superb.Overall, a must-visit place around Panjim."

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,MalcolmHafner,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Well worth a visit for the fort and history of liberation from Portugal,The fort is very interesting with a lot of history since the end of the 15th Century prior to the arrival of the Portuguese.The information about its history is full and well presented.  It has been restored well and you can imagine what it must have been like to live there over the years.The fort is quite extensive being on two levels built on the side of a hill.  The walkways aren't too steep so most people will be able to access at least some of it.The views across the Mandovi river are superb and worth visiting for.The unexpected part for me was the story of the resistance against Portuguese rule and the eventual overthrow at the end of 1961.I definitely recommend a visit if you're in the area.

The fort is well preserved and was used as a jail for sometime. The Fort changed hands from one ruler to another. Mughals to Portuguese to Maratha to British. This beautiful example of Goan Portuguese architecture is located in Bardez, Goa and a must visit place for tourists. Don't forget to watch a beautiful sunset from the fort, though I missed it due to rainy season. But the climate I experienced was awesome too.You can see it in the photographs!"

You have to climb a short slope to get to the fort but don't worry, there's a sea view along-side the climb. Old cobbled pathways are an immediate pointers of the Portuguese construction. There's also a small museum situated inside the fort and of course, vistas of Arabian sea. There's only a nominal entrance fee an that too, is lower on Sundays.Got a picture?

Tee tickets are bit on the expensive side and if it is a group or Family would suggest to make use of just one camera as charges are very high, no problems with the mobile. The fort is well maintained and would suggest visitors to go through the Photo Gallery with history behind it, it was worth reading. The view of River Mandovi is just beautiful. We had a bad luck as could not spend much time exploring because of the ongoing Film shooting for some South Indian movie. Just don't miss this when in Goa."

It's clearly been restored but is worth every one of the R50 that they charge you to get in. The site itself (the citadel) is small and is basically a  late renaissance fort that has been adapted to meet the arrival of cannons and gun powder. Make sure that you visit the fort graveyard and the garrison church on your way up.Below the fort are the gun platforms and emplacements that would have made this a  critical choke point for anyone trying to invade Goa. You are left to your own devices to wander around at will"

Actually in my last day in India, after one month visiting the country. I liked it a lot. The day was beautiful and I enjoyed exploring the fort and its rooms. All good except the fallacious propaganda and manipulation of facts regarding the invasion of 1961, when India attacked this Portuguese territory for no reason. At least for no reason different then those used by Hitler to invade Poland or Saddam to conquer Kuwait."

OK, I get it!!!So, we don’t want to shell out Rs 250 and will not use our video and we have been warned.  BUT, they still would not let us in with our video camera in a case around our neck, they insisted we go back to find our driver and leave it in the car!  Obviously they think I can’t control myself and will break down and use the video camera...Despite this very negative introduction, the fort is very well refurbished and maintained, and had excellent displays on the history of Goa.  Would have given 5 stars otherwise....BTW, map location on TripAdvisor is wrong, it’s on the other side of the river from where TripAdvisor has it, i.e. across from Panaji.  Will submit yet another updated location request to TripAdvisor, but they seem to have ignored all the others I have provided in the last two weeks, so maybe double check on google maps before setting out."

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Shailendra Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Excellent ...one of the best Forts in Goa!!,"Forts in India are awesome but so many of the famous forts are also overcrowded, not so well maintained or rather the public littering the place and hoardes of uninterested people just hustling and bustling around. Reis Magos was a welcome change. The place is secluded with very less crowds. It is extremely well maintained. It has scenic locations and best for taking photographs. Really peaceful place to spend quality time with oneself, friends or family. They have a small car which takes you to the top of you are a senior citizen or have very small kids. The visit typically takes 45 to 60 minutes at most. However it is upto you on the amount of leisurely time you want to spend at this beautiful and quiet fort. A must see and much better than the more famous Fort Aguada!!"
Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,GowriNK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Restored fort with great views and Mario Miranda's gallery,"If you read the history of this fort, you will realize that after being used as a fort, a hospital, and a prison, it had fallen into complete disrepair. Mario Miranda was instrumental in securing funds for its restoration from a UK-based cultural charity and we should be thankful for that!The fort requires some uphill climbing but the seascape views from the top are gorgeous. (Afternoons are a bad time to go as the sun is right overhead and there's no shelter to enjoy the views.) There are also multiple galleries in the fort with photographs chronicling Goa's turbulent political history and struggle for freedom. There's also a gallery with scores of the charming early works of Miranda.We went on a weekday and it was not crowded at all. You can easily spend 2-3 hours here."

Great view from top,"Very interesting restored small fort on the hillock and the best part is to view Mandovi river from the top. It was also used as a jail. very well maintained.

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,LBB,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,This Gorgeous Fort In Goa Dating Back To The 15th Century Is A Photographer's Delight,"Originally built in 1493 by the Sultan of Bijapur Yusuf Adil Shah, this then was small-fortified outpost when he ruled over Goa. It is the oldest fort in Goa, and has been restored to serve as a Cultural and Heritage Centre. And you can now hold private functions there.What Makes It Awesome?From being a Portuguese defence fortress to being a jail to imprison freedom fighters fighting for Goa’s liberation in the 1950s and then a hospital, the Reis Magos fort has served many roles for the state of Goa. The fort has always had strategic importance as the first line of defence for the old port town of Goa which we now know as Old Goa. With panoramic views of Panjim, Nerul, even Old Goa on clear days, this fort is a photographer’s delight. On some days if you are lucky, one can even see dolphins jumping about in the sea. This is an immaculately preserved fort, sparse crowds, well maintained cannons with neat and crisp signage, pictures that educate and entertain. There is a permanent exhibit of Mario Miranda’s sketches, old maps, photographs and drawings of the fort and its history. Also on offer, are amazing vistas of the Mandovi river meeting the Arabian Sea.And one can just visit it and enjoy this beautiful fort, or book it to conduct weddings, private parties, book launches and anything else you can think of. Do carry lots of water and snacks though as currently, it has no refreshment facilities in the fort.Pro-TipThe fort is closed on Mondays for general visits and has a small ticket of INR 50 to enter the fort. As there is a steep slope to climb, they also offer a car service to drop you to the top if required."

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Vidya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Excellent sea view and not too crowded.,"This is a beautiful, well-maintained fort that offers panoramic sea views and is much less crowded than Aguada. There is a van that takes you to the entrance at the top. You can then make your way down at your own pace while you take in the beauty and legacy of the fort. There are two halls decked with photographs and posters about the fort's history. And the view of the Arabian Sea from the top is absolutely breathtaking!!! There is a small stretch of beach just across the fort. It's very quiet and you'll likely be the only person around, but it's a good spot to take some photos :) "

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Shweta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Historic public attraction maintained well like a private property,"What blew our minds away was how clean, preserved and well kept was this fort !The only place to chronicle the Goa history . Did you know that Goa did not get independent with the rest of India ? Reis Magos fort is a must visit to know more of such startling facts.Wildflowers in bloom along with bees & butterflies also welcome you throughout the Fort. Scenic view across north goa with one side as lush green lands and other as lashing white sea waves make a mesmerising contrast.It houses a large collection of mario miranda sketches ranging from times when he was developing individual Goan characters, which are dialogues of his acclaimed pieces.Recommended to take out 2 hours in your next North Goa visit. The small but stiff trek also does well to digest the beer & oily food from the night before at a sea shack :)"

Timings force you to go there when its sunny but totally worth it.I've been there a few times and i have seen many tourists missing the best part.One of the rooms with the oil dropping hole, has a very long staircase leading to the below section of the fort. Be careful when your getting down. The views of the boats entering the river from there is beautiful.Just remember the entrance and exit are different. If your not exiting via the office your doing it wrong."

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,neetika13,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Loved it!,"If you are looking for a nice quaint peaceful place amongst Goa’s humdrum this is the place for you .. it’s relatively unknown, well maintained and standing lone on the lines of river Mandovi. Far moved from the hustle bustle of the other touristy places so frequented in Goa .. And yes! What a view. A little entry of 50 rupees per person with a free ride up for the elderly thrown in for good measure. All in all, much better than a lot of over hyped and frankly dirty places goa is know for."

Portuguese built great forts on route from Portugal to India one of the greatest and biggest is the Fort of Diu.Reis Magos fort commands great views of the city of Panaji over River Mandovi and  the Arabian  sea.You could go up to the main gate by a vehicle but coming down is bit tricky with all the cobbled stones path for walking or vehicles.
Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,Nelvis R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Fort of Panaji,This is a very ancient Fort dates back during the Portuguese rulership. This Fort is facing Panaji across the water. One can get a beautiful view from the Fort. Please keep in mind that this food does have an entry fee. This he is specifically because they want to limit the number of free tourist or people who do not pay but cause destruction to the place. So basically the fee is utilised to do the maintenance of the Fort. This phone has been restored few years ago. This place is open from morning 9 a.m. to evening 6 p.m.. if you are a tourist in Goa you must visit this place so that you know about the Forts as well. There is also a church beside the Fort. This place has been well maintained and now and marked as a tourist attraction.

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,FrauStrub,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Dangerous - please be aware,"We left to get there by bus 56 as recommended in tour guides. When we wanted to start walking there (from the bus stop another 2 km) some Brasilians hinted and talked to us loudly. We understood they did not want us to got there (we do not speak portuguese) as it was dangerous. We still kept going but were stopped again by other Brasilians and then eventually got wary and returned to our hotel. At our reception we were advised that our interpretation was correct. The Fort is closed for renovation and there had been a few ""incidents"" as they put it. They strongly recommended not to visit this dangerous place as the likelyhood of being robbed was very high. This is as per June 2018."

The Fort stands on the north bank of the Mandovi at Reis Magos and is clearly visible from the Panjim side of the Mandovi river.

Reis_Magos_Fort-Panjim_North,AniruddhaDeb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Quaintness revisited,"The fort is tiny and probably not known by many. In fact, we discovered it almost by chance because the road back from Aguada was clogged with traffic and we were looking for an alternate route back to Panaji. We saw the Reis Magos marked on Google maps and asked our driver about it. He had not even heard about it. We made him take us there - since he did not know how to read tha map, we had to tell him to take a right here and go along there...And soon we were driving down a narrow road where the sea kept sloshing up onto the street with every wave crashing on the stone pavement that separated the land from the sea. We felt like Sōsuke in Ponyo.The visit involves some climbing. You have to get tickets for nominal rates (and a larger amount for photography equipment - if you don't want to, you can leave them in lockers at the reception). The climb to the fort gates is steep for a man like me, but there is good news for the elderly - there is a car service for senior citizens.Once inside, the tiny fort turns out to be a museum with the history of Portugese Goa depicted on walls of the rooms. There are beautiful sketches by Mario, too. The view of the seafront is breathtaking and I wish to go back during the monsoon when the sea is more choppy."
