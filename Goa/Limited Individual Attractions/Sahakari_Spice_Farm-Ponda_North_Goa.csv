Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,wanda,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,"Nice tour, average lunch.","I agree with most of True Indian's review. However, they have improved the meet and greet bit with dancing and singing girls and petals being thrown over you! A nice drink given while we waited for a few more people to turn up. Then 8 of us were taken round by an older lady who was knowledgeable and entertaining. So far so good and it lasted about 45 mins as we were all chatting and asking questions. Lunch was average as described. At least it was fresh and hot. We arrived about 12 and beat the rush. It was very crowded as we were leaving."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,TrueIndian,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Explore other options if possible,"Hours of operation :  9.30 AM to 4.30 PMEntry ticket is Rs 500 per person which includes a compulsory lunch. Since lunch is included most visitors will arrive around that time and so there is a lot of rushLunch has both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes.You have to queue for lunch as you enter. There are benches to sit under ceiling fans.Food is tasteless and most dishes are cold. There are no bowls {katori} provided and since most dishes have curry everything gets messed up in your plate. I talked to the owner to provide the bowls but he was unresponsive. Sweet rice was the dessert  The fish variety served was full of bones so those who are not regular fish eaters have to be very careful. RO water is free but you can buy mineral water, soft drinks, beer etc from the stalls run by the management.Spices, oils and other things are for sale but the rates are much higher from the market.Toilets are clean. Indian seats also provided in female toilets.Guided tour takes 30 minutes. No indication where the guide will be available so you have to hunt for a guide or a group in the garden and join them. The tour starts from the area behind the wash basins and toilets. There is no one to guide you about the start of the tour. Guides are college students who have some knowledge about plants. They do not have have a pointer/torch so when he/she has to show a small fruit on the tree they throw a stone towards the fruit which may or may not hit the fruit so it is difficult to appreciate small fruits high up on trees. There are shrubs, bushes, creepers, and trees of common spices in the garden, some are grown there and some are planted only for demoThere is a small parking near the ticket window."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,natholian,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,Brilliant value for money,"We had a lovely tour and then we sat down to a gorgeous lunch. Honestly I don’t know how they can put together the whole package for the entry fee, it’s a complete bargain."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Manish Rasania,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Family,Commercial visit,"Entry fee of rupees 500 per person is too high. Though lunch is included in entry fees, it is worth 250 rupees maximally. Lunch is made compulsory, which is not appropriate. Walking Tour of garden with guide takes hardly 30 to 40 minutes. There should be separate charges for those who don't want Lunch _ it should be 100 rupees. Spices, fani, cashews sold there are though organic & may be of good quality; but prices are 1.5 to 2 times. Overall impression is that _ visit is more commercial activity. Should go to ICAR tropical spice plantation visit in stead, which is a government organization _ & entry may be free or at nominal cost; selling price of spices are likely to be lower."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Chandni138,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,"An unusual activity, but worth.","It's a unusual activity to do while in Goa. They explain the cultivation of spices, and show you around an area of the plantation. You can buy spices and essential oils from their shop, which are all very reasonably priced.Lunch is included in the entry ticket price. The food is aromatic and tasty.Definitely worth a visit."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Roy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Good tour,"Package deal with tour, lunch. Guided tour gives you lots of insights how our day to day spices are grown, usefulness.Goan traditionsl lunch with Feni as welcome drink.Peri peri pspad is the talk of the town.Buy spice at their store."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Avni,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,Highly recommend,"Really lovely experience. The visit starts with a short tour around a designated portion of the farm, where the guide talks about the different types of plants and spices they have growing there. The guide (ours was Cyril) gave lots of little tips on what to look for when buying spices, as well as pointing out the medicinal properties of the different plants he would show us. You can also have lunch at the farm itself, and the food is really good- very fresh and well made. The highlight of the experience for me was the spices they sold. Their vanilla beans were really really good quality, and the other spices were fantastic also."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Anant T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,Excellent,"Sahakari Spice farm was a wonderful experience, starting with a warming welcome drink, followed by an hour long tour through different spice trees and bushes and vines. Followed by a traditional Goan lunch. A very nice experience."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Soumya Nayak,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Green Green Green,"For those who live in small towns/villages & have greenery around, visit to the spice farm doesn't make sense. For those who live in the cities & don't get to see much greenery, this is a must do. It's also a great place for children to see & learn few things about spices & spice plants. It's a 200-acre privately owned property & we are taken on a 30-min walk where multiple spices have been grown within 1 acre of land. These spices are supplied to factories who produce masala & other food items.The entry fee is INR500 per person which includes lunch & tour guide service. Even if you don't want to have lunch, you still have to pay the full amount. You either choose to complete the tour, then have lunch or the other way round. Tour guides can speak English, Hindi & Konkani. They have good knowledge of the plants.My family & I visited various temples of South Goa in the morning, then headed to Sahakari Spice Farm for lunch at 2:00 pm followed by the spice farm tour. The Farm closes at 4:00 pm. Do carry umbrellas if you are visiting during monsoon, as the farm doesn't provide them."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,mysterioustraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,Learn about spices! An excellent tour.,"This is a very interesting tour do you understand vegetations behind the spices that make up our every day lives. We had an excellent guide, Francis, who spoke both English and Russian and vividly explained many of the spices that we take for granted in our daily life. This is a very educational and fun excursion. And once the tour is ended you were treated to a very local meal in their cafeteria style dining area. Definitely recommend it you are in the Goa area."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Naveen k mulay,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Driver joy ride for beer and commission,Places to visit to remove from goa guide map. Non veg food is waste. Plantation is just road side view there seven plants in one area of land. Tour ends with sales.
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,pallavi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Family,Nice,We had been here in a group of 10 people.The place is very well done and ambience is lovely.A must visit .We had a great time 
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Kamakshi B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Family,"Fantastic, Relaxing Experience","Lucy was absolutely fantastic - we had a great time walking around the spice plantation and trying all the spices and smelling the different leaves, etc. The food was absolutely fantastic and was great to have after not having home cooked food for a few days. Would highly recommend visiting this quaint location as a relaxing escape from the city."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,sanket raina,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Family,Only if you have time to kill and not sure what else to do,"Would rate this place just about average, the tour of spice plants and walk about was close to 20 min or so. Not as extensive as I imagined. The place was packed even though I had gone on a off day, must be crazy on busy days. Staff is helpful, though I agree with some other reviewers that it ain't worth 400 bucks even with the food thrown in and is probably running basis hype from tour operators. Ride to this part of goa is good and probably you can catch up other places around also."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Vinayak W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Family,Awesome Spice Farm,"We visited Sahakari Spice Farm on 2nd Sept. 2021.  It has an entry ticket of Rs. 400 per adult which includes buffet lunch (veg/non- veg) and tour of farm alongwith guide. On arrival guests are provided a welcome Herbal drink. It takes around 30 to 40 minutes for a farm tour. You can take lunch before going to farm or afterwords which may take some more time. The tour of farm is educative, informative, and knowledgable."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,wandermay08,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Refreshing experience / Guided tour.,"Refreshing place to visit. We were greeted by flower garland and welcome drink. A tour guide took us for a visit to the plantation. We got to know different spice plants and he shared good knowledge about the spices. He gave us information on how fenny was made and showed us the equipment used for it. Tasted original fenny, it was very strong but  a must have. Food was earthly and we loved it. Both veg and non veg options were available. Tour guide was friendly. There are different spices and varieties of fenny we can buy. We did not buy anything but all the stuff looked authentic. A must visit place."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,payal m,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Family,Bad place and waste of money,"I strongly suggest not to waste your time and money. They quickly show you cinnamon, bay leaves,  lemon grass, ilaichi, allspice, arecanut, coffee, nutmeg and vanilla plants and then ask you to have lunch. It is like assembly line. Group after group are taken in and shown their way out. I asked for a place to sit for sometime as we had little kids and it was hot. They said there was no place. Food is below average and overpriced. If you have never seen a spice plant in your life and want to loosen your purse, go there."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Happiness827176,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Family,Waste of money,Waste of money in a tour of 10-12 spices in a private property. For a basic buffet in an unhygienic restaurant you pay Rs 400 per person which is not more than Rs 100 . The tour guides earn a hefty commission so they will force you to come here. 
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,balaji s,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Dont Waste Your Time and Money:(,"Don’t waste your time and money here(400 inr per person).Spice tour is hardly 20 mins and they don’t even show their farms instead sample plants grown in a garden like area. Tour is around a garden area and should not be called as plantation tour.They had all the opportunity in the world to make it a pretty interesting , informative and wholesome experience for tourists but still they dont do it. The spice store there is pretty absymal and average - they should learn how to conduct these tours from the factory tours done in Mahabaleshwar side.Food served is pretty bad for the price they charge(veg) and served cold, kept open. The place does not feel hygienic and safe overall.P.S: Hotel traveldesk and Cab drivers would trick you into do one of these tours as they get some incentives in return from them. Dont fall prey to this - This place is  located 30 + kms from Panaji city and not worth the cost of hiring a cab just for this."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Travelxl2013,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Family,Amusement park,This place reminded me of an amusement park. No soul just minting money. The spices are very expensive.
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,CruisinSusan2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Winter Spice,"Always good to leave towns or ports behind to travel into the interior. The spice farm is approximately one and a half hours from the port. Along the way we passed beautiful scenery, rice paddies, temples and many vibrantly colourful abodes. The farm is set in a tropical garden teaming with life including humans of which there were many. It's a popular tourist destination so it will be even more crowded during peak season.Our tour was interesting and informative. Due to winter general growth had slowed in fruits and flowers so we did not see all that the farm has to offer. However our guide was passionate and enthusiastic which enhanced our experience.We paid for lunch upfront and was rewarded after with a delicious buffet of locally grown vegetables, fruits, rice and curries.  We would recommend this Spice Farm to visit and we will definitely return one day."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Natalia S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Lots of lol!,"Our guide  (Russian speaking) made our day! He was excellent. Next to his useful information, he did a real show. Definitely a talent for a tv show of a movie!It was a very entertaining experience followed by some Indian tradition of throwing cold water on your back ::)))))) and a wonderful meal.Definitely to be recommended!"
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Mahesh P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Close to Nature,"This place is hour long drive from Central Goa. I had been here twice, once with friends and once with family. It's a different experience and possibly one of must-go places in Goa. We are greeted with serving of an organic tea followed by a tour with the guide as a group. The entire walk through about different spices and the place is refreshing. The local Feni is served along with the lunch which is prepared there in an organic way. Different types of spices and oils can be bought at the stalls. Overall, a wonderful experience. For those who want to catch flight in the evening can directly go to airport from here. "
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Pablo M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,A great experience!,"Diving into the world of spices has been one of the most interesting experiences I have had in India. The farm is a bit far from the town of Vasco da Gama, where the ship was anchored, but it was completely worth the trip. The whole experience, lunch included, was so well organized, our guide so knowledgeable, made everything so interesting and dynamic. I learnt so much about these plants that make Indian food so tasty...We were received with the flower collars, lemon grass infusions and some snacks. Later, after the tour, comes the lunch, included in the 12 dollar cost of the ticket. Very tasty, and varied lunch, for vegetarians, and/or chicken and fish lovers. There is also a stand in which spices, natural medicines, infusions among other products are sold.I have to say, though, that the plantation is huge, and what is shown to us is only a sample, or a short tour. don´t expect a long visit through plantations because it is not planned this way.All in all, a very recommendable experience!"
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Padam,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,!!! STAY AWAY !!!,"Oops .. biggest mistake of trip. Got misled by colleague to visit this place (now I know he wanted to play a prank by sending me & my friends here) Horrible place.. there is no other choice and visitors have to eat whatever is prepared there. This basically is a cleaver way to get your money by compulsory ticket to buy. Cheap food served with no choices. Everything else is on payment basis. A ‘so called spice tour’ is 10 minutes walk where water sprinklers installed in ground are a safety hazard. The guide will be showing one plant of each type in a backyard sort of garden to a batch of 20-25 people regardless whether people are able to hear or not. Focus of this place is only and only on selling spices, and to our surprise we bought vanilla stick which we paid for and the counter girl never packed it in our bag. So we were robbed of money and did not get the item.No coincidence - we heard similar sad stories from other travellers about this place on returning to hotel.  Please Please Please - if you have nothing else to do .. then do nothing. Doing nothing is better than visiting this place.Rest - your choice !! "
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,RAJ CHAND,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Horrible Place,"Pathetic place, nothing to see there just show you 4-5 spice plants in 30 mins tours.  Basically they are selling their pathetic and un-higenic food in the name of tour and spice garden..Rs. 400 per person ticket which includes unlimited food and unlimited food means - dal, rice, bread, papad and one non veg dish.Food place are dirty steel places you can't have food on them. Sharing here some photos as well to get you all idea about the place and how they are making fool and cheating to tourists.Basically all the tour guide and drivers get commission on person that's why they will insist you to go there. Don't go there, if you are having free day and time in Goa, its better to spend time in hotel and relaxed rather then going this place."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Karen Savage,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Learn where spices come from (and a nice lunch),"Sure, it’s a bit touristy, but it was really pretty and educational! The guide was so nice and picked leaves and things for us to smell. It’s quite cool to see where spices come from. The lunch was quite tasty. There is a store that sells spices and other products (prices seemed good to me). I would say it’s worth a visit. "
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Janhenru,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,What a wonderful place,Visited the Spice Farm with another 16 family members with some being local and many of us from overseas. The hospitality is amazing. Our guide wakes us through a very aromatic tour of the spices grown on the farm before leading us to a well equipped eating area for a complementary lunch. This is one of the most enjoyable and value added tours of our trip.  I would highly recommend this as a must do stop on any tour of Goa. Well worth the visit.

Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Salil M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"Nothing great to see here, just selling lunch buffet at high price","This is a huge farm spread over around 130 acres. Guide showed us only 8 to 10 spice plants / trees in 30 minutes and tour was over. Then we went for lunch. In buffet, there was bread, rice, dal, subzi, chicken curry and fish fry which was at Rs.400 / person.It is nothing but they are selling their very limited lunch buffet at Rs.400 by naming the place as Spice Farm. Nobody would go so long in Goa to have buffet at that rate."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,CLIFF R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,One of a kind,"It's an spice farm with a entry fee of Rs. 400/-. which is inclusive of lunch.As soon as you enter you have an guide who will take you around the farm and help you identify the spices. The guides are well trained and very courteous.Lunch is authentic Goan cuisine with veg and non veg options.There is store available for purchasing various spices, Ayurvedic medicine and oils.It's worth a visit and value for money guaranteed.There is also an elephant ride available but we couldn't make it."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Ravi Kiran P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Average,You can visit if you don't have nothing to do on that day. Food taste is okay and trip in the farm is very short.You can also buy the spices in store available in the Farm.
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,SRINIVASN P,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Pathetic place.  Nothing to even match a Spice nursery.......Don't be guided by the pictures.,"Pathetic place to visit.   The whole so called Spice farm visit is a few meters of walk on a large plantation.  They just showed one tree each of  cinnamon, clove, cardamom, few pepper.   Nothing worth.   Might as well see a video of a nice garden.   They charge Rs.400 per person for a 10 minute visit to the few meters and the food served is pathetic and unhygenic."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Hilary S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Interesting and good value,This was a trip recommended by our hotel and it was definitely worth coming. Our tour guide was informative and spoke clear English. We thought the price was very reasonable especially considering the delicious meal that followed the tour. We were rushed through the tour a little too fast and I would have prefered to have spent more time learning about the different spices and being able to see where and how the spices were processed.
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Akshaya S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Okay For One Time Visit,"After having been through spice farm tours in Sri Lanka, it was a nice experience to have something similar in India. This is surely a must visit for one time if you have time to spare in Goa and are done with beaches. Food offered is limited in choices but it is at least traditional stuff."

Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,HPGoa,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,sad decline of a great visit,"I have visited this spice farm about a dozen times over the last ten years and was always delighted with the visit.They have kept the price at 400 rs, although the rupee has sunk to nearly half it's value in ten years. So, the quality of the tour has also sunk to  half of what it was. The worst was the replacement of the betel-nut plates with metal ones, completely contrary to the idea of the farm. the tour has shrunk from 45' to 30', the variety  of the food has also diminished, the bananas have disappeared, as has the ice-cream. and the rubbish is not properly cleared in the forest.It used to be the highlight of my yearly stay in Goa"
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,TarlCaboto,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Interesting place to visit with a free lunch if you have had enough of beaches/temples/churches,"This is a very interesting place to visit if you have had enough of beaches/temples/churches. You'll learn all about the various spices and you'll get an all inclusive lunch included in your Rs400 entry fee. You won't see vast plantations of spices though, it's all very small scale, but worth it for the learning and lunch."

Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Kieran G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Ecotourism at its best in modern Spice Farm set in traditional area,"Our visit to Sahakari Spice Farm was both informative as well as immensely enjoyable. The verdant drive to Ponda in a clear sunny morning after heavy unseasonal rains set the mood and tempo. We were greeted with a traditional welcome of kumkum and garland, and a cup of herbal tea with lemon grass, ginger and cinnamon. Our tour guide spoke impeccable English as he led us over a babbling stream past various spice and fruit trees. This spice farm has been growing Areca nuts, pepper etc for 800 years. This current generation has broadened the business and made it into an eco tourist destination where they show over many nut and spices plants (Tumeric, All Spice, Nutmeg, Mace, Vanilla, Cocoa, Pepper, Coffee, Cashew, Betel nut etc)  Caveat: The place has limited parking for 25 cars and there were a lot more when we visited."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Jane,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Awesome experience,"For only 400 rupees we got a tour of the spice farm, a welcome drink of tea and all you can eat food. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and it was really cool to see all the spices we eat in their natural form. Our guide even gave us free shots of the cashew liquor henni made on site! The food was awesome and 5 of us ate here and none of us got sick. The food was generally vegetarian and super tasty. "

Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Shankari Sakthi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Spice varieties and their plants exploration,"Its worth for the amount u paid at entrance , to walk around the spice farm , guide will explain the spice plants and their produces. its very natural and the smell around the farm makes you feel warm . The lunch provided there is awesome. You could taste goan style food , both veg and non veg provided."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Sundeep K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Entry fees of 400/- per person is not justified.,"I am giving a neutral review because I feel the plantation fees(400/-) is unjustified. It includes food but why would they want people to compulsorily pay for the food even if they don't want the food, they should have the option of without food entry. I feel this will increase their footfall. These places are far from main Goa tourist places so once people reach there , they will tend to pay the high entry fees. We didn't knew about this so the meal was a waste for us, as we already had our food. Also even if we had known about this, we would not have taken the meal there as we are vegetarian and prefer not to take meal at some not so well-known place which is serving veg and non-veg meals together. I would recommend this place only if they start offering entry option at about 150-200 per person (without Food)."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Mathias F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Nice and interesting,"We went here in december of 2013. Had a great time. nice environment and nice people. They knew the name of their spices in several different languages, which made the visit much more fulfilling since I only know spices as some kind of powder in different glassss jars. I would recommend the trip to visit them, we still use their Chilipowder in our cooking, hot but tasty."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Rebecca,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo,Beautiful in monsoon,"Really recommend if you like nature! It was really lush and green in monsoon, the tour guide was very informative and friendly, great service! The tour didn’t last too long that made me bored personally but was long enough to feel you gained some knowledge and could ask as many questions as you liked! It was only 400INR for a welcome tea, information pack about spices and their properties, entry, tour, really good veggie buffet (but I think they offered non veggie also) and also at the end a shot of alcohol from a plant in the plantation and some essential oil water poured down our back. Was a really enjoyable experience! Also a small shop sells some spices and other items from the plantation for good prices! Recommend if you have a spare hour or two nearby!"
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Amy K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,A great afternoon made sense to visit this after Dudhsagar Falls,"The Plantation is not very far from Dudhsagar Falls., even so to get to fall you go through forest... but to actually be in jungle like forest at the Plantation was way out of the World.  They greet you with rose petal flowers showered on you...what a wonderful welcome... The Tour Guide took us around to show us some of the spices grown here... To watch travellers showers by elephant was a treat....At least the lunch was included and set in beautiful natural surrounding of trees.... and served on l think were plates made out of banana leafs.... the food were cooked in clay pots..some one once commented why their were clay pots here and there at the Plantation.. these are actually used to make Alcohol from the Apple part of the Cashew nut.. After the seed is detached from the Apple... The ripe orange red apple is crushed (tradially by feet).. to squeeze out the juice.   These is than put in the clay pots and boiled....and distilled and tormented for about 6 weeks... at this stage there is very little Achohol...   Than the whole process is repeated and this is how the traditionaly make Cashew nut Alcohol..

Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Anand Rehpade,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Very Horrible,"This is hopeless place if you are travelling by own car. The staff at first gate and near parking is very rude and they will misbehave with you all the time. Parking management was terribly poor and the parking and security staff will misguide you at all time. Even if you ask for the responsible person phone number, they will again start arguing with you. As per them , so called responsible manager has not given his number. Many of us finally left the spot as first impression was so dangerous , that we have not taken a chance. As far as possible , please avoid . They got the publicity very early but  I doubt they will go long... Over all very very very bad"

They give information about key spices and how they grow, useful information for first timers. I didn’t try the lunch which was part of package as the vegetarian fare was very basic."

We enjoyed excursion with the guide ( they provide excursions in different languages: russian, english, etc.) The territory is well organised and you can find out interesting things and facts.So my advice - take half a day to visit farm. Even hot day can be pleasant there.Also you can buy spices, different oils and ,medicine there.We liked this place very much and will advice it to friends and travellers."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Scottnzuk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,"Amazing experience, learn so much.","it costs 400 Rupees, around 4.50 pounds or 5.80 USD. That also includes a basic but good indian lunch, its buffet so can eat any time. no need to book beforehand. I would recommend going in taxi in small group to avoid big bus trips that can overload the place when busy.Tour guide we had she was amazing making jokes and great tips about what to look for when buying and background information.

The price was very reasonable, 400 rupees for a welcome tea drink, (which u can sip while reading about essential oils they have and how to mix them for different remedies), guided tour(they take you in small groups- met some lovely people), a small taste of local feni alcohol and lunch (indian food, veg and non veg options). They had english and local speaking guides, which were super friendly and very informative! At the end of the tour they have a little shop where u can buy all the essential oils and products you read about which are also very reasonably priced. We had a great experience! "

Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Rohit Parashar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,A must visit place in Goa.,"It is a family owned private spice plantation in Goa, near Mangeshi Temple. Ticket is 400 for adults and 200 for kids below 7 years of age. This ticket includes a very tasty lunch. After lunch you take a tour with a tour guide it takes about 45 minutes to one hour for the tour where the tour guide tells about different spices and condiments. Tour guides are knowledgeable people with knowledge of Herbs and their effects on the body. And they present the facts in a bit humorous way. It takes about 1hr and 15 minutes by car from Calangute to this place. So it is almost a half a day activity which includes lunch."

We were greeted with kumkum on our foreheads and flower garlands at the entrance as a traditional welcome and offered a cup of herbal tea. Then we were taken for about 30 minutes guided tour in the spice garden. We could see a good variety of spices like allspice tree, cloves, black pepper, cinnamon, coffee, cocoa, areca nuts, cashew trees, vanilla etc. It was a good experience overall."

I was comfortable in Hindi so I took hindi guide and she explained us well about the facts of Indian spices.At the end of tour we were taken by her for Lunch . There were Veg and Non Veg meals so, I went to the veg one . The lunch was very much delicious. I recommended it in the South Goa Sightseeing.

Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Trix,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Left feeling very distressed !,Witnessing the treatment of the elephants at the end of the spice farm trip totally ruined the experience and the rest of my holiday. To see those poor elephants being dragged by their ears and hit with sticks for the sake of tourism was truly heartbreaking. The handlers were extremely aggressive towards the elephants...shouting and hitting them to make them pose for pictures. This ‘attraction’ is totally unnecessary.....if tourists stop going hopefully one day those elephants can live in peace. Please take this into consideration .....if you care for animals do not visit !!!

Thank you!"
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Lee M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Too horrible for words,"Visited as part of an organised tour. Food was included as was a guided tour. People were also encouraged to pay an additional 700rs for an elephant ride or an elephant shower. We were led to a benched area where we were left waiting for quite some time before a buffet was brought out. There was very little on offer, only a handful of dishes were available. We were again left for a considerable amount of time before a guide came. The tour itself was very lacklustre with very little to see. You spent most of it trying to get past other groups. It lasted between 15-20mins. We were then led to where the elephants were. I was horrified to see these beautiful creatures beaten with sticks and kicked to make them walk. I asked the plantation worker who was dealing with tickets, who owned the elephants. She quickly told me that they were nothing to do with the plantation. I found this very hard to believe since the staff clearly supported what was going on and took cash for it. Even having it at the end of the tour and people being lead to the elephants suggests that they are indeed part of the plantation. I came away feeling angry and upset but more so, helpless as I didn’t know what to do to help the two elephants. I have written to the Indian high commission for advice. It’s truly heartbreaking to see what I saw and I do not want the people to get away with it. Please please please do not go on trips that support elephant based activities and please help the two elephants sahakari have. They don’t deserve a life of abuse. "

The food was okay. For a roti eating North Indian, nothing special in the lunch. All said and done, the price for the tour was very high. 400INR is not the worth."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Ronabir A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Not too spicy!,"We read about and had heard the reviews of this spice plantation. The road there from Panjim was a good drive and you have to be careful as some parts of the road are being upgraded. On entry you are greeted with hot lemongrass tea and some brochures on various spices and their applications. The guided tour lasts almost for 25-30 mins with the guide explaining about the history of the place to showing you the spice plants such as nutmeg, cardomom, pepper, cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa etc. He gave us a bit of explanation about each with some benefits. He was very lively and made the explanations lively, however this seemed a very rehearsed routine. We also saw a feni distillery and cashewnut tree, one of the most prominent nuts being grown in Goa/ Konkan.The tour warpped up with a shot of Feni and some water being poured on your back for relaxation. The lunch was tasty with both, veg n non veg dishes and rice/curry. You can buy soft drinks, beer and other drinks at the counter. It was a good break away from the usual suspects  of beach bumming and drinking. It also was a bit informative and the plantation itself is a nice green space if you want to roam around. So visit this one, but so not have huge expectations."

The meal was great but don’t expect high quality; I had rice and fried first and spicy curry mutton with bread rolls and I was thought it was fine. You can buy water, fizzy drinks, fruit juices and beer and the prices are reasonable.Overall a nice visit after travelling around nonstop between the golden triangle."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Nigel H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Interesting but beware of being financially exploited,"The visit was interesting enough but was spoiled by blatant exploitation of tourists with overinflated pricing of products.  If you decide to buy some of the products and you see a sign that says the cost of each packet is Rs 200 each, look at the label on the packets that prices them at Rs 90 and insist on paying only this.  The Feni sample they offer you at lunch is good, but the small plastic bottle you can buy there tastes watered down.  A superior 750ml good quality bottle can be bought cheaply in many shops.  Rs 400 entry feel plus overinflated prices of products and a sense of obligation to leave a top for the person they call ""Monkey Man"" who demonstrates how to climb a palm tree all adds up.  I don't mind paying a fair price, but finding out later that I was charged Rs 200 for sample packets priced at Rs 90 was a bit of a spoiler for me and left me feeling that an otherwise interesting and worthwhile visit was primarily an opportunity to exploit tourists which I found disrespectful - Hence 2 points not 4."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Rakhisyaman,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Nice outing away from the beaches,"The farm gave us a nice welcome with a flower shower and also a warm welcome drink. (Would have been nicer with a cooler drink on a hot and humid day)The farm had nutmeg, turmeric, mace, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, all spice etc. they also have a dent distilling unit and cashew trees.I thought our guide, Yash could tell us more on the other trees/plants etc. The tour ends with a the guide pouring down cold water with cintronella and lavender down your back. It is mildly irritating when it happens, but you will thank him/her later. Lunch was very sumptuous and you can also buy beer there. The store there stocks all organic spices and cold pressed oil which were reasonably priced"

He kept hitting the elephant in the head with a stick- right into an open wound. Animals looked tired and undernourished. Still the elephant “driver” kept on asking for extra tip money for himself from all of those who did an elephant ride, even after they paid the full amount that was asked for a ride.I was left feeling greatly saddened by the way these poor animals were tortured."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Shyam,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,An ok experience,"We were suggested a spice farm tour by our hotel concierge. Since we had rented a bike for the day and had been to the beaches of north goa a zillion times,thinking we could get away from the hustle bustle of the city, we decided it should be worth it. The bike ride through the mountains and acres of coconut of planation was exciting. As we entered the spice farm, the greeting was warm and welcoming. Until then everything was exciting. The tour was a complete let down as we expected to see spice cultivation in a bigger scale. But we quickly went through the each of the spices and the tour ended in about 30-40 mins time. This was followed by simple and tasty konkan lunch. We recommend that you arrive there before 12 PM as we saw the crowd double in a matter of 30 mins. "
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Josie B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Elephant ride : A daylight robbery !!,"We first went for the elephant ride, then to the Spice farm and I planned to may be book the second activity with the elephant : ""being showered by an elephant in a river while seating on its back"" but the elephant ride totally put us off as we paid 1400 Rs in cash  for 2 people for 6 minutes of ride (70m on the car park and 70m on a path with no view but the car park) not even enjoying the ride as the ""elephant rider"" bothered us insisting of a tip. It is a trap for tourists ! While it seemed in the contrary that (for the same price) the ""elephant shower"" (which I witnessed) is a nice experience in a river, lasting longer and in nice surrondings (not in a middle of a car park !!). Elephants's maintenance might be high but yet they should not take us for bloody fools. Not worth more than 400 Rs. Luckily we had a lovely experience at the Spice farm afterwards (and this time worth every penny - 400 Rs for a guided visit of the farm with explanation about plants in an amazing property + lunch included)"

It's open till 4.30. 400 per person. Half hour guided tour admit the spice plantations. I opted for English speaking tour. They explained very clearly. Elephant ride doesn't belong to this farm, as informed by my tour guide and it's charged separately and we need to use a different gate as entrance. But we could see the elephant in their farm. Elephant was not been treated well by d person in-charge of them. Could see him using a iron rod to make d elephant listen to his commands. Looking at this I dropped d idea of taking an elephant ride. But the farm was good. You can shop those spices. Food included in d package was very bad. One can visit if really interested to knowing about spices."
Sahakari_Spice_Farm-Ponda_North,Georgina,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Afternoon at the Spice Plantation,"Having always wanted to visit a spice plantation I thoroughly enjoyed our trip-here. The entrance fee was Upon arrival is around 400 rupees per adult. As we do not have children I am not 100% on the charge for them. we were greeted by a lady who showers you in fresh, fragrant flowers and put a Bindi dot on our forehead. At this point we were slightly confused as to where to go, we noticed a small hut to the left where people where waiting and we decided to head there. This was the welcome area. We were given fresh hot lemon grass tea whilst we waited for our tour guide. There were informative leaflets dotted round with various remedies to cure any minor health issues. These where interesting to read as I suffer from psoriasis and one of the leaflets where advising which spices/herbs/natural juices where best to cure. Once our tour guide arrived 10 minutes later we made our way around the spice plantation. I would say that this took around 30 minutes. It was very informative, interesting and nice to see where all of our spices actually come from instead of just buying them ready made on the supermarket shelves. Our tour guide gave us small amounts of leaves etc and asked us to guess which spice it was. This kept us interested throughout the tour. We saw the elephant - a 48year old female in the river, she belongs to the plantation and is very well looked after. They do offer elephant showers here for an extra charge but we declined that offer and enjoyed watching her in the water. After our tour had finished we were shown to the open eatery which is inclusive within your entrance fee. The food is clearly cooked fresh using their own spices. However, it is not the best of standards. We did enjoy our meals, they were tasty but we had to watch out for bits of bone which where lingering in the curry! Never the less, we enjoyed our experience and I would return again if I had the chance. "

Available in a few different languages. A lunch is included with the entry price and is a good snack where you could probably go back for 'seconds' if you are particularly hungry.  There is also a small retail counter selling the plantations spice products to take away.  Extra attraction was the planation's elephant and workers transporting baskets of compost to various parts of the estate.  A real working venue, not just a tourist site."

There were 2 of them, only small, and being loaded up with tourists one after the other. They didn't go very far, but when stationary they rocked backwards and forwards. Their eyes were dead. It was heartbreaking. We declined to ride them and I felt the need to reach out and hold one's trunk.
