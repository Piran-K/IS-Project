The largest church in the whole of Asia and taking around a 100 years to build back in 1562... Though now the interior has all white washed walls throughout, there are arches/chapels to the left and right aisles where the white paint has been removed to reveal the beautifully artistic fresco paintings that once covered the whole interior!! One can only imagine its splendour back in its day! So whether you’re religious or not, this church is definitely worth a visit for it’s architecture alone... very interesting!! "

Se_Cathedral-Panjim_North,138500423,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,First Impressive Church At Old Goa Campus,"Most Impressive Churches I Ever Saw.1)	Old Church:Old Goa is the most famous tourist place for following impressive old churches:a)	St. Francis of Assisib)	Se Cathedralc)	Basilica of BOM JesusEach church has one museum. All above churches are in same campus.2)	My Two Goa Visits: Visited first in April 2017 for 3 days & second time in Sept 2018 for 1 day. Explored complete Goa beaches during these 2 visits.3)	MisconceptionDuring my past two Goa visits, I asked my Goan guide, Goan hotel owner as well as few Goans on best sightseeing places in Goa other than beaches. Their answer was:a)	Old churchb)	Dudhsagar waterfallc)	Mangeshi templed)	Shantadurga templeThe most common answer from Goans was Old Church.My mind was unable to accept church as a sightseeing place. Moreover, I used to wonder, what will be there for tourists to see in church. I had this misconception; I hope & feel sure that many will have this misconception.4)	Misconception To True Perception a)	My Third Visit To GoaI was on my third visit of 6 days to Goa from 24th to 29th Nov 2019. Visited old churches on 26th Nov. 2019.b)	Surprising SightTourists from all religions, including foreigners in large numbers visit old church in old Goa. It was the testimony of the most favorite destination in Goa for the tourists.c)	 Actual Visit Will Give You The True Perception On These ChurchesAfter visiting all the 3 churches, I understood why the Goans had old church as the most common answer for my question on best sightseeing places in Goa.If you are also one like me carrying the misconception on church then it is a must thing for you to visit old churches in Goa.  Now I have true perception on old churches of Goa as an impressive & must sightseeing place.During this 3rd Goa visit of mine, I visited old church, Dudhsagar waterfall, Mangeshi temple & Shantadurga temple. Old church impressed me a lot & Dudhsagar too. Mangeshi & Shantadurga temples are landmark temples of Goa. Both are good. 5)	The Ever Lasting ImpressionAfter seeing these impressive churches, there is an ever lasting impression in my mind with a following thought - can there be a church in any country of the world more impressive than these old churches of Goa.6)	The Things That Impressed Me Lot At Old Churches Are:a)	The inside baroque architecture on both the sidewall of churches b)	The big green picturesque garden with green trees  c)	Wheel chair & special toilet facility for disabled d)	Food snacks stallse)	Basic facilities such as cold drinking water & washroom  7)	Location & Distance Of Old Church Goa:Old church is located in old Goa at 10 km from Panaji Bus Stand.Use GPS from any place in Goa, it will guide you accurately.

Se_Cathedral-Panjim_North,Madhulika L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,One of Old Goa’s two most famous churches,"Of all the monuments which form the UNESCO World Heritage site of Old Goa’s churches, the massive Sé Cathedral and the Basilica of Bom Jesus, which faces it across the road, are the most popular. Of the two, the cathedral (or, to give it its full name, the Sé Catedral de Santa Caterina) was consecrated in 1640. This church has an interesting connection to the political history of Goa: in 1510, the first governor of Goa, Afonso de Albuquerque, defeated a Muslim army and captured the city of Goa. To commemorate that victory, the church was commissioned—and since the day of the victory was the feast day of St Catherine of Alexandria, the cathedral was dedicated to her. Accordingly, there are several depictions of St Catherine in the cathedral, including at the altar. There’s lots of gilded decoration, all in good condition, and some beautifully varied styles of decoration in the chapels that line the sides of the church: we did a complete round of the chapels, and saw everything from beautifully painted figures to old tiles and carved stone. No entry fee is charged for the cathedral, but they are fairly strict about behaviour in the cathedral: please be modestly dressed (no shorts or bikini tops!), don’t make a noise, and do not take photographs of religious ceremonies or of people—this includes not taking selfies, group photos, or photos of each other. I saw church staff members on duty scolding people who were trying to surreptitiously take selfies. Unless you want to be publicly scolded, avoid doing this!"
