Shantadurga_Temple-Panjim_North,PAVITRA SHIBAD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Family,Ancient temple of GSBs,"The minute I stepped inside the temple, I felt the positive and powerful vibes. Much needed in today's world.The temple is open from morning 8am to evening 6pm even during COVID, which is good as it prevents over-crowding of visitors.The main entrance is closed. You have to go just one lane ahead where the lane to the back entrance starts.Entry was not allowed without masks and the person at the entrance was noting down temperature checks of the visitors along with their address and phone number. Sanitizers were provided.Social distancing was followed.Important is modest dressing is a must. No sleeveless, half skirts, shorts or short clothes allowed. Hands and legs and legs should be fully covered.The original temple was first built in Quelossim. But after Portuguese invasion, the temple was destroyed and later built by the Maratha Empire in Kavlem, where it is now.The temple is dedicated to Shree Shantadurga, the goddess of peace. Durga, who is often portrayed exuding fury and aggression, appears in a gentler form in Goa. Shanta, in Sanskrit, means peace. According to Hindu mythology, the goddess got her name after she settled a quarrel between Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. According to legend, the quarrel turned bitter and became so fierce that it threatened to destroy the entire universe. Fearing annihilation, Lord Brahma pleaded Goddess Parvati to interfere. Taking the form of Shantadurga, the goddess took Shiva by her left hand and Vishnu by her right and pacified the duo.Thus, the idol of the goddess is flanked by the statues of Shiva and Vishnu. The goddess holds serpents in each hand, representing Shiva and Vishnu.This is the famous kuldevi of the Goud Saraswat Brahmin community.Very peaceful and positive place. Definitely visit at least once."

When the Saraswats came to Goa from Trihotrapuri ( present-day Trihut division ) in the Mithila region of Bihar , Loma Sharma of Kaushik Gotra brought Shanta Durga with him . The priest told us that before Puraan Kaal , there was a fierce fight between Lord Shankar and Lord Vishnu , to decide the supremacy at mount Gomanchala . At one moment  Shankar was on the verge of using   the Pashupati Astra , which would have wiped the entire universe . Lord Brahma , the creator , then urged  the Adishakti to intervene . She , in turn , sent Parvati in the form of Shanta Durga or Shanteri . Shantadurga stepped in as the arbitrator , She took Shankar by her left hand & Vishnu by her right and pacified the two .  Hence she stands in the temple shrine in between Shiva and Vishnu . She is also shown here holding two serpents , one in each hand , representing  Shankar and  Vishnu .Shanta Durga temple is a fusion of Indo-Portuguese architecture .The temple consists of pyramidal roofs with the addition of a dome on the slope in the bosom of a chain of mountains .

The original temple at Quelossim (Keloshi) in mormugao was destroyed by the Portuguese in 1566. The goddess was shifted to Kavalem and worship was continued there.
