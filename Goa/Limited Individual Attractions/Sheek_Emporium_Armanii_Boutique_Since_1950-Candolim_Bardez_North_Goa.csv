Sheek_Emporium_Armanii_Boutique_Since_1950-Candolim_Bardez_North,SimonB,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Sartaj Sheek Emporium bespoke clothing Goa,"I'd researched this place prior to going to Goa and visited on our 1st day. Immediately took a liking to Sartaj, as he was very professional, extremely helpful, and took plenty of time to show us fabrics and explain his processes. We had numerous shirts, shorts, dresses and a leather jacket made by him, all excellent quality, perfect fit and reasonably priced. Although we never purchased he does jewellery too. Once he has your size he can ship worldwide. If you are in Goa and in the market for bespoke clothes or jewellery I would highly recommend a visit."

The quality of the shirts I had made were excellent nothing is to much trouble. The professionalism of Sartaj and his father is something to behold.

Sheek_Emporium_Armanii_Boutique_Since_1950-Candolim_Bardez_North,fashion_designer_786,,,,You really MUST pay Sartaj a visit when you are in Goa. He is simply the BEST tailor EVER.

I've attached this years üòÅ He can make absolutely anything and if I lived a little closer I most certainly would be asking him to make my wedding dress for me.

I will definitely be back when I am next in Goa!"
,,,,,"Sartaj and Shafiq are not only the best tailors in Candolim Goa, but they are fast becoming equally famous for their jewellery business. The variety, quality and workmanship of jewellery is unmatched. Sartaj understood the sentimental attachment I had to my mother's antique amethyst ring. Keeping the original filigree gold bed,Sartaj was able to size the ring perfectly, and seamlessly rebuilt its gold band and claws. The finished product has a brilliant amethyst with a polished lustre, and has never looked so magnificent. I wear my mother's ring with love, pride and happiness. Thank you Sartaj and Shafiq."
Sheek_Emporium_Armanii_Boutique_Since_1950-Candolim_Bardez_North,David Taylor,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Great Tailor 2,"We always go to Sheek emporium when we visit Goa. It never disappoints took some trousers I like from U.K. and asked for them to be copied in a different colour. They fit great and fantastic material from Italy. Also had 3 shirts made, again great fit and good advice from Sartaj and the team. What I like about sheek emporium is they use designs  and material that you don‚Äôt get in UK So it feels exclusive. My wife also had some trousers and a blouse made she was really pleased. The only problem for me is due to lockdown I‚Äôve not been able to wear any of it."
Sheek_Emporium_Armanii_Boutique_Since_1950-Candolim_Bardez_North,Janis H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful earrings,Staying in Candolim we looked on Tripadvisor for a bespoke jewellery maker and Sheek Emporium had excellent reviews. Some years ago I had purchased a pendant necklace in the Caribbean and wanted some gold and diamond earrings to match. I didn‚Äôt have the item with me but found something similar online and gave a picture it to Sartak. He said he could do this. He kept me informed right through the process and within a few days I had my earrings. I am absolutely delighted with his workmanship and the price is extremely good. He even gave us a refund on his original quote because he hadn‚Äôt used as much gold material as he anticipated. Apart from his excellent work and very good price he is also a lovely gentleman and on our last few hours before departing Goa he invited us to his shop for coffee and cake.  Would not hesitate to use again. Very genuine and excellent quality.

Both my boyfriend and I had ideas of what we wanted (shirts and a jacket for him, a shirt and a top for me). We dealt with Sartaj who was so warm, welcoming and professional. His eye for detail and measurements were perfect. He helped us choose fabrics and allowed me to go upstairs and find some more (I found a vintage purple floral fabric which was just perfect for the shirt I had made). The quality, price and overall service (including several fittings) made this a really great experience. The shirts and jacket my boyfriend had made are of really excellent quality; the fit is almost perfect and the lining of the jacket shows the level of care and experience of the tailors. Since returning to the UK, we have kept in touch and have ordered some additional clothes using the measurements taken when we were there. Thanks so much to Sartaj & Shafiq.

Whilst visiting Goa I decided to have a couple of shirts made so I visited the Sheek Emporium after reading reviews on Trip advisor. The shop is run by a father and son team who were very friendly and spoke good english. After trawling through reams of material I chose the ones i wanted for my shirts, they took my measurements and a couple of days later my shirts were ready and I was really pleased with the results lovely attention to detail like coloured cotton stitching to match the colours on the shirt material. I was so pleased I ended up also having a jacket and two pair of trousers made. The shirts were ¬£20 each and the trousers ¬£30 though thats dependent on the material you choose. The jacket too the longest to make, about four days with a fitting in between. A great experiance for me due to the service I recieved I will certainly use their services again next time I visit Goa."
