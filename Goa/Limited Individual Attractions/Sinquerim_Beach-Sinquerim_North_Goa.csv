You can enjoy the beautiful sunset and sunrise from the top of round shape fort. You can also trek for 15 min to the left of fort to see the kaurati caves and devil's finger(rock formation) at the beach. Try water sports and boat rides from here to make your visit special."

Sinquerim_Beach-Sinquerim_North,Srinivasan Ramchand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,One of the best North Goa beaches,"One of the best beaches in North Goa. Scenic panoramic view from the Lower Aguada Fort - one of the best sunset points. The beach can get busy during evenings and weekends. The best time to visit is before 9am in the morning when the sun is not too harsh and you can have the beach for yourself (very few people visit at that time). Parking can become quite messy during evenings and weekends. There are various water sporting options but beware of the high tides. We saw families neglecting the coast guard warnings and venturing into the sea, which is not safe at all! The beach is immaculately clean, soft sand, clear water. Definitely recommend multiple visits during your stay (if you pick a hotel in North Goa)"

Sinquerim_Beach-Sinquerim_North,CheekyKB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Quieter alrernative to Calangute/Candolim,"Probably the quietest beach between Calangute, Candolim and Sinquerim. The sand was still laden with rubbish from domestic Indian tourists but the shacks were quieter. Loads of stray dogs roaming the beaches and quite aggressive."

Sinquerim_Beach-Sinquerim_North,Bhavi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Beautiful beach,"Sinquerim beach is a beautiful and a much cleaner beach. Yes,it is definitely much less crowded than calangute n Baga beach and perhaps that's why more preserved. It makes for a beautiful post card picture kind of beach. There is a key shape kind of spot on the beach where you can get some amazing clicks. N yess u have water sports too. Infact there were quite a few people doing watersports here and I think it's a good idea since it's very very crowded at calangute n Baga and thus often u have a waiting time.There are some amazing shacks too. I think it's a must visit place if u are looking for relaxation and tranquility."

Sinquerim_Beach-Sinquerim_North,Darpan_Puri,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,A secluded and less visited beach,"Not a very clean beach , mostly deserted and very close to the Taj hotels. Parking can be an issue as the approaching road towards this beach is very narrow."
Sinquerim_Beach-Sinquerim_North,Gowruv,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Business,Clean but costly...,"Though there is not much night life here, perhaps proximity to Taj Augoda has made it relatively costlier for whatever water-sports fcalities are available here..."
Sinquerim_Beach-Sinquerim_North,Vijay Shah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Superlative View ,"Sinquerim Beach is 1st beach to start the long shore line of North Goa...once u enter from Panjim side. Fort Aquoda n This beach makes together a lethal combination to spend some time in tranquility. Great views from various heights of the ocean. Different views, photo angles, proximity to Taj Resort. This beach has in all which other beaches do not have....sunset view was breathtaking from a height...must go place...but recommended cab with chaufer or best is to ride these with rented Bike.."
