St_Cajetan_s_Church-Old,Mi Do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Must see!,"The construction of the churchwas completed in 1661. The design of the church resembles St. . Peter's Basilica in Rome. Perhaps this similarity is due to the fact that the head of the construction of the project was an Italian monk of the Order of Theatines. The church is dedicated to Our Lady of Divine Conduct, but bears the name of Saint Cajetan, the founder of the Order of Theatines.  The architectural idea of the church is in many ways similar to similar Catholic churches in Goa, but it is the only surviving domed Catholic church in Goa. The church is made in the Corinthian style, while the gilded altars decorated with rich carvings represent the Baroque style. Must see!"

St_Cajetan_s_Church-Old,HarryHSR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Beautiful & Serene Church in Old Goa,"This Church looks very beautiful from outside, not as massive as the other Churches and Cathedrals in Old Goa, located close to the Viceroy's Arch (Mandovi river) We did not go inside the Church as the kids were very tired, but the church is surrounded by beautiful gardens and the 'Adil Shah Doorway' is also located in the complex of this Church.The church is considered to have been modeled on St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City and hence the architecture is extremely beautiful and looks very serene ...did not see many people here as the location is a little walk from the main road"
St_Cajetan_s_Church-Old,Govind S. Poteker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Italian Styled Church,"Close to the bank of River Mandovi stands the famous St Cajetan Church dedicated to Our Lady of Providence in Velho Goa (Old Goa). When one approaches the 17th century church from the river walking across the Viceroy’s Arch on the left hand side, the sight of this church is unmistakable for its unique dome shaped structure, only of a kind in Goa. Below the dome is a fresh water well.It has more sedate locale from the hustle-bustle of its neighbouring Se Cathedral, the largest church in Goa and Basilica of Bom Jesus. This church has some similarity to St Peter’s Basilica at Vatican City. As one faces this church, just outside its precinct is a small arched structure considered to be the Gate of Yusuf Adil Shah Palace, the former ruler of Bijapur in the late 15th and early 16th century when Goa was part of the Bijapur Sultanate. The motifs on the gate appears to be that of some Indian style carving often observed in temple architecture"

It was very peaceful with greenery all around. The church is generally missed by the tourists. The inside of the church is  clean but there were visible signs of wear and tear which saddened me to think that it might not survive for the future generations. There was a museum also next to the Church but it was closed that day. Do spend some quiet me time in the church."

For one thing, few tourists bother with it; we had the whole place to ourselves. This made it a much more contemplative experience than some of the others. However, the real highlight is the jaw-dropping beauty of the interior. While its Italianate exterior impresses, it was the interior which really surprised.The wooden altars are very well-preserved and extremely ornate.

Beautiful imposing architecture with a big beautiful dome, a massive sculpted altarpiece and a well tended front garden the church was just besides the Shah and then Viceroy Palace (long gone). As in many Goan churches there are plenty of bizarre rules for photo taking.It is surprising the church is not more popular with pilgrims as St Cajetan is the patron of the unemployed and the document controllers - which include a large part of the population.

They were not permitted to work in Golconda, so they came to Goa on 25th October 1640& they began the construction of a hospital but the local Viceroy stopped their activities in 1643 and asked them to leave Goa in 1645. However their  leader went back to Portugal to explain to the King, Dom João IV, that it would be in the interest of Christian religion if they were allowed to work in Goa together with the Portuguese priests.Impressed by the determination of the Italian friar, the King gave permission to build the hospital in 1650. In 1655, the Theatines managed to obtain permission to build the Church and also a Convent. The construction of the Church was completed in 1661.This church is half a kilometer away to the north east of the Se Cathedral. "

But what is most amazing about it is the architecture, as golden hour light falls on it the whole facade literally glows with golden white hues. Photographer`s delight. Once you enter inside make sure you look in all directions because it has something to offer. Guard tells me that mass is held on request and this is not a ""regular"" church. Totally worth a visit!"
St_Cajetan_s_Church-Old,Myo M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Solo,"With a ""beautiful"" front yard garden :)","Among all the churches of Old Goa, this one has the ""most"" beautiful front yard featuring a lovely garden with a life-sized statue of the saint (who the church was named after); and in a way, it's also ""grander"" than the other churches since it has a dome above.Inside the Church though, you'll see things ""less glittering"" compared to Basilica of Bom Jesus and especially Se Cathedral, but still no less impressive than those of the other churches is the ""main structure"" at the altar area at the far end with sculptures of angels carved on its face and a big crown on top; also to be seen are panels (maybe some are like secondary altars) on the two sides along the length of the Church, some depicting the saint and some the Crucifixion, and some big paintings on the walls depicting the life of the saint.This church is just a ""little bit"" out of the way from Old Goa's main area kind of ""clustered"" with Basilica of Bom Jesus (with the tomb of St. Francis Xavier inside), Se Cathedral (with ""glittering"" panels depicting saints & the Crucifixion) and Church of St. Francis of Assisi (with a ""museum of Goa"" in one part of the Church), but it's still very much in a walking distance from those (just about a 5-minute walk all the way to the right on the backstreet after exiting from the back side of Se Cathedral); also after this church (which you should do after those three main churches), another one worth checking out is Church of St. Augustine (just a ruin but still very much worth going to with its pretty tall tower) about a half-hour walk west from here (you'll have to go through the ""main area"" with the three churches again).The direct bus from Panjim takes only like 20 minutes; but if you're coming anywhere from North Goa (like I did, setting out from Anjuna where I stayed while in Goa), you'll first have to take the bus to Mapusa (which is like the ""transportation hub"" for North Goa) and then the buses from Mapusa to Panjim and from Panjim to Old Goa."

Interiors of this church are done in wood which include the pulpit.
St_Cajetan_s_Church-Old,MikeATL,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Solo,Nice church among a cluster of churches in Old Goa,"I was there in NOv 2015. Old Goa has the famous Cathedral with the remains of St Francis Xavier-that is NOT this church. But if you are visiting Old Goa there are many churches all visible and walkable so just go from one to the next!  This one is farther back to the NE direction and had few people. There was only only other person walking around so it was very quiet. The door was open, and hardly anyone around.  It appeared to very well kept and has buildings to the side.  I suggest you go to all the churches to give you an idea of the time periods and styles. The first is a small old stone church, very basic but from the early 1500s!  This is more recent. Generally there is info on the churches year of construction, etc.  Its probably a 5 or 6 minute walk from the next nearest church, very easy!"

St_Cajetan_s_Church-Old,Manish K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Solo,Extremely beautiful church in Old Goa...do not miss it,"The St. Cajetan church in Old Goa is often overlooked, as compared to the more famous Se Cathedral and Basilica of Bom Jesus. However, this church, located near the Victory Arch and between the cathedral and the Old Goa jetty, is an attraction not to be missed.Both the interiors and exterior of the church are in very good shape and contain impressive paintings depicting the life of Jesus Christ and various incidents from the Bible. Though not as large as other churches, this church is extremely beautiful and forms an integral part of the entire UNESCO World Heritage Site of Old Goa."

St_Cajetan_s_Church-Old,GuelphTraveller,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Solo,Bad Church Attitude,In a country that prays for economic help you would think there would be respect for and consideration for tourists. On the day that I visited this church there was one car parked right in front of the church and in a non-parking zone. This was the Director's car. Despite asking three times if it could be moved and including watching the Director walk right by it - it was made very clear to me that the Director was far to grand and arrogant to consider such a thing for a mere tourist. It is too bad the church does not understand that it is tourists who are bringing employment and business opportunities to their parishoners.Otherwise the church itself is lovely with beaytiful white interiors that highlight a number of baroque style altars and shrines as well as early paintings. The building was constructed in 1661 and has a resemblence to St Peter's in Rome. There are also attractive gardens.

The interiors are no less impressive and the lesser number of people visiting this church makes for a more serene environment. Interiors are out of this world & truly impressive. Do not miss this if you are in the area."
