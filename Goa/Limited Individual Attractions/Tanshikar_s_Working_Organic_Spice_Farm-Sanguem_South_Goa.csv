Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,tanshikarspicefarm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,An awesome experience,"We were 2 families during the visit.Interest grew from TripAdvisor, Google reviews supported by a thumbs up from a couple of my friends who had been there.You need to do the bookings directly through their website or via phone.Dont expect a well designed corporate structure, professional or scripted talk or any of it when coming here. I would not even call it a business because it is not run like one.   What is going to blow you over is a Family Run Farm, which is run with a lot of dedication and truthfulness(I have never used this word in any of my past reviews).The owner Mr Chinmay Tanshiker was handed over a farm by the previous generation which he has turned into a place where people like us can get our kids to show the wonders of nature.Few details of the property1)  Very Good Rooming Options (Mud Houses, Tree Houses, Individual Houses etc).I would recommend the mud houses  to get a feel of what village life is).2) Dining Options As per buffet for the day no Ala Carte, But Fresh Juices and Milk Shakes are a treat.3) They have a inhouse adventure activity setup complete with a zip line, the cost is included in the rooming charges.4) Hiking Activities with include two options depending on the time at hand and your willingness to walk.5) A in house fresh water pool to dive in.6) A tour of the plantation with Chinmay himself, very knowledgeable and he makes it interesting for the kids and adults alike.We enjoyed every bit of our 1 night stay at this place and we want to come back for more.Chinmay himself is a award winning Organic Farmer, his wife is as capable as he is , and to listen to his daughter practice her classical singing is a treat to ones ears.The staff or team that this farmhouse has is excellent, a special mention of Dilkhush who stays true to his name.Thank You  Team Tanshiker Farm We Wish You All The Luck"

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,Felix,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great informative tour & high quality organic products,We did the guided tour at Tanshikar spice farm followed by an incredibly delicious buffet style lunch which was included in the tour price. The female guide was very knowledgeable and presented all the informations in a very entertaining way. The farm is operating family owned in the 6th generation and is growing their products organically ever since. As a side business they even produce bio-degradatable plates and cutlery made from dryed betel-palm leafs. If you are in the area make sure you swing by this place and do the tour. You should let them know about your visit in beforehand though to give them a chance to prepare enough food for everyone.

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,Dippy,,,,A visit to this spice farm is a MUST on a visit to Goa.We were lucky to have Mr Chinmay Tanshikar to guide us on this tour and as my father says he is a Vidwaan (genius).We learnt a lot and really enjoyed the tour.A refreshing Kokum drink after the tour was welcome and the lunch tasted amazing.They have a whole array of organically grown spices and other local produce for sale.The almost 250 year old house is an architectural marvel.All in all a must do in Goa.

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,tanshikarspicefarm,,,,"So this is a farm that's been running for five generations and grows loads of different spices, some just for local use and some to export. It is such a fabulous tour and great insight into traditional and innovative farming practices and the guide was sooo knowledgeable not just about local farming but also spice farming history and how it compares to international practices as well - so interesting!An added plus was they they also showed us through a mud house their family had built and they still live in which was fascinating and of course the buffet provided for lunch was delicious (no dodgy tummies here)!Other travelers staying at our hotel went to a different spice farm and weren't impressed at all, which made us feel even more lucky that we were directed to this one.This really was one of the highlights of my stay in Goa, so if you get the chance give it a go and contribute to an incredible small family business while you have a fabulous experience.PS. I had no issues getting spices back into Australia aside for black pepper which has to be treated."

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,Ravi Nagare,,,,"I had a house guest from Mumbai for a mini vacation & we had crammed our days with things to explore and do within four days. One day was marked for the spice plantation..... We called the Plantation to ask if they were open and made reservations with a Mr. Chinmay. Reservations you say?? Yes.... reservations!We were located towards North Goa & the plantation was far down South in Sanguem, near Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary. Mr.Chinmay informed us we would take roughly two hours to reach the plantation. So we figured this will be a full day excursion into beautiful Goa and made reservations for 3 ..... why?? (1) For the one & a half hour tour through the plantation and (2) for the vegetarian meal that is included in the price, more because the food is cooked at home by the owner- Mr. Chinmay‚Äôs wife Gauri. Knowing how many people to expect for the buffet spread helps them to get organised to maximise our experience. WARNING: after a certain point there will be no signal on the cell phones but cortuntely after that point the road leads you through winding roads, plenty of greenery & tiny villages directly to the plantation. We did have to stop at one point to enquire if we were on the right route and were told another 200 mtrs & you will see the sign saying Tanshikar Spice Farm.Now for vital information:Parking place- yes.Toilets (clean & rustic) after the long drive- yes.Welcome drink- yes.Tour- 1 & 1/2 hours approx. Vanilla, spices & bees!! Mr. Chinmay is a third generation ‚Äúplantation-ist‚Äù who works from home so the feel is very homely, unlike the other two I have been too which are  more commercial. Mr. C is very knowledgeable about the history of spices & shares interesting tit bits of info about the various spice plants & their habits, about environmental co- habitation, importance of organic fertilisation & use of organic / natural pesticides which go a long way in maintaining the earth‚Äôs ecological balance, maintaining harmony of nature etc.  it was most enlightening. He also talked about green coffee, cacao seeds and the benefits of curcumin ( the humble haldi - now the latest fad  being Curcumin Latte when India always knew about the benefits of turmeric in our daily diet)Bee farming- yes.Lunch- yes( a simple, typical Goan vegetarian meal.) A small unpretentious  museum - displaying farming / agriculture instruments used down the ages.A walk through their mud house- almost 200 year old.They have tree houses to live in if one wants  to live there for a couple of nights! Sounded exciting!They have zip line & other adventure sports (we didn‚Äôt see where as it had started raining heavily by the time we finished our plantation tour) A small retail outlet to buy spices, pickles, coconut oil, vanilla beans etc. grown / made there.Overall a great experience! What made an impression on my mind is that having studied Commerce & having the option to work & live in a city, earns piles of money, have a fast life, own fancy gadgets, send his children to fancy schools etc. Mr.C chose to live in the family mud house in the back of beyond & make a life & contribute  his bit towards improving the environment! KUDOS to him & his family! Oh!!! and as a parting gift he gave us each a small packet of assorted spices for free!!!!!"

,,,,,"Here you have an authentic experience in a local Spice Farm.  We came by scooter through all the winding roads - I recommend you get a taxi / rent a car (it will be a long way by tuk tuk as well, or at least make sure you have a powerful scooter or motorbike).  The views are great, and we saw a few big cats and monkeys along the way.Super nice staff who take you through what they do.  Bring a little cash to buy some of their spices - and make sure you buy their honey.  They told us about their tree huts, we didn't stay, but its on our list for our next trip to Goa.Make sure you get there for lunch - have the tour before or after.  Lunch is a great tasting buffet."

,,,,,"i had visited some other spice farm in Goa. this time, wanted to visit the best so checked here on tripadvisor and saw tanshikar spice farm with highest score so planned to visit with friends. as it was july with raining most of the time, we were not sure whether we would get to see the farm properly and also whether we would get good information on the spices n other things. but to our surprise it was a great experience. Ms Gauri, the lady of the farm took us around showing us each and every plant and tree and whatever they have in the farm and also gave us all the information about everything. she really has good amount of knowledge about all what they have in their spice heaven and told us even the smallest of the things about the spices. we also got to see their ancestral house which is more than 250 years old. and the best part was to know about the honey bees. the way she explained and showed us the hive and the life of bees, felt to be a bee for sometime and go inside the hive to see all their incredible work. then the home made typical goan food was very tasty which made us to finish almost everything whatever they had prepared for us. they also sell all the spices and other products grown there and trust me, you will not get such organic and best spices anywhere outside. overall our trip to tanshikar spice farm was very informative, productive, interesting and stomach filling. i would suggest to visit the farm any time of the year whenever you are in goa."

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,Yeshwant Alway,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Satisfying Visit,"Tanshikar Spice Farm is a small spice garden with most known spice plants. It is run by well spoken couple who take turns in showing around. We were shown around by Mrs. Tanshikar and it was a deep knowledgeable well guided tour. It takes around 1 to 1.5 hrs to complete the tour and depends on your liking's of plants and interaction with the guide. The farm is well laid and has almost all spices which can grow in this climate and few fruit tree varieties. A good tour.The restaurant area is also well done, basic bit clean and proper. The food was excellent, had home made Goan taste and since small groups visit, it was probably made for you only. The items were sufficient. They have shops selling spices and other home made Goan food items,fresh and authentic, but albeit somewhat costly. The use of pebbles for toilet floor and coconut barks for pipes was environmentally satisfying.The old house where they stay is traditional old Goan Hindu villa, if it interests one. Did not stay so cannot comment on that facility. Also did not visit Jungle safari and perennial waterfall.Overall a nice visit, concluded in say 4 hrs. Travel time depends on which part of Goa you are, as this is in southwest interior Goa. Route is scenic. Also visit budbude  talav, which is in same village en-route."

About prices of spices yes may be 10 to 15% more compare to market because 100% organic and natural.
The reason why organic spices are costly compare to market price we also produce 20% less crop compare to chemically grown so to make balancing organic products are little bit costly.

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,tanshikarspicefarm,,,,"I had already visited a spice farm while travelling in Sri Lanka, however Chinmay was very informative and made the visit to Tanshikar a worthwhile experience. In addition, the food at the restaurant was delicious! Since there isn't much information on the website, a visit to the spice farm including lunch costs Rs 500 and takes around 2 hours. They can also organise visits to Netravali Waterfall for Rs 700 (including lunch), which also take 2 hours. The only downside is that you do need your own transport to reach the farm. Otherwise, I can recommend a visit as a break from the beaches of Goa."

Easily reachable from Palolem Beach, about 45 minutes (an a/c tourist taxi was 3,000 rupees including waiting time - your guest house can arrange) and a beautiful winding road through the tropical hills. A member of the family guides you through their spice garden, followed by a lovely homemade vegetarian lunch. Aim to arrive there around 11.30 h. In busy season  probably best to book. Cost Rps 500 per person, including lunch."

Rented a scooter at Palolem and drove there- the most beautiful RIDE we have EVER experienced!!! You go through the wild life park, jungle, hills and little villages. The spice farm itself is an AMAZING experience! Itms family owned, you van feel the love they put into growing trees, plants and lroduce spices. We have learned more than in schoolüòÇ and the owner even invited you to their house to experience the old and simple way of living. So to sum it up, one can feel when things are bejng done with heart- and this is one of those places. Oh and lunch and smoothies- to die for!"

After travelling through Chaudi, a busy market town, you ride up through mountains and the jungle, which is also a nature reserve. There are stunning views on the way. Although we did not book, We were very welcomed and were offered lemon grass tea and cashew nuts on arrival. We were then taken on a very informative tour of the spice farm and then invited into the family home. Their home is a mud house which is now 250 years old. They delivered a fabulous vegetarian Indian food spread which was delicious. You must visit the farm if in South Goa."

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,ketan p,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Fantastic and educational experience for the whole family,"Goa is great for the beaches but if you want to mix it up a bit, this is where you need to head. This is what you need to know.(1) It is a relative short way from the coast, but the roads are not conducive to fast driving so it took us the best part of 2h to cover 60km from Colva.(2) The drive to the Spice farm is amazing, from city, to mountains, via paddy fields to jungle.(3) MAKE SURE THAT THE DRIVER KNOWS WHERE HE IS GOING. OFTEN THEY TRY AND TAKE YOU TO OTHER SPICE FARMS. THEY GET A COMMISSION FROM THEM. THIS ONE DOES NOT PAY A COMMISSION.(4) You have to book in advance as they need to make catering arrangements.(5) You get a fantastic and educational tour and guide through the plantation. Our guide was the owners wife. She made the walk through the plantation really enjoyable. (worth taking mosquito repellent).(6) The tour ends with luch- veggie. Simply food but clean and tasty. You can buy a varity of shakes, we had the cocoa and fresh mango- unbelievably good. Very cheap as well.(7) There is a shop that sells spices. Good place to buy gifts esp the essence oils.(8) The whole place is charming. We all greatly enjoyed it, even our young son!!(9) Cost for tour and lunch was about ¬£5!! (10) The owner is really nice guy and worth talking to about his philosophy of the place.(11) do not expect to see elephants or any large animals. This is not a circus!!"

The owner of the farm conducted the group tour of the farm in which we learned about the variety of tree and vine based spices that are grown there, the honey they cultivate, and their methods of harvesting, etc.  We were also given a tour of the family farmhouse/home and a good view of their day to day lives.  We were then hosted to a delicious lunch.  We then took an off-road jeep to a hiking location and hiked about an hour to see a gorgeous waterfall (enjoyed our young French companions!).  Then we had a private cooking class with Tanshikar's wife who taught us how to make Roti and Paratha as well as a dahl and chickpea curry...all were delicious!  We bought spices from the farm and walked away with recipies and techniques to try at home!  A super way to spend a day in the region.  Highly recommend this!"

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,SaSuFinland,,,,"We read great things about this spice farm and attempted to call several times to arrange a tour. They never answered their phones so we decided to rent a motor bike and drive there for a tour. Based on the information on TripAdvisor and in our guide book we thought they were open until 5pm. Well that might be true but don‚Äôt go in the late afternoon. We rented a bike and drove for an hour and a half. When we arrived just before 4pm, the owner told us he would not offer a tour as they were done for the day, and to come back another day.  We asked if we might have a short private tour and he said he and his wife had given numerous tours that day already and he would not offer us one. We were highly disappointed and after such a long trip to get there were hoping he would be kind enough to give us even the briefest of tours ( of course we were ready to pay any fee for such a service).   Mind you, they were still open and there were numerous other visitors having lunch and shopping at their spice stand. I understand it‚Äôs a family business, and they can‚Äôt accommodate everyone, and maybe we were too late, but we wish they had been a little nicer when turning us away. Their tone was very dismissive and not at all understanding that we trekked so far to visit them. Needless to say, don‚Äôt go after 4pm... and after our disappointment, we won‚Äôt be doing the drive back out there! "
Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,tanshikarspicefarm,,,,"Firstly you didn‚Äôt book and called us at all.

Secondly our plantation tour is of 1.30 hours and you have arrived after 4.00 pm and you expect us dot tour where as we did 3 tour on that day and we also informed you that we had only two gusts in one of the tour. Their were 20 happy gusts what we had on that day.

You should also have courage to tell true things that we allowed you go in farm free of cost when you requested to have round in farm.

What you told is absolutely right that people where having lunch and some of they were on counter and they all have finished their tour and they were in restaurant.

So plant it before and experience our hospitality and we will never disappoint you.

For your kind information this is not park or picknic place that you can come any time and expects our service this is working and family run spice plantation.

About my tone or voice because I had interaction with you I am having sore throats for last two day so it sound little bit roude that you didn‚Äôt understand so please be kind enough with others when you make such allegations.

We farmers always welcoming and that‚Äôs what we learned from our parents.

But you were in different mood.

You went on water fall befor because it is closing at 5.00 pm and then decide to come on farm thinking that you can do tour of farm. Plane your things properly. 

Anothe allegation you have made that you asked for private tour that‚Äôs right but you didn‚Äôt asked to do short tour, at all you are  telling false things.
Have courage to write true things.

So when you read in guide book or on trip advisor you might also read that tour of plantation also includes lunch and I think you are aware of lunch times. 
But any way thanks a lot for suggestions that we have to do tour all day up to late evening too.
But we are not gridi people and we expect extra money. 
We are very much happy in what we have.

Tanshikar_s_Working_Organic_Spice_Farm-Sanguem_South,tanshikarspicefarm,,,,"We all really loved it here. 5 of us stayed overnight in the two treehouses. The spice farm is really in the middle of the jungle. It‚Äôs a 3 hour drive from Candolim, but we looked on the journey as part of the adventure, and we saw the countryside, people working in Paddy fields and other crops. Our driver was half farmer half taxi driver so we were lucky to hear all about farming in India on the way. The taxi fare for both ways was ¬£50 in total. I think that‚Äôs about average, probably you could get it cheaper but it was a nice car ( with seatbelts, not so common in India) and we felt safe with our driver who spoke excellent English. On arrival at the spice farm we were greeted with some Lemongrass tea and home grown cashews and then shown to our treehouses. It‚Äôs pretty basic but fine ( and has a flushing toilet and shower and electricity). We then had lunch. All the meals were pretty similar, all home made with plenty to choose from, and as much as you can eat. nearly all vegetarian. Vegetable curries, Daals, rice, chapattis, salad, pakoras, melon, rice pudding. We had 4 meals altogether. We had a tour of the spice farm, and Chinmay explained all about how his family have developed the farm over generations and how each generation prepares and plants for the generations to come. He knows a great deal about spices and how they are used medicinally. His wife Gauri is the culinary expert. We tasted lots of spices on the way, don‚Äôt try the chilli!! Chinmay took us into his house where he lives with his wife and two daughters so we could see a traditional Indian house which was amazing. On day 2 we had a cookery lesson, and Gauri showed us how she prepares the food for the guests and for her family. We all had a go at making a chapatti and a roti and I‚Äôve got a much better understanding of how Indian food is made. After our cookery lesson we went on a trip on a Jeep to a waterfall. By chance they were filming a movie at the waterfall so that was a bit of extra fun meeting the film crew. The water is cold but quite shallow and lovely for swimming. It‚Äôs really beautiful, hence the movie set. It‚Äôs quite a steep walk up and down to the waterfall, though not very far. Some people we met had a three year old who managed it no bother, but it‚Äôs not suitable for anyone who‚Äôs unsteady on their feet or nervous of heights. The spice farm trip was an amazing look at the Indian countryside. If you‚Äôre into luxury or health and safety in a big way, this is not for you. There are steep drops and beasties and you are really in the jungle. Don‚Äôt forget your mosquito spray or you‚Äôll get bitten. I only have one criticism. It‚Äôs pretty chilly at night (January) which we weren‚Äôt at all expecting, and our two blankets were too small and thin to keep us warm. Our friend said he thought he‚Äôd woken up in Inverness!! We didn‚Äôt have any warm clothes with us (it‚Äôs really hot in Candolim at night time) so we had a cold night, which could have been easily avoided with the provision of a few more ( and bigger) blankets. The whole spice farm experience for two of us including a lovely welcome, an overnight stop, four (excellent) meals, numerous pots of tea, cokes, and lemonade, the spice farm tour, the cookery lesson and the trip to the waterfall was ¬£35. We thought we had heard wrong. So thank you Chinmay and Gauri for giving us such an amazing time. "

The whole atmosphere in this place was so calm and relaxing. Totally stress free. Very friedly and polite owner welcomed us and we made a tour in the farm. His had a lot of knowledge and stories he shared with us and we learned a lot. It was interactive because there were so few of us. We all could smell and taste the spices he picked from the plants.After the tour we visited the old mud house, also very interesting. And then we had amazing lunch buffet and luckily we vere allowed to as much as we wanted because the food was so good! We also bought some spices from their spice shop and the prices vere very good, not expencive.Even tough it takes a bit travelling to get there it is so much worth it. Highly recommended."

So we returned within 5  minutes stay. There was no data or call connectivity at that place and 25 kms around and this may be dangerous when your family is traveling in 2-3 cars or there is some emergency. I suggest not to waste one full day since it is not worth. And leave the place will before darkness since it is jungle area with no help seemingly visible nearby. Also there are no shops or restaurants in 30 kms around. So better to avoid since this is not what we plan to visit Goa for. Family safety and convenience is foremost. "

,,,,,"We booked to stay here for one night in a tree house. On arrival everything was a little confusing (and a little stressful) as person we first spoke with had very little English and we had no real idea what we were doing. Should you have the same then lunch is served approx 1.30pm. Dinner at approx 7.30pm. Spice farm tour we did at 3pm. Next day we were at breakfast for 9am which was followed by trip to waterfalls. So, following initial confusion everything here was amazing. Mr & Mrs Tanshikar are both wonderful and incredibly hard working people. The amount of effort that went into providing dinner and breakfast was crazy (we would have been happy with toast :- ) The tour of the farm was 100% engaging, entertaining and informative. The following day we went to the waterfalls. Nb: my wife is very scared of heights and was terrified this trip would be on high roads and what not. Turns out it isn't and we felt 100% at all times (even in the boneshaker jeep). The tree house as well was a real treat. Lets not pretend, this will not be your most comfortable night spent in India (it's a tree house) but it will be one of your most memorable. Sat on the balcony as the sun went down, listening to all the different wildlife... this is a memory I will cherish forever. Myself and my wife are both very grateful for the hospitality we received. Value for money is outstanding and this farm should be a must on your itinerary if staying in South Goa."
