The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Ajay,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Nice,I guess one cannot expect the verve and delightful chaos of 8 years back. But the market is worth a visit. Best between Christmas and New Years'.
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,sawan005,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Saturday market ,Extremely over priced products.But the live music and food counters were preety good. Parking and traffic was exhausting.
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Hooray H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Shadow of it's former self,"It's still worth visiting but as CEO says it really has downsized by about two thirds- what a shame.It used to be a fun night out- tourists would come from South Goa to attend.We did hear some extraordinary music from Iraq. The drinks are over-priced.Like a lot of things in Goa- there has been a lot of envy of successful businesses so people who can, take advantage & double the rent or they influence the granting of a licence .Goa is a state run by Mafia- see what they did to Club Cubana & Thallassa- shameful.Instead of competing they control. Nasty people."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,CEO,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Dissapointing,In years gone by this eas a well worth visit...not anymore..drinks are double the cost of any cafe bar food stalls average ..music bands only one. years ago it was 3 times bigger drinks were on par for cost and it was buzzing
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Dawn G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great Saturday night out,"We had a good night out here looking at the stalls, listening to the music and visiting the food stalls."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Joshini T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great flea market on a Saturday Night,"Very good and organised flea market in Arpora. Parking easy available , vibe of the market is great with lots of local eateries and dealers and live music as well, must attend."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Rajesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,What a Place!!!!,An awesome place..firstly ample parking.. anytime you go..lots of colourful variety shops..a truly goan place with lively music.. people enjoying..and shopping offcourse..A must visit 
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,eyupmikethetyke,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Well worth the time to visit on Saturday night but bargain hard!!!!,"We visited Clive‚Äôs Saturday night market whilst staying at our nearby hotel (The Park Regis, Arpora) and it proved to be a good shopping experience. Locals told us that it only gets going after dark (7pm onwards) and if walking you may well need a torch, we certainly did.It‚Äôs very busy and covers around a quarter of a mile square with every sort of stall selling most things anyone might want. There is a large street food section with food from all over the world as well as many local dishes, whilst we didn‚Äôt eat we saw lots of others tucking into take away style dishes.There is a small stage area with music from quite a few different bands throughout the evening and a massive separate scooter/car park area. Top tip is to be very aware of scooters around this area as lots of the riders are tourists who have no ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù road sense, you can easily get run over if you‚Äôre not paying attention.All the stall holders are happy to haggle and if you are persistent there are some real bargains, I would make sure you have lots of different denomination notes so you can pay the exact price you have negotiated.There is another market up in Anjuna on a Wednesday daytime but this one seemed better maybe because of all the magical lights and general bustle, so happy shopping folks!"
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,shobo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Superb!,This a far cry from the crowded Friday night market (which is also fun in its madness).The music is great. Really good bands. The stores are all boutique types. I bought some beautiful outfits. But these are not cheap like Friday night market. But yet really great. Almost every single store was owned by a European designer. No Indians. 
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Eduard D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,best night market in India,totally unexpected experience. very crowded but a lot of crafts. very good deals. very good food .nice jewellery.

Good market to buy from. Good food, good music. There‚Äôs no question of getting bored because there‚Äôs so much to see.Have been going to this market year after year when me and my husband visit Goa. It‚Äôs happening and consistent. I thank each one for making it so alive and vibrant ü§©"
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,kat23uk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A good market to go to ,Worth trying this market out. I got some great bargains but dont go in flip flops. The ground is uneven and there is lots of red soil/sand/dust about 
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Memoirs-Sachin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Worth spending time on a Saturday night !!,"The Saturday Night Market at Arpora is a must visit. There are many shopping options ranging from clothing, accessories, antique or boutique jewelry, handicrafts, etc. The eating options are also good with flavors from all across India  not limited to Goan food. It is close to the gokarting arean  hence we clubbed these 2 places back to back."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,The Great,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Bazar,Its nice bazar to purchase something but its just opened on Saturday and also at night party is there and good things are there
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,bikingmom,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Was better 7 years ago,"We were in Palolem and drove the 3 hours to come to this market because 7 years ago we were here and remembered how amazing it was. To start there are now 2 night markets and our driver brought us to the other one first, we walked around quickly and realized this was not the one we had been to before. Once we arrived at This one we realized we were at the same place except it was considerably smaller. We talked to a few vendors who explained that most of the foreign vendors have left and now do a bimonthly night market on Fridays. We were disappointed because we had remembered all the unique items we could buy. There are still some of these vendors there and we did buy some unique items, just not as much as we wanted. The food area was great and there was a live band that was decent. Plenty of Indian vendors so a good place to pick up last minute souvenirs, out of the 2 markets this one is more manageable and less crowded."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,MelMul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"A spectacle worth visiting, even if you don't intend to make any purchases","This is a very large market selling a lot of the tourist tat you see near or on the beaches, but also a very more unusual items. Expect to spend around 1.5-2 hours here if you want to walk down every lane, more if you want to stop and listen to the (excellent) live music. I visited on my own as a solo female traveller and felt safe. If you can arrange a return taxi do, but there are plenty available outside. My taxi cost 1400 rupees return to the Lemon Tree, my driver waited outside for me. Be careful on the prices. For most items expect to haggle on everything to between 20-50% of the price initially stated. The 'walk away' tactic works well, although I was pursued for a good 5 minutes down one lane by a disappointed trader who kept slashing his prices in the hope of getting a sale.Entry is free. Worth a visit for the spectacle and experience, if nothing else. "
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Yogesh Bisht,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"Food, Music and Shopping","Loved hanging out there with friends , great place for nice live music and variety of food options. . One can pic cool handicraft items as well.."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Louise R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Fantastic Saturday night out,"Visit here each time we go to Goa, great stalls selling everything; clothing, jewellery, blankets etc.  Also street food stalls, biryani and doughnuts are a must and usually a great band to dance to night away!

The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,joanne f,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,crazy but an experience you wouldn't want to miss,"The first time we when to night market couldn't believe you had to cross a road of bikes to get into the market even thou it was on a car park. The car park was full of red dust. There was someone with a whistle ordering people where to park it was weird but crazy to see this and experience but also glad I went to this to experience it.There is begger here as well,but you can get a bargain here but it might be due to lack of people they was all wanted a sale so you could get a bargain here."

The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,jimbo1969crawley,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Not good,"Too big, too busy, nothing special to buy, terrible entertainment and no atmosphere. Much preferred the Hilltop Friday night Market in Vagator. Way more friendly, fun, smaller, completely different vibe and proper live music followed by a Goa trance night"

Plenty of parking. "
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Ravi B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Must Visit,The market is a very good place to shop almost everything from small souvenir s to clothes to big sho items. It also has food stalls and joy rides. Another important thing is about plenty of parking place. Overall a very well managed event. Please visit if your itinerary has a Saturday.

The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,DG82,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worth experiencing,We went to the market by chance and therefore had no expectations and I have to say we enjoyed it. We spent just over an hour there and bought some great souvenirs from our trip in Goa.Be prepared to bargain for everything and I would say the items we did buy we got at a fifth of the initally quoted price.As a previous reviewer mentioned it does become repetitive with the stalls selling the same sort of stuff however this is part of the experience of getting a whole host of prices for the same thing and getting it at the best rate. Some small rides for kids which we paid 100 rupees per ride per child.Items you can expect there are:ClothesJewelleryStatuesSilk coversFood spices and herbsToysSouvenirsShoesBagsEtc
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,stephthesignman,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Poor quality ,Poor quality market most stalls selling the same old tac you need to barter here and firmly as you will probably find the same item a stall or two down and half the price it‚Äôs just to much of the same thing if you want clothing a bed spread cushion covers costume jewelry or spices then this is the market for you however there is a much better craft market just a little further up the road so my advice is to head there
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Roger BHX,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Hot and humid,Visited and was not disappointed. Lots of local goods for sale. All the traditional fare.There was also a food section selling hot international foods.Worth a visit.
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Runali,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Very boring market!,There is nothing different here that you can't find anywhere else in goa. I don't know why some people took 2 hours to roam in this market. We finished it in about 40 mins. The food didn't look hygienic enough to try. If you decide to skip this place.. You won't miss anything
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,245hardiks,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Bakwass,"Not worth at all, very cheap quality stuff nothing good, they are only interested in fooling don't go for indians"

The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,ATHIRESORTS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,A must for any visitor!,"My favourite place by night, the Saturday Night Market - NOT the Saturday Night Bazaar (not so good) is a colourful market full of pretty much anything you can imagine - clothes, bags, shoes, artifacts, handmade creations, food, ornaments, art and a stage for up and coming artists to display their jazz, reggae, pop songs to the masses"
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Payal M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Bustling buzzing activity,"Gone are the days when the night market was a laid back affair where one could go to while around and have a good time. The night market now is crowded to capacity, where jostling crowds of tourists and fun seekers vie for space along with stall owners and food joints. Parking is a nightmare. I have been there once and Im not going back. The cheap trinkets are available at the Tibetan stores which are like any Delhi street market, the actual good stalls are over priced. The food is non descript and slightly suspect. For a first timer it may be one to cross off the list. I dont think anyone would want to go back."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,travelkat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,fun shopping,Came here once during our stay.It is a very well organised market and was busy.  Thoroughly enjoyed the market. Great choice of food stalls. Fire eaters and good music while we sat and enjoyed a drink or two.

There was variety of different goan clothes and also western clothes and also cosmetic products so I liked this market. With shopping there are also food stalls where so many different types you can taste which are so nice.
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,DpkArvind,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Good for an experience,"The market comes to life only on Saturdays and stays open from 7 pm till about 2 am. We took a taxi from Candolim to Arpora night market. Costed us 1400 for a late night return trip with an hour long waiting.   The flea market is huge with certainly around 200+ shops selling stuff. There are plenty of food stalls in case you decide to have dinner there. Wood fired pizzas are a favourite here. I personally was a bit dissapointed with the shops as they lacked variety. The shops are selling either Tshirts and dresses (typical Goa style), artificial metal jewellery, rajasthani stone works. These 3-4 types are repeated across these 200 shops and its gets repetitive very soon as you start walking around. For example its the same T shirt at every second shop. We didn't spend much time there and decided to return back. But those deciding to stay back and shop must bargain to best possible limits. "

When we arrived home they had shattered in the mail.  They were not wood at all, but a cheap plastic wax mold. There were rocks implanted into the base to add weight and make them more realistic.  Dont waste your money and be fooled by the dishonest scams at this market"

The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,EkMusafir,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Sharpen Your Bargaining Skills.,"This is an open-air market held every Saturday night at Arpora. There is a live band playing but you have to wait till after nightfall for it to get swinging. There are a lot of stalls where you can buy knick-knacks, art items, electronic stuff, curios, artifacts, cigarettes, masalas, spices, perfumes, footwear, imitation jewelry, bags, and clothing.Prices of most of the items are atrocious. Be sure to bargain. You may be lucky to get some merchandise at one-fourth of the original price quoted. If not, then pretend to walk away. You can always come back if you have set your heart on buying the item.At the end of it all, you will be hungry. Head to the food stalls where there is a variety of fast food available. Sit down with your plate of Tibetan momos or wada pao and enjoy the live music."

I know I had the use them, an experience I hope I will not enjoy again. You must barter or you will be taken to the cleaners. Taxi drivers will usually wait for 2 hours on their quoted fee."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Sue B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Great variety,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Saturday Night Market in Arpora. There was a varied selection of goods on sale, some of which was pretty cheap and tacky but there were some lovely items too. The stall holders were all really friendly and there was lots of banter during price negotiations. The spice stalls were amazing with their wonderful smells and beautiful colours. There was a great selection of jewellery at reasonable prices and beautiful fabrics. I wished I had left more room in my luggage. My favourite buy was an ink drawing of a family of elephants on banana leaves - magnificent! The atmosphere was lively with lots of people and, of course, a few cows roaming around checking out the wares and the food stalls. All round, it was an interesting and enjoyable experience."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,hettieuk,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Same old,We went with highish expectations but overall the market generally sells the same tat as the local shops. We did however have a lovely pork & stuffing batch. After ‚Äòshopping‚Äô eating & having a beer we were ready to leave after 45 minutes.  There is a poor excuse for a fair with deafening rave music blaring out. This is a place ticked off the list but definitely won‚Äôt be revisiting.
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Susan C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Some gems but you need to seek them out,We were staying at the Hilton across the road from the Saturday night market so it was a bit of a no brainer to visit this. We had already visited the Friday market at Mapusa and probably should have just left it at that. The Mapusa market is a locals market and is far superior that the tat generally on offer at this one. That said the food is great and there are some absolute gems which make a visit worth while. 
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Roadiex,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A great vibe,Loved this place.Yes as other reviewers have written you maybe able to buy from shops at similar prices but this market is more than that . It‚Äôs a party vibe with live bands and a bar and lots of food stalls. This place is a vibrant fun place to have a drink and people watch. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it once just for the atmosphere.

The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Nigel B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Got a bargain,It is always amazing to see the amount of stuff each stallholder has and to wonder how long it takes to set up and take down everything. I managed to get a bargain very early on with the help of my sister-in- law who is more familiar with the process of haggling than I am so it was a good start. There is so much to see and lots of 'alleyways' to explore that after a while it becomes numbing as everyone wants your trade/rupees!  There was live music provided and seating arranged to take it all in. The spectacle of the market is brilliant and it gets busier as the night goes on. The array of lights make it quite special but after about an hour and a half we were ready to leave and do battle with the amazingly busy and noisy street outside. Worth seeing for the spectacle itself. 
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,jason j,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Bit of a let down, terrible tourist trap and the organisers beat the animals with sticks! ","We were looking forward to the night Market to be honest as we thought it would be a great opportunity to buy proper local goods and produce. It turned out the opposite as all we found was the same tat that had been on sale all over our tour of India. The same souvenirs, same ornaments, same clothes and same fake jewellery. Tourist trap written all over it. Scams all over the place and luckily we were wise to them already. The place is massive however it's just the same 6 stalls replicated around the place. There's not much choice to be honest. Food was quite good and the people watching is brilliant as was the cheesy euro techno music. The night turned sour however when we witnessed the organisers going around the market literally beating the dogs and cows with sticks until they left the area cowering in corners. It was horrible to see and we confronted one guy who all of a sudden couldn't speak English. We then saw him running around a disused area chasing and beating cows. India has a serious problem with stray animals and animal cruelty and not to mention the horrendous litter situation. They have no care for theirs or anyone elses environment. It's a shame as it left a sour taste on an otherwise great holiday. "
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,A.Bhana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,great atmosphere,"Visited the same stalls outside of the market at their base stores, and the prices were much more cheaper than what they sell their stuff for at the tourist market.  However, still worth the stop and atmosphere and always good to support the markets, no matter their price!"
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,isel2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Great Goan experience,"There are different night markets in Arpora, this review is for the smaller one. Great ambience to experience the Goan atmosphere, good food, drink and entertainment. The Italian pizza and coffee and cake stall was very good and genuine. Drinks fairly priced, makes for a great fun night out. Note to the organisers......please change the group who comes after ‚ÄòGilbert‚Äô as they were terrible and in Goa you are spoilt for choice for live bandsüòÄ"

Open Food Court with liquor too and live band was performing.
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Judy P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,"A big, bustling market, but only clothese, trinkets, souvenirs, no produce","Quite a fun market, food stalls to eat at, live music, but basically dozens of stalls with the same products - tourist clothing, hats, trinkets, spices, souvenirs etc.  No produce for sale, no great interest or novel things for sale.  Marred also by the many beggars surrounding it as you enter or exit."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Gajarajan1947,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,An Interesting night shopping experience,"Every time I go to Goa people used to talk about this Saturday night market, so i had decided to go there during this visit and hence I chose to stay at Calangute( Arpora) so that I can walk back in the night to my Hotel. This is a very big market area created in a big ground with excellent lightings and enclosures for various stalls which sell A to Z. There are several make shift  food stalls and chat stalls all around. There is also a separate stage for music lovers. At the corner there is also a open place for you dance for disco music, after taking the liquor being sold by Titos shop.I could see many foreigners in groups and families visiting this place. Locals also come here in addition to the tourists. one important caution is that you have to bargain to buy anything and also to take care of your wallet all the time. There are many shops being repeated with the same items such as bags, antiques, ladies jewelleries,masks, hats,a collection of spices, colourful hammocks of sizes, shoes and ladies footwares, etc., etc..The shops are opened until upto 1-00 am and transport is available  till then."

We visited during peak night time which is what it is supposed to be best .They do have huge and ample parking as well
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Maipenbc,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Changing night markets in Goa,This night market has a vibrant atmosphere...lively music.  Food stalls could offer more variety and  although many vendors...mainly trinket  items!
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,smile_sneh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Drench in the Goan feel,"The Saturday Night Market is an experience that is enigmatic and engaging. If you are an hoarder for exotic things, this place is a must visit. Good food, amazing live music and the truly Goan vibes make the trip here an impressive visit."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,Udaibir,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nothing great anymore,"A few years ago I would have said that this is one place that is as Goa as it gets - great live music, mix of cultures, great stalls selling unique trinkets, handicrafts, and great food. It was a truly Goan experience. Now - bollywood music, okish food (who wants to eat an ok Domino's in Goa), stalls are tourist traps with things you can get at any other place. Give this place a pass. It's a hassle to get in and park and just to see ok things.If you are around, head to Anjuna for some great digs instead."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,urbuddyno1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Gr8 place to embibe Goan vibe,"Be it shopping, live music, local marketing...all in one at Arapora night market. Reminded me of the ingot night market. Must go if in Goa on Saturday night."
The_Saturday_Night_Market-Arpora_North,dameauxchats,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,An experience you need to have,We visited the market around 8pm on Saturday and were impressed at the security checkpoint before you entered- bags were being searched. The sellers can be particularly aggresive at times but just walk away and they'll halve or take a third off the price they were asking for! There's a lot to look at and also eat. Toilets are for the braver individual as they are open air with no privacy!
