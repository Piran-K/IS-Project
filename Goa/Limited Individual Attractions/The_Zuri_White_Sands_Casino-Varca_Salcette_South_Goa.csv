But The Casino in South Goa At Zuri White Sands Clearly Cheats People,  The Bouncers Are very Rude and Arrogant to their casino  customers even after you loosing your own money they come to attack you.... I would not recommend anyone to visit here again.!  I would really like to warn people before visiting this casino "

It ended before it started. Poor food service. Had to wait for 30 mins for some snacks. The staff keeps on looking as if we are running away taking their money. No parking available

The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,Amit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Good resort but few problems.,"Resort is good. They have good swimming pool, beach outside of resort is good. There are few shacks in the beach too. Food is not super duper great though i would say its above average/good. Rooms are clean and good in size. There are only 2 problem with hotel - 1) casino is a biggest let down. Seems like casino is not maintained by the hotel mgmt, it was full of local people, bouncer attitude was too high. If you coming with family then completely avoid it. 2) Taxi service. Hotel is located in a secluded area and there are taxi mafia there. So you MUST have your arrangement for vehicle. Taxi gang would not allow the private taxies to come in and they charge exorbitant amount of money like Rs 800 for 6 KM distance. So either you rent the self driven vehicle like scooter/car or come by your own vhicle."

The staff and the food were absolutely great. The standards in the room are in my meaning not like a 5 star room should be, especially not the bathrooms. There are dirth in the corners here and there but it is India. For me its too cold in side the bar and restaurants because of the aircondition. The staff and management are very nice and friendly and and wanna say a speciall thanks to my friends Ubhay Singh,  Pun Magar Chet Ram and Alroy. And of course all the guys and girls at the Zuri. Last but not least, my dear friend - Beach Guard! "

The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,Bangalore traveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Exceptional ! ,"Hello all,       I travel a lot and I visit the resort or hotel not by the number of stars they carry but the how the experience is. Zuri white Sands is a 5 star Resort or property in Goa.Yes I did read the reviews first and found out it's good place. So I decided to visit. I was not expecting a great service but thought it is a nice place. I usually don't keep too much expectations. Don't like to get disappointed.Now, day one I reach this place in a Taxi paying 1800 from a different property ( Regalia ).First thing I see is someone from reception waves at me and with a smiling face. We get a welcome drink and my room is set and one bell boy is already with my luggage showing us the room.Brilliant room, exceptionally clean and brilliant view. Usually I don't see such things in 5 star properties.They claim 5 star but do not live up to it. Rooms are spacious and extremely clean.Even if I rub my finger tip on the surface of the table I did not get a bit of dust settled on it. That means they take it very serious when it comes to cleanliness.I personally will give 10 points for reception and rooms . Property is also very well maintained. Every few hours I see people cleaning different areas of the lawn and pathways etc.  I visited the dining area had food and was observing the staff . My god they are so well mannered and extremely calm and polite. But always on their toes. Just awesome. Indians or foreigners will appreciate the staff and the way they get treated. It is a must visit place in my list for December.I did see some guests who don't belong to such a beautiful  place but still come because they have the money and then create a weird noisy atmosphere and make it a horrible place. So if in case any one who so reading this review comes across such an episode Pls Move Away and don't blame Zuri for it !!!! Finally I arrived at this place with in Zuri called Tangerine. The ambiance is 10 points.  It's a place to quench your thirst.There is a decent bar counter which can at least hold 8 bar tenders and let them do their stuff perfectly.I meet this gentleman Mr.Vishwesh asked him what is available and all those basic questions. This person is very polite and knows how to talk to his customers.Very well mannered and knows his job well. He can make lovely Hookahs and awesome cocktails.Was very impressed by his attitude and his drinks. So people if you want to go here ask for Vishwesh.He is the 6th Star in that 5 star property. For Zuri he is an asset. Coming back to Zuri as Property guys this is the best one can visit for a long stay.Hotel is wow. Food is wow üëåI am surely a repeat customer for Zuri.Best part is very clean. Even the Valet parking staff are polite. Security guards are friendly they smile at you. I usually don't see this behavior every where.Zuri has a wonderful staff ( which matters a lot) Zuri Chef knows what to cook and how to make it tasty. It's Wow. Thanks Team Zuri.Cheers and special thanks to Mr. Vishwesh for making our stay so much memorable and fun.Love your team. Yours Loyal Guest."
The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,all4uArnab,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Beautiful experience,"We were planning to visit Goa for a vacation. I am glad we selected the zuri white sands for staying. I stayed here for 6nights. The location ,the facilities , the hospitality and the room ambience was more than perfect. Really enjoyed the stay along with the food and swimming in the pool. Whether it's a walk to the beach or just relaxing in the pool. This was indeed a very serene experience. During breakfast,lunch and dinner , we really enjoyed the hospitality of Stuarts like Suman, Dinesh,Pankaj who was always ready to serve extra whenever needed. The staff of this hotel are it's real assets. One place that they can improve is the variety of food in buffet lunch and dinner.  The gym too is quite compact and has all necessary equipments for a decent workout. Overall , this was quite a beautiful experience. Would look forward to visit again especially with my loved ones.... In short - Fantastico!!!!"

The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,Sunil talwar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples, Nice but not the best,If u really want to unwind on the beach or pool then this is the place but the team lacks hospitality or may be we expected too much out of our stayThe rooms are nice but the people at check out staff is really not helpful in wayWe stayed hoping to spend some free time at the casino due to uncertain whether but the casino is really very dingy and all third class rated roulette machines and all the time you have to rub shoulders with other unwanted guests from outside who come here to play since the entry is freeThey should upgrade and restrict entry to only in house guests due to space constraintOverall i shall never visit this property again

Apparently, Zuri is quite well-known (got to know later) as wedding destination. From entry till the extent of arrangement made to make everyone feel at ease was really praiseworthy.Liked the white sand beach in front - icing on the cake!"

The food was major disappointment (waterfalls restaurant) and the Casino we just could not think of entering itself with the cheap kind of crowd that was visible inside and also queuing outside for entry. We had heard quite a hype about this place but for us this was sheer waste of time kind of place.

The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,Boomeranger,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great hotel and Location - Do not be put off by negative reviews,"We stayed for 2 weeks in a regular room, 1st floor over looking the pool. Excellent daily room service high standards through out.The hotel needs a little refurbishment and is looking tired in places. BUT don't that put you off. Breakfast a wide choice. We never ate in the hotel  for any other meals as we used the local restaurants / beach shacks all very close by and extremely cheap and I mean cheap. The Hotel bar was never busy except for Happy Hour which we ventured into, once only .The drinks are buy 1 get1 free ( selected drinks and not imported spirits). BUT watch out for the Tax and service charge. The drinks were still double the price than the local restaurants / beach shacks. BUT it was nice to be in a more up market surrounding air con etc.The majority of people we met never used the hotels bar / restaurants  mainly due to the prices . Why pay more when you can get it so cheap outside the hotel ( but not necessary the same surroundings as hotel and its high standards and selection) .A note to the hotel - Keep your prices down in the bar / restaurant and guests would use your facilities more.BUT the hotel does cater for conferences and weddings , so they would certainly would have a ""Captive audience"" who would be prepared to pay these higher prices and these guests could not go to alternative restaurants / beach shacks. Please note the hotel is not over busy, but there are  with  events and the weddings( like any hotel), they  are well planned with lavish decorations and parties out side in the immaculate maintain  gardens . My wife loved watching the colourful ceremonies,dresses and the different decorations..Overall we were extremely impressed with the hotel and would return. Please note that there  are a approx 8 restaurants and 8 beach shacks locally. PLEASE note you are in a third world country so restaurants etc are different and appear dirty / scruffy . But the food is excellent and very cheap. Please note the hotel is located in a very quiet area , so if you want hustle and bustle this hotel is not for you. Chill out Relax and enjoy - especially the beachThere is an excuse for a Casino - we are not gamblers but it was very small room full of men looking to make their fortune. Goodluck to them - this did not offend us.TIP - Don't us the Taxi's out side the hotel there is a cartel and are expensive compared to our taxi we found -double the price ( no negotiation ). However walk pass Johnny's pink coloured bar turn right walk 50 metres and there is a taxi owner called Joe Boy ( opposite the Garden court restaurant ) he offers very good prices and is a lovely family man looking to earn a living. We used him twice  one being a 3/4 day tour to the Waterfalls, ( worth a visit just for the view and swim at the falls,a spice gardens with lunch  and a Cathedral excellent day / price.. Any questions just ask and enjoy"

The property is a perfect getaway for families with kids especially, as there are enough activities to keep the kids engaged while you put your feet up & chill out. The sprawling lawns & the fantastic beach are a perfect holiday recipe & does not require for one to travel around to get to places. You have most of what you need on the property in terms of a pool, spa, restaurants, the beach & activities all through. I wish to make a special mention of Leena from the guest relations team that took the effort to get a Birthday cake done for my daughter at very short notice, Thank you Leena!If you are looking for a safe,hassle free holiday with great hospitality & a fantastic resort with absolute value for money, look no further than the Zuri, I would highly recommend The Zuri & we look forward to going back soon..."

The best part of the resort is their pool, one of the largest in Goa! We requested for a poolside view on the bottom floor, our door was within a couple feet of the pool. We didn‚Äôt get a chance to explore all the restaurants, as we were out exploring most of the day but what we did have was excellent. I recommend this resort to anyone traveling to Goa! "

The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,nimi111,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018,"Very small and extremely crowded, only Roulette works","The title of the review sums it all up. The crowd is local and only roulette table is available.Only good thing was that this was on land, very close to the resort I was staying and the entry was free.I probably would not have went there 2nd time if they charged entry fee. Also since I play only roulette, I was happy. But if you play different games in casino, then this one is not for you!"
The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,abbie s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great hotel,"Fabulous hotel. All the staff are very friendly and attentive. Great food for breakfast at the Waterfall Cafe, especially Manjula and Sureka who were always happy to help and find us  a table. Sanjay is a fabulous pool attendant, giving suggestions on which local places to visit and getting our beds ready. At the Blue Lagoon poolbar Arnot makes the best cocktails! The drinks are abit expensive but that is to be expeceted at a hotel of this high standard.The lunchtime and evening menus are varied and the food we tried was always good. Manjula and Sureka are fabulous hostesses at the Waterfall cafehe  is fabulous but you need a taxi to visit the surrounding .areas. Go to the taxi rank outside the hotel where you can negotiate a price before you leave."

The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,Ramandeep M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017,Pleasant visit @ Zuri ,"It all started with a cool welcome drink at the reception. The first view of the Hotel Zuri is kind of ok....the reception area is where I think a lot of work of improvement is to be done.....but the front desk staff - Ms. Leena is really cooperative and very helpful. And then my room 107 which was really small and dirty. I think the rooms & bathroom interior needs to really improve, this really gives a old look. Food is all what the hotel has..... on the name of a 5 star hotel. At this I would like to underline - Mr. Surrender which was really good to and is always Smiling. The hotel has private beech - but sorry it was really the worst thing the hotel has - dirty beech area with sewer water on the area and it was smelling too.The hotel cash on having a Casino but it is always over crowded by the Locals....so I would not appreciate on that.Room tips - Pool view rooms are good.Food - is very appreciating and promisingStaff - Helpful and courteous.Cleanliness - Needs to work on at the rooms - bathrooms - pool areaRest a big Thank you for the staff for making visit a memorable one.Thanks "

Airport pickup goof up, disturbances in the middle of the night, disgustingly filthy pool with algae growing on all walls, lack of concern for the customer, very poor customer service, bad food with no seafood on buffet although it's Goa, they take forever to respond to room service... need I even say more!!! Very disappointing for all the money they charge and claim to be a 5 star!"

The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,Rajat S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Business,Great property with Cold staffs,"Was here for 2 nights for a conference, the property has a great location, on the beach. Rooms are old but still good. The only thing that amused me was the staffs of the property, they never smiled or greeted any guests. They were neither rude nor welcoming. Restaurant staffs were needed to be told repeatedly for any service, didn't know if it was because of pressure of conference or it was their normal practice, but judging the property of this size, I feel they should be able to handle the group of 75 easily.Food was ok.If you overlook the service part then it's a good hotel property wise."

The_Zuri_White_Sands_Casino-Varca_Salcette_South,mejoyce,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Fantastic stay at ZURI WHITE SANDS.,"We stayed at the Zuri with our 18 months old for 3 nights and it was beautiful. We booked the deluxe room which is spacious and very calm with all the toiletries that is required and a fantastic shower with 24hrs running hot water.  Due to the ongoing BRICS meet in Goa we had a lot of foreign delegates staying who usually were out after breakfast and we had the whole resort to our selves. Room service is expensive like a tiramisu will cost you 636/- including taxes and so will brownie with ice cream. A mini bar is provided that is chargeable.You have many good food joints nearby and a small shop with some basic items along with alcohol, soft drinks etc named Michael's.PROS:1) Fantastic property of 37 acres with the largest meandering pool in Goa. They have an additional pool and a baby pool as well , all kept in superb condition. 2) We had such calmness every time as we got the last room on the top to the corner and there was barely any noise. Though the beach is a few minutes walk away we could hear the waves.3) Excellent house keeping staff and the lawns were maintained in utmost condition. Hats off.Cons:1) Room needs a little upgrade. It's started to wear out and look tired. As a 5 star you expect nothing but perfection.2)Food needs to be better . Breakfast at the Waterfall Cafe was average and so was the dinner at the same place. Buffet dinner was charged at 1300 pp plus taxes , we got a 25 % discount. Overall I would definitely recommend this resort if you need to relax and have your own transportation as it's far from other spots in Goa."

The buffet restaurant was superb.  A huge choice of food considering it is en masse.There was a small gym which only I seemed to use!Beauty/Pamper was  not impressive - she seemed like a substitute masseur.Rooms cleaned everyday and we did have an incident with a missing item.  It took until getting home to sort it out but eventually it was returned safely.There was outdoor games but these seem poorly maintained.
