The Church looks beautiful from the outside always, and has managed to stay peaceful and quiet in the Church. Doing a guide helps with some historical facts. Its a 10 mins tour inside, Guide is useful, though not mandatory. The tomb of St Xavier can be seen in the church. It is brought down every 10 years, with the next one being in 2024."

Tomb_of_St_Francis_Xavier-Old,jim m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,worth a long stop,"This is a very unusual place and much bigger than you think.  We did not have enough time.  It is free but there are rules - you can take photos but there are lots of signs saying no selfies - no photos of people.  It is a place of history and religious importance. It has relics and the body of St Francis Xavier but it has much more.  It is being restored and so is different than some of the TripAdvisor photographs. Inside is a strange mix of art and sculpture that range from the very bloody crucifixion, relics, intricate stone work and nativity scenes that look like they are from a garden centre.  Worth going to the toilet - or rather following the signs to them as they lead to a shady courtyard with seating that gives a nice break.  Many sellers on the streets outside trying to sell postcards etc but the second you go through the gate they leave you alone."

Tomb_of_St_Francis_Xavier-Old,Darryl Gonsalves,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,The iconic church of Goa,"One of the oldest church of Goa the Basilica of Bom Jesus is where tourists flock to every time they visit Goa. This huge church is well maintained even after hordes of tourist step in to have a look at the church. I, however, am miffed at some people's sheer lack of civic sense in abiding the rules maintained by the church to preserve the church's heritage. One should take enough time to browse through the main hall as you enter and slowly make your way to the elaborate gilded altar where on the right is the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier enclosed in an ornate silver casket guarded by cherubs. If you look closely you can see the mortal remains through the windows in the sarcophagus. Enter inside to a gallery that features the day to day items worn by the revered saint and some painting depicting his life. Exit to the inside courtyard where you can buy some souvenirs of your visit or check out the video show. The backdoor exit leads to the grotto depicting the apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes to Bernadette with a water cascade offering a soothing soundtrack. The toilets can be accessed further back but are in a sorry state due to lack of civic sense in most tourist using the facility to clean up after they have used the facility."

Tomb_of_St_Francis_Xavier-Old,Rempt2,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Beautiful church and setting,This is one of the places I definitely wanted to visit.  The church was lovely and seeing the tomb of St. Francis Xavier was an experience.  He is so famous in the US.  Many children of Catholic Parentage are named after him.  The tomb of the saint isn't easily viewed as it is just above eye view.  The grounds cover a large area and I enjoyed the setting especially of our Lady of Lourdes.  The side of the building is perfect for having a picnic lunch.  One the upper floors is a very nice museum containing wood statues previously used in the church.  There is also murals of St. Francis Xavier's life and some sketches of the interior of the church.  It is only 10 rupees which is a good price.  I offered a donation but the woman at the desk refused.  The church overs so much history of the area.  Across the street is an archeological museum which I didn't get a chance to see.

Tomb_of_St_Francis_Xavier-Old,JUGAAD H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Oooh Good,"Tomb of St Francis Xavier in the Church of Bom Jesus, Goa, from the Lee-Warner Collection: 'Bombay Presidency' taken by an unknown photographer in the 1880s. Born in Navarre, Spain, St. Francis Xavier (1506-52), was a former pupil of St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order; he was ordained in 1537 and came to Goa in 1542. During his time in Goa, St. Francis was credited with nursing the sick, founding numerous churches, converting thirty thousand people as well as performing miracles. Later he went to Sri Lanka, Malaysia, China and Japan to carry on his missionary work. St. Francis died in 1552 at Sancian Island off the coast of China at the age of 46; his body was later moved back to Goa. The tomb, the gift of the Grand Duke Cosmos III of Tuscany was carved by the sculptor Giovanni Batista Foggini; it took ten years to complete and was erected in 1698. Constructed of jasper and marble, the tomb was set out in three tiers: base, mausoleum and casket. The bronze plaques in the middle depict scenes from the life of St. Francis, and in front of the casket is a fine silver statue of the saint. The interior of the chapel is richly ornamented with carved detail and paintings illustrating scenes from the saint’s life. Once in a decade, the saint’s remains are displayed to the public on the anniversary of his death, 3rd December"
