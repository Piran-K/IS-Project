Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Sahil M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,"Don’t touch the cats, but enjoy the peaceful time learning about spices","If you are interested in learning about spices, to try a Goan buffet that is good and to enjoy some time off in a quiet place, this is the place to go. Even during the day time, the shade of trees meant it’s not too hot. Just be careful not to pet the cats, they are stray and may bite (and you would need rabies shots). But that goes for all places in India and around the world"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Jk N,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Waste of Time and Money,"Waste of Money & time. Go any where in Goa or either take rest in hotel room but never make mistake of visiting these place. Entry fee Rs.500 per person against which you will get unhygienic, unhealthy food been served at place where there is no cleanliness, dogs are sitting on table . No welcome drink or no proper cooperation once you pay. Its all commission business that taxi people get paid for bringing tourists at such terrible place. Welcome drink serve after half hour coz they wait for more tourists together so they prepare drink for all at a time. Food quality is also horrible, smelly bread . Sitting arrangements is also worst . All tables are broken . In short Goa tourism official should take notice of such place and should be shut down forever or make it proper"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Niten,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Nice plantation but very far,Big Spice plantation. Goan lunch included in tour price of Rs 400 per person .Nice preparation of food  and plates made of leaves. Tour was of short duration and every spice shown was offered for sale..Can avoid  if trip is packed .Place is bit far from Goa .So taxi and food  will cost lot .Totally commercialized and catering to various batches of tourists in row .
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Raiden,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 • Couples,Interesting off beat experience,"Location: Ponda Property: slightly low on the signages. So there is a probabitlity to get confused. Spread out over 80acres. Though tour is only around 1acre or so.Wide range of spices. Though would have loved to see Cashew trees or Feni distillary. Alas, it was off season.Tour Guide: Sushmita. She knows her spices well enoughThey also provide lunch. Simple goan food. Loved the sustainable aspect related to the utensils and cutlery.Overall, to be checked out for those looking at exploring Goa beyond beaches.PS: you can try out 1 shot of Feni."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Mitali,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Couples,Don't waste time and money,This is just waste of time and money. They have almost nothing to show. Even I have better collection of spices plants at my garden. The food is just edible. They sell different fake and duplicate product in the name of  herbal products. I bought different oils which are quite expensive yet duplicate. Total experience is too bad.
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Traveler from Finland,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Couples,Waste of time and waste of money,"Before coming there read the truth. Nothing to see. All the business is based on pushing you to take drinks, food and guide who will repeat you what you can read on the internet. We were in this place 10 and 15 years ago. This was a real spice plantation, which started to die slowly. At that time there was a tag with information about each plant. Now if you want to drive 2 hours (with a return way) and pay 400 INR only for drinks and food welcome. Strongly not recommended"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,sami_priya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Family,Worth every penny.,"It's always refreshing to walk in woods. I found it very professionally managed. The staff greet you with a welcome drink which is green tea with lemon grass, Ginger and lemon. It is refreshing. Then they take you for a tour which lasts for approximately 30 mins where you get to see cardamom , pepper, cinnamon, vanilla, betel nut trees etc. After the walk they serve you Goa's popular feni. And last but not the least you get the lunch (price included in the entry fees). The lunch is like Ghar ka khana,not fancy but filling. You can buy some pure spices from there too. Beware of the monkeys and it's better to walk in shoes. Good place overall."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Ruchira Khandelwal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Informative Place to know about Spice Plantation.,"There is an entry ticket which also includes welcome spice green tea and veg/non-veg lunch. Upon entry you will be welcomed with flowers. There is a wooden bridge made on a small lake to enter into the spice plantation. There are lady guides who accompany the groups of tourists in showing the plantation and explaining the details about the different types of spices and their benefits.There are variety of spices plants/trees here which we won't see usually mexican mirchi,  pepper tree, lavender tree. The tour is covered in 2 acres place though actual plantation spreads in 50 acres approximately. After the tour, visitors are provided with lunch which has both veg and non veg options. We can also buy spices and oils from here. This place also offers the Elephant Ride for which they charge Rs. 700 per person which is too expensive. Overall good place to visit."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,123omi,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Biased management,"We had included this site in our itenerery during our Goa trip this year. And to confirm it, we had also called to ask whether we need to book our visit. The manager or whoever was on the phone said that no booking is required you can visit anytime between 10 am to 3 pm. So we reached the place by 11:30 am. And to our surprise, the Watchmen at the gate didn't allow us to enter saying that the booking is full, all German tourists are arriving. He was way too rude to us even after telling him about how we had called for booking our visit and how we (my wife and 3 year old daughter) were planning to have lunch there as it was included in the package. He simply closed the gate on our face. We tried calling the manager who said that he will accommodate us only after 1 pm which was not fitting in our schedule. This clearly shows how biased and greedy the management is towards foreign tourists. They just want to mint money. Their ethics and values are gone for a toss. After sharing this incident with one of our family friends who had been here in the past, we even got to hear worse things about this place (food and hygene, overrated prices) Please give a second thought before planning your visit here, you can't trust the management."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,sharonn198,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Most Tranquil  & Informative,We had the most informative young lady walking this plantation Parvika. She was funny and knowledgeable. What a well maintained and neat plantation.Was so intrigued by how simple spices could help with not only health issues but add so much flavour to foods.The guy swinging from tree to tree was something else.Loved how we get cold water poured down our spine to relax us after the walk and the finny ( extract from cashew) was potent but good.Lunch was  included - it was simple and truly yummy.Definitely worth a  visit.
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Johneo_ca,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Interesting information on spices,Interesting if very commercialized place to find out about spices.It was good value for money as entrance included a nice buffet all you can eat lunch and a guided tour for 400 rupees.
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,jmt12london,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,soulless and robotic,"although it is in a beautiful setting, this is very disappointing. the name is misleading as we never get to see the plantation. instead, we walk briskly along a path where they’ve planted a few spice trees and bushes.the welcome is silly with staff robotically throwing petals at people. the whole place is soulless and is not worth the journey.and, i don’t see the point of advocating environmental practices when they sell their spices overpackaged in plastic. i also resented the advertising at the entrance.on top of that, even water has to be purchased, and of course in plastic bottles.highly disappointing"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Gregg P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Informative,"Informative but extremely forgetful. Worth a a visit for 1 hour and the 400 rupees admittance including lunch is fair. If your a food lover I’d bypass lunch, it was awful"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,CheshireTravellerHJG,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Fascinating insights +  delicious lunch,"We visited the Tropical Spice Planation as part of a private tour also including, Panjim, a river cruise and Vehla Goa.The guided visit to the Plantation was conducted by a knowledgable and personable guide who gave us fascinating insights into the cultivation and production of spices and other tropical crops. The setting is very picturesque and the buffet lunch delicious."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Vijay Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Office offsite,"We visited this place first time. Though, I have been goa for almost 8-9 times but this was my first experience to visit this place Tropical Spice Plantation.. When we reached they offered veg/non veg food which was amazing .. then take an tour of plantation. Everyone in my group loved to have such seeds, plantation and trees ... "
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Charley H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Good experience ,"Costs 400 rupees to enter. On entering you get given a complimentary drink and a tour round the plantation, I expected the tour to be a little longer than it was, however we did learn a lot and the tour guide was very informative. After the tour you get a buffet lunch which is mostly veg meals (which is great), the food was really tasty and they have the best pickle I have ever tried, they also give you a shot of feni (that will definitely put hairs on your chest) They have a little shop also where you can purchase the spices, oils, etc from the plantation. Good experience overall, would recommend if you're in the area. "
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Chanx,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Interesting tour ,"We found the guides here to be very knowledgeable and found this tour very interesting.

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Sri Satya Sai S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Good place to know about Spice Plantation,"This place is around 60 km from Goa and located amidst beautiful ghats. There is an entry ticket of Rs.400 for this plantation tour which also includes welcome spice green tea and veg/non-veg lunch. There is a wooden bridge that's laid on a small lake to enter into the spice plantation. Upon entry we will be welcomed with flowers and given hot green tea with spices which is very tasty (my daughter had 3 cups of it). There are in-house guides who takes group of visitors showing the plantation and explaining in details about different types spice plantation & benefits. There are variety of spics plants/trees here which we won't see usually and they include vanilla plant (2nd costliest spice), beetle nut tree, mexican mirchi (which is smallest mirchi and stands vertically upwards unlike regular mirchi), pepper tree, lavender tree etc. The tour is covered in 2 acres place though actual plantation spreads in 50 acres approximately. After the tour, visitors are provided with lunch which has both veg and non veg options. We can also buy spices and oils from here. Overall good place to visit and know the spice plantations, but the ticket price is costly though lunch is included."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Debbie P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Great Educational Experience!,"Better to get there in the morning as it gets very busy around lunchtime and the afternoon, with parking a challenge!  We walked around the plantation finding out about many spices and how they can hep you with health conditions.  A real educational experience.  Guide was very knowledgeable and gave many interesting facts.  Lunch was in the price and was average for the masses they have to feed.A couple of hours is more than enough for this attraction.  You can buy some of the spices, whilst you are there! Well worth a visit!"

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,priyansh j,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Worth a penny,"We visited and got package of ₹400 which include lunch, tour, entry ticket. And the lunch was so yum they make lunch with there fresh spices. After lunch we went on tour where they will explain the imp of spices and how they grow the spices.  After the tour you can taste fenny which is Goa speciality. You can even buy spices from there and they are worth. "
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Johannawrites,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,"Worth a visit, but a hassle to locate the place.","I enjoyed my visit here, the bridge is a little rickety but the staff are great and knowledgable about the plantation. The little tour around the plantation was informative and the ending where cold water scented with lavender is poured down your back is a lovely to end the half walk. I didn’t try the food but my fellow travellers said it was delicious and definitely well worth it especially since it’s included in the entrance fee. I definitely recommend a visit here however it took us some time to locate the place because there’s really no signboards to guide you. So have patience and your GPS and you should be fine."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Praveen M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Spice plantation ,It was great visit got knew got so many spices india has the use of it. Pls visit this place great food dont miss the visit
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Raghu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Welcome to the world of Spices,"Right from the entry gate to the entire garden it is a very spicy experience. What mesmerizes you the moment you the reach the place is canopy and the natural habitats with cows grazing on the grass and the bridge that leads you to the plantation. The ducks welcome you with their corking sounds and you are handed over a lovely lemon grass tea. As you sip on it you wait for your tour guide to take you around. The guide shows, makes you feel, smell and even eat sometimes the fruits, herbs and spices. The aroma and flavors kind of explode in your mind. While i am sure that Black Pepper is best in Calicut and so is Cardamom best in Munnar. I think Cashew is best in Goa... and obviously Feni. The only thing surprising was they harvest all this and send it to the mill... where it gets machine pressed, refined, which may not be the best way to extract the goodness and we may end up buying junk. Food served is decent and staff is welcoming... washrooms, which are western, need to be kept more clean. total charges 400 and time is 3 hours. "
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Prajot Joshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,A walk to get to know about the stuff you should already know ,We liked the concept and the way guests are greeted and welcome here. The lunch served has got a great taste and the way it is served could also be fascinating for some. I feel this place is based on the premise that how ignorant we have  become with the nature and the basic understanding of it. Having seen some of the stuff that we always see well packed  in a supermarket in its original form could be interesting for many.  Just the fact that we have lost touch with nature and the basic understanding of it that we find this amusing was a bit upsetting got me. Nevertheless the location is beautiful and a must visit for city dwellers.
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Vani S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Nice and well maintained plantation,"It was a very nice n informative guided tour. My 1st spice plantation visit. The guide Veena was very cheerful and patiently explained and answered each query fired at her. Its clean and well maintained.  The greenery insides really is soothing. They provide lunch too which is simplereally relishable. Very much an ecological place. Food was served in earthern pots. The taste was very homely. Worth a visit and lot of information gathered on different spices. There are some elephants too little ahead, but couldnt visit as we had a flight to catch. But we saw an elephant being bathed in a pond inside the plantation. Must go!"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,ClareS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Fantastic,"What a wonderful experience. After walking across a bridge from the car park, a wonderful Aarti welcome greets you, plus juice and nibbles. Then delicious Goan food served traditionally on a dried banana leaf plate, in a covered area within the spice plantation that had so much ambiance. The guided tour of the plantation was so interesting and informative. Opportunities to buy spices after the tour. Would highly recommend."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,KKPal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Average,"It was a small tour and also costly as they charged INR 400/- pp. Limited food option and it took around an hour to travel from North Goa to reached here so you need approximate 4hours to visit this place, in my opinion, it was not worth. So better to go on a beach and enjoy there."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Rashid Isa Rishi AlHeddi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Spice plantation visit,"Arrived at this place after a long drive from Cavellosim and car parking available outside- Paid Entrance fees Rs 400 per adult which was inclusive of a Goan Veg/ Non Veg lunch !! Very pleasant couple of hours wandering through this green ecological, well maintained spice plantation- We got to see various plants, flowers, trees, spices and even preparation of KajuFeni!! The local Goan portent alcohol !!There was samples available for the brave . The guide was well informed and patiently answered all questions raised by our small group. Saw several Birds and missed seeing the Elephants as they only at site during early morning and evenings.Nice shop selling all Spices , Tea , seeds, and Clove oils etc at reasonable prices.The Goan meal was average but as we were all hungry was devoured happily.It was Holi so all the Plantation staff were in different powdered colours and seemed to have enjoyed the Holi festival. Certainly a must visit for all visitors to Goa."

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Aaraa,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Recommend for a day trip in goa,"Going to visit the spice farm in ponda is a good idea if you are anyways in old goa . The entrance fee is reasonable , the tour is a 30-45 min tour where they explain all the various spice plants and trees and take you through the plantations.the lunch is also quite decent , of course the food is local Indian cuisine. Well organized"

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Saikat Chakraborty,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Tropical spice plantation,"The tour is good if you take a guide. The elephant ride is excellent but too overpriced at Rs 700 per person. There should be name board in front of tree as found in eco park Kolkata.But the  oils and extracts they are selling are of top quality, reakl and trully effective for the purpose they are to be used.we got result almost instantly!!"

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,650paul,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Not worth it,"Travelled from Goa it took us an hour and a half to get there. The plantation is a short walk down and over a rickety bridge to a covered area where your tour begins. However they do offer a complimentary transport from the car park down to the bridge for those with mobility problems. The tour takes about 40 minutes, but there is little to see. Food was provided in a buffet style. This was not what we envisaged and wouldn't recommend."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,john a,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,awsome place to learn of spices,we had an excursion to the plantation and also saw several temples and churches and the tour guide was amazing and very informative
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,ggillian912,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Spicy ,"Visited this plantation last Friday. 20 kms from Panjim.... follow your gps... otherwise you will end up driving around for another 10 kms through a hilly forest road... which turned out to be quite picturesque....When you reach the plantation, there is enough parking for cars & buses. You have to walk down, cross a rickety bridge to enter the reception centre.... we were greeted with a traditional Indian welcome and a showering if marigold petals.Tickets for a spice garden tour & lunch is ₹ 400/- each ... very reasonable !!!A half hour walkabout was interesting... then we tucked into a lunch buffet... local, wholesome & satisfying....Nice trip to do, if you haven’t visited a spice farm before ..... they are open from 9am - 4 pm daily."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Wayne G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Interesting insight,We visited the spice plantation and enjoyed the tour where the guide told us about many spices and how they grow and develop.  Learned some new facts and it was interesting.  Took about 40 minutes and then followed by lunch which could have been skipped.  Sugar cane drink is an acquired taste.  The staff were attentive and helpful although not sure about the shop.  be ready for cold water experience which was fun watching people's reactions.  Worth a visit.  Lots of other activities such as zip line and quad biking which we didn't do so can'rt comment on quality or safety of those activities.
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,travelingdmd,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Spices in India,This is a very interesting tour of the plants that make our spices.  It is about 30-45 minutes of walking around an area with plants that produce spices and our guide was very knowledgable.  We skipped the lunch and opted to eat in Panaji.

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Sub3B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Excellent experience and value for $,"I was glad that I decided to visit this plantation. It represented good value for money at just INR 400/head. The location was scenic. The food had a home cooked feel to it. I loved the tour of the spice plantation - our guide (in hindi) did an amazing job. I learnt a bunch from the tour. I'd recommend this over the plethora of church, temple and beach options which regularly comprise a south goa tour."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Avica M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,An Interesting and Informative Tour,A lovely experience - though it is quite busy with the various tour groups - the entire setup of the place and venue is very organised and the onsite crew/team makes it a seamless process. There are no frills - it is a pragmatic setup that serves the purpose of the tour.It is an informative tour where we learnt so much more about spices than we thought we knew.Our hostess and guide at the venue JORITA FERNANDEZ is absolutely exceptional - she has a wealth of knowledge which was shared so well - she kept it interesting and we enjoyed the tour of the plantation. Lunch is served ( though no frills) - tasty freshy prepared food.Good and enlightning experience.
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,OnAir16536029315,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Spice plantation,"Very far away not worth going. Very short trip made long by offering lunch. Lunch quality not upto mark. Think that you are eating dark chawal in rs 400.spices not visible.all theoretical knowledge. It's better to call it spice shop. Not showing processing, packing etc. Even my 6 year old daughter could understand they made us fool and it was waste of time. Actual visit maximum Half hour."

Includes a welcome drink,small group assigned to one guide who is well trained and knowledgeable about spices produced in this plantation.The lunch was an extra included in the price of Rs.400.  The food was better that other restaurants in town and included a drink of anise at the end of the meal.The shop in this attraction is interesting and prices are good.Although it is located away from Calangute, it was worth the visit."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Preeti C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,"A  good learning experience ,but should include more spices in the tour","For us Indians, spices are nothing new but to see them in their natural state is new.So this is a good learning trip.It is open from 9-4 , we were charged Rs 400 per head , which included tour of the spice garden and lunch buffet.We were served a welcome drink of lemongrass tea,which was nice and then a guide took us in small groups for the spice garden tour .The guide was knowledgeable but the knowledge was not very deep, more of rote.We got to see 10-12 spices if I recall well , I would have been happy if they had charged us Rs 100 more and given us a bigger tour !We were served lunch , which had veg and non veg dishes both , the lunch was low on spices and chilies in keeping with their mostly foreign visitors but it was filling and good.We also got to taste some cashew Feni !I recommend this place definitely.They have spices and some products made from coconuts for sale, which I found on the expensive side so did not buy."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Padmaja G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,An informative tour about spices,"A beautiful plantation to visit. Almost all spice plantation tours follow same routine..offering a warm lemon grass drink and a tour of a small area of the plantation that is purposely developed for spice tour. One of the assigned guides will take us around the designated area and will show us the available spice plants/tress mostly vanilla, turmeric, pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, arecanut etc...which is about 40-45 mins. This is followed by lunch. The drivers who recommend and take tourists to these plantation tours will get either a commission or free lunch. Overall it was time well  spent."

The girl who showed us spice plantation were very knowledgeable and was really interesting to explain us about spices. Definitely great visit.It was long drive (over an hour) from Baga beach so if you are not into spices you probably won't enjoy a lot.Lunch was good but nothing to special.

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,sandesh d,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,"Must See place ""Goan Spice Farm""","I would say this is one of the best place in Goa where you can get rejuvenated. The place is surrounded with lots of greenery and the plus point is it pollution free. In cities we  have busy and polluted environment with smoke, dust and noise. This place will make you completely relaxed from the noise and smoke from the cities.When you visit this place the host well comes you flowers and a welcome drink tea. The tea which they serve is organic and herbal which just relaxes you from the long tiring journeys.The Spice farm is a group tour. the group can be from 4 people to 10 people. and each group gets a professional and experience tour guide who explains the entire spice farm where you can see real and feel the spices which are grown naturally and organically.The other Specially of the Spice farm is that once the tour is over they serve you buffet  lunch which contain both Veg and Non Veg dishes. Most of the dishes are goan delicacies and it equivalent  to Continental taste.And the best part is the total tour comes to you with Spice farm tour and Buffet Lunch for Just Rs.400 ($6) per person which is very cheap.I suggest whoever visit Goa for the First time should add this place in their travel plan.Keep up the good work ""Tropical Spice Plantation team"". Cheers."

Best time to visit: Rainy season. Monsoon gives this place an extra pop with lush green trees and superb landscape. They offer you full veg, non-veg Goan cuisines with finger licking taste. Our guide Pooja was very knowledgeable and gave us some detailed information about the herbs and why they are that expensive. They even had a small shop, wherein you can buy natural oils, spices, herbs, etc. Overall it's a must vist place, if you are in Goa, not just for Night Life!!Do see the attached images for more details and hit Like if you found this review helpful."

We had a warm 'wet' welcome by our 'spice plantation' guide.  We enjoyed a lovely lunch while we waited for the shower to pass.  The guide was very light hearted and informative giving lots of information in the plantation.  There is also an opportunity to do some shopping of the products at good prices.  Well worth the effort,, Shouldn't be missed"

The entire spice tour lasted about 15mins, excluding the waiting. Didn’t show a whole lot of spices, neither explained much. Started off with a welcome drink, then the tour, and then lunch. Lunch was pretty good."

I was surprised by the nature's blessing on this place, caretakers and guides of this place are really good. You will see almost all spices in their natural forms and in the end nice simple food finishes the trip at a very high note. I recommend this place a must if you are nature and peace lover."

Not only was the tour cheap (400 INR/6 USD) we learned a ton! The guide was very knowledgeable and her English was excellent. The meal afterwards was one of the best I had during my stay in Goa. Highly recommend this place!"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Lakshmi N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,A good insight on spice plantation,"Its almost an hours drive from the shores of Goa. Once you get closer to the location, the drive resembles a hilly ride! The place has a decent parking space. Once you get in, you are welcomed by the crew members with a nice welcome drink (lemon grass tea) which you don't generally get in restaurants. They group people based on your language preference (I guess they have english and hindi guides). So you might have to wait for a few minutes before they take you through the tour. The guide is really knowledgeable on the spices and the plantation. Its almost an hours walking tour as they take you through different spice trees / plants and explain how its grown / and harvested. Sometimes, you need to be lucky enough to see the real spices as certain things are seasonal. Once you are done with the tour, you get to taste a decent enough buffet lunch. If you are staying in shore side of Goa, you need half a day to cover it. So plan accordingly to spend the rest of the day so that the distance you travel is worth the trip.Its a must visit for city grown people who might not have seen plantations!!!"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Joao A,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,To hot and not so much to see,It is an mandatory tourist visit they say but the true is that there is not much to see. And it is so hot that takes the mood for the visit. You can have lunch their for only 400 rupees but don’t waist your time and look for a nice restaurant although near their are none. Good for backpackers with no money to spend.

Our tour guide spoke great English and gave us details about the various spice plants on the farm. This included, cinnamon, basil, lemon grass, betel nuts (with a high flying demonstration on how to harvest), cashews and pepper plants to name a few. Lunch was a buffet of Indian foods.  Very good and a must see in the area. "

It’s beautiful, with a fun walk over the wooden bridge to get to the dining area where we had excellent food and a free drink.  Lots of pineapple plants, coconut palms, pepper plants, cardamom, cinnamon and more."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Dhiraj H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,A pleasant experience ,This plantation can be done after your visit to Mangeshi temple. However the signages are not adequate and neither is google map very accurate. The drive is through pleasant hilly terrain. There is adequate parking space in the premises. You have to purchase a ticket for a reasonable Rs 400. You first walk across a rather creaky walkway over a pond. On the other end girls welcome you by showering flowers on you and putting a traditional tilak ( a small paint mark)on the forehead. The premises is very cool and the staff very professional. You are first offered a pleasant warm welcome drink.Every fifteen minutes or so you are taken around on a guided tour of part of the plantation which showcases the different spices grown on a demonstration plot.The girl guide is knowledgeable and of pleasant personality. You can purchase spices and dry fruits also. After the half hour tour you are fed a hearty meal. The local buffet spread has interesting menu including two non veg items. You can purchase your drinks. The only improvement I would suggest is the washroom which needs more maintenance. Overall a worthwhile experience.

Rs 400 per person is the rate and after a short guided tour (15 minutes) lunch is served.The food is good has an eco-friendly setting and appeal .Go if u have nothing to do in Goa !*** Why is there a separate seating enclosure for foreigners? I am unable 2 understand *****

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Michael H,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Do not give these people your money,"The splice plantation is ok ...but it’s owned by the same people who do the elephant ride and wash a few miles up the road. Please please please do not go on the elephant ride.   The elephant had cuts and bruises and they just shout at him.  People in comments below noticed the same.  I got there with my partner and she went on a 5 minute ride but I declined.  They charged 1400 IRS which was a total rip off. When alone with them after the elephant wash (which is getting in his back in a river and he chucks water over you) they started coming up to us going “give me tip , give me tip for me and the boys”. I gave them an extra 200 just to get him away from me.  My partner after felt terrible for doing it but because the driver took us there she felt pressured to do it.  Who ever reads this please take note and do not go if you like animals. Thanks."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,chris282,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Don't expect too Much from the tour of this plantation,Total experience is a big disappointment: It's quite a distance from the city: To pay 400 INR is not worth it: The tour is nothing but a walk around a small area with nothing much to see of the spice plantationThe guild just rush though as I think they keep on repeating the same thing thousand times. A strong hint to give tips. The meal serve after the short tour is mass produce. Only go to this Spice Plantation if you really are very free and have nothing else to do
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,AninditaDe,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Give this a miss!,"The entry fee is 400 INR which includes lunch, we just wanted to go visit the garden and was not interested in the food. The lunch however was terrible to say the least, the yellow rice was colored (while they claim natural), the prawn dish hardly had any prawns and the food was not tasty either.The garden visit experience was also average. The spices they sell there are overpriced.Overall service quality - extremely poor.Give this a miss and save some time and bucks!"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,PrateekDwivedi28,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Must go place,Its a must go place not only to get intriduced to spices but also to have local authentic goan food.  Food was just awesome and we were kind of lost in food after Spice garden tour.  Tour time : 30-45 mins Food : buffet(no Time limit) This place has small beverages shop offers water cold drink and BEER wgich you can buy and drink while walking in tour or consume wherever you want. Only drawback : little far place from city limit. Kind of 1 hour drive from North Goa 
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,TrueIrishWanderer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,A great way to spend a few hours,"My wife and I visited the Tropical Spice Plantation one lovely Friday afternoon for lunch. When we arrived we walked across a long wooden bridge across a lake and were greeted by two members of staff. They ushered us to our table in the restaurant and gave us both a hot lemongrass drink. It was very refreshing. We then were taken to the buffet area and selected our food from large crock pots. There were several vegetable dishes, a prawn curry, and s chicken curry. There was also steamed rice and vegetable rice, and bread rolls. We then purchased cold drinks from the counter. After we had finished the main course the waited brought a plate of water melon pieces and two small individual tubs of ice cream. We were also served a small cup of Feni  - a local 40% alcoholic clear drink, made from distilling cashew nuts. After our meal, we were treated to a small tour of the exhibition area of the spice plantation and we learned many interesting facts about the various spices. At the end of the tour, the guide takes a ladle of cold water, taken from a crock pot, and puts the water down your back from the collar of your shirt. This is to cool your spine from the heat. I was a bit dubious about having this done, but it refreshed me and, in the heat, my shirt dried very quickly. After the spice tour, you can buy spices from the spice shop if you wish. I thoroughly enjoyed my day at the Tropical Spice Plantation and would recommend a visit to anyone. "
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Jenny C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Nice wind down with great info,"The spices are grown in their own areas throughout the property but they have a one acre plot that has samples of all they grow. Our guide was very knowledgeable( I'm sure they all are) and gave much info on how the spice is processed and what parts are used for what, ie cooking, therapeutic oils etc.Buffet lunch was average, but then you pay less than $10 AUD to enter so you can't expect too much. Gift shop was nice but unfortunately with our quarantine laws, can't bring back spices so I settled for oils."
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Sandy J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,Interesting visit,"We visited the plantation a few days ago. I loved the welcome we received  - a shower of yellow petals and a red marking in our forehead, followed by a refreshing spicy tea. We had an excellent guide who showed us all the plants that they grow. This was followed by a buffet lunch. Really worth a visit"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,PBPG,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Great setting but not enough spice,"The setting is fabulous with a lake surrounded by trees.  The tour round the spices was very disappointing.  I realise you can only be shown what is growing at that time, but it was very limited.  Peppercorns, prir piri and a couple of other trees that apparently would have cloves and cinnamon.  The it was back for lunch, which was a bit grim, very sloppy curry, and then the gift shop to sell you stuff.  You didn't get to see the actual farm at all, apparently it is 760 acres"
Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Sakshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Luxuriously Green & Aromatic!! ,"Visited the Tropical Spice for a second time and found it as enthralling as before! The walk across the lake, on the wooden footbridge, is such a crowd-puller! The excellent photo ops keep people floating back n forth over the bridge creating a constant jam 😋We reached around midday on a Tuesday and the place was teeming with tourists.. Our guide Pooja made the walk around the plantation very interesting with her anecdotes and animated conversation! She was well acquainted with the spices and herbs and answered questions from guests enthusiastically! At the end of the tour, we were ushered to the open dining area for a buffet meal.. The food is traditional Indian.. well-cooked, simple and tasty.. i ended up eating twice as much (its so hard to find non-spicy non-greasy meals!) There is a kiosk for buying fresh spices n a plethora of oils produced at the plantation .. and i loaded up on all things exotic 😎Its a well-organised copiously-green place to spend 2 hours learning about ingredients that set our Indian dishes abuzz, with never an insipid moment! I would highly recommend this place even for those not-so-gastronomically inclined.. just to unwind in the luxuriously green environs of the plantation! "

Tropical_Spice_Plantation-Ponda_North,Ishuheri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,A Beautiful Walk Through the Woods,"Came here as part of a tour of Goa. I really enjoyed this experience. You get to the spice farm by crossing a long bridge across a lake. The bridge is a bit rickety, but it adds to the charm. On the other side you're greeted with a shower of petals and a talika.It's fascinating to see all the plants we cook with every day, but never think about where, or how, they grow: black pepper, cardamom, turmeric, vanilla. It's like something from the pages of The Mistress of Spices.At the end of the tour, you get a refreshing dose of cool lavender water down your back and treated to lunch, served on recycled palm leaves. You can even sample their homemade feni, a lethal moonshine unique to Goa, distilled from cashew nut apples."

However we did enjoy it and despite having some concerns we sampled the different tasting elements and got stuck into the buffet. Really nice to see lots of different nationalities including Indians all experiencing the setting. It was done well and it is not a big oversell of spices. Even the drinks that were not included in the buffet were priced normally.
