Utorda_Beach-Utorda_South,Rahul Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Clean and peaceful beach ,The UTORDA Beach is set in the south of Goa and is one of the cleanest beaches I have ever seen. Being located in South Goa the beach is not at all crowded. These beaches are mostly accessed by the residents of hotels across the beach.The beach is clean and sand does not stick like the one in North Goa. Commercial activities like hawkers selling stuff are almost NIL. one can sit or even sleep peacefully here. We found a lot of sea shells and small crabs in the water.Sunsets are amazing and not to be missed.

Utorda_Beach-Utorda_South,TheWorldNut,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,A very very nice beach,"Utorda beach is nice. Less crowded (in fact not much), very clean, nice sand and shallow. The beach is fantastic for playing in the sea as it quite shallow till quite inwards, no gravel and no filth. Decent options for shacks and water sports. Actually to make the most of this beach, stay somewhere close by.  Sunset is great from here."

Spotlessly clean, serene and peaceful stretch of beach. The sea was calm here as well and good for swimming. No hawkers or excess crowd unlike other popular beaches. "

Those assurances are yours with Quatar and a break in your long journey east and a stretch of legs may not need be a deterrent but a welcome part of your holiday planning"
