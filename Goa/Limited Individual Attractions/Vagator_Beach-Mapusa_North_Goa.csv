Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,TravellerR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,Super clean and serene beach !,"Though not as known as the infamous Baga and Calangute beaches, this is a very clean and less crowded beach you can visit while heading towards Chapora fort! Plan to spend sometime walking on this beach or spend an evening here! You can enjoy water sports also here!"
Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,PuttarajAG,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Vagator beach is good but do not use any water sports while at the beach.,"Its a beautiful beach, less crowded. While being there do not chose any water activities, the guys are big cheats and their service standards are very poor. They only fleece money."
Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,Vandana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,An unforgettable partially eclipsed sunset...,This is a rocky beach. There is a sunset point from which one can watch a beautiful sunset.  There are stairs hidden behind the small shops by which you can come down to the beach. The waves are very calm and so makes a good spot for bathing especially for kids.  People using four wheelers please cross check with the locals for the parking spot as the maps are a little misleading.

Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,Sandy_JSR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Beautiful Settings & Less Crowded,"Vegator is one of the beach of many beached in Goa. During our visit to Goa in Feb’20, we visited Vagator Beach as part of North Goa tour. It is located near Chopra Fort. Vagator Beach is split into two main beaches by a seaside cliff. There was enough space for car park, situated at the top, we reached to the beach through steps. The place had many small stalls selling junk jewelries, clothes, soft drinks and snacks, we made some bargain purchases of junk jewelry and souvenir items. The beach was less crowded, spotted several foreign tourists. Beachside also has limited shacks as compared to Baga and Calangute. We spotted some local boys playing cricket on the beach, cows roaming here & there etc. Due to its settings, the beach has a nice view especially from top, however it looks to be slightly laid back and less touristy."

Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,JXXXR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Beautiful Beach,Vagator Beach is a stunning beach located in the North part of Goa. This beach was less crowded then others in the area and offers a great sunset view.
Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,Ruchira Khandelwal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Black Sand Beach,Goa has a lot better beaches to offer. I have been to this beach in Feb'20 and I stayed there only for 5 minutes as the beach was not very clean.
Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,eyupmikethetyke,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,North Goa sandy beach with nearby bars and not as busy as Baga beach,"We came across Vagator beach whilst visiting the nearby ruined Portuguese fort on the overlooking hill and it proved to be a good move for an extended lunch with drinks. The beach is sandy and about half a mile long, rocky outcrops at each end with several small bars serving food/drinks in an slightly elevated position, so you have a good view across the whole beach area.We spent a pleasant couple of hours watching people enjoying the beach/sea as well as some local lads playing cricket in-between several cows strolling wherever they wanted and the local coconut milk sellers dog chasing them away from his maters stall. The water seemed clean with small waves so probably safe bathing and paddling to be had along with a clean sandy shoreline.It was nothing like as bustling as Baga beach which we had visited the previous evening and much more attractive for bathing or generally just lazing around. We stayed a good hour longer than planned and thoroughly enjoyed our snacks and drinks in the beach bar, of which there are three of four.A local taxi from our hotel in Arpora (The Park Regis) was around 300 rupees so an affordable day out to a quiet relaxing beach with just enough commercial development to not spoil the tranquillity was very easy to do."
Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,Samir S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Vagator Beach - less crowded , and nice sunset view.","One has to walk down a bit to reach the sandy beach . Proper stair case is there , so there is no problem in climbing down right up-to the beach.Less crowded , water sports available. Restaurant food is quite good here .  there are a number of Mediterranean and Indian Cafes/Hotels serving a variety of food and drink.The tourist traffic is predominantly Western backpackers, however it has also become popular with Indian tourists, who particularly come to watch the sunset from the rocks. The sunset through rocks is breathtaking from Vagator Beach.This is in my opinion is the best beach in North Goa . View of sunset is Awesome from here ."

Like most Beaches in Goa, it is Clean & Beautiful. Being away from Calangute, it is not crowded and you also get a better quality of Tourists here. There are plenty of Hotels, Resorts & Guest Houses in Vagator to suit every Budget and there are quite a few Restaurants around as well.

If you go just around the headland, there is a hill you can climb and also the lifeguards were less restrictive enabling us to swim out further than other beaches along this stretch.

Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,S.Menda,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Locals are violent against tourists - Vagator parking lot story,"First time in Goa, second of 7 days planned here and realised how much of a hooliganism locals can display for tourists. The parking is very bad at Vagator beach. Now I don't know is it the big beach or small. I was approaching the parking in my rented car and realised there was a traffic jam. This local tourist was trying to leave the parking from the opposite direction. As one car came towards us, all I said was 'please be careful, this is a rented car, cannot afford a scratch'....and then begins a series of abuse towards me (the driver) and my husband...so enraged got the guy whom my husband told to mind his tongue, that he got down his car and hurled abuses at my husband and began kicking my car. A random hooligan also started doing that from all directions and the man who was trying to leave the parking just supported them. They harassed us for my husband standing up for indecent behaviour, for supposedly creating traffic (which happened because of a bus by the way) and for being tourists. Since I'm a female, I was called a bad driver. Nice. That's how gender works. This happened within a few seconds which left me shocked, my husband feeling guilty for standing up for me and my rented car damaged by dents and bad scratches. While the hooligan created videos of us while hurling abuses at us, I managed to get a photograph of his which helped me lodge a complaint at Anjuna PS. Officers were supportive. Learnings: 1. Please use scooters as means of transportation in Goa. Roads are very narrow and weekends are crowded. We would have happily rented a scooty but we didn't have a two-wheeler licence on us. Chose to spend x5 times more on a rental car to avoid being fined. 2. You have the right to be anywhere you want but look for beaches with good parking and few people.3. Avoid scuffles with locals, do not curse.4. Please lodge police complaint for any wrong doing with you, atleast it stays in public record.Be vigilant and take as many evidence you can to help with the complaint. Goa Police has WhatsApp network so information provided to them can be shared quickly in their network."

There are many locations from top and from ground beach level. Keep some good time to take photographs here. You will not find many such good  places for photos.

Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,Jiegney,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,"Clean beach, Good Music, Amazing to be here","One of the best beaches in Goa, Vagtor beaches located in thw northern part of Goa. Vagator gives me an essence of beauty to not be found in any other beach. Its a small beach town. As we reach the area we are welcomed by the fancy restruents, colourful bars and the beachwear shops. Not only beachwear but different kinds of dresses, food, things etc.Vagator beach is just near a hill, on the hilltop there is a fort build centuries ago and only its ruins remains. It is one of most famous tourist attraction in Goa because of its beauty and accessibility. The beach of vagator is just next to Ozaran beach again one of famous beach.From the top of the hill the view of open sea is breath taking.Something to be put light on Vagator is that it is Miami of India, ever minute of the day there is party. You don’t know where to go because there is so much to see in Goa."
Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,gauth333,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Nice beach with less crowd,One of the few beaches in North Goa with relatively less crowd. THis may be due to the fact that the sand here is kinda blackish. Notwithstanding this fact the beach is beautiful and waves are medium. There are only a couple of shacks due to which the food and drinks are expensive. Locals play beach football in the evening and they do accommodate people on request for a game. Crowd is a mix of Indian and foreign. There are places to change near the beach and life guards are available till 1800hrs in the evening. Limited Water sports options are available.

Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,modxsounds,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Good beach,Vagator is a big beach with large space to lay down and relax. It is good for swimming but be aware for the red flag. If it is happen the lifeguard comes and swimming is not allowed probably of the jellyfish. Also it is good idea to have an sea umprella with you because there is nothing to lay down under the shadow.

Unlike Baga and Anjuna this beach is usually not crowded even in the weekends. The atmosphere is very peaceful to have nice walk along the beach or to spent a romantic evening with your girlfriends. Vagator beach also a ideal place to do your morning yoga. The are only two or three restrobar are available on the beach. The slope of beach is very gentle makes it easy for the people to go into the water even who doesn't know swimming. There is free parking space available.

One with small cliff like rock structures and another as a beach front. Both make for very great experiences. You can look forward to taking some breathtaking pictures near the rock structures during sunset. And they also have a very lit bar abd restaurant on the beach front for some after sunset chill.
Vagator_Beach-Mapusa_North,Richa D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Beautiful picturesque beach !!!,"Our first visit to the Vagator beach last November. We found this beach very different from our all time favourite Candolim beach as this is a rocky beach hence did not look inviting enough to spend long hrs in the water. We just stopped here for the views and the Chapora fort in the background. Since we went before noon, the beach wasn't very crowded and it being a nice clear sunny day, the locale proved good for some happy bright pictures. "
