The beach is not crowdy and is very clean. The best part about this beach is the sunset. Sun sets right in the middle of Arabian sea here and is completely painted in red colour in the evening. You can enjoy boat rides and some other sports here and it is also not dangerous if you walk towards the sea. Must visit in south Goa....

Varca_Beach-Varca_Salcette_South,Mihir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2020 • Friends,Best secluded white sand beach in Goa,"The reason I say best is coz in my numerous trips to Goa beaches right from Baga, Calagute, Candolim, Mandrem , Vagator, Morjim in North Goa to Canacona, Agonda, Palolem beaches in South, Varca turns out to be the best clean and free of public. And there is a simple reason for it...it just doesn't have enough hotels and shacks !I am not quite sure whether it's due to low awareness , popularity of dearth of budget hotels but maybe because if these reasons it's a place to be..The sands white, the beach quite broad for u to play, run, chill , sleep etc.. few shacks (must say most are not that good in food taste but it's the beach for which you go there ) and it's a long one.So if you wanna really rejuvenate, dont wanna see many faces and be by yourself then go to Varca..Best part about this beach is it's just 45 mins from the airport unlike other South Goa beaches. So you don't waste too much time traveling like in the case of far north (Mandrem,Morjim, Arambol) or far south ( Canacona, Agonda, Palolem)TIP : if you want a good meal (lunch/dinner) and don't wanna compromise on taste or quality then you can walk across to a hotel called Sterling Varca. That's the best in food and absolute bliss. It's just 500 mtrs from the entrance of Varca beach or just behind Zuri white Sands hotel."

Varca_Beach-Varca_Salcette_South,Malay A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Varca beach Goa -- a less-crowded beach with a relaxing ambience!,"Goa is surrounded by some of the most beautiful beaches, not only in India but perhaps the World. Some of these beaches are very crowded and some are not (especially during the peak/tourist season).Varca beach is one of the less crowded one even compared with Colva beach which is only about 10 km from Varca. If you are looking for a quiet beach with nice ambience to relax in Goa, then Varca beach is one of them. There is less activity here like Jet skiing, Para sailing etc. which is more evident in neighbouring Colva beach and other beaches, so there are less number of tourists/visitors here. For this reason perhaps there are less number of beach-side-food/drinks shacks & restaurants here too (compared to Colva and other beaches). You can hire beach-chairs which are mostly placed under beach-umbrellas and charged at hourly rates by the beach side restaurants/shacks. They also serve you cold Beer, drinks, food & snacks. (Some will offer you better rates/deal if you agree to also buy food, drinks from them -- it's negotiable).  Varca town itself which is about 3 km from the beach (and about 28 km from Dabolim international Airport) is quite a relaxed place to stay in Goa. It has many multi-cuisine restaurants/eateries, convenience stores, Souvenirs shops etc. From Varca you can organise day trips to many places of interest in Goa.Malay AdhikariMelbourne, Australia)"

Varca_Beach-Varca_Salcette_South,Prakash G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Tranquil Beach with Beautiful Sunsets,"We did visit in the shoulder season, after an extended monsoon. The beach is beautiful, clean and not too crowded. At this time only a couple of beach shacks were operational. But we did get our share of sun beds and sea food. Unlike other beaches in Goa, this seemed to be devoid of hawkers, masseurs and their ilk. Water sports are limited. There are a few non-menacing stray dogs, and a cattle shed with the accompanying poop. Life guards are on duty.  Breakfast on the beach was beautiful, sunset was sublime. Perhaps peak season will interfere with the tranquility. But I will visit again in Novembers"
