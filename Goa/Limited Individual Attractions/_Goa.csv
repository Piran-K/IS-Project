,Shreya Sircar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Excellent and Awe Inspiring,"Was a wonderful experience. A one person collection of 4000 items from the pre Portuguese era... very awe inspiring . A 45 mins well spent ... The guide Sushant was knowledgeable, patient with our questions and passionate about the place and each one of the items. A must go too ... Kudos to Victor Gomes !!!"
,Rakesh N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Museum - level 99,One of the hidden gems in Goa - The Goa Chitra Museum. Amazing private collection of Goan history by Victor Hugo. Place looks small from outside but didn't realise how the 2 hours flew with the detailed explanation from the guides. Not a place to be missed.
,Nikhil Soni,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Nice collection of work spread across three sections. Helpful guides. Not too long or tiring.,It's a private museum maintained by some local people. The guides are informed and helpful. They take you through three sections. Each of them has its own charm. You can take as many photos as you want but no flash allowed. They also have a souvenir shop but we didn't visit that. It took us about an hour to visit the whole museum. It was an hour well spent.
,Aaheli20,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Nice exhibit but not good experience for the price,The collections are wonderful but all exhibited items are not labelled. Few items are self explanatory but from where they have been collected and the history behind it isn’t well captured.They charge 300/- for the tour but the experience it offers isn’t value for money. The guide has explained all the sections well but we felt information was limited. In a less known museum like this a story telling is important which we didn’t like atall. Movie references for explanation is fine but overtly doing that didn’t give us a nice trip overall.
,Siddhesh Garg,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,A Goan Atelier for the Curious-Minded,"Curated by a Goan art historian, Victor Gomes, ‘Goa Chitra Museum’ is a must-visit on a lazy afternoon. Studded with artefacts and trinkets from across the Indian peninsula, the museum is divided into three sub-museums that teleport you from the pre-colonial Hindustan lifestyle to the Portuguese-helmed heritage. Taking a 45-minute guided tour (300 INR and worth it) enlightens you about the ancient farming tools at the Goa Chitra Museum (the first sub-museum), India's first-of-its-kind vehicles of different eras at the Goa Chakra Museum (the second sub-museum), and the historic Goan culture at the Goa Cruti Museum (the third and final sub-museum). My Tip:Ask for a tour from one of their resident guides, Sushant. He is very passionate about shedding more light on Victor's vision and the museum. His aura is very heartwarming and he made my visit worth noting.Best, SID"
,Sushmita Biswas,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,1 hr for this in Goa is must,"It’s an incredible accumulation of things of past and present.Wide range… carts, wheels, vessels, containers, office supplies and equipments, and many many categories.The guide Gladys was very informative and elaborate.Suggestion: the information shared about the articles should be displayed too along with the article. This will add authenticity to the museum.Good job."
,Sandip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Hidden Gem,"We were staying nearby and chanced upon this place. The owner - Mr. Victor Hugo Gomes  himself gave a brief introduction of the Museum . Approx. visit duration is ~ 2 hours. I was amazed to see such a widespread and rare collection dating back to several past years. We got a dedicated Tour Guide who explained on the 3 main sections of the Museum. The museum has a fair share of Local Goan History as well as from across the country specially of pre-Independence day era. The artefacts primarily covered the Transportation aspects as well as included the day-day chores not limited to the Cooking aspects, sanitization, eating habits, medical needs, recreational facilities, communication protocols, armory, fishery, plantation and agricultural aspects. They also had a Cafe but was closed due to renovation work as well as due to Covid. Think they should start that and have Light refreshments to offer . Was astonished to understand from Mr. Gomes that this was just 10% of his personal collection and wherever possible all these artefacts have been restored . Located quite close to the Colva Beach , tickets are priced at 300 each and is suitable for all age groups. It was truly a fascinating experience and to dwell into the rich history of Goa was quite enlightening.."
,JoshlineC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Couples,The Goa Chitra Museum is an absolute treasure of Goa,"Lovingly curated by Victor Hugo Gomes over many years, this small museum showcasing Goa's agriculture, Portuguese living, and India wide transport, is short and sweet.The joy is talking with Victor who describes his 30-year+ odyssey to collect, catalogue, and display the unique items and the travails of destructive cyclones, false promise politicians, and the apathy of Goans taken in by shallow tourism.The Caine Family from Fiji love visiting museums, and we're really glad to have met a true Goan in Victor."

The museum guide was wonderful and had many interesting stories. It was also such a delight to talk with Mr Victor Gomes, the founder and curator of the museum, the man behind the collection. Just within a 15 minute conversation, Victor amazed us with his unique insight and perspective into the need of cultural documentation and preservation of traditional knowledge systems.Would definitely recommend Goa Chitra to everyone interested in knowing and exploring beyond Goa's beaches."

,Vaishali B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Benaulim Ethnographic Museum,Visited as part of an organised tour...a step back into time...so many things collected from many locations giving an insight into the development of Goa.  It was a fascinating time...would have liked more..staff were polite & keen to show you the history of the area....it has to be said this man has a passion that is almost to the extreme limited only by the funds they have to preserve artifacts found or donated to his cause....well worth the time to visit & take a peek into the ares history...that would have been lost forever without the efforts of Victor Hugo Gomes....Excellent

,2torontotraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Goa Chitra Museum,"This museum in South Goa is a private collection of an individual by the name of Victor Huge Gomez. The entry fee is exorbitantly high as compared to other government museums (Rs 300). A guide takes you through the museum. There are three sections of the museum and all these are exhibition of collection of old artefacts by the owner. The artefacts not only concern the old Goan life but also at other places in India. These are mainly pottery, local tools, household items, horse-carts, palanquins, musical instruments and many other items. One will have to weigh the visit of the museum vis-a-vis the price of the entry ticket. Not many people visit this but one has to make his own call."

Goa Chitra is a conglomerate of three museums with over 40,000 artefacts and it's a self-funded and privately managed project with a team that's dedicated to preserving the rich history of Goa and our country.

,Vaishali B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,DOWN MEMORY LANE,"We visited Goa-Chitra,as part of a shore excursion from our cruise ship that was located in Vasco da Gama.  This museum was founded in 2010. It was about an hour's drive to get this museum from our ship as the museum is located in Benaulim. When we arrived the founder,  artist-curator-restorer Victor-Hugo Gomes introduced us to the concept and the idea behind this museum.  Goa Chitra's collection includes local carriages, carts,  pottery, farming tools, musical instruments, furniture and other memorabilia. It also showcases an organic farm which is used to cultivate various vegetables, herbs, spices, sugarcane, and rice—all staples of the Goa area. We were shown around the museum by a tour guide.  The museum contains also contains a gift shop that sells products made by local  artisans.  As this museum is based on the personal collection of Victor-Hugo Gomes, and contains over 4000 items, it reminded me of the antique section of farmer's markets in Canada.  It was interesting to see the agricultural tools of coastal western India."

,,,,,"So far this is this is one of the best museum's that i have seen. I have been here thrice and have loved it every time. Over the years they have been able to maintain it well my,compliments to Victor for this.They have now made three small differentiation, one is the museum of wheels, the other holds Portuguese artifacts and the last one has Goan artifacts. They have also tried to explain the artifacts with descriptions wherever possible.The setup of the museum is in a beautifully house, which has its own water harvesting.The staff is warm and welcoming, the guided tour is very informative. The rooms are literally crammed with artifacts, and if you have have a liking for how things used to work in the old world then this is the place for you.I have lost count of time all three times i visited.I read a few posts that say that the entry fees are high. My take is looking at what and the way the artifacts are maintained, and knowing that it is private museum, i think the fee is well worth it.More over i have learnt that the management take in the school children at discounted prices. If you have the liking and time this is a must see place.My best wishes to the Management and lots of luck."

,,,,,"What a wonderful experience to visit this 3 in one museum.. strating witht the carriages section, one gets to see so many varities of them. From diffefrent states and for different uses, one can visulise life in those days. Some palanquins also can be seen.  You then get to see different sections where they have pottery, baskets and weaving, barbers shop and so on. Next you get to see implenets used in various vocations, agriculture being prominent. The thridsection was one with ancient artifacts , clocks, table ware, medical equiplents, furniture etc. Guided tour is there and one needs to pay Rs.300 per head as entrance charges. It was fully worth and I spent about 75 minutes there... one can spend a bit more if one plans accordingly as theres so much to see and relish."

,vivek t,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Worthless visit,"We visited with a thought to see about goa heritage. Chitra museum of decicting various kinds of wheels, chariots. But it  was of pan india. Nothing more about goa. Owners effort is appreciable for collections, but it's not worthy to see after paying entry ticket of 300/- per head. May be good for foreigners but not for indians."

,Vaishali B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Nice bit of goan history but too costly,"Advertised primarily as a transport museum, this transport part is really a collection of human and animal drawn vehicles,  There are no signs and without a guide, they are meaningless.

Other parts of the collection/museum were more of a museum with ethnographic displays that were well documented and explained.  nevertheless, this was an interesting and well-spent morning and we were pleased that we undertook it."

,Meena A,,,,Went with my family on 9 June..Goa chitra part was good and informative but Goa chakra part was not that good..keeping a cart from Rajasthan or any other state doesn't tell anything to us about Goa so Goa chakra part was a misnomer..and 300 rs for this museum is way too much..museum of Goa( mog) takes just 100 rs and is way better than Goa chitra..
,SridharSathnur,,,,"We have visited Goa many times and were unaware of this little gem until our recent visit. The museum is small but beautifully laid out and crammed with interesting artefacts.  There are two sections, one dedicated to the ‘wheel’ which as its title suggests is primarily focussed on transport. There are many examples of carts and palanquins from all over India. The other section is more concerned with objects of everyday life notably kitchen tools and distillery processes, printing and lighting.  The guided tour which is included in the entry fee is a delight and helps to bring the objects to life. Well worth a visit!"
,GordonW318,,,,"So glad I visited after a recommendation. This Museum is small, but the personal tour included in the price of R300 makes it wonderfully enlightening. There are 2 sections: the first is the Transport Museum with interesting or ornate carriages and carts which were built and uses around India, from decorative marriage palanquins to carved Rajasthani gypsy vehicles.The second Ethnographic Museum, demonstrates the traditions of Goan life and village industries. Utensils and artefacts used eg for fishing, farming, printing, tailoring etc. My ancestors came from Goa, so it was relevant as part of my history. I would recommend this to anyone interested in people's and different cultures as a well presented and fascinating overview of Goan identity. "
,,,,,Located in Benaulim : it is a must visit in case you happen to stay in Benaulim or close by in south goa.  Very good collection of old carts/ carriages/ modes of transports/ palanquins in Chakra museum and wonderful glimpses of pottery/ furniture /kitchen vessals/ tools etc. used in old goan homes in Chitra museum are a definite worth a visit. Being run by collector himself and his enthusiasm in interacting with visitors adds to its charm. 
,,,,,"Tucked away in Benaulim is the Goa Chitra Museum. It has a fine collection of horse carriages, ancient carts, pottery, tools, some musical instruments, palanquins across different times. It is quite a large place and the artifacts are quite varied. There is an entrance fee of Rs. 300 per head. You are accompanied by a guide who patiently walks you through the place. The place has ample parking and is easily located using Google maps. This should be on your itinerary if you are visiting South Goa."
,,,,,This was an interesting visit and being welcomed by the owner and who's life work it is made the visit very worthwhile.The buildings are full of either originals or replicas of a bygone era. These included transport modes as well as various arts and crafts being displayed. The entertainment whilst drinking coconut milk was a four piece jazz band who played very well.This place is well worth a visit.

When people go to Goa, they think of beaches, food but noone actually knows that Goa has such great heritage and rich culture. I saw and learned that at the Goa Chitra museum. Victor Hugo the founder of the museum has such passion about this heritage and he's showcased it all through this museum travelling through remote areas in Goa in search of his passion.

With carts from  various states of our great country india.....And it's varied uses.Display of items past and present depicting the typical Goan way of life.. whether in home cooking, agriculture or fishing etc...A must visit for the younger generation who cannot connect to life parents lived before moving to living in cities and apartments..Everywhere in the world people respect and value heritage but in our country it's given the least importance...May this place continue to preserve our culture."
,SkykomishBob,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Interesting but Guide Overwhelming,"This place is well worth a visit, but I hope you get a guide whose English isn't monotone.  The sweet young woman who guided us couldn't even be understood by the Indian Guide who brought us here.  And she was tone deaf as bar stool when it came to gauging our interest in learning less about anything.  She had her set piece to deliver about each item and even though we were wandering ahead, she had to go through it.  Had we been prepared to be assertive about what we wanted to see and know, it would have made this a much more enjoyable experience for us.  As it was, it is a terrific museum with lots of interesting items, which were well understood by our guide, near as we could tell, and most of them in very good condition.  As it was we still learned a lot about earlier lifestyles and the trappings involved, although we were totally exhausted after nearly two hours of trying to make sense of what the lovely young woman was going on about.Do visit, by all means, but be prepared."
,PonsIndia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Never miss visiting this!,"Nice collection of different time period tongas and bullock carts. Well maintained and the guide explained every antique piece in a simple way. There were two museums within the museum, one was the Goa Chakra museum that has antique carts and the other one is Goa Chitra museum that consists of different agricultural equipments, cooking equipments and many more that was used years back. The guide was really sweet and explained everything in detail. Highly recommended to visit!!"
,Lyudmyla Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Wow!,"Goa is kinda poor for history, and this museum is smth! We were impressed by the collections and the guide. Museum. Several collections: transport, pottery, agricultural things and so on.Guide. She knows a lot, besides, she has an answer for every our question.And a tip: go by feet! Yes, it's far, but you can see so much interesting... For example, we saw tiny furniture plant, where everything is made by hands, we saw a tree with unknown fruirts and a girl, who lived in that house, gave us a present some of them. After cleaning."
,SPM02143,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Better than expected if you have any interest in ethnography ,"We were not sure what to expect from the Goa Chitra Museum and were prepared to be as bored as anyone with pile of old tools. In fact, it was an excellent experience in every respect. We were lucky to have a devoted and knowledgeable guide, who gave clear explanations about the origin and future plans for the museum project as well as about the various instruments, their uses and the era and location where they were found. You don't have to be an ethnographer to appreciate the museum but don't expect to be superfcially entertained. All you need is a fascination with how rural societies have found solutions to transportation, crop cultivation and harvesting, grain preparation and cooking. Definitely worth the travel time and hour or so-long tour. "
,VinitaChhatwani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Nice collection of antique carts,"Nice collection however entry tickets are highly priced. The best attraction is a 400 year old cart that weighs 8 ton and is made of granite wheels, unfortunately was not available for viewing as it had broken down, just got to see the wheels from the covering "
,Shahsona,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016,A private museum with an extensive collection of Artefacts from across India,"Amazing and biggest collection of carts from various centuries and from different states.

,jaideep k,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Conflict of Information and Entry Charges,"The website of this museum states there is no entry fee but when you reach at the location you are told that free entry has been discontinued and now you have to pay Rs. 300. It was quite annoying. I requested the guide present there to arrange for a call with the management to clarify the matter. After a couple of requests he dialed Victor's number who owns this private property.Victor was made aware that their website that was last updated in 2009 still says that entry is free and that is the window available to public for getting right information, and presenting misleading or wrong information is an offence. Instead of apologising for the mistake he started criticising government for not supporting and aiding arts in the country.I am not against entry fee but didn't like the attitude of the management. They must update the information related to entry charges on their official website to ensure the sanctity of the website and customer friendly attitude of the top management."
,GoaChitra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,Private Collectors Envy,"We have various types of people visiting Goa Chitra. We have   had over 4 lakh visitors since 2009 ranging from young school children to youth, researchers, holiday tourist from all corners of the globe including celebrities like Mr. Gulzhar and Robert di Nero. Ever-so-often we get an odd person seeking to find favors using their own selfish interest to see the museum free. 

For reasons better understood by them they quote a paragraph from our website which is misinterpreted only for the sole purpose of gaining free entry.  

The following line from our website is understood that entry is free, “…The proposed museum hopes to allow free entry for all interested in viewing the museum in this hope it fulfills most of the objectives.”..

The word hopes is conveniently left out.

The last page of the Goa Chitra website it is clearly mentioned that the entry is at Rs 300/- and special discounts for groups.

On one such occasion a men throwing his weight around with our staff acting arrogant and assertive, barraging that we are in fact selling the museum under false pretext kept flashing his journalist prerogative to gain free entry.
 
The Goa Chitra management will like to go on record and state that the above mention review is out of selfish interest and personal spite for not encouraging such hoodlums who use their personal profession of a so called “Digital Journalist”, Mr. Jaideep K, to throw his weight around and intimidate young enthusiastic staff who are just doing their duty.

The museum in fact is free for all elders to visit on world elder’s days.  School Students are given entry at Rs. 50 , college and PG students at Rs, 100 and all journalist and research scholars, artists, senior citizens are given special consideration on prior phone calls and appointments.

,Kailashnath K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Amazing place ,"Unsure of the name heard of this private museum this place is 5kms odd from margoa ..but the treasures found here speaks the authenticity of the mission of the collector       "" To conserve and pass heritage to future generation"" .Truly words cannot describe the heritage present here  and their associated stories .The guide who came along this trip was quite impressive in the knowledge of the history of these items and her unique way of clearing our doubts has to be praised.Do not miss this point all the history fans of IndiaThe entry for this museum is 300 ,however if you are taking any of the package tours you would be getting at INR200/person."
,viral06,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Family,Old Goan Picture,"A small museum off the beaten track. We went as it was offered by the hotel we stayed in as part of their free tours. A private museum, we went with no expectations. And it turned out quite interesting. A collection of 'wheel' based transport through the ages was fun to see and interesting to see the development over the centuries. The old Goa history collection was also quite extensive... an old confession booth, a bishop's chair, an old 'ghani' bullock oil press and many more such antiques.Small but worth a visit. Really appreciate the collector and his passion!"
,MARGDARSHI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,A magnificant collection of old Goan artifacts,Goa-chitra is very good place. Work in progress but nice place. Very good collection and good facility. Must visit once.
,399lindsayj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Friends,Organise a tour with the museums founder!,"Goa Chitra Museum is located in Benaulim & is a work in progress starting from 200 items displayed to more the 4000 now.It is a small museum with an entrance fee of RS 100 which can be gone through in about 2 hours.There is  not a museum with much fanfare & visit it only if you are interested in knowing about the development of Goa in the fields of farming-tools & methods of farming,various modes of transportation & their evolution over times.I found the exhibit of some well known painters putting on their canvases the Goan scenes.The various occupations indulged in by the people in the rural areas like basket making,milk churning activities implements etc & also some which are not being used today."
,veggie666,,,,"This museum was a real find, just a few kilometers inland from Benaulim beach. It began as a man's personal collection of carriages, furniture, tools and implements from the Goan past and is continually expanding. The items have been beautifully restored.The two of us had a very knowlegable personal guide for the tour which took around two hours and cost only 300 rupees each.Well worth a visit."
,,,,,"The museum is absolutely interesting, telling you about goan lifestyle. Ask to meet the founder, Victor Hugo,  and try to join him on a one-day-tour totally off the beaten tracks! He has so many stories to tell about how life used to be in goa, and how it changed."
,johnchristinewright,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,Wonderful collection of artifacts,"Goa Chitra is a must for visitors.

,MidlandsMoochers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,Two attractions for the price of one!,"Happy to add our contribution to the many other positive reviews of this charming museum.  A great alternative to (another) day on the beach! Firstly, it has a great collection of mostly wooden carriages and carts from all over India that reflect the different styles of each region and the means of propulsion, be they camel, bullock, horse or human! The second museum comprises collections reflecting everyday Goan life in previous years. Some were arranged by craft of the creator or user; potter, weaver, fisherman or farmer.  Others in the style of an antique or curiosity shop; fascinating finds, large and small waiting to be explored!Our guide was informative and helpful throughout, although some time to wander unguided might be more to others tastes.We spent a couple of hours there and could have stayed longer."

The exhibits are well laid out in several rooms - but are completely unlabelled. However we were guided around by an charming and very knowledgeable guide, Valerie. We were the only visitors at time - might not be such a good experience if museum busy."

Although we went in an off season ,it was different experience to see historical Goan culture. The lady was brilliant in explaining us the informations about the artefacts and she made the whole experience pleasure able. If you are interested in history,n in South Goa you might want to give it a try."

It is a collection tools and artifacts, seldom seen,an amazing collection that will be appreciated not only by tourists,but by the people themselves who will appreciate Victor's efforts to create a museum that everyone can identify with, and probably wish they had retained as a memento!A night occasion was a treat to behold!

,Yeshwant Alway,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,WORTH A VISIT,"We wanted to visit this place for past 3-4 years and managed to do so this year on a hot summer afternoon. Goa Chitra and Chakra Musuem is display of articles and objects portraying lifestyle of people (especially in & around Goa) painstakingly collected by a single person. And it is growing and adding objects. We were shown around by curator and collector Mr. Victor Gomes himself and thus had a good insight into the displays. The Musuem is divided into 'Dom Martin Art Gallery' a small collection of Paintings on Goa, 'Goa Chakra Musuem' showcasing the various objects on wheels as per its evolution and 'Goa Chitra' which focuses on livelihood and lifestyle of previous generations, their objects and articulates, some totally detailed.You have to go and see. It is a worth visit. You can also refer their website. If you do visit take time out to understand individual displays and it use. Mere roaming can be done anywhere in Goa.With growing displays, may be it should spread out a bit. Also a detailed book/article on objects, their meanings and use can do justice to understand better than a timebound visit"
,Willy D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Solo,"Excellent break from ""beach life"".",I have been to Goa Chitra twice. Once to visit the museum and once for a night of dance and workshops. You will leave with an understanding of Goa most will never get from the tourist areas. Victor who owns and curates the museum is a wealth of Goan knowledge. Not to be missed.
,Vintage_Vix,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Couples,A Fascinating Gem,We'd been meaning to visit Chitra for a number of years but only got round to it last year.

We didn't feel rushed and any questions we posed to her were expertly answered.

It was tough to locate the place through GPS or navigation system, we just folllowed the directions mentioned in their website. The entry fee is Rs. 200 per person and there is enough parking space.

His missionary zeal in collecting artefacts and bits and pieces of Goa over many years and presenting it here in a museum has truly brooght joy to hundreds of visitors to this show piece.After painstakingly collecting restoring and cataloguing his personal collection he now shares it with all who enter (for a nominal entrance fee). If you want to get a feel and look of the Goa of yester years, this is the place to visit. Many of the articles presented are not in use anymore. Victor also gives you an insight of the ways of the land many years ago. (Like the weights and measures used by traders and also the trickery used to fool customers by some of them)His collection encompasses agriculture, trade, lifestyle, and also a study of remote villages. Learning history makes you appreciate whatever is left in Goa today.Also on the event list is partaking in organic farming, the Goa Chakra (transport museum), Music shows, Childrens' programs.Thanks for a wonderful experience"
