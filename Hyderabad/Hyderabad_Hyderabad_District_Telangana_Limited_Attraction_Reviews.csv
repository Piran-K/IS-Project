Ramoji_Film_City,Dr.Saravanan Chandran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-23,One day tour at Ramoji Film City,"One of the must see at Hyderabad, you need a day to see most of the places, reach at 9am stay up to 7pm, maintained up to the international standard. "
Ramoji_Film_City,Amit Bansal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan-23,"Good experience, wish I had got some good food as well","A good experience going around the film city.I booked a package from Ramoji website. The first half was checking around sets via an A/C bus with guide followed by a lunch.The lunch at Superstar hotel was really not as per Ramoji's standard. Poor state of veg food, pathetically slow roti service. Not worth the price. Taste was just OK. If the restaurant can not handle volume, then they should not even entertain that much of volume.The stalls outside offered much better food.The shows were great as well, the package that I opted was too lengthy for my enthusiasm, at around 5 PM, I wish there were no more shows. I wanted a good tea with some snacks, that experience was not that great as well. Food & restaurants surely needs to improve for the prices that are offered for.There was a winter fest that made the place even beautiful with lights, perhaps, I had left with no energy & zeal to enjoy that.It was a good experience, wish I had got some good food."
Ramoji_Film_City,Kapil R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Bad experience of Transportation,"Very unprofessional peoples, i have booked transport for pickup from santosh dhaba, begum bazar nd pickup time was 7:15. But no one reached there nd when talk to customer care even they also don’t know about the pickup. After that they ( mohammed Yasir) are asking us to come to another point nd giving  excuses that by mistake santosh dhaba was printed on ticket.I don’t understand that how there could be misprinting.My parents are senior citizens those who are facing this problem."
Ramoji_Film_City,Rajesh Ramamurthy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-22,A mind blowing experience,"The sheer enormity of this place means travelers are bound to be left wondering about the logistics of moving around. Believe me, as a family of four including two children, we found the logistics was handled seamlessly. The guides were well informed and the trip moved in a sequential manner. Facilities such as rest rooms, restaurants etc. were also positioned to the advantage of all guests. Highly recommended"
Ramoji_Film_City,Mel12939,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-22,The Film City of India,"Massive, huge, mesmerizing, literally takes you one complete day to wander around each and every beautiful aspect of making a film, hospitable people, neatly maintained, good souvenirs, overall would definitely recommend.  "
Ramoji_Film_City,Avijit,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,"Ramoji film city visit with star experience is sheer wastage of time and money The carnival and parade is nothing to ta","Sheer waste of time and money as I said in title. If managementbthoughtbthat they can mix fast food and  heavy lunch together, then this can happen. One can neither see the things they mightbfeel interesting although there is nothing much to see, except some old film sets, nor one can get time to enjoy the rides available for kids. The other entertainments are what ones get to see in circus , like action stunts, dance show, etc. In the digital era, these does not entice people. They should make it clear whether they want to promote it as game and rides park or mere tour of some so called fancy sets"
Ramoji_Film_City,SREENIVASAREDDY M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,"An Indian Hollywood, a great & must see wonder!","Situated in the middle of green hills, away from city buzzing, with good stay & food arrangements, originally meant for fil. shootings of various locations like  various township locations, gardens, fountains, forts, tempkes, rly Station, bus station, busy areas, parks, zoo, birdirium and incl.of recent blockbuster like BAHUBALI sets also can seen alive.Two days tour actually required to enjoy the serene of this spot. There are various tariff hotels to stay, all sorts if food out let's, any point to any point free bus service etc privileges of this property."
Ramoji_Film_City,Raman G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,"When visiting Hyderabad,  you can come here for a day","It is a full day tour. About 40 km from Hyderabad.  The largest film city complex in the world. The owners of film city also organize tours for guests for the huge complex. Tours from around 9 am to 530 pm. We took a Star experience tour. Booked online in advance from their website. ( they have a toll free number as well for any enquiries) . It is a guided tour of the grounds, sets and the special shows. The advantage is that this tour   is communicating in a AC bus. Which was definitely a comfort for us. It includes a buffet  lunch- which was ok. If you need, the organizers also arrange a bus pick up and drop from various  points in Hyderabad. But depending on your pick up location. It can be a 2 hour ride in the bus to the film city. We hired a taxi for full day. ( abt Rs 3000 for the day). We reached a bit before 10 am. It is recommended to reach by 9 am as they ask to, as the tour definitely ends at 530pm. We did notice that for return to Hyderabad in the evening  there are stalls at film city for return transport , but do not know the charge? ( in case you only take a drop to film city by own transport). You can visit the film city without booking any of the tour package as well. It will be a walk in for the tickets. We noticed that these are quite crowded as a group. If you have visited any such film city  tours abroad, say in Singapore or San Francisco, these are very much of a very high standard and quality in thrills and excitement and experience as compared to Ramoji.But in India, it is surely one a kind. Tour includes, rides, walk through bird parks, gardens, visit film sets,  walk through film sets and shows. The latter include a dance and song show as well.Our tour was very well set up and organised."
Ramoji_Film_City,Praveen Anand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-22,Excellent and fun place to go. Must visit place in Hyderabad,"Learn about the film making and visit many locations, which were part of many great films. Very well  clean and maintained place. You need full day to visit"

Ramoji_Film_City,reshma r,,,,"Waste of time.Not organised at all.Simply waste of time is queue.They asked all people to go to movie magic first and then  Doll store.. And so on. But instead they could have split the teams so we can avoid  waiting time.And also iits not worth waiting in queue and watching some dances. They are olden days strategy. But they are still following it.And not all the games are free, You have to pay for many games. And also 3D movie they charged 100 per person. All the things are not included in my Ticket.Ticket -- ₹1250 + 250 Dinner + tax its ₹ 1770/-  per head.Food is heavy costly 1biryany  500+Water small bottle 25.₹All eatables costly for common manNot worth at all"
Ramoji_Film_City,TamilAmerican,,,,"Ramoji Film City is a wonderful experience and a must visit. I'll list down some delighters and things that can be improved based on my experience.  Pros first1. Lots of things to do and experiences to have. 2. The shows are very impressive. Spirit of Ramoji, Wild West were in particular very nice. 3. There were a good amount of rides for children and adults to enjoy. 4. The eco park was very good, especially the bonsai collection was amazing to see. 5. Haunted house was a good experience for kids. Things that can be improved1. The brochure was very confusing. There is no way you can cover all the things in Ramoji in a day, so the brochure should give more detailed information which helps the people to choose based on their interest. 2. We took the star experience package which was the more expensive one. However they kept passing us from one person to other person without anyone explaining what is the plan for the day. Even on asking they were not interested to answer and just kept pointing to someone else. It felt we missed out on lots of things simply because no-body told us. Also the bus was so overcrowded that everyone did not even got a seat and lots of time was wasted in sorting that out. The star experience didn't feel worth the money and I felt I would have been better off with a regular ticket and planning the day myself, rather than leaving it to the star experience providers. 3.  Don't think this falls under the jurisdiction of Ramoji, but the travel to and from Ramoji was a big headache. We booked a ticket via BestBus which seemed to show on their site that they are the official partners with Ramoji. However it was a bad experience, as they kept asking us to change pickup point without realizing how difficult it would be for someone to reach different pickup point at short notice. Even while drooping off they didn't drop us at our designated dropping point. I would strongly suggest giving BESTBUS a skip and find another option to reach there."
,,,,,"Ramoji Film City is the thematic holiday destination and The World’s Largest Film Studio Complex. A 1, 600-acre land gifts the spectacular experience of exploring the wonderful attractions of the world at one destination. It is an awesome place to visit with family & friends."
,,,,,"I went there in May 2022 (during the carnival season) with my husband and nephews. Everybody loved that place. The place has so much to offer, including - learning about movie making process, adventure sports, food, music, DJ, dance performances, martial art performances, gifts for participants, beautiful movie sets, green gardens, butterfly garden, and so on. We spent over 12 hours and it was worth it. The ticket cost was approx. 1200 per person, but it's worth every penny. There is bus service inside, you can go from one point to another by bus (no additional cost). Bring your own water bottle as there is a drinking water tap at every point where you can refill your water bottle for free. I am planning to go there again with my parents in November.Only advice - go there when the weather is nice and keep in mind that you will spend at least 6-8 hours outdoors."
,,,,,"This family friendly huge entertainment zone was unique. Right from the entry, where we were given chocolates and sets to take interesting themed photos, the trip was amazing. A van took us to different points like Alauddin ride, shows about making the movie, sets where each entrance was a different building etc. The guide was charming and explained the significance of different spots along with the famous movies directed there. The gardens were spacious and well maintained. The best part of the trip was the Bahubali set. We loved the magnificent ensemble."
Ramoji_Film_City,Vaishnavi_g,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-22,SImply excellent,"Dont ask a local hyderabi about visiting this place. They say, what is there in it !!! But believe me it is really wonderful for an outsider. You will be taken through a guided tour, and you will get to see cine-settings, best of it is, Bahubali setting, Mahabharata, Ramyana... Then you will have a 4D show... Eco park where for the first time I saw the birds , geese etc left to freely fly around although inside a fenced area. You can just walk through them...Got to hold a maccaw in hand.... And adventure rides.... Worth giving an entire day for it.     Dont bother if a local says, dont waste your one day on it. Just go for it. It is worth going atleast once here. "
Ramoji_Film_City,Biswajit M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-21,Time waste,"Its not worth visit as its very mundane and old school , its actually a studio being open for tourists who have nothing else to do and only have time to waste and spend money"
Ramoji_Film_City,Konganapally Laasya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun-22,My experience on Ramoji Film City,Since I am an Indian Hindu my family has some traditions And since I am 10 years old i have to start wearing half sarees For that we need to throw a party as my first day wearing half sareeWe threw that party in Ramoji Film City hawa mahal and everything was great the food the atmosphere and everything we book hotel rooms in Tara hotel and we stayed for a night the next morning we did a photo shoot in Ramoji Film City The reason I gave four stars is because it was really expensive it nearly cost 3 lakhs and the next morning my rooms shower broke and the hair dryer was not working But still you should visit Ramoji Film City cause it’s the greatest experience I’ve ever had 
Ramoji_Film_City,Dattatray Bhat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,BIGGEST FLIM CITY IN WORLD,"I had visited ramoji, couple of years earlier.

Ramoji_Film_City,Suresh K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-21,Worthy Place to Visit,Very much enjoyed with Family. Very large place to cover. Inside commuting is very good. You can spend the whole day is not enough to cover everything. Very much interesting to watch how they filming. 
Ramoji_Film_City,Mayank G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-21,One of the Must Visit Place in India,"This overall Ramoji Rao Film City tour experience like watching huge budget film on big screen . This tour is full of action, emotion, drama, music and dance . Just Amazing and unique place. But in my opinion this tour must be two days because only one whole day you can not cover this huge area . Nevertheless one day trip is also enjoyable. This is one trip where you can understand the process of film making . Lovely! Total Blockbuster Place."
Ramoji_Film_City,lkoraj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,"Good place, must see if you are in hydrabad.","A very good place, very much decorated shooting points and beautiful gardens, good for children entertainment, nice shows like adventure, dance, film making process, space yatra, filmi duniya, action etc, big film sets are a very good attraction of this place, overall a good place to see."
Ramoji_Film_City,Tubby,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Solo,Over hyped.. sangam restaurant NOT TO BE VISITED!,"Caves, wild west, birds show, and space yatra good showsBut Buses force you to go from one spot to anther and there is no option to go directly to the starting point I would specifically call out Sangam restaurant that forces one to pay rs350/head for unlimited food!! They need to learn from Chowki Dhani, Jaipur how unlimited food is served!! They go around the tables to serve people and people eating dont have to go again n again to get smthing! Worst is on reaching the buffet spot, you may not even find the dish you came for 🫤. Plus, Ramuji and family, when you source out to these caterers do you even chk what they are serving and how? Do you eat rasam in a thali at your home? My suggestion.. ramuji and family, plz come to this place as a tourist and then share your review as well!!!"
Ramoji_Film_City,Jalpesh Rojasara,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Must visit if get opportunity,"Must visit once in life time. Take standard tickets. No need to take star experience tickets. Well organized visit by film city staff, just follow their instructions u will not miss single  Location or live shows. Plenty of free drinking water stands with chilled and hygiene water. Plenty of food options with price on higher side. They provide guided tour in their vintage style red bus in film city. More than 2000 movie shooting done here. Bahubali set is ok. 3 hotels name tara, sitara and shantiniketan are within film city. Reach at 9 am so u can watch opening ceremony. 2 lines for tickets, 1 for direct ticket from ticket counter and onther who have online tickets. Evening parade is good. In evening whole film city is decorated by lights so u feel u are in another world. Must experience this. Most of rides are complementary free. At sahas adventure location u will enjoy adventure rides free of cost. One full day required for visit. Kids zone is also good and photogenic. Star experience tickets has ac bus, food coupon, welcome chocolate box not worth for its price. Local taxi from hyderabad city available at 1000 to 2000 fair rate. Plenty of free parking lots available at ticket counter. If u have hotel booking u can take u r private car upto hotel. So enjoy ur visit u will definitely remember it. "
Ramoji_Film_City,amol s,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Total Waste of Money & Time !!,"We visited this place with lot of expectations but were left very disappointed with overall experience!Total ticket cost for family of 2 adults and 2 kids was 5400 for absolutely nothing worth mentioning to see Horror starts right from beginning when u are asked to park car 5 kms away from main premise. From there all tourists are put in outdated buses like prisoners and taken to main film city area .So once you are in you just can not leave place without going through entire torture. Guided tour lasts only about 30 mins and after that you are left there from point to point to explore nothing. Adventure sports area sports like paintball , archery are all useless. For paintball just one person standing there asking u to shoot 3 shots on target . Archery session arch set looks like it is third class china toy bought at 100 from local market. That also only one ser is there. In short what is included in ticket is all useless stuff but advertised by Mr Ramoji as if its out of the world Sahaj adventure sports .For kids only space yatra which lasted for 5 mins and bird park was only area worth mentioning.In addition like prisoners you are not allowed to carry any food inside . Firstly with exorbitant ticket cost now they like are further allowed to take more money from your pocket.Restaurant called Jimmy is total useless with third grade food at five star prices .Worst is you cant leave place as you are stuck there !!Pls avoid avoid and donate money to some needy !!!"

Ramoji_Film_City,AjithBhaskaran,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-22,Fun insight into movie making,"Worth a visit if you are on a trip to Hyderabad - it is around 1 1/2 hours drive from City Centre. Gives an idea as to how films are made and sets are constructed. Need to either reach by around 9 am or better still stay there in one of the hotels inside RFC the previous evening as you need a full day to see everything. Even a full day is a bit rushed. Best to pick up tickets ('Studio Tour' is good enough) online, go to the centre point (Eureka), attend the opening ceremony at 9.45 am, proceed to Studio Tour/Eco Tour (must do), have lunch, then go for the shows. Don't miss the Wild West Stunt Show! Lights, Camera, Action is interesting too. Rest of the shows are average, especially for someone who has been to other studios/sets elsewhere. Pick up a brochure and plan your day ahead. Food within RFC is average or even below average."

We loved the spots we saw and the carefully curated sets. The Japanese Gardens were a delight in particular and we loved the Bird Park. Had no idea they had such an amazing collection and the birds looked like they were vey well taken care of. The Moviemaking Part was amazing and the 'Director' was very funny.OUR GUIDE: Loved our guide Datta Ji. He was very patient and very courteous. He let us choose which spots we wished to disembark for and offered to take our pictures everywhere we went. He was very funny, jovial and amiable person.FOOD: The buffet at Sitara was sufficient so was the taste.OVERALL, it's truly a must visit spot if you come to Hyderabad"

Ramoji_Film_City,SuprabhatC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-21,Grand,"This is a massive film city and studio complex with open-air film sets, vast gardens, replicas of historical monuments, statues. Liked the Bahubali set. Though there are a number of restaurants and fast food options, it is inadequate keeping in mind the vastness of the complex. A pressing need for more drinking water stations as walking around the whole day can be very exhausting. Mist fans should be installed for respite from heat. The route options of buses lack clarity.One should budget an extra day, recommend night stay at the hotels in the complex for more leisurely experience."

Unfortunately they expected my mother to climb in to a bus to go and then climb out of that bus to climb in to another bus, from which she would have to climb in and out at every stop. I even offered to buy 4 premium tickets if they allowed our vehicle in with their guide. But to no avail. It is sad to see an establishment that portrays it self with such grandness to be so inconsiderate and non inclusive."

Here you will see see film sets used in multiple films. Star attraction is Bahubali fim set. To add icing on the cake, there are multiple shows. Pls do keep their timings in mind. You can reach the main entrance via own car, bus or local transport. From there,, you need to travel via their buses. Avoid visiting during public holidays, as it can get over crowded, and you might end up spending most of the time in queues. Overall a great place. "
Ramoji_Film_City,Rover_Girl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Couples,Awesome experience,"Ramoji Filmcity is a must visit if you are travelling to Hyd for business or leisure. Located in around 2000 acres, a well managed theme park. I was awestruck by looking at management of the premises; it’s nothing less than any international theme parks like Disneyland etc. only difference is that this place attracts all age groups & not only kids. It has got 4shows; bus tour; Sahas adventure land; opening & closing ceremony; kids rides & various dining experiences. All are worth it.Advice for management: Streamline the bus tour as the hop on & hop off should be at the discretion of visitor instead forceful. Also should have the red bus at all locations rather starting with red bus then normal buses & last leg with red bus. Too much hassle for visitor.Things I loved: beautiful capture of Mahabharata Sets; bird park was awesome;  Bahubali set & Mughal garden were grandeour; & shooting locations were interesting."

Ramoji_Film_City,Raviraj Rodrigues,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-21,Excellent place for a one time visit,"The property is built on the lines of Disneyworld, but at a much lower scale and finish quality. However for the entry price, I would say its worth a one time visit. We got to see many sets. both live and ready for shooting. Some of them are permanent like Mughal gardens, Rajput Palaces, Wild West, Indian Village scenes etc. Some others were created for one movie and left for tourists to enjoy like the sets of Bahubali. They have some lovely gardens, bird park and butterfly park too. However, one can truly enjoy the place only by staying inside the filmcity in one of their hotels for atleast 2 nights. There is too much to see and do and the guided tour of 2.5 hours will not do justice to the place. We could spend early mornings and late evening on the sets and gardens as we stayed in the resort and were permitted to move around. "
Ramoji_Film_City,Neha Banerjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-21,Would definitely come back with my toddler,We visited recently in Covid times. 1 excellent thing is it's closed for outside but open for people who are staying. So the crowd was minimal.We stayed in the Sitara hotel.We enjoyed hassle-free check-in. Then Ramoji tour and Bahubali tour. Hardly 10-15 ppl which was excellent as per the pandemic situation. Few parks were open and in lush greenery so it was just a close-to-nature trip.My toddler could run around freely and enjoyed it a lot.I will surely visit again.

Ramoji_Film_City,valivali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr-21,Wonderful Place,"I visited film city on 01-04-2021. It was excellent. Best Place to visit in Hyderabad. Best for Families, Friends, Couples, Children's and for every one. Best in hospitality. Best Cooperative Employees. Best Guides. Comfortable, Clean & Neat every place including washrooms. Foot-by-Foot water facilities with cool and disposable glass also. Infact one day was not enough to enjoy the entire film city, minimum 02 days. Guidance and Hospitality towards us was very much appreciable. We ate Veg-Food and it was good, but price was Rs.300/- comparing to outside of film city it cost just or below 100/-. So Price was pretty much higher. Except food all are reasonable rates. Unfortunately i forgot my bag at clock room and left HYD and reached my home town. After contacted them they were very helpful and responded in a cooperative nature. After some phone calls and messages, i got my bag via courier and all things were as same as left bag(No things were missed nor disturbed yet).Finally i give 05 stars for film city and 1 star for Food Rate."

They don't allow any kind of food item... selling their food items in their stalls at very high rates....20 rupees item available at the rate of 80 rupees. Also all the items are fast food...so small children and elderly may suffer from hypoglycemia...no healthy choices available...It's only money making business... ticket rates are already very high...the difference between adult and children rate only 200rupees...not in capacity to visit the tour by middle class...who have earned the money by hard work...No resting place with shadow at some points...can not visit again...After visiting the place you are the most tired person...Food must be available at reasonable price or visitors should be allowed food items to carry...

Ramoji_Film_City,Twinkle Sonar,,,,I went there with my wife & friends. It is situated nearby to Hyderabad Airport. I just loved the place. I saw so many sets of different films. It took complete one day to go through each and every part of Ramoji Film City. It's a complete one day picnic. I have enjoyed throughly. 
,,,,,"Ramoji Fiml City is the largest film city in the world and it is a good place to visit with family for a day of incursion. It has fun rides, film sets and the most popular Bahubali movie set."
,,,,,"ramoji is like a dream. I had not experienced anything like this before in one go. As it is spread in a huge area you need to board a bus to reach the first point from where your MAGICAL JOURNEY BEGINS. From there it is that super  sweet red bus to take you along.It is so interesting and intriguing and beautiful that you dont want it to end. Honestly you cannot see all in a day. Though I visited this place 2 years ago I m still in love with it. When this covid menace is over I would certainly go there again to regenerate myrself.  Its just lovely. I can bet that like me you too will be amazed. Go and visit if you are in hyderabad.  If you don't see ramoji you will regret it for sure. But a little piece of caution. The story goes that it is haunted, which is still a mystery for me."

We had booked tickets online through Makemytrip priced at 1150 rupees per person and collected physical tickets from the counter at Ramoji Film City. Once inside the gate, a bus took us to the actual amusement park area. There was a grand welcome show with song and dance at 9.45 am. Next we boarded their red bus for a grand tour which took us to different locations like Bahubali movie set, Japanese Gardens, London street, Butterfly park, Bird park, Kripalu caves and many more. In the 2nd half we attended different mind boggling shows out of which the best was the Spirit of Ramoji show. In between we squeezed time for burgers and fries. To sum it up, this was surely one of the great experience to cherish for a lifetime."

It is listed as the World's largest film studio, and indeed the tram tour dovers acres of land and a multitude of film sets. You can possible see ongoing filming and the attractions and occasional performers that you meet are entertaining.As an visiting American, I wasn't familiar with the films that had been made here, but nonetheless was impressed with the studio lots and the tram tour. Everything was professionally done and the staff was good about getting people back ontime after each stop. I note that the tour was not in English, but that didn't really affect my ability to enjoy and understand what we were seeing."

Well organized guided tour and memorable experience from the moment you step in until you leave the place. Whole property is very well maintained. Plenty of photo options for photography lovers.While we come across each sets it reminds of some movie of any Indian language. Highlight is Bahubaali set for our group. Lot of walking involved inside but great experience.Definitely with high standards and competitive comparison with other similar concept around the world. It was not really fully crowded probably because of school examinations time and week day as well. Great memorable experience. Descent food options available inside at decent price range. Definitely 5 stars and each penny worth spending.

Golconda_Fort,Saurabh M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Historical Golkonda fort.....“Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far they can go.”,"Exploring Telangana........Hyderabad..... At the famous Golkonda fort......How to reach can take a auto or ola directly there....... Golconda Fort Hyderabad is an outstanding example of brilliant engineering and magical architecture. Located at a distance of 11km from the city, it is the most famous of all Hyderabad tourist places. The name of the fort has been derived from the Telugu words ""Golla"" and ""Konda"" which together means 'Shepherd's Hill'.An impressive structure, which once, would have bewitched every onlooker, stands majestically even today. Golconda Fort is sure to impress you with not only with that highly advanced techniques were used back then and sturdy structure, but also with an outstanding view of the surrounding city.Founded in the approximately 12th Century by the Kakatiya Kings, this massive Golconda Fort with eight gates and 87 bastions was later built by Qutub Shahi Kings.The name Golconda Fort has a legend behind it. As per the story, a shepherd boy was once walking on this hill when he had come across a God idol. The news about the shepherd boy and his findings reached the then ruler of Kakatiya Dynasty. The King then decided to built a fort on the hill, which then came to be known as Golconda (Shepherd’s Hill) Fort.However, almost 200 years later, the fort came under Bahamani rulers. Later Qutub Shahi Kings took the fort under their control and extended it further. The fort was fortified and expanded during the reign of Bahamani rulers and Qutub Shahi Dynasty. Later in 1687, this fort came under the rule of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. It was then the fort was left unattended.At present, the Golconda Fort constitutes a complex layout of palaces, temple mosques and pavilion, all of which unfortunately are in ruins now.Architecture of Golconda FortWith perimeters of around 11 kilometers, the fort has 15 to 18 foot high walls. It has huge gates that have pointed iron spikes on them. This protected the fort from Elephants damaging the fort as well as enemy attacks. Golconda fort presents a mesmerizing architecture which will astonish you at each and every step. This fort has been built on a granite rock with a height of 12 meters. Huge rampart around the golconda fort was built, a glimpse of which can still be seen.The system of acoustics in the Fort is something which attracts each and every visitor. The sound of clapping at the entrance can be heard at the ‘Bala Hissar' which is the highest point and almost a kilometre away. This system was apparently used for communication purposes, especially to alert royal in case of any attack.Other attractive features of the Fort include water supply system which does leave many marvelling at the advancement of the technical and scientific knowledge while constructing this fort. Another popular aspect is the 'Rahban' cannon.Ramdas’ prison is one of the popular spots inside the fort. According to legend, Ramdas who was a revenue collector in Abdul Hasan Shah's court was imprisoned. During his imprisonment, he carved Hindu deities on the wall of his cell. One can see many carvings of Hindu Lord Hanuman on the wall, which are now smeared with holy vermillion. A holy lamp or two (diyas) is also kept lit in front of the carvings."
Golconda_Fort,Nazura Javed,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-22,Golconda Fort - Climbing for History,"The place is in ruins , needs better maintenance  and amenities like toilets. The approach road is through crowded narrow roads. Reaching the top of the fort requires a bit of stamina for one has to climb up steps and it can be a little hard for those not used to it. Also the day we went the place was pretty crowded.The good thing is that one does get a feel of history (especially if one is somewhat aware of Deccan India history) and also a great view of the city once you reach the top of the fort."
Golconda_Fort,Ruzan Desai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-22,"History, Hike and Panaramic Views",The Golconda fort is a great place for spending half a day. It is recommended to take the government approved guides( INR 750) to understand the true essence of the place. The guides are helpful with showing the stellar architectural nuances of whispering walls and echo points. It is worth climbing to the top of the fort. It is about 400 steps each way. The city view is excellent from there- panoramic in every sense of the word. There is a stall on the top with basic water and chocolates which provides adequate replenishments.
Golconda_Fort,jojo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-22,Scenic Background with Historical Memories.,We visited the fort in the noon time. Ticket was Rs 25 per adult. It was almost crowded. But it was properly maintained. The fort was very beautiful and has historical importance. Having a majestic look spread over with memories of the past. Excited crowds being busy with photographs and the excellent scenic background.Guides were available.
Golconda_Fort,Andrew D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Lovely view from the top,"Compared with other forts in India, Golconda is not particularly different but it does have a good view of the surrounding areas from the top. That being said, I would still recommend a visit to the Golconda Fort for a taste of how lives must have been during the nizam's times."
Golconda_Fort,vasant agshikar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Golconda fort visit,I visited the fort and took a guide who provided me good enough about the fort. It is advisable you negotiate with the guide .the fort is well maintained and one can enjoy the view from various levels of the fort. The view from the top most point of the is awesome. The 700 step well is an uphill tasks if your having health issues like heart BP etc kindly avoid taking the stairs. The architectural is amazing and the science behind construction is also an interesting subject to study to know how advance we were then. It would take you 2 hrs to cover the entire area with enough rest and photography.
Golconda_Fort,TANISHK REDDY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Golconda lo Gola,Golconda is one of the iconic sites in Telengana state. I visited on a cool day and the views of Hyderabad hitech City was very good. It's a must visit place for all ages.
Golconda_Fort,Raman G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Can make a visit,"We visited the fort as part of our holiday to Hyderabad.  It is part of your sightseeing itinerary.  Managed by Archaeology Survey of India. We did not take a guide. ( as compared, for Agra fort you surely need a guide). It is mainly a walk in the grounds and a abt 300 step walk to the highest point in the fort open for tourists. As Senior Citizens,  we did  walk to the top. It is tiring. Did it at a slow pace. The main attraction is the view from the top."
Golconda_Fort,OctOriental,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-22,A feel of history,"Straightaway you get a feel of history of an old fort. It looks good as well, spanning a great distance from left to right. But do beware, there are several spots where the guards warn you not to venture into as some stone structures have loosened up and could collapse. Some people disregard the warnings. Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it. Do read it to get some first hand history."
Golconda_Fort,madhavi2022,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-22,Awesome Golconda,read up before you go - guides are scalpers. Reach early to dodge the heat and crowds! Mask up as poor social distancing
Golconda_Fort,Chandra J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Great views.  Take a guide for maximum  enjoyment ,Easy trek up hillside unless you have problems navigating stairs.  Great views of the city and of the whole area.  Helpful with a guide so you know what you're looking at
Golconda_Fort,casandeep,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-22,Fantastic Place....,If you are visiting Hyderabad this place you must visit. Though you will have to walk a lot but its worth to do so.  Taking a guide along is must if you really want to understand the rich history and the beautiful architecture. How things were visualized 500 years back is simply unbelievable.

Golconda_Fort,Michael M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-22,Amazing,"We were in Hyderabad for work but I was taken with colleagues to the Fort so I could see some of Hyderabad not just do work.The old (800+ years old) decorative carving showing the connection to what is now called Iran was incredible.There are several locations that have perfect acoustics - experiencing them is the only way to give it justice as words fail. For example there is a spot where if you clap you can hear an echo but walk two steps away from that spot and there is no echo. The age of the Fort is comparable to the early Norman kings of England - I had no idea that buildings like this existed in India that far back.There is a lot to see, and a lot to climb - depending on how adventurous you are you could climb to the top mosque.Alas there is a entry fee for Indians and a much higher fee for foreigners......"
Golconda_Fort,ullacarinquiterio,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-22,Golconda Fort,The fort was a nice experience but the biggest disappointment was that there is no  sound and light show as it is under repairs and no-one can tell when it will start again.

Golconda_Fort,jasno,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-22,"Rich history, hire a guide","Truly an impressive historical landmark.  Pretty substantial walking and uneven stairs, which adds to the authenticity but FYI for those that don't get around well.  HIGHLY recommend hiring a guide (~500-1,000 rupees for english speaking), there are really need sounds, echos, and histories that require some explanation."

Golconda_Fort,Michael P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,Fort towering above Hyderabad,"The fort covers an immense area although the outer walls have mostly disappeared now. Originally an 11th century temle was built at the top of the hill, Mahankali Temple. The history is fascinating as are the acoustical wonders. Unfortunately, as was the custom, the architects were executed after completing their work - so their secrets remain. It is well worht taking an official guide - 750 rupees for the shorter one hour tour or 1000 rupees for the longer tour - 2 hours in my case."

Golconda_Fort,Ardhanareeshvara,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Couples,Ancient Fort in a Modern City,"The Golkonda Fort looms over the modern city of Hyderabad in Telangana where it has stood since the 15thcentury. Built on a hill it is a fortified citadel which passed through several hands  before the Qutub Shahi dynasty was established.The nearby diamond mines produced the fabled Koh-I-Noor diamond now among the Crown Jewels in the U.K. with several other renowned ones.A massive granite fortification extends around 5km in circumference. The fort later fell into ruin and taken over by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century.The Fort continues to impress with its Victory Gate, Main Entrance Gate and the Durbar Hall and  the Baramati atop the hill. There is a Mosque of Ibrahim also there.The structure is in fairly good state of repair and the various tombs,Gardens, rooms and tanks are worthy of spending a 2-3 hours visit.The Golkonda Fort is popular with tourists and the local people alike. it is recommended that the tour is commenced as soon as the fort is open at 10 a.m. to beat the rush (esp at weekends) and the heat.There are plenty of photo opportunities so do not be in a rush."

It was a hot day and we had a tough time reaching the top but it was worth the effort. There is a cafeteria within the Fort premises.

Golconda_Fort,Talent P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,greatest architectural wonders,"even after almost 800 years, the fort still stands as one of Hyderabad’s greatest architectural wonders.

This was said to be used for warning the royals in the case of an attack."
Golconda_Fort,Sardev2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Impressive historical site,If you can cope with traffic then definitely worth a visit to GF. Best done during the day.

Access is very limited as getting to the fort requires access thru old narrow gate which in Hyderabad means crazy traffic queues. Worth it.

Golconda_Fort,The Route Edit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Visit the fort skip the light and sound show,"This was my second visit to the fort. Last time we visited we didn't have time for the light and sound show so this time I made it a point to stay back for it. The fort itself is very beautiful provided you like historical places or else it would seem brick and mortar debri. Take a registered guide and remember to bargain for the rate coz without a guide it might seem boring. The view from the top is worth the climb and do check the amazing architectural acoustics of the fort. Coming to the light and sound show, I would suggest you give it a miss. They give you a complimentary odomos tube with the tickets so you can imagine the amount of mosquitoes you are about to face during the show. You will be so busy battling mosquitoes that the real battle stories wouldn't seem that interesting. I sat there and dozed off for a major part of the show. I like history and have watched lots of light and sound shows but I guess this experience wasn't that great for me. "

In the evening they have a light show showcasing the life of the nawab and his fort. There are 2 shows one in hindi and English. So if visiting this fort make it by evening so that you can watch the light show. It's enjoyable

Golconda_Fort,Jimmycontra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Golconda Fort,"The Golconda fort is a real marvel of a fort as it has been built with scientific knowledge which in those days was not well known. When you first enter the gate, you go across stone pavings which give large echoes which can be heard right throughout the fort. Then the far at where the king would sit n you could never hit him. Then the air conditioner in the king’s bedchamber or the whispering wall. I would advise you to take a guide at the gates of the door , who would explain all the finest details n history of the fort, without it it’s just a ruined fort. Long walk upto the top but well worth it. In the evening there is a sound n light show, but do see the fort in the daylight to get the best of this beautiful fort."
Golconda_Fort,Akillchowdary,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Monuments and historical places,"Golconda Fort is one of the major tourist attractions in Hyderabad. I shifted from Delhi to Hyderabad in the last quarter of 2009 and visited several tourist attractions with my family thereafter. However we could visit Golconda (or Golkunda) Fort on 26.01.2011 only. We visited in the morning hours and enjoyed a lot from around 10 a.m. to the afternoon time before returning back to our home at B.H.E.L. colony (near Lingampalli). On 13.01.2013, we visited there for the second time, this time during the late evening hours and watched the Light and Sound Show. On both the occasions, the experiences of myself were simply mesmerizing. After the second visit, my daughter urged me to pen a review on Golconda. So, here comes the review.Golconda Fort is easily accessible from any point of Hyderabad city. It’s situated at around 18 kilometres from my residence, around 8 kilometres from the Secunderabad railway station and around 13 kilometres from the famous Chaar Minaar. Since I visited it during both the main timings, i.e., the morning time and the evening time, I enjoyed the outing in two different ways. The morning and the day time is quite useful in enjoying the geography of the fort containing 9 doors, the lengthy and high walls, the cave-like basement, the ammunition store, the various mosques, the graves, the Madanna Mandir, the Nagina Baagh, the residences of the erstwhile queens and the princesses and also the Bala Hisar which might have witnessed several conferences and seminars. The fort has three lines of influential fortification walls, one within another. The thickness of the very strong outer boundary well varies from 5 to 10 metres.From the height (Petla Burj), if you cast your eye from any ventilator, not only you will be able to enjoy cool breeze (until and unless, it is a damn hot day) but also have a bird’s eye-view of the city of the Hyderabad. Hyderabad appears to be like a beautiful painting from that height. If the wind is stormy, it may scare someone and it may also touch the soul of a sensitive person like me.Originally built by the Kaakatiyas of Waarangal and developed by Mohammad Shaah and Qutub Shaah, this fort is spread in 8 square kilometres. However for a tourist, it’s not feasible to roam about the whole area covered by the fort. So, just enjoy the practically walkable and climbable distance. Despite the affect of the passage of time being visible on it, the grandeur of the fort and the time when it was a symbol of glory can be felt quite easily. The famous diamond Kohinoor is said to be mined and preserved here only before it got looted and sent out of India.On a pleasant weather day, the visit to the fort can be enjoyed like a picnic too. The whole procedure of entering the fort by purchasing entry tickets and thereafter roaming inside is simple. I found the employees working there as customer-friendly and cooperative. During our second visit, after the Light and Sound Show, my wife and daughter forgot their purse and camera on their seats but upon coming to know of it, when we rushed there back, we got both the purse (containing money, driving license etc.) and the camera because the security people had preserved them and they returned them to us without a fuss.Eatables can be bought from the shops inside the fort and there is a cafeteria also at the top. Outside the fort, there are restaurants aplenty which can be approached for breakfast / lunch / dinner either before entering the fort or after coming out of it, depending upon your own programme. Beautiful pictures of the are also sold there which can be kept as memento. As far as wandering inside the fort is concerned, let me say that the whole fort is beautiful and it’s a pleasure to see different parts of it carrying different significance of their own. The thing, in my opinion, required to enjoy it to the full is your imagination power to visualize that period and those people. Even it is not-so-good, never mind. The Light and Sound Show in the evening (in both English and Hindi) is there to help it.I found the Light and Sound Show as the best attraction of the fort. Though I have seen the Light and Sound Show in the Red Fort of Delhi too, this Light and Sound Show, taking us back into the bygone era, proved to be an altogether different experience for me. Not only the dialogs and different relevant sounds impressed me and made me feel like watching a good historical movie; but above all,  the pieces of music and songs inserted in the narrative depicting the love (male-female) of the characters that existed in that time effortlessly won my heart. Any music lover will be just too happy to witness this programme.The charges for entering tickets as well as for the Light and Sound Show appeared reasonable to me. We enjoyed the show in ordinary class, however there’s an executive class too with separate seating arrangement. Perhaps that place gives a better sight of the light switching from place to place (in the fort) during the show. I have come to know that there is concession in ticket rates for the school troupes.I have not given the minute details of the fort as well as its history which must be available on the internet. I just say that Golconda Fort is one of the best places to visit in Hyderabad. I have visited Chaar Minaar on one hand and Ramoji Film City on the other and I frankly admit that my visits to Golconda Fort have been the most satisfying ones. This mighty fort is the pride of Deccan. Once the centre of the Bahmani Kingdom as well as the centre of the diamond-trade, this grandiose fort gives you a call. Whenever you make a trip to Hyderabad, please don’t miss visiting it."

Golconda_Fort,Sunder S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,Disappointing!,"This was a huge let-down. The fort is a crumbling ruin, poorly maintained. All that has been done is to create a lawn-like space in the front. The rest of the fort is left as it is - overgrown weeds/plants, run-down look, and a general sense of decay. This could have been developed into something worthwhile - a pity! India has too many of these forts for us to bother about maintenance. Perhaps if the ASI could hand over these monuments to the local state government it would be better off.The tour guides simply try to rip you off - they start with a price of Rs. 1200, and what you pay is your skill to negotiate. We paid Rs. 800 for the long tour. Why can't the ASI also publish the tour guide prices like they do in other places?"

The fort is huge and it’s awe inspiring that such a beautiful construction was made in times where there were no machines and nothing to help people make the fort. The sunsets at Golconda Fort are ravishing. Will recommend going here if you have come to Hyderabad. 
Golconda_Fort,Ken W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,Sound and light show,"We came in the evening to watch the sound and light show.  It’s about a 4 hundred metre walk from the entrance to where the seats are located.There are 2 sets of seats...vip on a raised area up some steps, and ordinary at ground level.  To be honest, I think the view was probably as good from the non-vip seats.  Bottom line, there’s not a lot of difference.They do give out tubes of insect repellent, but we had applied our own spray before arriving.  There are plenty of mosquitoes, but we weren’t bitten.The sound and light show was ok, but there were many songs and poems included  in the performance, which meant that the whole thing dragged on quite a bit.  We’d previously been to a similar show in Jaipur and Udaipur which were superior.  However, if we hadn’t been to the other shows, we probably would’ve enjoyed this one more.Overall, it was worth going but we won’t return."

The weather was not bad in late January. There was a lot to see and do I even stumbled upon an indoor area that had a swarm of bats that was very cool to discover. The entrance fee was nominal and I think it was totally worth it a good way to spend a few hours and an interesting thing to see in Hyderabad."

Hyderabad.....at birla.maindir.......No cameras are allowed here.......Located near lakadi ka pull metro station.......  Beautiful place......Birla Mandir is near to Lakdi-ka-pul and Assembly Hyderabad metro station. Birla Mandir is well connected by TSRTC buses and MMTS. The nearest MMTS station is Lakdi ka pul. Bus No: 5K,5S,5 From Secunderabad to Mehdipatnam any bus no. 113 from Uppal to Mehdipatnam.Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple, built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The construction took 10 years and was opened in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all of which are known as Birla Mandir....The temple manifests a blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani and Utkala architectures. It is constructed of 2000 tons of pure white marble. The granite idol of presiding deity Lord Venkateswara is about 11 ft (3.4 m) tall and a carved lotus forms an umbrella on the top. There is a brass flagstaff in the temple premises which rises to a height of 42 ft (13 m). The temple does not have traditional bells, as Swami Ranganathananda wished that the temple atmosphere should be conducive for meditation.Apart from the main shrine, the consorts of Lord Venkateswara, Padmavati and Andal are housed in separate shrines. The temple also has separate shrines for various Deva and Devi including Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh, Hanuman, Brahma, Saraswati and Lakshmi. Selected because teachings of men and Gurbani are engraved on temple walls. Birla temples are open to all, as identified by Mahatma Gandhi and other Hindu leaders."

This will lead to traffic chokes. Either go @ 7 am or if you go later, alight and walk to avoid delays. All vehicles ( specially cars) cannot turnabout until the temple gate and hence you will always have a backed up traffic to challenge. once you get into the temple , you have to deposit your mobile/ electronics and footwear into its respective lockers/ spaces. The mobile locker line will delay you further if you don’t go early morning. After this, the pristine beauty of the granite hill top temple will captivate you no bounds. The temple main deity is Venkateswara and you have the related gods and goddesses en route. The view from top, of the necklace road and Hussain Sagar is breathtaking."

Other than this, there is a small clock tower which is supposed to be the showstopper. Every hour, a miniature soldier comes out of the clock tower and rings the Gong. This was a big disappointment for me and feel it is overhyped. Other than these, the museum has a wide range of artefacts and collection that depicts the ancient history of the city."

To fully enjoy the exhibits, you need to plan at least six visits, spending three to four hours every time. This is exactly what we did. We will be sharing with you the key highlights from each visit. There is an excellent cafeteria on ground floor where you can get lunch and snacks. A smaller cafeteria exists on first floor of Western Wing too.Cameras are allowed and photography fee is mere Rs. 50. Mobiles are allowed only on payment of Rs.50 and you can take pics with your mobile. There is also excellent locker service where for a token fee of Rs.10 you can deposit your stuff. Entrance tickets for domestic tourists is Rs.10.The highlight of museum is Bracket clock. There is huge crowd at 12 noon. So, avoid and go early to reach museum at 10.30 when it opens. Spend some time admiring the veiled Rebecca and marble sculptures in galler-7. Then come out of gallery and sit in the viewing gallery at 10.50 am to have a good view of the bracket clock. Enjoy the 11 am performance. After this you can visit Ivory gallery (Room 6), Walking sticks gallery (Room 8), Arms and Armor gallery (Room 9), Metal ware gallery (Room 10), Indian Modern paintings gallery (Room 11) and Miniature paintings gallery (Room-12).By now you will be completely exhausted.

Salar_Jung_Museum,Christopher F,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2021 • Solo,Very Disappointed,"Reading reviews and descriptions of this museum made it sound very interesting. This museum is made up of one man’s collection allegedly the largest collection making it up a single Museum.  I do realize that museums in India are not up to par with like museums in the western world but the descriptions I read made it sound as if this museum could stand with some of the best museums in the world, it does not. The items in the museum vary greatly from western art, Asian arts, two some interesting archaeological pieces from the Indus Valley. That being said there really are no exquisite pieces that you must see most of the collection was dated from The 18th and 19th centuries AD, not very old pieces. So all in all the collection was not very impressive, at least to me.￼ The actual museum building was also a let down. Some rooms were totally stripped of all the cabinets but were left open, everything needed to be painted, and there were big empty rooms with dirty furniture laid out in no special way.￼ Because this was the first day after reopening due to Covid I can understand why the food court was 90% empty but it look like the gift shop has been closed for a very long time so there was no place to buy souvenirs. I was very much let down by this museum nor would I recommend it to friends or family. But as most everywhere else in India the people, the staff are great￼ and I really appreciate their hospitality."

Salar_Jung_Museum,Jimmycontra,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Salarjang museum,"We had gone to see Salar Jang museum as we had so much about it. I had been to see it in my youth, when it was in its original palace. This time it was a big let down, whole sections were closed , the reason given was the museum was being renovated. But the inside story is that a lot of good items have been stolen or sold off. There is less than half of the original items collected over a lifetime. There is still a few items worth seeing. Some of the marble statues, especially the lady in a veil n the double sided statue, the best in the world. The mechanical clock which was kept along with several others is now kept in an auditorium like room n on the day we went the room was filled with school children all shouting n chatting loudly n fooling around so you could not see the clock or hear it well at midday. Overall if you have not seen it, it’s worth seeing. It’s value for money. But if this is your second visit you are likely to be disappointed."

Salar_Jung_Museum,JeffCarter,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Very large ,"I am not a big fan of museums and when I travel we rarely stop to visit them, but local people highly suggested I pay a visit to this museum so I did I was told to allocate about 90 minutes at least and that was probably just enough time there are endless rooms across two or three levels with massive amounts of art to view it was almost too much to take in some of the stuff was just amazing. You could wander from room to room for days. Very incredible and definitely worth see there’s a lot here and if something is an interesting you just skip that room or skip that level and they’ll be something else around the corner. There was a large film presentation going on but I missed it so I’m not sure what it was and there were lots of school kids attending as well. If you are into museums you might need even more than 90 minutes. Definitely worth a visit I would recommend it. There did not seem to be much air conditioning and I went in January a cool time of year I could imagine during the high summer it might be a little uncomfortable with the heat."

But despite all these things, it is a must see attraction in Hyderabad where one could know how Arab people could could come to India and establish an Empire. The museum throws light on the high standard of living maintained by the Salar Jung's and their interminglings with the British. Yes, they're highly englishied. The museum is situated in an imposing building and at the entrance is a fire fighter unit used at that time which is peculiar in design. Inside on the ground floor are the exhibition of high valued furnitures, embroidered clothes, utensils used by the Salar Jungs - Salar Jung is a title. Items made of ivory exhibited there is    worth seeing - from chairs, tables to ornaments to show pieces to walking sticks to knives, all are praise worthy.

Salar_Jung_Museum,Ravindra A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-19,A 'Disneyland' for history lovers,"If you visiting Hyderabad, keep aside 3 to 4 hours atleast to visit this place. At the onset you will be mildly disappointed by the lack of proper info on many impressive exhibits, swells of random visitors who show scant regard for pieces of rich history of our own land, below average display design & poor lighting that takes away a lot from the mind boggling collection. But you will gradually get sucked into the 'time machine', transporting you to an era when being royalty meant some other worldly wealth & influence. Marvel at the uncut diamond studded swords, rare miniature paintings, exquisitely detailed clay toys & cringe at the jaw dropping quantum of Ivory artifacts on display. The marble sculpture collection is amazing. There are even jade & crystal back-scratchers will make you wish you had an itch that expensive :)  Please dont waste your time waiting for that mechanical clock in the central courtyard on the ground floor to strike on the hour. Its just a human figure walk out & walk back into the clock at the strike of the hour. Nothing more. Get an audio-guide device for yourself which is available inside the building at the counter right after your tickets are checked & security. Camera phones need to have a separate ticket purchased incase you want to click photos of the exhibits. A love for history, strong legs & half a day is what you need to visit this. Its well worth the effort."

One must book in advance, with 50% advance payment for dining. There are 2 main restaurants, Ada (Indian) and Celeste (Italian). A one hour tour of the palace is conducted by the staff of the hotel, explaining the history of the palace and all the rooms in the palace. No doubt the dinner is expensive (almost Rs 7000 per person including taxes for a 4 course menu), but its worth it, along with the tour that you get. Its a memory that you will cherish forever. The staff in Ada, where we had dinner was excellent, courteous and helpful. They go out of the way to make sure you are comfortable.

You definitely get the royal treatment from horse carriage rides to floral showers to impressive cutlery. We had lunch at Adda which was a set menu buffet. The kebabs were simply out of the world. The rest of the spread was also good, but kebabs were the highlights according to me. Post lunch we took the palace tour which was good but I dare say falls a bit short if you compare with similar palace tours in Rajasthan.Overall definitely a very good experience. If you are going on your own, be prepared to shell out a sizeable amount. It is one of the most expensive place to go in Hyderabad. Also remember to book in advance"

If you are lucky you might even get a glimpse of some movie shooting from distace. Food is definitely good. Chef took care of my request for pregnancy friendly food. The food did taste good.

And choose the dining place as ""Gol Bunglow"".....ideal would be on the Diwali day.....with a pleasant evening weather....and Qawalli Singers on the go...takes you away out of this world.  You don't even feel that you are having a 5 or 7 course meal as it only melts the way the ears lilted with the music. And as you savour....just glance the dark sky that is fully lit up with the Diwali fire crackers colours.  Oooo.....what to say more.....you get to see a 120 degree view of the old city of the Nawabs.  It's a once in a life time experience for a common man like me....and a destination default for the who's who of the country."

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Vagish Dixit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,A Palace which retains its aura,Conceded that this is not a specially abled friendly place with no ramps and lifts in sight. But this is an old palace with the zillion steps from floor 0 to floor 1 and of course a horse carriage ride from main entrance to porch. Every room smells of history in its lush and princely aura. Service is genuinely reflective of the period and food is to die for. Overall this place is amazing and is a bucket list item for anyone visiting Hyderabad. 
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Indusman248,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-19,High Tea on Christmas Day with Spouse,Great arrival experience on a Royal Horse Cart (Bagi) from the Palace entrance gate to the main porch - this was coupled with Rose petal shower as a romantic welcome to the Palace. The palace tour takes about an hour and our Tour Guide was using plenty of Urdu couplets during the tour which made the entire experience interesting. There is a souvenir shop in the palace which needs an improvement from collection and its pricing perspective (collection is not that great and pricing is on the higher side).Recommended not to take lunch before the High Tea as the choice is huge and one does not need to eat dinner post the High Tea. Price does not justify the overall experience - needs correction as found on the higher side.This Palace is being managed by Taj Hotels and it was found that it is difficult to get connected with the associates of the Palace for booking.

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Avinash Reddy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Amazing....!!,Stunning historic Palace property. Parts of the palace are modeled on Windsor Castle and the billiards table is identical to the one at Buckingham palace. This was once the home of the richest man in the world. The hotel has retained all the original features of the palace. My only suggestion is that the Taj group address the issue of pigeons damaging the structure. Installing transparent fishing wire along the ledges is a simple trick that would stop the birds from landing.

However, right from picking us from the main entrance in the Tah Group Buggy/Golf cart till the High Tea, it was amazing. It is worth to mention the palace guide with an excellent sense of Poetry ( shayeri) . Zade room was awesome, one will remember the bathtub fitted in the queen's ( Begum?) bathroom  and off course the 100 seater dining table.

It make you feel in diffrent world altogether due to it's ambiance and quality of services and for every thing including food & I will simply say  a world where dreams are fulfilled, right from the moment you descend from your horse-drawn carriage. This magnificent mansion conceived by the Nizam of Hyderabad. We can have  an authentic treatment at  Jiva Grande Spa,over all I suggest this to enjoy for short visit.However,charges for food and services are good but need to be improved and re-looked.there are so many other places as well whether good quality food are available at comparatively cheaper rates and having Hyderabady flavor."

The Taj group has done a great job of maintaining the palace and grounds in a very discreet manner. It’s all about the Nawabi splendour and lifestyle. The staff is very polite and knowledgeable. The walking tour is well done and flows well as one ascends the beautiful stairs up to the library, the queens quarters, the dining hall, the jade room and so on. The grounds have a magical look in the evening and the scents of jasmine combine to enthral you. After the tour you can carry on to the restaurant for your dinner. Again a sumptuous spread.

They went absolutely out of their way to accommodate our every wish. From special-order butter chicken at every meal and a child-sized bathrobe for my little cousin, to remembering just how my father-in-law takes his tea and what kind of roti he prefers, they really aim to please.The accommodations themselves are luxurious- our room was palatial and comfortable with fast wi fi. The courtyard is tranquil and inviting, and the incredible palace speaks for itself.The entertainment is superb, from the very talented live music offered daily both in the morning and evening, to the high tea program, to the lovely pool, to the billiards hall for a nightcap. One of the attendants in the billiards hall even took the time to try to teach us to play (we were hopeless!).The spa is lovely. My husband and I both agreed it was one of the best massages we’ve had.And the food! The breakfast spread has everything from South Indian staples to European Continental and everything in between. Dinner was scrumptious each evening, and the service absolutely could not be beat (special shout out to Hema Santosh, who took excellent care of us).In all, the hotel is an absolutely lovely and peaceful retreat, and you will feel and be treated as royalty during your stay. Don’t think twice and just treat yourself! "

Our suite was just what we wanted.  The staff was brilliant. We took a spa and Rima and Pizzo were outstanding. I have had a lot of treatments at various hotels and Rima was simply one of the best. They were so good that we had to take a massage the next day also. We had dinner at Gol Bungalow. The ambience and the food was very good. The Hyderabad cuisine was authentic.  I wish they would take care of their service. The staff was courteous when they came to you. No one came and asked if we want a second drink. We had to signal a waiter. Our second drink came in 35 minutes. The assistant restaurant manager was helpful and gave great suggestions. We asked for food in 15 minutes but it came in 35 minutes. It did not matter as my wife and I were enjoying ourselves. No one to fill water glass. When the bottle finished no one came to refill. We got the dessert before the finger bowl. To top it all in the end the waiter came and said sorry for the delayed service as he was busy with the other table.  My wife and I had decided to have a good time so these points did not really dampen my evening, but come on is this The Falaknuma Palace we are talking about. Overall a great trip and would be back again but would never have dinner here."

And the Taj people have done a spectacular job renovating it. Apparently, it took twice as long to restore it than it took originally to build it. Of course, you could stay in one of the splendid rooms but they are priced for their splendor. alternatively, you can book a dinner and get a complementary tour of the main parts of the palace and the gardens. Starry evenings give you a great view of the entire city of Hyderabad below your feet and out in the distance. The dinner is not cheap, but it will fill you with wonder (the tour and the place, if not the meal); it is worth it. And the staff is exceptionally well trained and very proud of the unique palace they have been entrusted to serve. "

In fact, it is beyond the scope of definition.  It is a true blue royal tryst with grandeur and aesthetics. I spent two days here and it was an experience of lifetime, always to be reme6and cherished for. The early morning breakfasts at Gol Bungalow which has a breathtaking view of the entire Falaknuma and old city area of Hyderabad is stunning. We enjoyed our delicious breakfasts here and I loved the typical Fakaknuma style mutton Kheema. We were treated with evening Palace tours which gives an insight into the royal legacy and history behind the rich heritage. The evening Qawali was soulful and the yummy evening desserts in our rooms were aamazing. I also took the Attar/Ittar Bath, which is an in room bath had the fragrances from the Nizam era with rose petals. It was indeed a great thing.The hotel staff was great in hospitality. We were treated with utmost care and every aspect of service was amazing.  The best part was the royal grand welcome as we arrived and were showered with rose petals. In all, one must definitely experience the grandness of this great luxury hotel. We went back home with treasured moments in our hearts and amazing souvenirs from the hotel."

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,krishna292,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,Great Tourist Attraction with HighTea But at an Unreasonable Cost Not Worth,"During recent visit of my grandson, a student of Harward we planned to visit a different, out of blue place and chose Taj Falaknuma, a Heritage hotel of Hyderabad. The booking was done online and the package consisted of a guided tour of Palace with HighTea at about 3500/- rupees per head (nearly $60.00) excluding 18% taxes. There are number of tours at different times, High Tea, dinner, lunch etc and even the State tourism department also arranges these tours almost at the same charges only on weekdays but ours was a weekend tour. We were four people, took a cab that dropped us at the main gate from where battery operated vehicles take the visitors to the palace entrance. The main attraction is a bird'd view of Hyderabad as the palace is situated on a hillock. It has a well manicured garden and an imposing structure through stairs to reach the main lobby. On the way to palace we saw several peacocks and other structures, all white painted, probably rooms for the guests. The guided tour started at about 3 PM and our guide explained history of palace, background of paintings adoring the walls and roof, galleries, furniture etc, We were also taken to the main dining hall which accommodates 100 persons, one of the biggest halls in the world. The whole place looks beautiful but one shudders to think that all that opulence and expenditure was at the cost of poor people. Why the money was not used to eradicate poverty and hunger by these kings and nawabs. After an hour tour we went to the restaurant, known as Gol Bunglaw, There were several types of cakes, cookies, pastries, choices of soft and hot drinks and snacks, all served in a royal fashion with excellent service. My total bill came to be nearly 16000/-rupess, which is equivalent to about 250 dollars. It is not worth. If one has visited Salarjung Museum and Chowmoholla Palace, where all these items are dispalyed, one need not waste money here. I do not recommend this tour to Indian visitors unless they have money to waste. Of course foreign visitors, if they are staying in a hotel, minimum charges are 600 dollars per day, they can very well see the whole palace."

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,LordAdvisor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Business,Experience Royalty,"We visited the Taj Falaknuma in June 2019. The palace by today's standards may not seem grand and royal, however, if you take yourself back in time when it was built and look at it from that era, you may be able to appreciate its grandeur. The stories that the guide tells you about this Nizam and the making of the palace gives you an idea of the money that was splurged in making of the palace and the lifestyle that they lived at that point in time.We had dinner at Adaa restaurant and my experience here was not good. The level of service was way lower than what I am used to at Taj properties. It was definitely below standard.I would yet like to try out the restaurant once more as I believe in Taj quality of service and my this experience could have been a one-offI recommend Taj Falaknuma especially to foreign tourist visiting India."

Really !!! Peanut sauce with biriyani rice - I don’t think soThe breakfast buffet was also ordinary and many dishes served luke warm - not good enough this time around
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Amit1965,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-19,FALAKNUMA PALACE-Hyderabad,"This is an Awesome Heritage Palace of Nizam Era , its so Royal , Grand and Opulent . The Falaknuma word is FALAK-NUMA which comes from Urdu Language which means- "" Like the Sky "" or "" Mirror of the Sky"".This was the Royal residence of Nizam Mehboob Ali Khan Bahadur . Actually it was a Dream Palace of Nawab Vikar-ul- Umra around 130 years ago, it took 9 years to get it completed as it's foundation was laid in 1884 and it was completed in 1893, it is spread over 32 acres and is on a 2000ft high hill top from where you have a spectacular view of the city.It was taken over and opened by TAJ HOTELS & PALACES in Nov. 2010 as it was in poor condition in 1950's.Its architecture is very intriguing as its not Mughal or Islamic one but it is Italian and Tudor style as Nawab Vikar had travelled around many countries, he wanted it to be something exotic and exquisite.Its a MUST Visit on anyone's itinerary for Hyderabad."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Srinivas Yalamarthy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Absolute feeling of Grandeur... Truly Majestic,"Wow is the only word you will utter the moment you step in to the palace. Private vehicles are not allowed in to the palace and they will transport you on their buggy to the from the entrance to the main palace. They will only allow you provided you make prior reservation. Any amount of interiors in new hotels can compete with the luxury and decor of this palace. For a moment you would have a envy feeling that how grandly those nawabs would have lived in this palace. You get to see the Nawab's room and his attached bathroom with those vintage original fittings, which are nostalgic. The best part of the palace is the walk ways and the huge open air balcony with an amazing panaramic view is just stunning.. literally you can see the whole city as it is in a very elevated place. The food part is jus about to be ok nothing to rave about. The experience will be a life time. You must insist any of the staff to give a tour to the palace which was a great tourist  attraction long back with a dining table which can seat beyond 100 persons at a time.

Charminar,Saurabh M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,The Grandeur that lines in the heart of Hyderabad......,"Exploring Telangana....... Hyderabad......at Chairminar........Best way to reach is get down at  MGBS metro station and take bus or auto..... Or directly auto from anywhere....An identifying feature of the city, Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar.Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar has been synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era. It is a massive structure which has four minarets which many believe stand for the first four 'khalifas' (Prophets) of Islam. Towards the north of the monument, there are four gateways known as Char Kaman which have been constructed in the cardinal directions. The structure was intended to serve as a Madrasa or a Mosque. In its present form, Charminar, has been added to the 'tentative list' of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.The structure of Charminar is an exquisite example of Indo-Islamic architecture with Persian influences. The arches and domes of the monument define the influence of Islamic architecture, while the Persian influence is prominent from its minarets. The balconies and the outside walls, embellished with delicate stucco floral ornamentations on the ceiling, showcases the influence of the Hindu style of architecture.At the base of the Charminar is a small temple called as ""Bhagyalakshmi Temple""....The Charminar was built to commemorate the decision and eradication of plague from the city. It is known as Charminar as it is supported by four minarets on four sides which were possibly meant to commemorate the first four caliphs of Islam. The old city of Hyderabad was designed keeping Charminar as the centre of the city. According to some legends, Quli Qutub Shahi saw his beloved wife, Baghmati, at this very site. He built Charminar as a symbol of his eternal love for his wife. There is also a legend that talks about the existence of a secret tunnel under the Charminar that connects it to the Golkonda Fort. It was created as a means of escape for the royal family in the time of emergencies.Charminar is famous for many things but is most known for the lip smacking dishes and great bargain shopping. There is no better place for shopping in Hyderabad than the area surrounding the Charminar. The streets are brimming with people at all times, with the shops displaying attractive and colourful bangles and jewellery. It is popular for bangles, pearls, jewellery, semi-precious stones, silverware, Kalamkari paintings, sarees, silk materials, gold embroidered fabric, lacquer bangles, ittar and the traditional Khara dupatta. This street is filled with people and haggling is part and parcel of this market....."

Charminar,Raman G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,A crowded place. To visit only because it is popular ,Went in the afternoon.  We walked in 5 minutes to this place  from Chowmullah Palace. A visit only because it is popular. And has been advertised a lot. The area around is dirty and crowded with hawkers. The latter keep pestering.  The segregated area around it has hawker stalls which is a pain for a tourist. It could have been developed beautifully.  One is allowed to climb up to the first floor. We did not do so.
Charminar,OctOriental,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-22,A good draw but horribly congested,"Touted as a hallmark of Hyderabad. But it's a risky, unenjoyable and terribly congested place with a million or so hawkers cluttering up the place and rendering it unworthy of your time and effort. The least the administration could have done is clear up the central area at least to afford a good view of the Charminar."

There’s so many market sellers although none are too pushy, live performances and a generally friendly vibe. The history is great, so many good photo opportunities and a real insight into the local culture. Highly recommended!"

You have to get to the top, take a breather, and go down through a similar staircase. We went there and my mom almost fainted. If you're claustrophobic, DO NOT take a chance here.

Charminar,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Beautiful architecture,Charminar is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Hyderabad and we had visited the same during our sightseeing in Hyderabad. The place is very crowded with small vendors occupying the entire road outside the beautiful heritage structure. We enjoyed biscuits and tea at the nearby Nimrah Cafe and enjoyed the beauty of the Charminar right in front of us. One can go inside the Charminar up to a certain height and we saw many locals standing inside the Charminar.

Charminar,Greg48,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,Icon of Hyderabad,I first heard of the Charminar years ago by way of a cigarette brand which featured the structure on its packages.The iconic symbol of Hyderabad dates back to the 1500's and is an interesting structure with 4 Minarets and 4 arches. The area surrounding it is a busy street and jewelry market. You can find inexpensive bangles (bracelets) as well as very low priced 'pearls' which would make a cute item for young girls. There are also a number of Pearl Shops supposedly selling the gem that the city is famed for. Not being knowledgeable about jewelry I stayed with the costume jewelry and found the market to be enjoyable.

It was perfect timing. No traffic, no crowds, no bustle in the adjoining markets... Basically, it was easy to get in and out. I've been here three times before and as always, the Charminar was under repairs, this time around too. There was a scaffold around three sides of the monument. So a good selfie wasn't possible. However, it felt good to walk around it and have an Irani tea and a wedge of Dilkhush (bread stuffed with dried fruits) as an early breakfast from one of the many tea shops in the area. I hung around for less than an hour before heading over to my next destination. "

It was not pricey to get in, and the climb was not bad. The spiral stairs were no worse than cathedral tower climbs in Europe. Beautiful views and the crowds were friendly. I assume pick pocketing might be an issue but i was careful to not bring anything but my camera and very small shoulder pack.

I don't believe in such foolish beliefs without hard work. At the same time believe in God and pray regularly.But my suggestion is nothing comes free without hard work and effort. But belief in God may help you put your best efforts and and the efforts get fulfilled with God's blessings.OK. Let me tell you about the temple. The temple is very small. I so you must go early in the morning. How early you start and reach Chilukuru, you will still find devotees offering pradakshinas. It's over crowded with believers. So start as early as possible.For the first time when you visit you offer 9 or 11 pradakshinas and wish for your highest goal in the presence of God. Once your wishes come true you will have to visit the temple again and finish 108 Pradakshinas. 🙏* But one thing I found here its very difficult to finish 108 Pradakshinas in a single day for most of the people because of the crowd and conjusted temple. You need not worry about this because you can finish the remaining Pradakshinas in multiple attempts.* One more best thing that I found was that here is that you will not find find Hundi and Pujaris also don't take money from the devotees. That's really great.Overall as a strong believer of God I would say there is some special power that helps you fulfill all your genuine wishes by praying regularly."

Hyderabad.....at Zoo....Located at a distance of 16 km from Hyderabad, Nehru Zoological Park was opened to the public in the year of 1963. It is situated near the historically important Mir Alam Tank, which is 200 year old and is the first multi-arch masonry dam in the world. Nehru Zoological Park is one of the largest zoos of India . Run by the Forest department, Government of Telangana, the zoo has been named after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country........What makes Hyderabad zoo an amiable place for both visitors and inhabitants are the open enclosures in which animals are kept. These open enclosures have been created to resemble the natural habitats. A wide variety of exotic animals have been successfully bred in this zoo park as well.There is electric car which is very helpful......"

Outside the main gate it is a bit too chaotic and noisy and dusty with broken roads but that's Hyderabad. The zoo could have done with more logical signposts to different enclosures so that we don't miss a single creature. The safari rides last 15 minutes but give you a good look at lions, tigers, bisons. Lots of schoolkids on their school-organised visits lend to the nice feel of the place. Most commonly known wild animals are here. Must visit."

It's best to go early (at 8:30-9am) when the animals are up and about as they tend to retire for the afternoon.Specially enjoyed the nocturnal animal den and snake pits. TPro tip: if you want to enjoy the Safari, take the hop-on/hop-off tickets and get down at the Safari stop (3rd stop after the elephant stop), as it is a LONG walk and difficult to get back to, especially with children. The toy train was also pleasant and enjoyable."

Found that the safaris as well as the Reptile House and Nocturnal Animal house are closed. Got disappointed a bit.They have a cheetah exhibit, a large deer and emu exhibit, and a large elephant exhibit. Other animals worth note are lion, tiger, white tiger, wolf, fox, jackal, gaur, hippo, rhino, ostrich, two types of bear, giraffe, sambar, blackbuck, white deer and crocodiles. There are some walk in aviaries, but entry now restricted due to Covid situation. Did not see any large apes, but seen a few small monkeys. All animals are kept in natural settings, though sometimes a little small.There are battery cars which are hop-on hop-off types, excellent to traverse the zoo, though still it takes much walking. The toy train starts only after a minimum number of passengers. It is possible to walk the entire length, there is a major circular path and small inner walkways.There is a refundable Rs. 10 per bottle  deposit to take plastic bottles inside."

Have 3-4 water bottles during your visit. By the time we visited, safari ride was not there, which would take you inside the forest with freely roaming animals. Worth to go if you are going as a family with children as they would enjoy the park and the animals. For a gang of friends, you would start feeling devastated by this visit."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,wjw2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,"Very spacious grounds, plenty of walking!","Once you get past the 'no plastics' security patrol, who will confiscate any plastic bags or make you get your water bottle stamped for a 10 Rs deposit, you're free to enter this zoo (tickets cost 50 Rs)...and WHAT a huge zoo it is! There are not a massive amount of animals but the ones that are there looked to be in a reasonable condition and had food and water, though the cages for the birds didn't have any greenery in them which was sad. For those who don't like walking too much, there are various transport options like a train and some small golf cart trailers who'll take you around  for a small charge. Also, halfway round the zoo there's a bus that you can board, for an extra 50 Rs, to take you on a mini 'safari' where you can see lions, a tiger and some bears. I was saddened to see them in cages though....the area of the safari would be big enough for them to roam free, but they've been contained in featureless enclosures which is sad. Outside of this, there's a lot of imagination shown, with tunnels and fossil parks and all sorts. It does make for a good day out, but there could be some improvement with more seating and some restaurants and water points. Overall, pretty good, though a bit more foliage in the bird cages would be kinder for them, plus more staff presence to stop people whistling and harassing the animals is definitely needed."

I have seen high standards of zoos and safaris in Singapore, London and Bangkok and super pathetic standards of Indian zoos like jaipur, ahmedabad and crowning glory of patheticism.. Mumbai zoo where animals are caged in small iron boxes. Compared to all these... I found Hyderabad zoo much much better. It's spacious, animals looked fresh and relatively happy... They have been tried to be given their natural habitat. As with all Indian zoos... It's super cheap with ticket under 100 Rs. Golf cart tickets are extra but it's OK. It's a good service that they have provided. Please buy a ticket for golf cart if you don't want to walk too much as space is humongous. Frequency of golf carts were reasonable. I especially liked the enclosures for elephants.. They have been given huge space. I didn't try the safari bus so won't be able to comment on it but I have seen this facility only in Hyderabad zoo of all Indian zoos. Ice cream, cool drinks and some snacks are available inside the zoo but no proper restaurent. All in all i'd recommend going to this place if you like going to zoos and watching animals like Rhinos and Giraffe."

There is a train which you can take which will leave you at drop points to explore the place. There are a lot of birds including hens.But overall we were disappointed with count of animals.Please carry food as the cafeteria has limited options such as pau bhaji , puffs , corn and cool drinks.

Spanning across an area of 300 acres, it has species of Indian rhino, Bengal tiger, Indian elephant, python, panther, Asiatic lion, gaur, antelopes, deer, Himalayan Black Bear and number of birds as its inmates. A number of animals from zoo across the country have been brought here showcasing the variety of wildlife it inhabitants.Few added attractions for children and visitors include Natural History Museum, Toy Train, Aquarium, Butterfly Park, Jurassic Park, and Children’s Park. It happens to be the first zoo that started off with the idea of Safari Park and successfully established the Lion Safari Park. This park has been extended to a Safari complex also including Bear Safari, Tiger Safari, and Bison Safari. Proper eating amenities are provided for visitors including a multi-cuisine food court, canteen,dairy parlour and bakery.Moreover, Mir Alam Tank that is situated next to this zoological park draws a number of people due to boating activity conducted by the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Department."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Suneela K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Animals,Takes a 6-8 hours to see completely. Fun filled train ride around the zoo. Lion safari is worth it. Separate bird enclosures. Butterfly park is also good. Nocturnal animals are in a separate enclosure. 2 canteens available for lunch. Most locals get their own food.
Nehru_Zoological_Park,RaviPoojari,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-19,Good Zoo,Good place to visit and see animals. You can see different animals but looks park dont have good resturants inside to eat something good.
Nehru_Zoological_Park,beyondtravel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Vast and variant,"Went on coincidence on lions day, we're awed by the variety of animals, birds, sections such as carnivores, elephant, aves, reptiles, herbivore including rhino, giraffe and hippo , butterfly, nocturnal, bisons, deers etc. But saw 1 lion only. Overall it's a great place and takes 4-5 hours to cover on weekends, located close to city. The park is well maintained with toy train, battery operated hop on cars, and ample animals to see especially if you have kids with you or if you are first timer. However inadequate signages make you  walk a lot, stand in slow and unorganized ques etc. The safari is a total time waste considering tigers are caged. Food options are too limited, better to carry own food. Do visit as a tick in box if you stay at Hyderabad"
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Kalilur R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Need more maintanance,"The park is situated amist the middle of populated town. Thought it is a very old zoo in Hyderabad, the developements are lacking. Animals are very far away and seeing them is seems difficult. In safari very little wild animals."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Prashanth,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Avoid weekends if you have a choice,It was a good visit to the Zoo. My son loved and we could spot most of the animals. He had a great time. Now coming to the bad parts of the visit - We went on Sunday which is the most busy day for the park.So as expected it was very crowded. We wanted to rent a personal cart but after standing in the line for 1 hour I was told they dont have any available I have to do the sharing cart. But they gave a personal cart to the guy who did not even stand in the line as he had a connection with some hid ranked departments. The guys driving the carts had such an arrogant attitude that most of the people riding it could feel it and had lot of altercations with them.Other than that we had a great visit and could show so many animals to my son.

The zoo houses all animals and birds from India and overseas. The zoo is famous for its white tiger and lion safari park. It also has an animal and bird museum. A great place for tourist and children to watch almost all species of animals and birds.
Nehru_Zoological_Park,preethi d,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,The zoo opens at 8:30am but no staff and animals in enclosure until 10am. PATHETIC MAINTENANCE,"The zoo opens at 8:30am and the staff comes at 10am that means all the animals will be inside the night shelters and nothing to see,  they should either shift the opening timings to 10am or the staff should come to the zoo an hour earlier than the open timings clean the zoo, animals and open all the enclosures. Worst maintenance."

Food / Canteen facilities are good and reasonably priced. One needs to spend 4-5 hrs at least to cover the entire zoo.If you do not want to explore on foot and get overly tiered, use the buggy service or rental cycles. Keep hydrated throughout. This Zoo is worth visiting."

You can reach out to here in public transport or Ola / Uber or any other cab. Its a nice zoo park perfectly maintained and organized. It has way boards, maps and directions. You can also take bycicles and buggies. You can take any of them based on your requirement. You can enjoy the trip with so much ease. This saves lot of time, effort and energy.You will find lot of people from Andhra, Telangana and many other states too. The best way I found is to take a ticket at the entrance for buggy. You will enjoy the trip. There are good canteens also in the zoo park. You can buy popcorn 🍿, Samosa and ice creams. There are many animals that you will find interesting and curios to know the facts if you carefully read about them.Overall its a nice place to enjoy the trip."

Enough greenery to protect you from sunlight. They also provide electric car service on charge basis which will show the whole park. give enough intervals at fixed points to explore the life of animals. best option for who wants to round the park without getting tired."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Peter V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,Superb cultural experience,"I had a free Sunday in Hyderabad and decided to visit the Zoo. I was pleasantly surprised by the space the animals have: I saw some beautiful albino tigers, elephants, giraffes, tropical birds, etc... What I did not know is that I was going to be the only tourist (ie. white male) in the entire Zoo; so I became the attraction. Families with kids wanted to take pictures with me which was somewhat unexpected. Oh and the other funny thing about my visit is that the most popular animals in the Zoo were the deer! I was barely interested, but the locals were all lining up to see deer."

The park is well laid out with easy access to the exhibits.    The gardens are well maintained and there is a train ride for the kids (even the grown up kids).   There is a safari park ""tour"" and a ""Natural History Museum"" at the park, but I wouldn't bother with either of these as they were both VERY disappointing.   Overall it was a very nice visit and you could easily spend a day there."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Rakesh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Business,Can spend a whole day,"Dont Rush your day by planning half day zoo tour, I suggest anyone to allocate whole day here. if possible, one routine suggestion i would like to give here, Plan it on weekdays (except on closing day- Monday i guess), because when we went there on Sunday, its totally Crowd, and you may not like it, people bring mats and water cans then eat food on lawns.if you are a pack of 10 or so, then you can book a resting room or retiring room also, you can google for that info.Coming to imp part, never miss lions, tigers and lot of animals like giraffe, also white tigers.Most importantly follow the path guided by them, because you may end of moving in the zoo walking extra without watching all animals. Zoo is very very bigHave fun. Enjoy your trip"

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Suresh1976,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-18,Excellent place to visit with kids,"We had visited this place in Dec. we had a wonderful time in this zoo and my kids enjoyed a lot. This zoo is very big, has lot of animals and different types of birds, reptiles, small fish aquarium.Animals like Cheetah, leopard, tiger, wolf, jackal, hyena, elephants, giraffe, ostrich, we found lots of deer. They have kept different types of birds, peacocks etc. in reptiles we have seen some crocodiles and different types of snakes.It is nicely maintained and it is very clean. Before the entrance there is the proper checking where staff don’t allow anyone to carry plastic bags inside the zoo. After the entrance you will find a mini van service which is quite good if you have old age people with you or if your kids are very small who cannot walk long distance. Zoo is spread in the vast area where you need to walk a long distance to cover all the animals.After the entrance there is toy train also. Ticket is very reasonable. Rs 20 for adult and Rs.10 for child. I advise you to take this toy train, kids will enjoy a lot. It covers the complete zoo area in 25 mins.There is Safari service also but we skipped it because of lot of rush. So better go early so that you don’t miss this safari service.You will not find much eateries inside. You will find ample drinking water and public toilets inside the zoo at various places.You will require full day to enjoy complete zoo but we spent 4 hours and skipped some of the places.We had a wonderful time in this zoo."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Mandar Jetly,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Excellent zoo,Wide variety of animals - Safari took more time in queue - go for AC bus if you have money as there was no queue - Reach early - you can miss Aquarium - There should be more supervision in area of Nocturnal animal & snake encounters as Peaple make crowd and push each other.Overall worth visit if you like animals.If you are strong and young do not take battery operated vehicle.

Its a huge trail walking , so one can hire bicycle inside or take a battery cart hop on hop off ride for extra cost. The zoo overall is not that hygenic and the animal enclsures often smell foul. So be sure to carry your hand sanitiser also. Overall the children enjoy seeing so many animals at one place but the place reaaly needs to be better maintained."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Sandeep Bhojani,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,The Place is Good but can be planned better..,"The authorities are good in terms of maintaining things but we had been on a sunday that too in christmas vacation, so it was very crowded. It is difficult to find few locations of the animals although you can see them in them in the Map on the main road. As when you move inside from the main road there are very few guiding maps who would suggest you the way. Toilets are pay and use and there is additional fee for aquarium, noctrunal animals, fossil mueseum etc. A good place to visit but avoid on public holidays and summer hot days as need to walk a lot if u want to explore all the animals, as the electric car and the mini train would not offer you sights of important animals like lion, tiger etc"

Satish Kumar (The Great and Humble Man of God).Looking back, it's a break through in the history building this Mega Gigantic Church just in 52 days as Nehemiah just builted the walls of holy Jerusalem of Israel country.I believe it's the holiest place on the earth after Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Further, I experienced the presence of the Lord and seen his mighty works in the temple. Personally blessed and sharing this good news to you.

Shilparamam_Cultural_Society,Fairy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Family,Indian Ethnic Crafts Village,"Shilparamam is an Indian ethnic crafts village. A good place to spend a leisurely evening and fulfil your desire of shop till you drop, on Indian ethnic handicrafts. They have a large display and sale of handicrafts from artisans from across the country. One can find handmade pottery, metal craftwork, ethnic outfits, sarees from Banaras and other South Indian states, handbags from Gujarat, embroidered patchwork runners and cushions, crochet outfits and bags and lots more. The shopkeepers don’t have any fixed rates, and there is a lot of bargaining going around the shops, which makes one feel if they have actually paid a reasonable price. One thing one must keep in mind here while purchasing is that these artisans don’t earn much sitting here all year long. We must be reasonable while bargaining with them. Most times they do quote random exorbitant prices, which is not fair too. So it is ultimately at the customers’ discretion if they want to buy it or not. Just compare prices in other stall before making a purchase. The place is mostly well maintained, and one can move around leisurely shopping and enjoying the village themed ambience. There are lot of food stalls, but we have never tried any of those as the hygiene is questionable at the stalls. The food stalls in particular are not maintained very well. They are just filthy. You may choose to visit this place in the evening to avoid the sun and heat, as the place is sprawling and expansive and totally open to air. On Sundays they have some beautiful ethnic performances in their open air amphi theatre, which are a treat. It is truly refreshing to see these performances to actually enjoy the true milieu."

Shilparamam_Cultural_Society,ShaanRoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Expensive to shop around,its basically a market where businessmen from different states have set up their shops to sell their goods at a very expensive price. Avoid purchasing stuff which you will get at one third the price in the local market outside. The sellers from the north have a good collection of antique lookalikes but you have to bargain hard to get a good deal. Many shops accept cards as payment option. Parking is available in the basement for 30/- for four wheelers and 20/- for two wheelers. Entry fee is 50/-. Its a big area and will take half a day to roam around. Visit during the evening to avoid heat.

Can buy handicrafts directly from artisans. As other reviewers have mentioned, bargain well. You can get stuff at 50% of the first quote. It will be harder for non-Indians and north Indians to bargain. So go with someone local if you plan to purchase something expensive. 2. Cultural shows in the evening are interesting. You cannot expect Cirque Du Soleil in $1 ticket. There is a decent effort to manage mosquitoes. Expect few bites if you are not fully covered.3. Boating can be fun for someone who has never done boating. Frequent travellers to USA and Europe may find it childish though. Water can be smelly and again full of mosquitoes. 4. Provides some trees and green environment in the concrete jungle. So you can walk around if the weather is good. Negatives:]1. Street dogs roam around free. 2. Kids are plucking flowers despite warning signs.3. Mosquitoes"

Hussain_Sagar_Lake,Chandana Jain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,My 10th visit,"I have been residing in Hyderabad for the past 26 years and have been to Hussain sagar lake for more than 10 times. Hussain sagar lake is a lake that has a buddha statue which is apparently carved out of a single stone. The statue is beautiful and for seeing the statue you need to take a boat ride either from ""Eat Street"" or from ""Lumbini Park"" there are also private small ships namely bhagmati etc which can be used for a private party, kitty party etc which has a restaurant inside it. These boats also have a live dance performance. The regular boat ticket is priced at 50INR which is adequate. The statue is worth spending it.  The boat ride is amazing and it drops you at buddha statue and gives you 15 minutes to enjoy the beauty of the statue and click pictures. After 15 minutes it takes you back to either ""Eat street"" or ""Lumbini park"" where ever you took the boat from. The experience is worth it for 50 bucks."

They don’t care to request travellers to wait or finish the meals. We were having dinner and the staff lady was rushing to clean the floor. The housekeeping team started putting chairs on the tables. This looked to be the end of day operations. The staff was eating the food kept for travellers. Most of the food items were cold and no heating was being maintained. My next flight was after 6 hours but I was told that the lounge can  be used only for 2 hours. This was new for me. It’s Pathetic and I couldn’t see any supervisor with whom I could chat. Plaza premium definitely needs to upgrade the quality.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Winnia,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Arrogant Receptionist,"I just came out of the lounge all furious on the receptionist who was a nutcase, didnt seem to understand simple English and above all spoke rudely.I told her to kindly contact the Indigo helpdesk to help me in taking my mother who is a senior citizen to the boarding gate.The wheelchair assistance guy had left us at the lounge since we had a 4 hours layover.Before leaving he said that I need to initimate lounge receptionist and she would connect with Indigo helpdesk and arrange for the assistance.When it was time ,I went and told this receptionist that my mother is seated on the wheelchair and that if she could connect with the Indigo helpdesk for continuing the assistance till the gate, she noded her like an idiot...After sometime when nobody came ,I went back and reminded her while she was fidgeting with her cellphone and she was like we dont provide this service; To which I said this is ridiculous because if you didn't,you should have told that to me the first time.She had the audacity to tell me ""How much has it been since you first came, I didn't tell you then, but I am telling you now"".I AM REALLY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS KIND OF ATTITUDE THAT TOO FOR REQUESTING FOR SERVICE FOR A SENIOR CITIZEN. SHOCKED TO SEE SUCH BEHAVIOUR FROM THE RECEPTIONIST.Requesting the Plaza lounge management to please take action against such arrogant staff.Winnia Furtado9833512787"

Can the management look into it plz. It's sooo waste.... Action should be taken related to this."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,drvivekx,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Business,Poorly being managed.,The lounge was closed when we arrived. We were told the lounge will open at 12:30 when lunch starts. When the lounge opened there was atleast a crowd of 40 people waiting for card to get swiped and getting unmanageable. And only one person to swipe . Later after 15 min 1 more arrived. The water dispenser did not have hot water . No soft drink- machine out of order. No tea in tea coffee dispenser.

While the spread when I visited was good, limited seating options and long lines diluted the overall experience."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Akshay Sharma,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-22,An average lounge with a Premium mentioned in its name,This lounge though named Premium offers an average service compared to the ones at Delhi/ Mumbai airports. The seating arrangement is cramped and the check-in experience is very poor. They need to improve the seating arrangement which makes the whole area quite cramped.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Ankur Borwankar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-22,"Excellent food, comfortable couches","Out of the dozen or so airport lounges I've been to in India, this one is by far the best. Comfortable seating, runway facing couches with plush footrests, delicious lunch, live food counter, and polite staff.Lunch included soup, salads & beans, daal & rice, a vegetarian starter, one vegetarian and one chicken main course, a live dosa counter, and a dessert. All of these were fresh and worthy of compliment on a pedestrian Tuesday afternoon. My only gripe is there were no rotis on the menu. It does get crowded around mealtime but I found a two-person dining table without having to wait.A small bar serves alcohol at a charge with separate seating, coffee machines dispense good cappuccino, and there's also a soda fountain with 4 or 5 varieties (PepsiCo, not Coke).A smoking room is inside the lounge, adjacent to the bar, so there's no need to lug your cappuccino across the airport. The room is small but clean and maintenance staff was sweeping it thrice every hour during peak rush.The staff is warm and all the travellers I encountered were friendly as well. Much more genial than the dour, reserved types one finds in Delhi.I was told there are two lounge areas, this review is for the domestic Plaza Premium lounge on level 2.- ANX SCORE CARD -Food: 5/5Service: 5/5Ambience: 5/5VFM: N/A - VERDICT -Definitely worthwhile stopping by. An even sweeter deal if you have complimentary lounge access."

I was quite surprised (positively) with the overall ambience, hospitality, and especially the food. For those who have been visitors of plaza premium in the past would know that the food quality has been decent, but you don’t come with a lot of expectations. However, this time plaza has gone extra mile to ensure the food goes hand in hand with the new setup. It’s almost (authentic) restaurant quality food on the go! Further, the associates made sure that my stay was as comfortable as it could be. Kudos to the team (Sandip, Tirumal - the chef, and Anthony) for going extra mile and ensuring delightful experience. I look forward to my next trip and coming back to the lounge, with a hope to treat my taste buds again! #keepitup"

Inorbit_Mall,Mickey Uppal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Family,A little bit of everything under 1 roof,"One of the few BIG malls of hyd, which has many different brands under one roof.. you can start your day from having lunch in the food court which has reasonably price vendors to up market restaurants like Fusion9. brands like Shoppers stop, pantaloon, M&S, H&M,  are there to carter to men/women shopping needs.Entertainment zones like SMASHH, Dilouge In The Dark, Fun zone for kids.. The few drawbacks are, the drive to the mall is very tiring coz it's located in he middle of an IT HUB which means going there after 5:30-6pm is a pain in the back side. The Durgam cheruvu lake located next to the mall has got an amazing rope bridge which is visible from the mall and looks stunning in the evenings  They have ample parking so finding a spot is not hard .. OVERALL... Go there if u don't like online shopping..."

It is a good hotel but calling it a Luxury Collection is overrated.It’s a good business hotel with zero family orientation.Breakfast is ok but inferior to other hotels of similar type.Lounge is for name-sake with nothing but a couple of snacks and manned just by 1 employee. It is far inferior to any other lower category Marriott properties that I stayed at.Customer service is inferior compared to even lower rated hotels. There are many hotel employees in the lobby but no one seems to pay attention to the customers.I may stay there again primarily due to proximity to work but no other compelling reason."

Inorbit_Mall,SAnkeath,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Inorbit Hyderabad,Inorbit mall in Hyderabad is a spacious shopping mall in Madhapur by Raheja Group. The parking lot is spacious and a fountain at the entrance of the mall makes it appealing. As far as shopping is concerned I did not find many good outlets here.The first floor is completely occupied by a supermarket and the other floors too do not have a good number of branded outlets. I visit this mall only to buy perfumes for which there is an exclusive store on the 3rd floor that stocks almost all good fragrances.The mall is not easily accessible except to those who work at Madhapur. It is situated a bit far from other main localities of Hyderabad. It has a food court and a multiplex both of which are not so attractive. Not a good place for a quality shopping.

As soon as went there we went to the food court. Kids wanted to have ice cremes. Coldstone was the best choice we felt. Later we booked tickets for movie. We went to Jai Lava Kusa. It was recently released. It was a flop movie. That too we watched the latenight show. So everybody slept except two or three kids. Because it was a boring movie. The main reason for watching is kids wanted to see the multiplex. PVR Theatre was very well maintained. Everybody slept except few. Overall it was a nice mall. We went home by Ola. You can spend the whole day once you enter the mall.

It has both stores likely to be found in U.S. including H & M as well as FabIndia for fabulous Indian attire. For the last few visits, my daughter and I visited the ""fish pedicure"" which might not be desired by all visitors but we loved it. We have also watched movies too."
Inorbit_Mall,Sudha T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-18,Great Mall in Great location,"Visited Inorbit Mall 3 times recently during our stay at the nearby Hotel. Definitely worth visiting. Has a great selection of stores with high end products. Mall is very crowded in the afternoon, especially the food courts and it is very difficult to get seating. Interesting aspect is that most of the stores have very limited shoppers, it appears customers are just window shopping. Would definitely recommend buying products at the stores, comparable prices in a very well maintained stores. Would recommend going early in the day for lunch as the food courts are too crowded, definitely not comfortable to have family lunch. Fusion 9 is a great sit down restaurant and is ideal.Overall great experience. Would love to visit again for shopping."

What stood for me of malls in Hyderabad is that they have ample water coolers for drinking water instead of pushing people to buy bottled water."

Food court and movies if you in the mood for some entertainment. If you using the Auto Rickshas, they can be a rip off and dishonest. Rather use an Uber.

Anyways, this is the place to enjoy with your family."

Meaningful and ample shopping and food options. I saw 3 ATMs in the food court but none was ICICI which was pretty disappointing. It is weird how the staff is not aware of facilities. In fact, ask them anything, in general, they would not answer at all (lack of knowledge) or not confidently. A fairly decent level of customer service is missing - be it food court, clothing stores or others.People here need to realize the growth and development in their city that has brought in and continues to draw people from diverse backgrounds to Hyderabad. People working in the mall -you can do better:)"

The temple is wonderful, the location to get the temple is little trcky but for local people it will be super easy. People who are outside from Hyderabad should ask taxi or auto drivers to take them to ""Big Temple near to Abids Post Office"" . The temple is quite old and it is one of a temple where Srila Prabhupada installed the deities personally. The temple is really serene and it provides spiritual connection while a person is inside the premises.The temple is hosting Radha Krishna, Gaur Nitai, and Jagannath,Baladev, Subhadra. All the Artis are good to see. I must recommend to go to Mangala Arti if you are in a near by place. Lot of in house and outside devotees come to the temple to do Mangala Aarti in the morning at 4:30 AM.  The temple is also having Govinda restaurant which serves different type delicious food starting from Lunch to Dinner. Lot of Snacks and other shops are also there which are purely vegetarian without onion and garlic. During lunch hour you will only be able to get North Indian and South Indian Thali. I would recommend people to have snacks and lunch if they are going to the temple in those timing as I found them tasty. All in all there is spiritual taste connected with good infrastructure and eating areas. I have given 4 as it is little difficult to find else the place is wonderful. I suggest people should visit to the temple who are planning to halt in Hyderabad."

Buddha_Statue,Gorgan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,NOT ALLOWED! NOT ALLOWED!,"""Not allowed! Not allowed!"" has become one of the most popular Indian mantras in recent times. It is chanted whenever a tourist carrying his camera is about to enter the site. Fortunately there was a cloak room where I could temporarily store my camera otherwise I would have been asked to pay a 1000-rupee fee. The same mantra was repeated to me at the entrance of other two parks but in those cases there were no cloak rooms. As a result I had to give up on them otherwise I would have been charged 2000 rupees.It's hard for me to understand what is wrong in taking pictures of a Buddha statue, or gardens or the Indian flag or whatever. With that being said it was nice to take the boat to visit this landmark in Hyderabad."

The island can be accessed by boat, which are available from the Lumbini Park. There are various types of boat services available on different payment options. The boat service makes the experience of visiting the island, ordinary.First of all, there was a long queue to buy the tickets, then the visitors had to queue to get on the boat. Later, there was also a rush to return from the island to the shore. Overall, this whole visit was quiet taxing.Best is to avoid going to the island and absorb the beauty of the statue from the shore."

Buddha_Statue,Arun Karthik,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Good Place to Hangout,"The creation of Buddha statue, which has been carved out of single stone, took close to 2 years. About 200 sculptors have worked endlessly to give birth to this marvellous sculpture. It has been carved out of white granite stone which was found on a mountainside, near Nalgonda, located about 40 miles from Hyderabad.Not many are aware of the fact that the Buddha statue in the Hussain Sagar boasts of being a holy pilgrimage as well. It was sanctified by the spiritual leader Dalai Lama himself in the year of 2006.This grand Gautam Buddha statue in Hyderabad owes its construction to then CM of Andhra Pradesh, Sri Late N. T. Rama Rao. The idea to create this monolithic statue of Buddha germinated from his visit to New York where he got inspired with the startling beauty of Statue of Liberty. It was after this visit, he showed keen interest to have a symbol which can stand for the opulence of our culture as well as represent the depths of our distinctive heritage.This statue is a result of the Buddha Purnima Project contribution, which was held in 1985. In the year of 1988, the statue was shipped to Hyderabad. Covering 60 km of distance, it was brought on a gigantic carriage, which had about 192 wheels. There were some troubles initially for mounting the statue. However, in the month of April in 1992, this captivating huge statue of Buddha was raised over the serene waters of Hussain Sagar Lake. Since then, it has been captivating visitors with its incomparable beauty. At the same time, the Lumbini Park with its famous musical fountains was also inaugurated.To reach the Buddha Statue, you have ferry service from Lumbini Park to the rock of Gibraltar, on which this statue stands. Although a sight worth capturing even from far, it is an enchanting experience to get a close look at the statue. You can also sit at Eat Street and enjoy the view with some mouth watering snacks.The best time to visit is evening. In evening, the statue is illuminated in different colourful lights. The sight of illuminated statue of Buddha, with just water all around it, is mesmerizing. It is something you cannot miss. The timings are from 8 am to 10.30 pm.Built in 1562, by Hazrat Hussain Shah Wali, Hussain Sagar Lake is spread over an area of 5.7 square kilometres, across a tributary of the Musi Rive"

Even today, one can able to see the granite besides Hyderabad to Warangal highway near Yadagirigutta location, the rock out of which the statue was made by Sri. Ganapathi Stapathi, a famous temple architect and expert in  sculptures. I still remember those years, how much sum was expensed to create 58 feet toll and about 400 tones of   monolithic sculpture said to be World’s tallest statue of Buddha. Even, still remember the pain staking journey of the sculpture from Raigiri to Hyderabad by expanding roads to reach the Hussain sagar lake.

Its about 18 Km from Hussain Sagar lake but the road to the airport is relatively traffic free as you will travel on the Outer Ring Road most of the time. Its about 37 Km from the Rajiv Gandhi Airport.  "

I recently happened to attend a conference that hosted about 1000 delegates comfortably. Air Conditioning was good and consistent. The car pick up point tends to get congested at times during morning hours when lots of delegates get dropped at HICC. The biggest sore point was the food. Very average and nothing much to write about.

Hyderabad_International_Convention_Center,Rahul_and_Niyanta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-17,Banquet event,"I attended the Wedding Times Fashion Fiesta at HICC on Monday evening (20th March). I am a hotelier myself and have been privy to a number of such PR and media events at the various hotels that I have worked in. However, I must say, that the execution of the event on Monday evening on your end was exceptional. I am not referring to the actual fashion show or the event set p inside the hall. I am referring to the hospitality rendered to guests both, pre and post event. I was lucky enough to attend the after party on the first floor as well. All your staff was courteous and polite, and always smiling. I know Banquet staff is generally very stressed because of their long hours, not to mention handling a complimentary event. However, each and every one of them were brilliant. Always smiling and ready to extended any assistance. For instance, on a number of occasions, your staff ensured that our drinks were brought to us instead of us having to walk up to the bar. Snack service was prompt and if  we requested one of the boys to bring one of the other snacks on rotation, it was promptly brought. Bartenders remembered our drinks and made it promptly. I would like to mention a few gentlemen whose names I caught - Mohiuddin and Anand Ravi, both managers I guess because they were dressed in a jacket, and Saroj (snack server) and Ankush (bartender at the after party). Amongst others, these four brilliant people ensured that we had a memorable evening, one that will last in our collective memories for a long time. And not to forget the food - it was delicious. The chicken satay served at the after party were generous sized and succulent. The chicken biryani, the stew and appam, the anjeer ice cream and the tres leches dessert were all mouth watering, served at the right temperature and delicious. Again, staff was helpful enough to bring us bottles of water to accompany our dinner without being prompted. A classic example of brilliant service. Thank you once again and I do hope you will share my good wishes with your banquet staff to let them know how much we appreciated their efforts that evening. "

Precisely, this property is having number of rides which is spoiling the tranquility. Few rides may be discontinued though it is revenue generating to maintain the spirit of Garden to provide some peaceful environment in Garden.Because it is having vast area about 30 plus acres of land, there is every scope to develop much more better to attract more tourists than present  volume.

Sudha_Cars_Museum,menonCGN,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,A misnomer!,I went there expecting to see vintage cars and vehicles of historical significance; but what the 'museum' had was crudely built replicas and some vehicles like a 1950 model Fiat! It is not a museum at all. I felt it as just a junk yard. Hence the choice of title for this review. My advice to the enthusiasts of automobiles or vintage vehicles; please do not waste your time and money by visiting this place while you are in Hyderabad.

This was one big surprise the first time I had the opportunity to visit KBR park. From the outside it is very hard to imagine how peaceful the interiors are, because all around you are surrounded by the noise and movement of traffice, the people, the vehicles, the hot weather, the humidity and so many other pressures. But once you enter inside, you are transported into a world that has remained pure and calm inspite of all that happens outside. The quietness can surprise you along with a few majestic peacocks that call out and walk across your path. The lush grass in specific areas is temptingly inviting and you will be inspired watching the many elderly gentlemen taking a walk and doing stretches. All in all, it's an absolute MUST Visit to get away from the pressure of the outside world. The more often you visit, the more therapeutic you will feel. "

Wonderla_Amusement_Park,Aantharya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-22,Good but needs lot of improvements.,"Quality is low compared to the price they are charging. The automated answering phone mentions ticket prices that are not accurate. On the phone the price mentioned was around 1000 rupees for adult and 800 rupees for kid, but there when we went it was higher. Locker facility is good they charge 300 rupees for that and 100 rupees out of that is refundable.  The swimming suits are available for reasonable price. I saw many roadside vendors selling swimming dresses just outside wonderla. I presume wonderla might have reduced their clothing price because of serious competition from them. Even then they did not have good collection of all sizes. You would end up buying what ever is available in your size. They also do not encourage exchange if the size does not fit.we reached there at 12 noon and by the time we got everything in place it was 1.30pm, so I feel it would be better idea to reach there by 10.30am itself so that you can get started soon and make the most of the time you get.Changing stations were good. But very small not comfortable for aged people or specially abled people. I guess it was just 2 feet by 2 feet with a curtain. The toilets looked clean but smelled very bad. Only one Indian type toilet was available. The lady at the dressing shop told me my dress is ok for pools as it was made of nylon. but there the guards did not allow me inside the pool as  it was long top.Even though they had marked right end as kids and ladies only, men were also there and none of the guards bothered. we went for lunch at 3pm and not all items were available.  But food was good.Not all the pools were open. The pirate theme pool was closed. So do not promise kids any particular ride before visiting. They usually keep half things operating. So overall we had fun and would visit again."

The huge dissatisfaction was not adherence to covid appropriate behaviour. People were crammed up in a room for the short movie shows, no social distancing at all, people without masks were allowed to enter ( there were many such people ). On asking the security personnel , they said we can’t do anything.On weekends , with huge rush, and no protocols for preventing people who are not adhering to masks or social distancing , it’s the right place for rise in covid cases , considering lot of kids come there . Overall wouldn’t rate it high."

Wonderla_Amusement_Park,"Reddy, Chandhra",2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan-21,Sorry to write this review based my yesterday (24-01-2021) visit. This is weekend visit experience,"Sorry to write this review based my yesterday (24-01-2021) visit. This is weekend visit experience.I visited Wonderla Hyderabad first time with Family (4 people) based on the good reviews and mainly because of 699/- offer, but got a very very bad experience. I am not able to imagine how this reputed organization is leaving public to fight themselves.  Specifically at ROLLER COASTER  ride. I hope most of the people visit to enjoy this ride, the standard time was mentioned as 90minutes. for us it took around 2 hours. That's fine as crowd is huge and its acceptable.But how the people were at queue was unimaginable, I though its like we are in local Theaters, were people were fight for movie ticket and jump queue line. The same happened here and management / staff were just simple standing their and not controlling the crowd. All the security staff are living dead people, no one are active (May be management were not paying them write salary).I had a good learning, don't believe on brand name. I compared Wonderla with Jalvihar (found Jalvihar far better in managing crowd)"

You may want to go here if you understand that and are interested in exploring. But it's so deserted like any graveyard and you are left to wander around. There are quite a few tombs here but they are not any grand architectural structures like what you would see in Delhi. More like any typical contemporary old abandoned structures where no one goes.

These tombs were laid as a reminder of the glory and grandeur of Golconda kings who were buried over here. Qutb Shahi Tombs are considered to be among the oldest historical monuments of Hyderabad City. It is one of the kind place in the world where entire dynasty is buried at one place.Qutb Shahi Tombs is a group of Mosques that are built in memory of Qutb Shahi Dynasty. There are around 30 tombs in this compound. The largest of all these tombs is the Mohammed Quli Qutub Shahi Tomb. These Tombs are built on a individual raised platform and have a splendid dome shaped structure. All these domes seems to be same from long distance, but the best thing is that all the domes over here are unique, with fine details and intricate shapesMost prominent of all is the tomb of Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah who is founder of Hyderabad City. However the most important and modest tomb is considered to be of Sultan Quli Qutub-ul-Mulk, who is the founder of Qutub Shahi Dynasty.

The state government has set up a small info center explaining their makeup and the efforts to preserve and protect them. You can see workers using traditional techniques and craftsmen doing restoration."
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Ken W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,Well worth a visit,"Really interesting to look round these tombs, which date back to the 15 and 16 hundreds.We used a guide, but negotiated a lesser price rather than the crazy amount he asked for.You need about 45 mins to an hour to look round.  A fair amount of renovation going on,  to restore and repair some earlier 20th century efforts."
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,JeffCarter,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Neat,I walked here from the Golconda fort. I had a great afternoon exploring the area there are many many tombs to check out and you can step inside most of them or walk underneath some of them. I did have a few locals want to be my guide and I kindly declined I would rather just walk around on my own. There was an entrance fee I think it was nominal. In January is not very crowded so I was able to wander around on my own even on a Saturday. Well worth a visit while in town.

Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Shashialabur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-19,Beautiful but a sombre place of burials,"The Qutub Shahi Tombs, or the Seven Tombs as they are also known, are beautiful architectural structures, though they they house the tombs of the rulers of an era gone by & their families.Initially planned for only the rulers, there were seven of them but I believe the last one decided to include tombs for the family members too and hence you see many more of them, some small, some big, but all of them architecturally excellent, with a blend of Persian and Indian architectural styles.This place was getting a face lift, with proper walkways, gardens, etc. under various stages of construction when we visited this place. This place is a stark reminder of the impermanence of the human life & body, but at the same time one is forced to ponder on the wisdom of these rulers who built tombs for themselves when they were still alive !The largest of the tombs, of Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah tomb is nearly 60 meters tall, has a huge double terraced structure with a raised courtyard.A must visit place for its. architectural beauty. If you are not too keen on knowing all the details, then you can finish this within an hour, but may need a little more time if you are inclined historically or architecturally.Quite surprisingly, out driver did not know the Qutub Shahi Tombs - probably he knew of them as the Seven Tombs, may be !Beware of Google Maps though, as it took us through the narrow by-lanes on the outer periphery of this large area, without getting us anywhere near the entrance to it !"
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Tomb really surprised me,These Navabs got their tombs made when they were alive. It was very surprising to know that the rulers planned their own tombs even before their death. There are a many people who don't even know how to plan a day. Poor people. But we must appreciate these Kings for their planning of their own tombs.
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-19,Medieval necropolis,"During the Qutb Shahi period, these tombs were held in great veneration. But after their reign, the tombs were neglected until Sir Salar Jung III ordered their restoration in the early 19th century. A garden was laid out, and a compound wall was built. Once again, the tomb-garden of the Qutb Shahi family became a place of serene beauty. All except the last of the Qutb Shahi sultans lie buried here."

Some of the tombs were still under construction but the one that I had access to was very well maintained. A lot of history and it was wonderful to see that the family honored important members of their court with tombs as well i.e. physicians. I really enjoyed my tour and recommend visiting the Qutuab Shahi Tombs. As my guide described it ‘ these were the great men who built the city of Hyderabad as we know it’.

Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,TheoP0001,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-19,Impressive. Simple but elegant; the restoration work already shows the benefits and slowly reveals the old splrendour,"Walking distance (I am kidding, while it is only 800 meters away, this is India, you can't just walk, but it is very close) from the Golconda Fort are those seven tombs that are slowly being brought back to their old glamour. And as they are restored, through the generosity of the local government and the Aga Khan Foundation, they are becoming very accessible. Right now, they are also doing a nice landscaping work. Soon, the entire area will tell its story and the splendor of the Qutb dynasty that built the city of Hyderabad and brought out its treasures."
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Bulbul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,Death is indeed the ultimate truth of life,"This is one of the must-see places in Hyderabad. Various kings of the Qutub Shahi dynasty built these tombs and mosques for each of themselves during their respective reigns. In fact, its the only place in the world where all the emperors are buried in one place. The architecture of the tombs is a mixture of Hindu, Pathan and Persian styles, and is breathtaking. It is said that Aurangzeb, with his army, seized the fort during the reign of the 7th king, Therefore, his tomb remains incomplete.These tombs convey, in a royal way that - 'Death is the ultimate truth of life'Highly recommended to hire a guide. I found the history here far more interesting than Golconda fort. The guide will charge around INR 200-300 for an hour.The best time to visit is in the evenings"

Royal family members are still buried there. Plan to do a lot of walking to see the series of tombs and learn about the history. There is really no reason to pay a tour guide unless you want to. There are plenty of site markings that teach you what you need to know. The buildings do not appear like they did hundreds of years ago, but they are nonetheless impressionable.

Lumbini_Park,gpradeepshenoy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Just a small park,Took a Bus from Nampally to Lumbini Park(Nearest bus stop to Lumbini park is Secretariat ). A Walk from Secretariat bus stop to Lumbini park is of about 3 Minutes.               Entrance costs Rs 20 to this park. From this park boats goes to Buddha statue. The ferry rates are Rs 55(up and down charges). It is better to visit this park and budha statue in the late evening/ night . One can spend time at the buddha statue as per their liking and then return to Lumbini park. After sunset the budhha statue becomes lighted because of many lights directed on the statue and is good to watch.             Apart from boats which take tourists to Buddha statue there are speed boats also. These speed boats do not stop at the Buddha statue . Apart from this there is some evening/night cruise in a boat. This boat also does not stop in Buddha statue but the boat plays music for tourists to dance and have a good time.            There are few Kiosks inside Lumbini park selling snacks and beverages. We went for Laser show in the Lumbini park which costs Rs 60.00 The show was very average and the show starts at 7:15 Pm. If you are in a hurry then this laser show can be missed.                Average place to visit while at Hyderabad.

Lumbini_Park,ShvRm_Traveller,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Overrated and commercialized,"The purpose visiting the park is to spend some peaceful time, which is defeated because of the amount of effort that is being taken to just enter the park. First, there was a long queue and heavy jostling to obtain the entry tickets. The ticket counter was absolutely unorganized. Then there was a very long queue to enter the park. Bags, even the backpack, were not allowed inside. There was a counter to deposit the bags, where again there was a heavy rush.Cameras are allowed inside the park on payment, however, the amount quoted for allowing a simple Digital camera was INR 1000/-. So we had to go and deposit the camera at the luggage counter.After all this when we entered the park, we found that, there was nothing extraordinary about the place, apart from being located on the bank of Hussain Sagar lake. Moreover, the place was heavily crowded.The boat service to the Buddha Statue starts from the park, on payment of additional charges for the boat.Overall, the park is a over hyped place, which is mostly frequented by the tourist, as it is sold to them as a tourist attraction. To be visited, only if there is nothing else better to do."

Lumbini_Park,Mahesh A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Nice laser show,"This park is located just next to the famous Hussain Sagar lake. From the park entrance, we can go to both the boating and laser/musical fountain shows.The park is well maintained. It looked neat even though it was too crowded when we went. The entrance fee for getting into the park is very nominal. But we need to pay extra for other facilities available inside the park - Ex., boating, laser show etc.,We went for the laser show first. It was a mix of laser show and musical fountain. A laser show followed by a musical fountain and it was repeated thrice. For the first timers, this would be a fabulous experience. It was of a great standard. The queue for the boating was huge, so couldn't take a trip to Buddha statue.Tips:1. It is not allowed to carry any bags inside the park (other than ladies handbag). They have a baggage counter, so unless you have any costly material, it shouldn't be a problem2. It was extremely crowded even on a Thursday (a non-holiday also). So you need to plan well if you want to cover both boating and laser/musical fountain show3. From there, if you take an auto to your place of stay, some drivers may recommend ""a good place to buy sarees etc.,"" DON'T go for that option. Your such buying cost may also include their commission."

The problem is the other slot where the lasermounted exactly opposite to audience fires the show at the audience.this is the dumbest thing to do. the permissible lasers are sub 5mW (the laser pointers). the ones used in the show seem very heavy wattage shining right into 1000+ audience eye balls on the opposite side.@ 50Rs per head, the park easily collects in excess of 15 Lakh per month just from laser show. if they could afford to consult/hire any engineer with common sense, it might be turned into pleasurable experience. recommend  not to go there unless you know this problem is solved."

First of all, the temple is very good and awesome as it is golden and so many lords are there but why I'm saying it as above average, the reason is that I always feel like it was built with no proper planning. Why because the way for entrance and exit has not been constructed well as it is mixture of ups and down. I know the temple was built on hills, even-though it should be proper planned. The surroundings and outside place also be kept in a smooth structure. "

That’s been stopped now which probably tells you that the temple is gaining in popularity.Having said that, the temple needs better upkeep. The water in the taps at the entrance often runs dry. Can’t do much about the monkey menace too I guess. I firmly believe it’s the people who are causing it by the constant feeding and pampering. With some donation, you can get to go inside the sanctum sanctorum for a Darshan. The idol of Lord Venkateswara is well adorned and the Pooja is performed well.In summer the stone floor can get very hot to walk on so please be wary. Don’t carry any food and if you are carrying water please be wary of the monkeys. The temple is atop a hill but there is ample parking. "

Sanghi_Temple,funesc111,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,What can go wrong!,"1. If you are using Uber/ Ola etc., remember that you can face problems during return, especially in the evening after 7 pm.  The cabs that we were trying to book on return were always 10-12 km away and they had to come through the Ramoji Film City, which i guess was not allowed so easily.  So it took us lot of time to get a cab in the evening.  And if you don't have a cab, you will be just stuck at the top2. There is no lift/ elevator/ mini bus facility and for elders, it is almost impossible to climb-up or down some 200 stairs (approximate) 3. The toilets (which are down stairs) can surely give you a UTI (urinary tract infection).  They are filthy.  There is just no water.  Taps are broken.  We did not find drinking water/ toilet facility at the top, where the temple is located4. Flooring around the temple is uneven.  Not even cemented properlyWhat is good - Playful monkeys, may be little bit of scenery during monsoons, and of course a thought about the Lord!!"

Sanghi_Temple,rimjhim,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Not at all maintained!,"We went to Sanghi Temple yesterday as a part of a family outing. The timings on the internet were mentioned as 8:30 to 10:30 AM and 4 PM to 6 PM so we rushed to reach there on time in the evening. The road to the temple is quite nice. It doesnt feel as if you are in Hyderabad as there is greenery on both sides. The entrance hoarding to the temple showed different timings...Its open in the evenings from 4 PM TO 8 PM contrary to what is mentioned on the web and on Sundays it is open from 8AM to 8PM.The temple is not well maintained at all. The grass and greenery that was there a few years back is no longer there. There were muddy patches everywhere and very little of grass. No floral plants as seen a few years back. So the only so called beauty is in terms of the temple structure. The priests seemed highly reluctant to do any kind of ""free"" service like offering teertham , flowers etc. It was a major put off. We stayed there till 5:30pm and there was no light in the sanctum sanctorum which was dark inside and made it diffcult to see the idols. Very demotivated temple staff.The temple has quite some numbers of monkeys around which are a nuisance. They kept coming near us when we were seated on the benches , forcing us to leave the seats.Overall it was a disappointment. The only plus point was the weather. Theres no point driving to the outskirts of the city to see a barren temple land and priests who are highly demotivated!The citys Jagannath temple in Banjara hills seemed much better option !!"

That’s been stopped now which probably tells you that the temple is gaining in popularity.Having said that, the temple needs better upkeep. The water in the taps at the entrance often runs dry. Can’t do much about the monkey menace too I guess. I firmly believe it’s the people who are causing it by the constant feeding and pampering. With some donation, you can get to go inside the sanctum sanctorum for a Darshan. The idol of Lord Venkateswara is well adorned and the Pooja is performed well.In summer the stone floor can get very hot to walk on so please be wary. Don’t carry any food and if you are carrying water please be wary of the monkeys. The temple is atop a hill but there is ample parking. "

Sanghi_Temple,funesc111,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,What can go wrong!,"1. If you are using Uber/ Ola etc., remember that you can face problems during return, especially in the evening after 7 pm.  The cabs that we were trying to book on return were always 10-12 km away and they had to come through the Ramoji Film City, which i guess was not allowed so easily.  So it took us lot of time to get a cab in the evening.  And if you don't have a cab, you will be just stuck at the top2. There is no lift/ elevator/ mini bus facility and for elders, it is almost impossible to climb-up or down some 200 stairs (approximate) 3. The toilets (which are down stairs) can surely give you a UTI (urinary tract infection).  They are filthy.  There is just no water.  Taps are broken.  We did not find drinking water/ toilet facility at the top, where the temple is located4. Flooring around the temple is uneven.  Not even cemented properlyWhat is good - Playful monkeys, may be little bit of scenery during monsoons, and of course a thought about the Lord!!"

The architecture of the temples is splendid and one can get a good view of surroundings from the top. The Ramoji Film City is close by and is visible from the top of the hill. There are many hotels and stalls at the bottom of the hill where the city buses halt.

Sanghi_Temple,rimjhim,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Not at all maintained!,"We went to Sanghi Temple yesterday as a part of a family outing. The timings on the internet were mentioned as 8:30 to 10:30 AM and 4 PM to 6 PM so we rushed to reach there on time in the evening. The road to the temple is quite nice. It doesnt feel as if you are in Hyderabad as there is greenery on both sides. The entrance hoarding to the temple showed different timings...Its open in the evenings from 4 PM TO 8 PM contrary to what is mentioned on the web and on Sundays it is open from 8AM to 8PM.The temple is not well maintained at all. The grass and greenery that was there a few years back is no longer there. There were muddy patches everywhere and very little of grass. No floral plants as seen a few years back. So the only so called beauty is in terms of the temple structure. The priests seemed highly reluctant to do any kind of ""free"" service like offering teertham , flowers etc. It was a major put off. We stayed there till 5:30pm and there was no light in the sanctum sanctorum which was dark inside and made it diffcult to see the idols. Very demotivated temple staff.The temple has quite some numbers of monkeys around which are a nuisance. They kept coming near us when we were seated on the benches , forcing us to leave the seats.Overall it was a disappointment. The only plus point was the weather. Theres no point driving to the outskirts of the city to see a barren temple land and priests who are highly demotivated!The citys Jagannath temple in Banjara hills seemed much better option !!"

After checked in our hotel at Abids we decided to visit Charminar in the afternoon. Every body knows that Charminar is the iconic of Hyderabad City, the most beautiful monument in the heart of Hyderabad.  We reached in the evening. The place is very crowded as it was Independence Day. We spent some time there. Then we visited Mecca Masjid, one of the largest in the world, situated on the south west of Charminar. Here also we a lot of visitors assembled. All are in festive mood. we were interested to pay a visit there. First we faced a tight security. However we entered the masjid area. Why Mecca Masjid, the name given? Some say the founder, Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah commissioned the construction who asked for soil to be brought in from the holy Islamic site of Mecca. He laid the foundation stone of this mosque in 1641. Some say that a few bricks from holy shrine from Mecca were embedded in it .Another view that only one brick was brought from Mecca. However, the mosque was completed by Aurangzeb,in 1694,  the Mughal Emperor, after conquering Golkunda in 1687. It is so big that it can accommodate 10,000 worshippers in its prayer hall. The architecture is beautiful, one of a Heritage Building in Hyderabad. It is worth visiting along with the Charminar."

It is said that he himself laid the foundation stone and the bricks used to construct the central arch of the mosque have been made from soil sourced from Mecca. This is the reason behind the mosque getting its name as Mecca Masjid.It has the capacity to accommodate 10,000 worshippers to offer prayers at a time. About 8000 workers were involved in the construction of this mosque that draws hundreds of tourists from all across the globe, not just for its historical or religious importance but also for its spectacular beauty.A few common sights at this sacred place include feeding of pigeons considered to be a virtue in the Muslim community and devotees sitting by the side of an artificial pond installed in the mosque.

Full of bird feathers and dried leaves and dust floating on it, however, there is a separate place with taps for ablution too but not clearly visible, we had to ask if there was one.The prayer sermon or khudba was in Arabic instead of the widely spoken and understood Urdu which was surprising.The interior of the masjid is spellbinding, mainly because it's very high. Almost four to five storeys high ceiling.Chandelier were covered in cloth thought and fans kept things cool.Albeit run down and under maintenance, it still gave the old time flavour and one could feel they are back in time by say 40-50 years.Worth visiting and experiencing if in Hyderabad."

Not the best experience here.  I am white so I stand out as a tourist.  Came around lunchtime.  I came into the courtyard and you have to take off your shoes and socks and when you come back they will expect you to pay for their watching your shoes.  I came in and an old guy offered to show me something interesting (which should have been a red flag, my error) and he took me around the corner to show me some graves of the local rules.  Then him and another old Muslim guy started pressuring me to deposit some money on this grave and say a prayer, and I realized that I was now out of view of the crowd and alone with these two guys who are trying to extract money.  I politely walked away, back to where the shoes are.  By this time my feet have ample dirt on them.  I walked around in the courtyard toward the main mosque and it's impressive enough.  However the cobblestones were filthy on my bare feet and I decided to go look around other things in the Charminar area instead.It would probably be a better experience with a guide or local friend."

A good selection of shops over three floors and a movie theatre on the top. I felt that some of the branded shops were then duplicated as concessions within larger shops but,  I could over look that.  The place was clean and tidy and that would just fine for now.I was impressed at the size of the food hall, didn’t eat anything but it was sizable."

,,,,,"The Forum is a fairly large property, unlike many other ""malls"" in Hyderabad. It is quite well-maintained as well. There's a good collection of brands/retail stores. The reason for the average rating - it has a pretty crappy food court payment solution. You need to buy a prepaid card loaded with cash and you can buy only with that card inside. No cash/credit cards. Worst part - if you are new to the mall, like I was, I had no idea on what the price charts looked like for each outlet. And there's queues for loading cash, and rushing back since you fell a few rupees short of what you calculated you expected to eat (seriously, singularly amongst the worst payment implementations for a mall setting). Management, if you are reading this, cash and credit cards work. You need to figure a better way of ensuring your tenants share sales data if you don't trust them! Not thrust a crappy solution on every visiting patron."
,,,,,"Dear Guest, 

We regret the inconvenience caused to you. There are other reasons and thought for the prepaid card system currently in place.However, we certainly take your feedback and shall explore initiatives for further simplification.

Snow_World,AmitG17,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Not that much worth...!!,"We visited in afternoon time for slot of 5.30 PM. Ticket price was ₹600 for adult and ₹450 for kids over 2.5 years. You will get equipments like jacket, shoes, gloves , socks etc from the staff there, but sometimes they are very oversized.. They have kept it well with snow games, dance etc but considering ticket prices, it is not that worth really! It's overpriced place.. but if you've never been to any snow place in India, then it can be a good place to enjoy it"
Snow_World,Krishna Sandeep Siram,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-19,Good But Over Priced,Best place for experiencing snow and ice in summer for fun But limited time is permitted. Litlle bit overpriced but good.
Snow_World,sivaprasadsahu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Weekend Visit to Snow World,"Just casually we were roaming around necklace road seeing the decorations of Republic Day when we came across Snow World. This was a place which she wanted to go long back but as we stay in Lingampally don't come this side often, so thought to give it a whirl. The snow world didn't dissapoint us, the inside was freezing and I guess it would be 2-3 degrees. The snow was quite clean on the floor. Not much to do inside apart from clicking pics and going on the snow slide. I would recommend to go in larger groups to enjoy as there is a mini volley ball area, and a DJ floor too. This place would be great for kids too. The jackets were good but the gloves were really thin and the gum boots were too large so the snow was going inside from the top. Should add more games or attractions inside.The other attractions that came with the packahe was the Living Dead (Scary House) which was a completely joke if u ask me but then again it costs 30/ head so mehhh... Then there is the Rain forest which is also below okayish.... Amd at last there is the Kaleddo which is essentially the Mirror Maze which was around average as the area was not so big that you would puzzle out, the mirrors were also a little dusty so one could figure out the way.Overall worth to go once. Package is 500/head if only Snow world and 600/  head for all the things that I mentioned above."

Developed by the Ocean Park Multi Tech Limited (OPML), it is spread over an impressive area of 17,000 square feet.Located at the Lower Tank Bund Road, this theme-park is easily accessible. Apart from playing with the snow, which is made up of mineral water, you can also try sports such as ice skating, ice boarding, snow slides with bumping-car and toboggan rides.The Cryo Zone is one of the most popular sections. It presents a natural landscape with igloos, simulated polar bears and penguins and alpine trees"

Its Mussorie in Hyderabad this summer . Explore it and have fun. I loved with my friends throwing snow at each other."
Snow_World,savvyuec,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Get your expectation right before visiting,"The actual venue is a large room with frozen snow on the ground and with a few large models (not made of snow) like the igloo, a snow man, yeti etc. There is slide ride that you can take. There is NO ARTIFICIAL SNOW FALL. For what they call a show is basically turning on the music and a large water sprayer. For all this they charge 500/- per head for Adults and 300/- for children. Photography: You are not allowed to carry your cell phones inside. You can however carry camera on payment of 50/-. There is photographer inside who charges Rs 100/- for every click and is in a rush to just click and get done with it. Also you need to wait for upto 30 mins assuming you get bored and leave out early as this guy can only give prints once the show slot ends.  Experience: If you have seen a snow fall or snow in your life YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE THIS PLACE a PASS. The place is a absolute waste of time and it may be a harassing experience because of the crowd for you and your family as you need to wait in a queue for up to 45 mins to get in after the ticket purchase. Total not worth the time or the money (except for a kid seeing frozen ice for the first time).Also in my opinion is it avoidable if you have a toddler. Kids in the age group of 3 to 9 years may enjoy playing in the ice and someone who is seeing snow for the first time.We got out of the place within 25 mins.Logistics: - Parking is free.- You can take off your shoes inside and deposit at a counter as family in a bag which they will give you.- They also give a pair of socks, snow boots, jacket and gloves. Smaller sized stuff is available for kids although they fit may not be good."

We thought we will never be able to reach the door in time. But to my utter surprise, we reached the entrance door in just 13 minute - such a organised place - and above all the law abiding, docile people. There was no breaking of line, no tramping of foot - nothing. The place inside is amazing - they have 1 hour slot for each group - and in that 1 hour you will feel like freezing. They spread ice mechanically once in this 1 hour period and you will get a small feeling of snow blizzard. They have rides inside. Also, they serve hot soups inside - nice to have. Once you are out, they have nice outlets for snacks / soups / tea / coffee.Above all, I am amazed at what an effective infrastructure they have created - so much so in that crowd, they manage everything almost picture perfect - hats off to the management and mainly to local people"

Snow_World,devbajaj,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,"Poorly maintained, very average place","We went to this place on Dec 27, 2017.4 adults and 3 children.This place has 4 sections and here's my rating for them-1. Rain Forest- AVOID, waste of money and time. They've tried to create a dingy and scary rain forest experience which is actually pathetic2. Living Dead- AVOID, waste of money3. Kalledo - AVOID, waste of money4. Snow world- 45 minutes of being in an overcrowded room with snow on the floor, and a couple of rides. Snow was dirty. Getting in the snow world room will have you experience a stampede like situation so beware if you have small kids with you.Ticket prices we paid for combo of all 4 sections-Adult- 600 per personChildren- 400 per childTotal = 3700Sorry! No pictures. Mobiles are not allowed inside."

Snow_World,Vinay Y,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Fun place to experience snow!,"This is a fun place to experience snow in Hyderabad. As someone who grew up in the Northeast USA (who now lives in Los Angeles, California, USA), seeing snow wasn't a huge thrill for me, but my wife and son have never seen snow or played in snow (since it doesn't snow in Los Angeles). It was organized and they provided all the jackets, boots, mittens, etc. It's a nice place to play in the snow and experience what it's like to live in a winter place.Since I grew up in a place where it snows nearly 5 months of the year, I can expertly say this was a good representation of how it feels like to experience snow and snow like cold weather.They only let people into the snow chamber at certain time slots (presumably to keep the place cold) and you cannot take cell phones or cameras with you; they want to sell you their photos.Just be careful with young children as many of the people throw snowballs and play a little rough in the snow, so young kids can get hit with snow or knocked down."
Snow_World,hemang m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Good place but bit expensive & way way too over crowded,"Snow WorldAnother delayed review. Went here with my family in 1st week of November. My 82 yr old grandma wanted to come with us as well but everyone including ticket staff at the venue, the official agency from where we booked the online tickets said sadly, she won't be allowed inside. We really wanted her to come with us [fyi still does everything on her own without needing any assistance] but the staff told us god forbid if anything wrong happens it would be our responsibility as the temparature inside is -5 degees, hence to be on a safer side she decided to wait outsideShe happily agreed to sit in the common lobby, so we all went in. We went for the late evening batch. Every batch lasts around roughly an hour. The premises are big enough. They have rock climbing, snow rides, basketball games, snow dance etc. It's really freezing inside so make sure you put your gear properly. My 30 month old daughter got really scared after someone by mistake & in pure fun threw some ice on her, hence my wife and I took turns to look after her just outside the exit.Pros:1) Extremely helpful Staff [talking about the ones sitting at the gear counters]2) The gear provided is washed / cleaned in warm water & only then given to the forthcoming batch.3) Allotted time of approx 1 Hour is just enough to enjoy the place.Cons:1) Expensive Ticket prices. @ 500 Rs for Adults is definately steep.2) We had 2 school groups in our batch who were COMPLETE NUISANCE. [Wish I could have noted their details to report it to their management]. Constantly yelling, pushing everyone & anyone before entering inside [hey I know everyone goes there to enjoy but enjoying at the expense of pushing, shoving others makes NO SENSE]. Security staff controls no one outside the main area, they are just least bothered.3) Snow World Management just fills up people like anything, literally anything. There should definately be a limit of allowing the visitors inside.Overall, one can surely visit the place when in Hyd but make sure you check the timings and the crowd. PS: Just like other places, there is a 30-40 Rs Digi Cam fees."

Jackets, boots, gloves, socks are provided. I was a little worried about whether they will be clean or not but they were.There is a garbage unit right next to Snow World so if you have to spend time at the outside waiting area you will have to bear the unpleasant stench."

Snow_World,FoodieYogiKrishna,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Snow in city of Biryanis !,A few years back had visited this snow world and had come back disappointed. But this time around better experience and hence the review. The facility itself looks very very old and lack of maintenance shows. Learnt that  crowd is very low except on holidays. Kids really loved the sight and feel of snow. It will be very slippery and utmost care has to be taken to not trip and hurt one self. Worth only for the snow world entry and not all the others (scary house etc.. ). My samsung s6 crashed and all the pics are lost :( . i had pictured the ticket to keep track of the prices too !!
Snow_World,Ritesh J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,An experience to have while in Hyderabad,"We have been to this place with our family friends and kids. The place is just fun to go if you haven't been to any place with real snow. They give gloves, shoes and jacket to wear. They have a standard size and you just need to wear it before entering the main chamber. Don't expect the gloves to clean though. I didn't find them hygienic and washed hands thoroughly once out. Once inside you understand how it is to be in snow for even around 30 mins. The time passes quickly inside. You have a small shop inside selling tea, coffee and sweet corn. Apart from that they have a snow laden slide and many other activities. In case if someone feels too cold then they have an exist which opens every few minutes and one can go out for sometime. It is advisable to go in a group so that you can enjoy with your own group. You might want to take a package which gives you opportunity to visit mirror maze and haunted house. They are not that great but  it's fun."

Snow_World,Giri P,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Very poorly managed venue ,Snow world falls way short of fun experience.i went by the positive reviews only to find the theme park in a pathetic state. The living dead and the rain forest were a joke. Irritating sounds with no hint of adventure or fear. Waste of time and money.The snow drome was overcrowded. They make u wear the snow gear and wait for 30 min in an enclosed area. A small area where there shouldnt be more than 20 people..they cram it with 100+ . Crowd manners are pathetic in our country. There was scary stampede to enter the snow drome once the gate was opened. Interiors were discoloured and depressing.dirty snow and noisy snow generators. Food was costly and tasteless. The tomato soup worth 50 bucks inside the snow drome was served in flimsy paper cups which just tore off with weight of soup.Overall it was very poorly managed profit making venture.

The cost is quiet high @ Rs.500/- for a time period of one hour in the snow world. They provide all necessary clothing including jackets, shoes, socks, gloves, etc. You have to leave mobiles outside. The entry is timed at intervals of 90 minutes - so check the timings before you reach the place since you do not want to be waiting for long time. Once you are in the snow world it takes some time to get used to the -5 C temp. One can play in the snow, there are balls and otehr stuff. There is also a steep slide on ice and adults/ older kids can do it. They also do some snow fall and play music for dance. Go to snow world to enjoy the chill !!"

The place had relatively fewer visitors, compared to other malls of similar type.It was also difficult get a public transport from the mall when we left, later.It may be a popular place to shop among the locals, however, the tourist may consider to skip this place, if they do not have any specific branded items on their shopping list."

The stores are very basic stores and nothing too flash.... you can go to Fabindia or Chumbuck or Soles.... but this is not a high end mall.  It is still ok, but not what I expected.  The food court leaves a LOT to be desired.  A few fast food stalls and that is it.

Shri_Ashtalakshmi_Temple,Manu,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Best Lakshmi Devi temple in Hyderabad,"I am a regular visitor to Ashta Lakshmi temple in Hyderabad. Its maintnance is admirable and we see all 8 avatars of Lakshmi Devi. But in 2019 it has raised ticket prices drastically. Last year(2018) I spent Rs.101 for Vahana Pooja(T/W) on Dussehra but in 2019 it is increased to Rs 251 and more over poojari who performed vahanapooja demanded Rs.101 and servents Rs. 50. Poojari shouted at a man who gave him Rs. 50 as he didnt give 101 and insulted him throwing that Rs. 50 to a Cleaner. My point is people go to temple with a peaceful mind to get the blessings of godess and the Priest. But if a priest behaves with devotees like this it hurt them a lot and creates negetive impression on it's commercial side. On top of it this Priest had pan masala also. I would ask management to look into it and protect people religious sentiments especially on special occations. Regards,Manohar"

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Gowrish P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Little astronomy. Boring content.,"Birla Planetarium (BP) is a part of the Birla Science Center, but, only the Planetarium  is reviewed here.I think the BP set up is good, but the content has been not well thought out at all. We went with expectation of an astronomy focused visit, but were let down by the content. Very little relevance to science of astronomy. BP needs to buck up to remain with the times.Planetarium has three parts to it - Dome, 3D theater, and observatory. We did not visit the observatory as it was overcast and raining.*The dome* is designed for 70 or so people and it fills up fast. Take your tickets and make it to the show time as printed on your ticket. Shows run hourly from 10 AM till 5 PM. There might be shows in Telugu. Check with the ticket counter. *The show itself* was boring. The focus of the show evolution of astronomy from a historical perspective. This did not need a 40 minute treatment and turned out to be a drag. There are many advancements in astronomy and it would have been useful to show that. More than talking about symbolism of different cultures/civilizations (and how they converge) over time, it should be kept basic for children's sakes - basic solar system model visualized, how far we have gone with our travels in it, what planetary bodies can be observed with eyes, what methods exist to look farther, something about Hubble telescope, radio telescopes... these would pique the curiosity to explore further.*3D Theater* is a decent set up as well. However, the content was a let down. Our ticket said '3D Universe' for the name of the show. However, what was shown up was a 3D Animation movie about story of a T-Rex. It's all good for someone who has never seen a 3D movie, but today every mall and amusement center has 3D. You can see 3D on the cellphone for a small cost of the glasses. What's the big deal with a Jurassic Park kind of show at a Planetarium?BP needs to really think what people expect when they visit a planetarium. If they want people, esp. children to come back with more interest, BP need to think how they need to rejig the content. Else, the planetarium is just a tick in the box for someone who has not seen one in HYD."

One you reach the well designed centre is impressive. A  brief astronomy(based on modern as well as vedic science) video is played against the ceiling of the circular auditorium. Suggest kids  6+ to be brought here. The toddlers were getting frightened/impatient in the dark room with heads pointed towards to the ceiling.  The show itself seems very outdated in terms of the clarity of the video, voice or music. But the content is exceptional and well detailed. From the time the universe was created till when it may pass the subject is covered well with basis from ancient vedas(pure sciences). A good visit for inquisitive children and parents."

The planetarium and science museum are in the same complex but has a separate fee for each. Also, there is a Art gallery. went for a planetarium (cost Rs. 100/-) which was not bad. There is one show in the planetarium for 30 mins which was very good and another in the science building which supposed to be 3D but was'nt. It was simulated 3D.

At first, I was very enthusiastic about the fact that I was setting foot in a scientific zone after a very long time. I stood in line to purchase the tickets. I had purchased a combo ticket for the Museum and Planetarium, and it cost me around Rs 150. The show was perfectly on time, so no issues with that. Once the content started playing, I felt that I was watching the same version that I had seen almost 10 years ago. There seemed to be negligible improvement in quality and content. I wish it was better. But, it is worth a visit if you're going with kids. They might like the visual experience. One most important factor that you should keep in mind if you are going during a weekend - try and buy your ticket as soon as you enter the premises, because the English show's tickets get sold out very soon.

It has international standards of presentation, which has been rated among the best and highly visited planetarium of the world. It is a place for everyone and can be afforded by everyone too as the Birla Planetarium entry fee is also minimal. What I liked the most in the center were the exhibits where the different working model of various scientific principal are displayed and kids are encouraged to play with them. So the children visiting the museum can not only see the exhibits they can actually try them out and learn science principals that they may be aware only by theory from their school curriculum. Overall I would highly recommend visiting Birla Science Museum and Planetarium with your kids and spend a day learning about not only science, dinosaurs, planets, stars but it will be a day well-spent bonding with your kids."

Even if you don't buy anything, there's great opportunity for street photography as well as lots of material for observation. That said, keep your belongings secure as pickpockets abound (even the police station there warns us so). Lots of bangles shops; how much you pay for them depends on how good you're at bargaining (which I'll confess I was rubbish at). There's an old cafe right next to the Charminar, Nimrah Bakery; they had some good Irani tea and lovely biscuits. Lots of knickknacks to browse through. An enjoyable experience if you aren't too bummed out by crowds and people bumping into you. That said, I didn't have even a single bad experience as a woman - no perverted touching/grazing/grabbing.

The Bazar has been operating since the time of the Qutb Shahis and the Nizams. Pearls jewelry along with hollow bangles are the main attraction of this place. Unfortunately, the popularity of hollow bangles which was once the must have for anybody visiting and in Hyderabad is declining. However, it is something to have. Very light and graceful, delicate I must add. Another thing which is found only is Hyderabad's Laad bazar is the 'Chiksa'. It is a kind of beauty mask. Can be used in hair and skin. Before the facial, and body polish, every Muslim family which had a wedding planned, would make sure to get this. Brides used to use this every day for 21 or 14 days for a beautiful and naturally fragrant skin. It is worth a try. Before going, have an idea about the cost. If you are good with knowledge of price and quality of a commodity, and with bargaining, this is a place for you. Cheap and nice, but if you are someone like me who has no idea about quality and price and is bad with bargaining, be ready to get ripped off. The first price that is quoted to you is 3-4 time higher!!! Good luck"

Good spot to watch the sun set over the city.Maula Ali Dargah has two access points. One starts at the base with stairs all the way. Another one (likely, newly redeveloped) accessible from the road up to mid point to the top. We chose the former, which has parking only in small bylanes. The latter point is recently developed with broad roads and sufficient parking.The walk up the 400+ stairs is pleasant, and not tiring.Dating back to Qutb Shahi times, the Dargah has strong following and is believed to fulfilling wishes. This Dargah is claimed to have a handprint of Hazrat Ali, son in law of The Prophet.The Dargah is open and accessible on all days from dawn to 10 pm.The best time to reach here is an hour before sunset. Walk up the stairs, visit the Dargah and them settle down on the ample space around the Dargah. This space is essentially the side of a rocky smooth hillock. All sides are accessible to walk and each side offers views not seen anywhere else. You can faintly spot buildings in the remote financial district. Faintly, and phantom like.It is interesting play to identify remote spots such as the Golconda fort directly to the West. The small size of the fort emphasizes the distance from Maula Ali.Watching the sun set and lights turning on slowly all around the city and silence settling down after the prayer hours is to be experienced here.All in all, this spot should be on your checklist if you live in the twin cities."

The view is serenic and you could just sit on the hilltop for hours to view the sunrise and sunset.  Given the 500+ steps, make sure to carry water and food cos you will not find it on the top.  Irrespective of the religion, it is a perfect place for medidation, but avoid going in the noon.  I would suggest going between 5-7 am and 4-7 pm."

A peep inside will astonish you. The glittering mirror filled walls and ceiling and decorations in silver with verses from the Quran liberally covering the walls, will keep you mesmerised. Anyone can enter and seek blessings from the priest who will brush you with  peacock feathers. On holy days when the Urs (religious festival dedicated to Hazat Ali is held), you can also view and touch the relics kept under a cloth covering.On the days of the urs, you wlll find huge throngs of men,women and children making the strenuous climb to seek the blessings of the 4th Caliph of Islam.Both a visually rewarding and uplifting spiritual experience!!"

Parking of the vehicles is a problem, make sure you dont parking in front of any residence door or gate. Carry your water & fruits, if you wish to explore the hill with some time. Wear canvas / tennis shoes with rubber sole will give you grip during the climb, and walk the rock surface.One can also test their endurance by doing a climb sprint on the nearly 400 stairs. I managed 2 back to back stair climbs, before i started huffing & puffing.If you wish to visit the Dargah, them make sure you are attired in a presentable way, to attend a place of worship. Carrying a head scarf or large handkerchief is advised, and leaving your footwear at the designated place suggested.Camera & Mobile phone is permitted. But avoid carrying any other valuable gadgets & wearing jewelry while climbing & exploring.The place has elevation, hence expect wind.Down the hill are few restored places also of historic significance, which can also be explored and appreciated.Since this is are place of worship.

However, presently it has become a major commercial hub. There is another hillock opposite the Moula Ali Hill, called ""Qadam -e- Rasul"" on which the sacred relices of the prophet were supposedly deposited by Mohammad Shakrullah Rahan a servant of Asaf Jahi.

Shilparamam,Venkataraman M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-18,Not worth it!,"During the planning of our trip to Hyderabad, was told that this is one of the ""must see"" areas in the city. The closest comparision given was that of Dilli Haat, where I have been to and have enjoyed the experience there. I was therefore quite looking forward to the visit to this place. The place has an entry ticket of Rs. 50 for all adults (over the age of 10 years). The place was a complete disappointment and a waste of time. If you are coming here because you want to see the handicrafts and small scale/ cottage industry products, there are many other options available these days, where such exhibitions are held in nearly all the cities.There were very few traders there and the prices quoted by them were exorbitant. If you chose to walk away, you will get an immediate drop in price by as much as 33%. Clearly shows that the shopkeepers there have also become desperate.My recommendation is stay away and use your time more wisely in the city."

Area is clean and well maintained. Shopping is from individually licensed shopkeepers with specific stalls assigned. Be prepared to bargain anywhere from 25-60% in the price of items. The amount to be bargained depends on the uniqueness of the item and amount of hand work required.  For instance, the pashmina comes in a wide array of quality and print and many shops have it, bargain at least 50%.  Hand painted terra-cotta is much less coin and hand painted. Recommend coming in the evening when it’s cooler. Uber might be difficult during the rush hour. "

Birla_Science_Center,Gowrish P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Great place for children. But can do better.,"Birla Science Center and Planetarium are in the same complex. There is a separate listing for Planetarium. This is a review of the Science Center only.BSC is one of those places that every city needs and I am sure that was the intent of this as well. However, I can see that BSC could do more to keep up with the times. That said, this place is still a good place to spend half a day, including if you have children, say in primary and middle school.Location: Set atop a hillock, BSC boasts of some of the best views atleast to on three sides. You go up through a narrow hill to find the main gate to the left. There's *paid parking* inside the gates.*The ticket counter* is right by the parking lot and pick up all your tickets beforehand. *Suggested itinerary* is to visit the Planetarium and then go to the BSC. That way you can visit the BSC without anxiety of the show time of the Planetarium.What to do: These are the key venues here*Interactive Science Center at the reception or Ground level *Archeological Exhibits at Level -1. This level also has the Nirmala Birla personal collection section.*Remote Sensing and IEEE exhibits at Level 1*Dinosaurim at Level 2*Interactive center is where children will enjoy the most. It shows with hands on experience how some fundamental principles of physics, mostly, work. Some exhibits were not working or in poor condition. Signages were missing in a few places.*Archeological collection is worth the visit. It traces thousands of years of cultural and art history - war implements, household and occupational tools, scriptures, a good collection of South India mythological sculptures and paintings, coins and other miscellaneous artifacts. Do not miss the *Room Royale* that houses some of the rarest and most expensive item of interest including an ornate carpet, one guard told us, runs into hundreds of crores in value. There are no descriptive signages for anything. They are labeled, but do not tell much. BSC could consider providing audio tours for the exhibits to provide appropriate context.*Remote Sensing and IEEE* floor has some computer based and model based learning around how RS technology is applied  to the field of archeology and agriculture. Some models of advanced physics concepts are displayed here. E.g. How Raman Effect is used in Oncology.*Dinosaurim* is interesting too. The full scale skeleton of Sauropod makes for a good exhibit. The artifacts, here, were found in the neighborhood of Hyderabad I.e in Adilabad. *The guards are intrusive* about not taking pictures, while there really was no signage on this floor prohibiting pictures. One should wonder why this should be even prohibited. This is a nuisance.All in all this good place to spend indoors, in summer.Some additional pointers for BSC management:* You have a grand reception counter, but it was not at all manned. There is nothing useful there even if someone were present. Can some information and brochures be put up here?* What is the use of a Pearl Shop for a souvenir shop? This is a an example of where BSC could keep up with the times. There's  much opportunity lost for marketing BSC here."

Zero maintenance. Some exhibits are falling apart, or already gone.Most of the displays are outdated, even the staff don't seem to care about them.The science museum could have so much more potential to become a centre that excites young individuals to pursue science, and instigate excitement about the same. Science museums across the world use much better technologies, display fonts and methods, interactive science displays, right lighting & positioning etc.Audio tours, guided tours, merchandise selling etc. can add additional revenue to the science centre (which can be used hopefully for maintenance / upgrade).I sincerely hope this centre gets a much needed renovation, and gets updated on the modern advancements in science. - Mayank"

It has objects related to history, science, space and dinosaurs. The trip is definitely worth the money. The most unique part is the history section in which there are idols that are older than 1000 years! The ground floor had many experiments, which show the workings of scientific principles in a practical sense. The 1st floor had models of the part of Antarctica which is controlled by India and had the model of the sunken city of Dwarka (very informative). The 2nd level had the bones and information on Dinosaurs and other animals that lived with the dinosaurs. The museum has a lot to show and see so it could be completed in about 3 hours. We have visited many Science Museums, and we can surely say that the history and Dinosaur section is better than those at most places."

Planetarium: Amazing experience , specially for students and science enthusiast. Well explanation and 360° screen are like you are sitting under clear sky. Though , I felt explanation can be made little easier fir understanding of school children.2. 3D movie about solar and space facts:Great for young school children knowing already and having watched many 3 movies it felt boating. 3. Art Galary : perhaps biggest one I hva visited so far. Spread on 3 floors, most people just visit modern art Galary and miss the best part. In front of art Galary there is huge series of art, Specially we liked painting by Iqbal Hussain on Indian Mythology and history . Amazing details. I wish I could take photos but it wasn't allowed.4.Dianasorium: Huge skeleton of Dianasour found near Hyderabad and information are gear. Touching 200 million old fossil is just a great experience.5.Science Museum with live experiments: this is just a unique experience of day to day life physics. Huge learning for any student. There is IEEE experiments to hands on too. This must for any student to visit.Overall, in 200 per head, this is most fun place in Hyderabad so far."

Birla_Science_Center,CaptainBasu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,"Great potential, poor maintenance","The place is a storehouse of some greatly intriguing science objects. However, it is very poorly maintained. The planetarium is small but the explanations were clear. Remember to bring lots of water on a summer day. Though not too big, you will need to walk up and down a number of stairs.Suggest climb right up to the planetarium first (shows in English starts at 1130) walking your way down thru the galleries on different levels to reach the science museum at the ground level. There is a separate ticket for the Planetarium which includes the 3D show, and separate ones for the rest of the place. The entry prices kept changing based on God knows what. It was RS.60 on Monday when we arrived, but came up to RS.80 by Wednesday when we actually visited.The science section needs serious maintenance, many gizmos are either inoperative or totally absent.  The Planetarium offers some interesting shows along with the 3D theatre of the seven wonders of Solar system. Expect to spend three hours at leisure."

Birla_Science_Center,lonetraveler1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,"We had budgeted for an hour, spent over 3","This place is like a one stop treasure trove for children. The one star that is missing from the rating is for air conditioning. Otherwise, its a perfect place to spend the day with children. They will spend the day discovering, learning, experimenting and watching. At the end of 3 hours, we were still not done. The Nirmala Birla Dolls Museum , then the Archeology museum, where we really saw the grandeur of our past - stone age, iron age, pottery meticulously preserved, terracotta animal figurines that reminded me of Harappa valley pottery figurines.  Then there was Indian painting, Philately, Numismatics, Art. It was 2 hours before the children exited just the basement floor. Then we went to the science experience center, where children play with specially created learning toys. You can easily put kids there for 90 minutes and forget about them. After that it was time for the observatory in the planetarium next door, so off we went. We could see Mars (nothing impressive) and Jupiter(we saw the stripes of Jupiter and the 4 moons of Jupiter). It was awesome! Then we came back to the Dinosaurium. It has a full skeleton of a large dinosaur, one preserved egg fossil, and some bone fossils. Its an awe inspiring skeleton. The building is basic, but that skeleton.. is something!! We missed the space and Antartica Diorama, but we have seen that earlier. MOre than anything else, this visit got me thinking about private museums in the country. This was absolutely fantastic."

We palnned to go early in the morning. So that we have more time to enjoy water sports. Its a great experience and also its a very fun place with lot of physical exercise. Because to slide in the water sports we have to climb 2 stairs. So it was lot of exercise for our body to climb. We enjoyed entire day. It is also a great exercise for us and lot of fun. We also enjoyed the ropeway but Water sliding is the best of all.

I was confused between Wondala and this park before going. I was thinking this park wont be good and we wont be having much fun there. I would like to say this park is worth for the money and as I went with family this park was sufficient for them.Even most of ride here my family member could not able to do it because they got tired and ride was a bit difficult. It has numerous of water rides and I hope it will like everyone.We have enjoyed alot and at the end I thought it was a good decision to go there in a budget.It has difficult and easy water ridesI and non water ride too.  would suggest you to carry you own nylon(Swimming cloth) because they will charge 100rs for each person.It would be good if you go on a weekend or any festival time because you will get more people there after all fun will only come if people are more. Charges: Adult 450/- Child(More than 2.6 Inc.) 350/-Overall I would like to say It is good park and you will enjoy with your family."

Make sure u eat only after u take water rides else u might suffer from omitting 12. City cabs like ola uber take much more charges since this place is outside city limit so they charge heavily.

Ocean_Park_India,Nishant Ujjwal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Average Park with average cleanliness and average rides. ,Don't expect too much from this water park. It got basic rides only and all are not working some are under maintenance always. Their are only two waterparks in hyderabad one is jalvihar and the second one is ocean Park. This is better than jalvihar. If you have been to some very good water parks than this will be disappointing for you.  cleanliness is not their.  Mainly school crowd will be their. Toilets  and changing rooms are in very pathetic and unhygienic condition. Some rides are also their you can also enjoy them. All over its an average water park if you don't have anything to do on weekend and you are waterpark freak than you can pay a visit otherwise I will not suggest. The ticket cost is 350 rupees per head excluding locker charges costume charges. You can take your own costumes but they should be of nylon only. Word of caution is that always  take sufficient cash over their with you as that place is in isolated location and no ATM is their within 5Km of area. Moreover the ocean Park authorities are not accepting any card only cash.  I didn't understood what is this stupidity.

Ocean_Park_India,vishal n,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,It kind of needs renovation.,I visited this place once but was disappointed when reached there. Not a single good ride and water rides were just ok. Not a good experience at all.

Ocean_Park_India,seedhunter,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Just ok,"Ocean park is located near Gandipet (Osman Sagar Lake) and Golkond Resort. Although lot of water activities are there, but maintenance is an issue. Highly crowded on weekend."
Ocean_Park_India,dikshit_umk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-14,Ocean Park,This is most visited place by school children in there Picnic / Excursion day.Because of its varieties of Water Games.It is best to visit in Summer Season to get more Water Sports and also on weekends for Special Treats.
Ocean_Park_India,madabushi,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,"IN bad shape:Good facility for kids and excellent water sports, but needs real total manitenance","Ocean park as we visited 10 years back was far better and clean Than now.   Now some of the rides are not working.   Overall There needs to be a good maintenance schedule, lest the whole park will be lost with no visitors or by the curse of the visitors.Water in the pool needs to be cleaned.   As at entry itself ticket cost is slightly more, many rides are free inside.  There are some more ride and shows with charges, But did not venture in to them.   Bumping car was ok, especially kids will enjoy very much.  Wave pool is  fine as it was before, and enjoyable.  Kids enjoyed well.   no food is permitted to carry  inside. Food and snacks and hot and cool drinks are available inside for purchase Some pf them are ok.Better to go on weekdays to avoid overcrowd."
Ocean_Park_India,urenig,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Very crowded,"Very very crowded during summer and not maintained well. The locker room n bathrooms are not that good, neither is the food canteen. Since it is away from the city not much option of eating anywhere else esp. when u are spending the entire day! The water games are kind of OK."
Ocean_Park_India,Purandhar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Friends,Good,Nice place but they need to work on there maintenance. The wave pool has a lot of dead flies in the water. The water slides are really fun. I recommend going on a weekday if you can as it is less crowded. The food is average. The last thing I say is if you are under 5 feet there are very few rides you can do.

Ocean_Park_India,testingtest1,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Pathetic place. Please avoid,"Poor pathetic place. Do yourself a favor and avoid going here. Very basic park. Amenities are horrible. They call it as a water park but so little water. And its so dirty. Also the worst crowd I have ever seen. Rides are in a pathetic condition.,food available inside is ok. Would not risk taking children and getting some infections. Too many mosquitoes. Cannot even stand in a place for 10 second. Don't go. You have been clearly informed."
Ocean_Park_India,rajvchins,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Good outing for a weekend,"I went there on a Saturday afternoon about 3 - 3.30 pm ... Overall experience was very good. My expectation was not quite much other than hoping water will be clean. The slides 6-7 of them are amazing fun although you can do them only twice as much. Overall park is clean and water is also clean. Only not very good part of the ladies and kids pool only but fortunately it's a solo area so men cannot really complain about that. There was food around the area, kids naked and diapers around but that didn't throw the experience off since my wife only went there and immediately came back. They can do some more work on the changing area too.The best part is the rides are there are all free and easily you can get them on it without waiting which makes it worth after a day in the pool."
Ocean_Park_India,Robin A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Fun with some group,Good to visit in scoring sun to get relief in water rides.Can be good with group of families or for team outing.Nice hang out place. Music and food is good.
Ocean_Park_India,sanjay v,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,beat the heat for sure,"I know there are very few options near Hyderabad where you can actually beat the heat and Ocean park is still playing the same role. I firstly visited the place 6 years back and heard a lot of negative things since then so couldn't dare to go again but last weekend I somehow convinced my family to give it a try and can you imagine.....we were not able to cover all the facilities because we left pool very late. Wave pool was just amazing and they are still maintaining it so guys don't think much and give it a try and I'm sure you will be amazed. However don't expect much on food part but still there are lot of options to try like South Indian, packaged food. I personally suggest not to try Chinese as it tasted bad with lot of oil so try Dosas, Idli etc.Below point may help you more to decide1: Its just 12 KM from Gachibowly OOR circle so very near to visit and better to reach by 11 AM as you will get ample amount of time to enjoy the wave pool.2: Waves are active for 3 times a day and timings are displayed there so be there to enjoy the amazing waves. I call it best family day so kids also enjoy upto fullest3: Entry fee is 250 for adult and 230 for kid below 4 feet. I believe this is the least entry fee with almost all free water slides/rides. You may have to pay extra for bumping car.......yes you can enjoy bumping cars and more. We enjoyed a lot on colliding on bumping cars.4: Better to come out of the pool by 5:00 PM so you get extra time to roam there while sunset and capture some memories. Good greenery at entry gate and near cafeteria.5: Clean water to enjoy the pool and you can rent the arm bands and swimming rings. However balls are not allowed to play inside to protect others safetyHowever its very old water park of Hyderabad but still maintained. I could see just 1 ride not working which is possible anywhere. I still rate it higher because we have very less options like this.Hit like if I helped a bit in deciding a good weekend. Happy summers :)"
Ocean_Park_India,tricksee2,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,"Good for team outings, but not amazingly awesome","I didn't have as much fun with friends as I was expecting to, but I'd say worth a visit. Anything you buy inside is slightly on the expensive side, but it has some decent water sports.I'd say it's better to go with officemates and colleagues on team outings for a few hours, it is designed to be fun that way. I wouldn't visit again on my own budget, but it is worth a one time see."

Charges are as per height.Food is also available and is OK (don't expect much).Swim costumes are available on rent and they charge Rs.100.There are some small shops outside the park who sell the swim wear for mens for Rs.80/-, so better to buy instead of renting in the park."

The water rides were thrilling enough ... the water was maintained well (if u see ocean park from the outside, u wont have much expectations before stepping in :P ).. the land/dry rides do not function at all ! hence, one is limited to only water rides. it is fun if u go with a big group... :) the shower dance plays great music....and the dolby sound is also good.. the wave pool was fun! overall, this place is recommended.. do not expect high fi stuff (like wonderla).. hence costumes are given on rent. they are clean and nice.. the changing room is just basic. although the ocean park gives u a old world feel, it still works for people looking for some fun... the food is okayish!! carry extra money inside, since there are carnival games like, shoot the darts, bungee jump, ride the bull, cricket etc which is not included in the park entry."

Ocean_Park_India,Sree1972,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May-12,Nice water rides but costly and horrible food,The water rides in ocean park are very good. The area meant only for women is absolutely fantastic. The water falling from the water bucket is a thrilling experience. We have visited many theme parks but this is special bcoz it is one of the earliest theme parks in Hyderabad. The circle ride is awesome as at one point of time we are upside down. The other rides are also good but now their condition needs to be revamped. The food within the premises is costly and horrible in taste. We had to survive on packed foods like chips etc.
Ocean_Park_India,RohitDassani,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2012 • Couples,Dont waste your money,The place is old and most of the rides are under maintenance. Most of the rides are for small kids and there is little for adults. The water rides are ok but the whole setup is shabby. Most of the staff are always on break or plug-in mode. There us very little on the foods menu. The worst part is the changing area. The bathroom are really bad and smells sick. Please do not go there and waste your precious money.

Paigah_Tombs,Fernweh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-21,Don't miss this beautiful art when in Hyderabad,"This place is very beautiful. The art in lime and mortar is sadly neglected and forgotten. The navigation to this place can be a bit difficult but once you reach the area near the tombs, locals will help you. Google Maps worked for me. Also, one can book uber or ola till here. The place is safe for solo visitors, the elderly, or couples. I visited this place alone and as a solo female visitor, I felt very safe. A family stays nearby and they willingly tell the place's history. Its high time that this place is protected and restored. A visit to Hyderabad is incomplete if this place is missed."
Paigah_Tombs,Christopher F,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Solo,Located in a dangerous neighborhood. I do not recommend for solo or couple’s.,"The first thing that I want to say is that this historical site is located in a very poor and what appeared to be a very dangerous neighborhood. The road leading to the site is a dirt road and not properly displayed on the Uber drives GPS. The Uber driver asked me if I wanted to walk the 100 additional meters to the site but the neighborhood looked dangerous enough that I requested he both drive me to the front and wait until I exited the site. I was hounded by young men as soon as I left the Uber for tours and for money and the young man what time to tell me the tourist we’re not safe in the neighborhood. Long story short I took a quick look at the site got back in the Uber and left immediately. I would not recommend the side to any of my friends nor family and if they decided to go I would recommend that they take as many people as possible as not to be alone. As most if not all historic sites in Hyderabad this one is poorly maintained too. The cobblestone sidewalks are all loose and uneven, the grass and greenery is overgrown and trash all over. All that being said the tombs were beautiful and intricately carved"
Paigah_Tombs,53Ruta_R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-19,difficult to find,"It is easy to get lost finding Paigah Tombs as they are located in a maze of alleys. Blink and you could miss the entrance as it is hidden behind a tree on a quiet street. Once found, and you enter, a different world is present. The lime and mortar tombs are over 200 years old."
Paigah_Tombs,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,Don't come back without visiting this architectural jewel.,"The word Paigah, which means pomp and rank in Persian, was a title given by the second Nizam of Hyderabad to Nawab Abul Fateh Taig Jung Bahadur, founder of the Paigah family. Fiercely loyal to the Nizams, the powerful Paigah nobility maintained their own private army and the local police and courts had no jurisdiction over them or their property. Their necropolis in Hyderabad has intricate stucco work, reminiscent of the World heritage sites of Alhambra palace in Granada and Alcazar palace in Seville, SpainThe tombs are enclosed in carved screens and canopies of lime and mortar. The stucco reliefs closely resemble Byzantine art while the Moorish influences can be seen on arabesques details stucco reliefs and the domes. These tombs represent an eclectic mix of the Mughal, Persian, Moorish, Byzantine, Rajasthani and Deccani style of architecture which are unparalleled in India. Ornate trellises, beautifully carved pillars intricate lattice work and embellished domes surround the mini mausoleums. Some of the tombs are enclosed in Chaukhandis entered through ornate wooden doors made of mahogany, teak or rosewood. Entry is free and so is photography. Plan to spend at least two hours if you want to fully appreciate the architecture. Most tourists are not even aware of this gem and hence you may find yourself to be the only tourist here!"

Paigah_Tombs,Ashok Kumar M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Story of Apathy and Neglect !!,"These beautifully and intricately carved monuments are a very sad story of neglect and apathy by the Archaeological Survey of India and the State Governments. No entrance fee. Scarcity of visitors. Situated in the dense residential area about 4 kms from Charminar they are difficult to locate in absence of proper sign boards. But the parking on the road in front of the gate is no problem. only the caretaker is there to tell something.The photos published on TA could be misleading as they do not indicate a bit the extent of deterioration and depletion in absence of maintenance and care they deserve. Felt very sad. However, the place is  worth visiting and should not be missed in Hyderabad. Suggest to read the review on TA by OneLifeFewClicks before visitng Paigah Tombs."

Paigah_Tombs,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"Surprising gem, not the easiest place to reach though","The Paigah Tombs are a place, that is really hard to reach and one can easily get lost trying to find them. Located in a crowded residential area, I missed it entirely the first time and stumbled on to it accidentally, the second time. There are hardly any signs to it and the entrance too is hardly conspicuous.Entrance to the complex is free. It contains tombs of the Paigah nobles, who were the Nizam's closest confidants and were the only ones, whi intermarried with members of the Nizam's family. Unlike the simple tombs of the Nizams, the Paigah tombs are architecturally vivid. A number of floral motifs and decorations adorn many of these tombs, which belong to the noblemen, their wives and children.Maintenance of the complex is a concern and lighting is another one. The tombs have, in many places, been left to the mercy of the elements and encroachment by the residents nearby is a threat. Charging a fee for its maintenance is the first step towards reviving this important piece of heritage, before it disappears."

It was late that we realised that we should still follow the road to get to the tombs. So next time..."
Paigah_Tombs,travelswithali,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan-18,Afternoon visit,We hired a driver to take us to these tombs as I had read about them and thought they would be worth a look.  Its a very restricted entrance the driver had to ask for directions on how to enter.  We were the only three people visiting here.  Very quiet and peaceful.  Had a lovely tour by the 19yr old caretaker.  He said he was third generation of caretakers and seemed very proud of his position.  They are fascinating tombs very intricate in design.  I'm not sure how much longer these will last as they look very derelict in places with walls crumbling around us.  There was no entrance fee which seemed strange and also no box to put in any donation.  I did give the young boy something as it looked like he was living in squalor.

Paigah_Tombs,OneLifeFewClicks,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Paigah Tombs – An Architectural Masterpiece,"Paigah Tombs or Maqhbara Shams al-Umara are one of the famous monuments of Hyderabad city which are known for their excellent architectural beauty.Paigah Tombs were constructed by the Paigah family, who were very close and extreme loyals of the Nizams of Hyderabad. Their loyality towards Nizams and later matrimonial alliances with them made Paigahs very influential during 18th century. 'Shams al-Umara’ was a title which was given to Paigahs by Nizams which means 'the sun amongst the masses'.Abdul Fateh Khan Tegh Jung was the first who was buried in 1786 at the place which later became the family Maqbara built as later generations of the members of their families were also burried there.There are 27 tombs in the main complex; rest of the tombs of the family is just outside it.Paigah and their love for Art & Architecture:The Paigahs were the great patrons of arts and have made several palaces including Falaknuma Palace. Their love for art is seen even in their exquisite tombs. The Paigah tombs are example of Indo-Islamic architecture, with a mix of both the Asaf Jahi and the Rajputana styles of architecture. The décor in fabulous stucco work, represents the Mughal, Persian and Deccan style too. The tombs are in the shape of “Chaukhandis” with latticed panels but open to sky. (Chaukhandi – A dome like structure on 4 pillars The crypts are made of lime and mortar and have intricate marble inlay work and stucco.The surrounding beautiful structure of walls has latticed panels with geometrical and floral design. The geometrical designs in the Paigah Tombs are unique and are perforated with screens with great craftsmanship. The Tomb of Asman Jah and Begum Khurshid Jah attract maximum number of tourists. The structures are made of marble and were once adorned with precious and semi-precious stones which changed colours with the change of seasons. The Tombs are enclosed by a wall which is ornamented with lattice work and exotic floral and geometric designs. Each wall is done up differently with fruits, drums, serpents, flowers, vases, etc.The mausoleums have exemplary craftsmanship, utilizing elaborate canopies and marble fences done in trellis-work that are made up of geometric and floral designs. Arches fringed by smaller semi-circular arches–a feature unique to India–are also employed. Another interesting point of the place is that all the tombs have unique designs carved on them differently.  Travelers Note:The architectural beauty of the place makes it a must-see place for tourists. This place is dazzling sight for someone who is visiting this place first time in case you are from Hyderabad. The serene and peaceful place will compel you to slow down, pause and reflect on the grandeur of the bygone times.The magnificent tombs and its intricate designs are a delight for photographers. Student and people involved in architecture may find this place very interesting in terms of design and one never know what inspirations this might give you.At first sight the place looks deserted and somewhat ignored. Although there is a family staying there and taking care of it but this architectural wonder is now more than 200 years old and demanding a better care and some restoration work from our side.You can visit these tombs on all days, except on Fridays. To visit Paigah tombs, the timings are from 10 am to 5 pm.There is no entry fee to this place, but the care taker is also a very warm person and guides you around and shares some info, in expectation of some ""fees"". This is open to your discretion. The pointer on the Google maps is accurate, so do not be confused by the unassuming entrance. There is a small signboard too, that should help identify the place.Footwear is to be left outside the elevated platform of the tombs, so if it’s mid-day when you reach a pair of socks should be useful in summers as the stones get quite warm.You would ideally need about 45 to 60 minutes to soak in this place, photographers and architecture students may need more based on their levels of interest."

There are native Hyderabadis who have never been to this place.  The only reason I found out about this place and visited it was because of pictures I had seen on Instagram.

However, it is worth a visit for anyone interested in architecture. Several different styles (Islam, Hindu and even Roman) can be seen in various structures here. Begging for maintenance and restoration, some of the structures seem to be fast crumbling. The caretaker of this monument (an old gentleman) would show around the place and explain the intricacies with much passion and interest."

Paigah_Tombs,plan41,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Couples,Paigah Royal Tombs,"Paigahs were very respected and close relatives of the Nizams - the Asaf Jahi Rulers of Hyderabad. They were noble men whose families got integrated with the Nizams' families through matrimony. The title of ""Paigah"" - signifying exclusivity and closeness in relationship with the Rulers - was first conferred by the Second Nizam of Hyderabad on these men of high integrity, discipline and commitment to peace, while also being good warriors. There are about 27 Royal Tombs in these premises which are located within an area of one acre, approachable closely from the main highway leading to the Shamshabad International Airport of Hyderabad City opposite a location known as Owaisi Hospital. The architecture of these tombs, their entrance doors and compound walls is unique and rare. There are several beautiful motifs latticed in marble and limestone imported from Rajasthan and are a delight to watch in close analytical observation with a discerning eye. No two designs are similar. Another noteworthy feature is the adoption of both Hindu and Islamic icons designed and merged in a very aesthetic and intelligent manner - perhaps signifying the absolute unity and integrity of the people belonging to the two religions in those days of Nizams' Rule. There is a beautiful Mosque at one end of the complex, where people pray with their voices sweeping across the tombs. The whole place is serene, calm and worthy of spending a few quiet moments by any tourist visiting the Paigah Tombs!"
Paigah_Tombs,plan41,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Couples,Paigah Tombs,"Amongst the nobility of Hyderabad, the Paigah Family was second only to that of the Nizams of Hyderabad to whom they were attached by matrimony. The term ""Paigah"" is of Persian origin which means ""Pomp and Rank"". This was an honorofic title conferred by the Second Nizam of the Asaf Jahi Dynasty (1724 to 1948 AD). The Paigah Nobles were staunch loyalists of the Asaf Jahis, magnanimous, well-versed in war and peace, supported scholarship and patronized Art and Culture. 27 members of the Paigah Family lie buried in these tombs., which are spread over an area of one acre. A beautiful mosque is alongside the elegantly carved and architectured tombs in white limestone and marble - imported from Rajasthan - that facilitates people to pray from the ""Mehrab"" (Pulpit) to echo over the ""Qabr"" (Tomb). The place is located in Santoshnagar off the main Highway leading to the present Shamshabad International Airport, in a rather narrow, obscure and not-so-prominent lane opposite to the Owaisi Hospital, but the site is very much worth visiting. Its architecture and the design of the complex are unique, rare and no two designs are similar or comparable. Of curiosity and interest are the rare inter-mingling of both Hindu and Muslim motifs in a most intelligent and appealing manner, integrating the same beautifully into the overall magnificence of these structures. The place within the complex is so serene and peaceful and is awe-inspiring!"
Paigah_Tombs,117abbas,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Friends,Inticate stucco tracery and fine marble carvings,"Way out of the normal tourist track and a little difficult to locate, are he Paigahh tombs which are the resting place of the Paigah nobles, second in hierarchy to the Nzams. They in fact competed with the Salar Jungs for top position at the court.They were in fact the Defence Ministers of the state over a long period, from late 18th century till Hyderabad becane a part of India in 1948.The first tomb built in 1789 is of pure marble with superb embellishments. The others following are similarly lavishly carved in marble, reminding a visitor of the Taj Mahal. In fact this complex ha been called the SuthernTaj Mahal though in size they are miniscule.The stuccio work on the walls is quite mind boggling, looks like someone has carved  in wax!!Unfortunately, the complex has not been maintained well, otherwise it would be a rival to any of the popular monuments of Hyderabad.Your entry to the tomb complex is quite complicated. From the Santoshnagar Bangalore road, you have to tske a right turn (left if you are coming from the airport/Bangalore side) into a narrow lane  and then ask for directions from any passersby.Once you drive a little into the lane, to you right you will see the board to the complex entry which is just a few metres in the side lane surrounded by houses"

The tombs are well maintained, the details and patterns are stunning and if you get a guide (there is an old man who looks after the tombs) who will also sing if you're nice, there's nothing like it. The whole complex is out of this world. It can get quite deserted in the evening so you should plan to leave the place as soon as the sun starts setting."

A classic India experience with old world architecture and modern day garbage strewn about. On a really positive note, I was there in August of 2014 and they are currently refinishing a few of the tombs. There were stone masons working in the court yards. Absolutely fascinating to watch. This is a must see with minimal tourist. A truly intimate experience. Do yourself a favor and tip the attendee at the main tomb. He will show the real tomb on the underground floor as well as do a ""Call to Prayer"" in the main tomb. An real thrill if you are running a video recorder. "

Paigah_Tombs,asmterrace,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Friends,Where the rulers of the paradise come to rest,"What strikes when you enter the Paigah tombs is the tranquility that welcomes you. Interned here are people who were served by battalions of soldiers and servants yet the melancholic solitude pierces through your heart and tel you that hard fact of life "" you may live among millions but you rest alone"".In a nonchalant bye lane where the residents are least concerned about the history around lies few people who lead once of the most glorious personal and social life which made even emperors jealous. What attracts a visitor is in intrinsic art work and caligraphy displayed in the building. To appreciate the place a little knowledge of the history of Hyderabad is required. PAIGAHs are the foremost aristocratic family in the social pyramid of Nizam era Hyderabad , rich more than several maharajas and were paramount palace builders. Their loyalty to the NIZAM was iron strong . An example : A Paigah noble is believed to have refused to bow before the might British Emperor during the Delhi Durbar because his own ruler NIZAM was around. His logic was he cannot serve two masters and he would stick his loyalty to his NIZAM. NIzams rewarded this loyaly with close marital relationships and huge tax collection rights. Standing next to the tomb of Vicar ul umra, one can only lower the head when once knows that the great FALAKNUMA, PAIAGAH palaces and Vicar manzil are made by him. HIs generosity and thirst for fine life has made quite a few unbelievable folklore which facts will vouch that are true. The garden around is neglected but the care taker by his personal interest is trying to garner funds from government through few public interest litigation filed before courts. One can only leave the place with a sigh that the where the rulers of the paradise come to rest may be taken cared slightly better and will retain its importance in the list of the archaeological department.

Many of the auto drivers don't know this location, and we had to drive around a bit to find it.

I understand there has been good amount of rains but despite sun shine for more than a day and with lot of modern day equipment the ground should have been ready for the decider match. This shows the poor management of the ground authorities.They were using fans to dry the wet patches in the ground which was even more annoying."

The ground has had its share of controversy. The first came with the name, which the state government changed to honour a former Indian prime minister. The HCA had to pay out the contractors - Visaka Industries - after whom the stadium was originally named. Then, ten days before what would have been its first first-class match - between the Australians and Mumbai - the ground was deemed unfit to host a big match. But the stadium is now ready, a state-of-the-art facility, complete with floodlights installed in April 2008 in time for hosting the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League."

At that time he heard repeatedly the Roar of Tiger and followed that direction but didn't find tiger. After moving further he heard the Chanting ""Sri Ram"" and then discovered the idol of Hanuman. In the same day night dream god Hanuman asked him to build a Temple at that place.  On the very next day King laid the foundation for the temple. This is happened in 12th Century in 1143 AD Way back in 1679, The Mughal Emperor Aurangazeb passed an official order of demolishing Hindu temples and this was also one of that, But his entire force tried to destroy and not succeed in their act. they gone back to King and reported the same. Then King decided to go in person to destroy the temple. He also not succeeded and some invisible  force was pushed out. He heard a  Voice that ""Pahle tum karo man ghat"" First make your mind strong. with this finally he didn't succeed and vent back. with this story this place is named as Karo man ghat later become Karmanghat.

The main deity is Lord Hanuman. Established in 12th century It has an interesting history. It is said that King of Kakitya dynasty while on a hunting expedition in the jungles around this area was taking rest when he heard some voice chanting Lord Ram's bhajans and it was a stone carved like Lord Hanuman. Then he ordered the installation of that large Stone (vigraha) and built a temple around it. For regular income to this temple, he arranged revenues from the nearby village which is now named Karmanghat. There is also an interesting story about the name of the temple. In 16th century, the Moghul emperor attacked Golconda and ordered the demolition of all temples nearby but his soldiers could not do so when they reached the temple because of some divine light and noise. Then the emperor came himself and was about to hit the temple deity when he heard a divine voice KAR (do) MAN (heart) GHAT (hard), which means Harden your heart and thus afraid he went away. There are many other small temples with deities of Lord Ganesha,Rama, Shiva, goddess Durga and others. About 3 years back, the temple was renovated and a grand 'gopuram' was constructed. I have been visiting this temple almost once a month for several years. It has a large courtyard and the main sanctum is also very spacious.

Karmanghat_Hanuman_Temple,plan41,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-15,"ŚRĪ DHYĀNĀNJANÉYASWĀMI TEMPLE, “KAR-MAN-GHAT”, HYDERABAD","Laxmi and I were inspired a few days ago to visit and offer our prayers to the Powerful Deity – Lord Śrī Dhyānānjanéyaswāmi of this most holy, ancient temple located in what is known as “Kar-Man-Ghat” – that got gradually transformed into “Karmanghat” over the  nine centuries of its existence to the present date when people continue to revere Lord Śrī Hanumān and seek His protection and blessings for success in their pursuits in life – and He indeed ensures that their pleas are answered by His eternal grace – provided His devotees are honest,  humble, sincere, righteous and non-injurious to others. The Temple is located in a  sprawling area adjoining the highway leading from LBNagar to the City’s Airport at Shamshabad. The whole complex is very serene and peaceful – quite conducive to the mind to be calm while offering prayers. There are as many as 15 temples located in the campus, dedicated to almost all the principal gods who are usually worshipped in the Hindu pantheon. The story behind the origin and existence of this Temple is true and historic: King Padaraju of Kakateeya Rulers of Warangal, located about 150 kms. east of Hyderabad, had built the historic Golconda Fort. His son Prince Pratap Rudradeva the Second, while on a hunting expedition, got tired of a tiger hunt and stopped to rest at an isolated location where suddenly he heard a constant recitation in prayer to the Hindu God Lord Śrī Rāma in a very melodious voice. Curious to know the origin of  the voice in a wild and deserted area, he searched around and discovered a five-feet high idol. Later, in a dream, he was commanded by a Divine Will to preserve the idol in a Temple and arrange for daily oblations to be performed to the Deity represented by the idol, which is none other than that of Lord Hanuman, the faithful servant of Lord Śrī Rāma of the Hindu epic Rāmāyaņa. Since He was heard  reciting the prayer addressing Lord Śrī Rāma, the Deity was named Dhyānānjanéyaswāmi and a grand Temple was built in the present location in the year 1143 AD. The Temple became very famous and renowned for its miraculous powers, ever since then…Golconda Fort was annexed from the then Qutb Shahi Rulers by the Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb in the year 1687 AD.  Aurangzeb, in his intolerance towards Hindu religion, went on destroying several temples and when his warriors came to destroy this Temple, they were chased away by the Divine Power. Disbelieving, Aurangzeb himself went to demolish the Temple. When he approached the Temple entrance, he heard a deafening loud noise and was astonished to see a super-bright tall light extending over the height of the Temple. He then heard a sweet voice telling him “KAR MAN GHAT” – meaning: “Strengthen your heart”, before touching the Temple. The Emperor, quite convinced of the Power of the Deity presiding over this Temple had retreated with no second thought. The Temple had since then come to be known as “Karmanghat”.We were quite impressed by the serenity of the location, the forms of the deities, the religiosity, preservation of the ancient and time-tested methodology of worship and offering of various oblations to the respective deities in each of the fifteen  sacred ancillary temples – some very ancient, and so on. There is no entrance fee and people are free to worship in the mornings and evenings. There were no jostling crowds and one could have very comfortable darshan at each temple within the complex. For those who have faith and belief in Hinduism, a visit to this Temple – the oldest in the City, I guess – is highly recommended! On our part, Laxmi and I felt we were abundantly blessed…!"
Karmanghat_Hanuman_Temple,KASI VENKOBA RAO,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Lord Hanuman in Meditation,"Karmanghat Hanuman Temple is an ancient temple purported to have been built in the 12th Century. The main Deity is Lord Hanuman and said to be very powerful.  Large devotees gather at the temple to pay prayers to the Lord Hanuman and the number is ten times folded on Saturdays, said to be a auspicious day for the Lord. Daily pooja with Pan leaves and abhisekhams are performed at this temple. The complex has a huge space for parking of vehicles.The Legend say that a Kakatiya king went hunting and was resting under a tree, he heard the chanting of Lord Rama's name. Wondering who it was in the middle of a dense forest, he discovered a stone idol of Lord Hanuman, in seated posture and the voice coming from the statue. He paid his respects.and  returned to his capital, The same night, Lord appeared in his dream and asked him to construct a temple. The temple was built immediately and successive kings ruled it well.Later, Moghul Empire  Aurangzeb with an intention of expansion of his Kingdom sent out his armies to all corners of the country.  At this temple, the army couldn't even step close to the compound wall. When the General reported this to Aurangzeb, he himself went with a crow bar to break down the temple. At the threshold of the temple, he heard a loud roar rumblning like thunder, and the crowbar slipped from his hands as he was shaking in fear. Then he heard a voice in the heavens ""Mandir todna hai rajan, to kar man ghat"" meaning that if you want  to break down the temple, then make your heart stronger.Kar means make, man means Heart and Ghat means stronger.Since then this temple is being called as Karmanghat Hanuman temple.Since Lord Anjaneya sits peacefully meditating and blessing devotees,this Hanuman is also being called as ""Dhyana Anjaneya Swamy""."

While resting, the king heard someone chanting the name of Lord Rama, the king got interested and went around trying to find who it was and as he walked further deep into the forest, he discovered an idol of Lord Hanuman. The stone idol was in a sitting posture and the voice was coming from within the vigraham.

Masarrat Mahal It was constructed for third Nizam Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III by his father Ali Khan Bahadur, Asaf Jah II. The main building resembles 18th-century European palaces. A unique feature of this palace is the world's longest wardrobe, built in two levels with a hand-cranked wooden elevator in place. This occupies the entire length of one wing of the palace.Sikander Jah lived here for some time and later shifted to Chowmahalla Palace. Due to this, these buildings were also called Purani Haveli. The sixth and seventh Nizams were born at this palace, and did spend a part of their life at this palace."
Nizam_Museum,Christopher F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2021 • Solo,Pleasantly Surprised,I gave this museum five stars only because I was lucky enough to get a one on one with one of the staff. The tour was unexpected but the staff saw that I was very interested in the articles being exhibited so they reached out and asked me if I would like a tour and of course I agreed. The museum was small and was in need of some TLC but it had some very interesting objects. What interested me the most we’re all the gifts that the local ruler received from both his subjects￼ and visiting dignitaries. They were so many objects made of both gold and silver I was truly amazed I had no idea that it such a small museum could hold so many precious objects. The Museum was part of a one time palace the palace has the worlds longest wardrobe/closet recognized by the Guinness book of world records. I found that interesting. It was a small museum that will take you no more than 3540 minutes to go through thoroughly but like I said I enjoyed it because I receive that one on one with a tour guide. I am not sure but if you ask you might be able to enjoy that too.

Most of them have very little artistic or historical value. One walks through a hall lined with empty cabinets that were supposed to hold costumes and royal attire. Even lights are not switched on to illuminate the displays.The untold story is more interesting - of countless artifacts either stolen or sold off as contraband. What has remained in this museum is leftover of leftovers.Your time is better spent at Chowmahalla and Salar Jung Museum, just a short distance away.

Nizam_Museum,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"A gem, only if better maintained","The Nizam Museum is located in the Purani Haveli complex near the Charminar and is a very short distance away from the more famous Salar Jung Museum. However, though the distance is not much, the difference in terms of organization and maintenance of the museums is staggeringly large.The Nizam Museum is suffering from lack of maintenance. Owned privately by the Nizam's family, unlike the government-owned Salar Jung museum, this museum levies a much higher entrance charge. There are also separate higher charges for cameras (including mobile phones).The museum is spread across 4-5 rooms. Most of the first 3 rooms contain gifts given to the Nizams, while the 4th room is the Hyderabad city museum, which contains details about the city's evolution. Photography is not allowed in this part, even if one has purchased a photo ticket, which struck me as being quite strange.The last room is the Nizam's wardrobe, which actually has replicas of clothes worn during the Nizam's time. The most noteworthy thing is the old manually-operated lift. This place can be a major attraction, if maintained well. The staff seemed disinterested and at times, actively sought tips from visitors, so one needs to be cautious."
Nizam_Museum,Rajesh_in,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,"Average Museum , needs better maintenance","After Visiting Salar Jung Museum , we visited Nizam's Museum , which was a let down , as it is not maintained the way it should be. The surroundings and premises are not maintained well. Inside of the museum is not air conditioned and I am not sure what impact it does to the antique items being preserved & displayed there. The museum , I believe , is maintained privately by Nizam's family & not he government , hence the entrance ticket price is also much higher.I hope this museum is maintained well & promoted well."

Nizam_Museum,Alka Varma,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Nizam Museum,"Nizam Museum or popularly known as Purani Haveli, houses the most precious and fabulous collection of art and artefacts of the last Nizam. Infact all the precious gifts received on his silver jubilee celebrations are displayed here. You cannot reach the museum easily because of the accessibility through narrow bylanes. One can see hundreds of kids on its ground as part of it has been converted into a school. Unfortunately not many tourists visit here and thus not crowded. The museum has the golden wooden throne used for the silver jubilee celebrations, a golden tiffin box inlaid with diamonds and very precious daggers studded with diamonds , rubies and emeralds- all lie here in the display- which is not well maintained . Some of the objects lie in dusty almirahs crying for better lighting and display. The most unique thing here is a wardrobe of the 6th Nizam which is known to be the longest in the world and can hang 730 attires. It is well known that Nizam was very fond of dressing up. Then not to miss is a 150 year old manually operated wooden lift. Wish the European style building of the museum was better maintained. "

A elevator/lift which was manually-operated by a winding mechanism3. Nizam's huge walk-in closet. If I remember right, it's probably among the biggest in the world."

You pay 80rps to pretty much get a glimpse of how rich this dude was.  You also walk through his closet which is insane because he never wore the same clothes twice.  There are some facts written on the walls where you can learn about the founding of civilization in the region and just how much everyone liked the guy.  There was a guide who offered his services for a donation.

It is located in a bylane of the old city and is a 10 minute drive from Salar Jung museum. The only negative being that the building is not in a good condition and looks a bit scary. However considering you would not spend more than 30 minutes you could ignore this negative point.

Feels very educative to learn of various happenings pre and post independence.  The souvenirs and silver artifacts received by Osman Ali Khan, the last nizam is a sight of splendour. The hisorical happenings well etched and kept for public display in all columns of the rooms is quite informative.  The wardrobe section is in utter neglect with dripping rain water onto the cupboards and the carpets. The trust needs definitely needs more support to sustain itself, this being a private entity and funds are obtained from the visitor  tickets purchased and supposedly from the the grants of the former Nizami princess visiting this place from abroad at regular intervals to inspect its upkeep."

A must visit place for people who are interested in the history of Hyderabad. The exquisitely made artifacts and miniature models reveals the skill of the craftsmen of the era. But I am unable to understand why they charge for taking photographs. In my view the photos taken by the visitors, some of which may be published, adds to the fame of the place which will attract more visitors. I have been to Vatican Museum in Rome, one of the famous museums in the world, where they allow to photograph anything a visitor wants to.Though the exhibit's historical value and importance is indisputable, the premises is an eyesore! The compound was filled with filth and wild growth. One couldn't go near a washroom there as it was broken and leaky. I left the place feeling sorry and wondering when this place will be made attractive!"

Nizam_Museum,Payal G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Must visit,"This museum is not as aggressively promoted as the Salar Jung museum but is a bigger treasure trove of Nizam's valuables. If not for the gold and silver and a set of the world's largest Basra pearls go for the most unique wardrobe in the world - it's the largest one ever and several flats can be easily fit into it. The museum also houses a rare elevator (though tourists can't get into it). It's located in an old palace. If going by cab/uber watch out for signs as the GPS is misleading. Locals were generally unaware of this place so best to remember that it's just behind the children's hospital. The museum rooms are quite basic and can do with some sprucing up. Remember to take tickets for cameras at the entrance itself. However, the lighting inside is not conducive for photos so it can be skipped. Some of the staff are great guides - which we took as without the stories most of the fun is gone. Our guide Hyder Hussain was from a family of one of the Nizam's old retainers and hence was quite knowledgeable about the exhibits without being pushy. We paid around ₹200 to him."

Although it's not an official museum of Hyderabad and is situated in an old haveli of the grandson of the last Nizam, the artifacts are truly awe-inspiring. Although they all belong to one person, mostly garnered during one ocassion, the silver-jubilee celebration, it is definitely an impressive collection. For example the golden lunchbox carried by the Nizam during hunting or the vast corridor that acted as the Nizam's wardrobe housing a dress for each of the days of the year, never to be repeated again.

Lotus_Pond,Rajib Ghosh,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,Not A Tourist Destination,"Lotuses neither grow in this pond not it is shaped like one. Its a misnomer. Nestled in area between Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills, the Lotus pond is a water body surrounded by residential and commercial buildings.The pond itself is fenced with wire and does not allow stepping in and resting ones feet in the cold water. Being surrounded by political big-wigs and commercial offices, the narrow road around the lake is a traffic circus that is best avoided by one and all."

Lotus_Pond,outside o,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-15,"Nice spot if you're in the area, to me it is not a destination.","Nice spot to relax and walk around the pond.  Security guards keeping food, drinks, cameras, and ballyhoo outside the gates.  This place is only open in the wee hours (It think) and between 4-6 pm.  I am constantly frustrated by the closed hours of public parks.  You can walk around the pond in about 15-20 minutes, we usually stretch it to about 45 by letting our toddler toddle, and stopping to check out the turtles/fish/crabs which are easily seen en mass from the path directly opposite the main gait.  There is also a small wooded section off to the left of the main path with several covered pavilions.  We wandered through once or twice and it was mostly teenage boys carving their names into tree trunks while taking turns looking out for the guides and a couple of couples getting frisky in the shadows.  Looked like the pavilions  would be good for some morning exercises or yoga.  We never felt the least bit threatened in this area, but it is somewhat removed from the main trail and most of the people.  Overall, I visit this park once or twice a week due to proximity, would visit it more if it were open during the day.  Also, any birders, there is usually anywhere from 4-10 species of wading and water birds visible in the pond.  "

A large park, it attracts a number of people looking to spend some quiet moments away from the noise of the city.The best way to reach the park is by the neighbouring MMTS railway station, bearing the same name. The entrance fees is Rs. 20 for an adult. The park has a memorial to former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, Damodaram Sanjeeviah. It also has a butterfly park (but no butterflies) and a rose garden (where roses were still being planted), when I visited.The main attraction, however, is the giant national flag, which is the second tallest in India. When fully unfurled, it is a sight to see and can be seen from a significant distance. This is the best things about this park, else one can give it a miss."

Sanjeeviah_Park,Janet S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Good by Hyderabad standards,"This became one of our favorite places to walk while staying in Hyderabad because there were a couple areas in the park that actually were lovely, by any international standards...a rare thing in Hyderabad!  Of note is the rose garden, at the entrance, and the rock & desert plant garden in the back corner behind the rose garden.  Both are off limits to normal visitors.  We were told each time we tried to enter ""no entry"" and a security/gardener lady would come over to usher us out.  Finally, we just pretended not to understand and went wandering through anyway.  The desert area is amazing, with some plants that I had never even seen before.  Well maintained and pristine, without trash!  After the first time, we just continued to not pay attention to the ""no entry"" and finally they would give up.  After a couple days, they stopped bothering us and we wandered alone through these areas.  The entire park is large and well utilized during the weekends, turning into a huge party place with the resulting trash.  The playground is in deplorable condition, but entrance fee is only Rs 15."

Pochampalli,Prakash,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Pochampalli - Land of the Ikkat Saree,"Pochampalli (officially called Bhoodan Pochampilli) is a small village located in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district of Telangana. It is world famous for its weaving of Ikkat Saris and other textiles. It is on the tentative list of UNESCO world heritage sites. Situated under 45 Kms from Hyderabad City (around 57.5 Kms for the RGI International Airport) it can be reached by taxi or bus. As most of the drive is on the 8-lane Nehru Outer Ring Road (ORR) expressway, the drive is generally smooth. The town is situated 11.5 Kms off the ORR. One needs to pay Toll while exiting the ORR for the distances covered. One can see bunches of cute little monkeys on the road leading from ORR to Pochampalli..In the village one can see weavers at work (they do not encourage photographs) and you can buy the textiles form the many shops in the village. I found that the best place to buy Saris, handkerchiefs, shawls and bed linen is the government run Pochampalli Weavers Coop retail outlet.Prices of saris bought in Pochampalli are generally atleast 40-50% cheaper than those found in Hyderabad or other cities or online."

You hardly see people weaving there. The place to go to is Pochampally Hand loom Park which is about an hours drive from Pochampally. That's where you can see activity.

Pochampalli,Amartya1987,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Saree hub - Long drive from Hyderabad,"We can also call this the saree village. I have never seen so many saree shops in a small village.Just on a lazy Saturday afternoon, also the absence of good places to see around Hyderabad, I decided to use Google for some suggestions within 100kms. I got an answer which neither my wife nor my mom can reject. Yes, that's right, Pochampally.Post lunch we just quickly got ready as most of the reviews said that the working hours would be mostly 9 - 6. Filled up some petrol around Gachibowli HP petrol pump near Citibank and made our way towards ORR. As usual the ORR offered a great ride and we took an exit at Exit 11(Pedda Amberpet). Took the Vijayawada Highway, NH65 and continued for another dozen or more kilometres when the Google maps screamed to take a left in another 900 metres. Was looking for a major road when a big arch on the left side read, Pochampally-12 kms and I took a swift left and continued on the road. Even though the road was single lane and a big shift from the NH but it was mostly vacant and those 12kms was like a cakewalk.Once deep inside the village, saree shops started appearing on both sides of the road. There is a new market of brick and mortar coming up and all you can see are saree shops. Continued for a few more kilometres and hit M.G. ROAD, here we decided to take help from localites and came to a old and under renovation building where the signboard read Pochampally Co-op weavers society. We parked the vehicle on the backside of the building. There is old Muruga Swamy temple just next to the building which acts as a landmark.Here the ladies got into action and went on to explore the shop's collection, but they were outside the shop within 5 minutes, which made me wonder. On enquiring I found that the shop was quoting exorbitant prices. Another family from Hyderabad who were coming out the shop shared the same experience. Now it was turn to explore the surroundings as the only thing that you can notice everywhere are saree shops. There were a few good shops around like Nataraja, Chandana and many more which I can't recall right now with good collections.While I was waiting outside I decided to venture out and gather more info. With my very limited knowledge of local language I got to know that there is a place called Pochampally Handloom Park where you can see the actual making and also buy a few of them.Here I turned the engine on and asked my family to hop on and moved out towards the location with Google maps and asking passersby on the road. After a drive through village roads reached the Handloom Park, couldn't see the action of saree making as it was almost time for the craftsmen to go back home as it was almost 6pm but we managed to sneak into the store and catch a glimpse of the collection, it was okayish as I suppose the good ones go to cities for sale and just a few display units are kept here.Heartbroken, we thought of returning back as it was around 6:30 pm and drive back home would take another 1.5 hours.We took help from the security guys and they told me that you can avoid the Pochampally village and directly connect the Vijayawada Highway. We followed his instructions and made an exit near Yallagiri. Took an u turn in another 3-4kms and continued on the highway, joined the ORR where the signage read Hyderabad and reached back home around 8pm.Few notes to the fellow readers:1. It's a nice long drive no doubt but don't go with the intention of buying sarees at a throwaway price, it's a myth.2. Don't go in chic clothes and please don't appear to be tourists, u may be ripped with the prices.3. Language is not a barrier, local language is a good to know but the name of the game is bargaining. The better u do, the better are the prices.4. As its a small village, don't expect pizza and burgers but u get enough to survive and they are tasty.5. Locals are great here, strike a conversation and he might help you get to the best shop around.6. Lots of ATMs around, also most of the big shops have EDC, no need to carry piles of cash. Just carry enough as you might carry on any long drive."

There is a government run small industry where you can see how pochampally is design and fabric manufacturing is done. The industry is in interiors of the village and you may need to ask the locals for exact way upto the industry. There are direction marks but not very helpful.If possible ask someone to take you inside the industry and explain all the process and activities carried on. There is a small outlet outside the industry run by government for the fabrics and products manufactured there and are available for purchase. In the village area there were many small weaver shops who sell pochampally sarees, ikkat and kalamkari work dress material at negotiable rates. Quality wise products are awesome . Carry cash because atms and card machines were not working at weavers place due to network issues. There are no eating joints nearby - only coconut water and corns are available.

Pochampalli,Rohit M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,Visit to Pochampalli,"I drove to Pochampalli with my family from Hyderabad. The route to this place is awesome. Starting with ORR for over 50 KMs which is a wonderful expressway and so well maintained that it could be counted in one of the best maintained roads in the country today. You need to take exit 11 from  ORR which takes to this nice loop leading to Ramoji Film City. Few kilometres after Ramoji, one has to take a left turn to Pochampalli. The way to the village is equally nice from there. Nice landscapes and beautiful roads.Finally we reached Pochampalli but the overall experience was a bit disappointing. We expected to see some Govt run set up of weavers where we could see actual weaving happening displaying this 'Ikkat' art which is what this place is famous for. However, apart from 10-12 shops on that stretch and an old small complex of cooperative society selling sarees, we couldn't see anyone really making it. We ventured into a few houses in village and could also see some small set ups of saree making but no one was working there. The shops have a limited variety and my wife and mom couldn't select much. Also, the rates are a bit inflated by the village standards and one needs to bargain hard.All in all still worth visiting but better use of time could be to combine Ramoji Film City with it where most part of the day should be spent."

Pochampalli home to some fine craftsmen who weave the famous Ikkat Saris. Even if you don't buy the saris, just go there and observe the talented weavers at work"
Pochampalli,TVREDDY02,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,MAKE IN INDIA---HYDERABAD,"Had been to the Pochampally and found that the Handloom Park(known as factory locally) is worth a place to see if want to see how sarees/cloths are wooven.  A place for the children to see also.  Timings are from 0900 Hrs to 1800 Hrs.  Sundays are holidays (it comes under Textile ministry).  Though there are locally house made cloth made too but then one does not really know the quality of the same as such, hence procurement of the same from the handloom manufacturer is worth. Though we had been there on sunday and since they were working hence requested for an entry, the persons there had been very courteous and welcomed us. Had meet Mr Nagarjuna, Nagesh,Ashok, Shravan and Miss Ujjwala...all had been so nice to show us the whole factory and did not close the factory till we had left at 1730 hrs.  Thankful to all of them to have ensured that we did not waste the day.  Cost of the manufacture is found reasonable when seen the work that is going on.  Its a place for the people to get the job too.  They conduct 3 months training and pay a stipend of Rs 2,000/- and then one can work there and make a living by doing the job there itself.  A silent place and not much publicized.  Once in Hyderabad a place one should not miss out especially for ladies and children (for knowledge atleast).Place to reach .. From Hyderabad go towards Rammoji film city and then after 4-5 kms have to turn left...keep checking on the way as if one misses will have to go a long way for turning back as is a NH."
Pochampalli,KrisfromSF,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,Enjoyable DayTrip from Hyderabad,"Nice excursion combining sightseeing and shopping. A village that specializes in hand-loom weaving of silk saris. We went to a couple of weavers' houses and to the ""factory"" to see all the stages of production, including the Ikat dyeing. Outlet store at the factory sells saris for 50% of what you will pay in Hyderabad. Bought two! And then ate our lunch (bring your own) in a field and drove back to Hyderabad.  Total time about 8 hours including commute."
Pochampalli,Kedarshukla,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2013 • Family,Saree shopping and weaver's workshop.,"Actually if you are in Hyderabad and you are not buying pochampalli sarees.. Then you are missing something..  So why not go to the place where these sarees are made and see the work of weavers first hand.This place is around 40 km from Hyderabad and can be reached by city bus or car drive. Search for bhudan pochampalli on google maps for correct place. Just be warned that there is no decent eatery in or around pochampalli so carry your food OR eat before you travel. When in the village you can visit any handloom factory located in almost every house, you can see the age old machines and traditional technology of making sarees.. .. I am not sure but they may give you a try on their machines.. If possible have a person with you who can speak English cause the weavers don't speak any language apart from Telugu. You can buy sarees from any shop their or better to go to the cooperative society shop. Everyone gives flat10% discount on every purchase.Tip: carry a fat purse because there is lot of to buy in small hidden heaven of sarees."
Pochampalli,captsameerkhan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Saree shopping,it's a smooth one and a half hour drive from hyderabad city and is the perfect place if you're looking to do some heavy duty shopping for silk and cotton sarees and suits of the famous ikat work.

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,EkMusafir,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Open Space For Recreation.,"The Botanical Gardens of Hyderabad, officially known as Sri Kotla Vijayabhaskara Reddy Botanical Gardens, is located on the Miyapur-Gachibowli Highway in the Kondapur area. There is a huge free parking lot for cars and two-wheelers.Upon entering you have to buy a ticket for ₹25 per person, and there is a stiff fee for photography and videography. It seems that these fees are meant for commercial shootings, but everyone was entering without paying for their cell-phone cameras, and many were taking selfies. If you are a regular morning walker you can buy a pass for ₹400 per month or ₹1500 for an annual pass.As you enter there are some life-like statues of animals and birds laid out in neat gardens. There are some demarcated areas for yoga, a wellness center, a party zone, skating rink, mini golf course, fitness center, an adventure arena, a video hall, conference hall, and an amphitheater. There are some cottages for rent and a Food Court which opens later in the day.The main walking track leads into a dry forest which is more brown rather than green. The track is made of a mixture of sand and gravel. The full round of the track is about 3.5 km. You can hear peacocks early in the morning, and if you are lucky you may even see some. Other smaller birds like bulbuls, babblers, sparrows, and bee-eaters can also be seen and heard.It is best to go early in the morning if you want to exercise your limbs. Compared to parks in other parts of the country, like Bangalore or Pune, the entry rates are very high, and the park is not so green and soothing to the eyes. The Telangana Forest Department should work on these aspects to make it a better experience for the nature lovers."

Needless to say we didn't go in.   Is this just another attempt to take advantage of tourists who might not know the value of the rupee exchange rate?

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,GBee,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,"Very little to see, scamming tourists with cameras","They are charging upwards of 4000 rupees (£43, $56) just to take a camera into the 'gardens' - since no right-thinking local would pay even a fraction of that amount. I can only assume they are trying to scam clueless tourists who have no idea of the relative value of the rupee.Once inside you'll be glad you didn't pay that charge, because the ornate entrance is just hiding a very tiny space that contains nearly nothing to deserve the 'botanical garden' title. It's smaller than most parks in the city and lacking in botanical interest - you'll see more plant species in the nearby waste ground than you will inside the perimeter.There are a few attractions  for the kids - a mini-golf course and an adventure/activity area for which you'll pay extra."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,karthik D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Worst Govt Policies,"Definitely it's a big thumbs-down 👎 for the tourists visiting here with their cameras. They are charging like 4000 to 8000 rupees to allow a camera. You know, a camera lens can be bought with that money. Too ridiculous to charge that much. If it is a commercial photo shoot or film making it would be appropriate to charge as they would be getting money from the shoots. But for family and friends to make some good memories and store them as photos, it is too much to charge those amounts. I saw foreigners arguing with the staff and even left the place as they found the charges are to high.  It's not only about this place,every where in hyderabad they are charging like this only. There are only few places in hyderabad to visit and due to this camera charges we are not able to visit any of them. It will surely impact the tourism in hyderabad over the course of time."

Where in the world does any park charge that much for taking photos. There is another ticket for photography for INR 500 if you are there between 5 am to 8 am. We didn't take the photography ticket (well, who will take it) and went in to spend some time. It's good that we didn't take it. There is not much greenery in the park and it is getting converted into concrete park. They are building some buildings (like gazebos etc) and making it more like a public park than a botanical garden. This garden has lost the points which it had for whatever greenery it had earlier.

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,David D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Poorly maintained,"Very puzzled by positive reviews. There's potential here (or faded glory) but this park is cluttered by crumbling ""improvements"" and is very poorly maintained. No comparison to KBR National Park, which is model that should be followed. People are ""working"" but they're not doing any maintenance. Visitors are confined to a limited area. Trails to most of the park (which must be where peacocks have escaped to) have been closed the two times we've been here. Go with very low expectations. Sad because there's clear potential here and this area of the city would benefit from a nice park."

It is a great place for morning walks/runs. I generally used a track which was about 400m, though once I went onto a track that was far far longer. Peacocks are very much a part of this garden."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Travel-Adhikari,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Visit to Botanical Garden,"Though we lived in Secunderabad for years we didn't know existence of a 'botanical garden'. We visited it after we came across the information. May be due to peak summer season, the greenery would have depleted and water in two small reservoirs had evaporated, apathy towards maintenance was glaring. Again the same belief that government run institutions are most inefficient and employees get in them just for the sake of constant source of income, was seen to be true. But we had a very enjoyable experience of watching full grown gorgeous male peacocks....about 7 of them. One was atop the wall at one end of the garden. After sitting there for some time it slipped into the other side and we followed through a gate (no signs about whether we can actually cross over) and penetrated through the dried bushes stealthily. In a small open space surrounded by dried up trees about 7 peacocks had assembled around their feeding site. Other than this there is not other charm in the garden. Sanjeevaiah Park beside Hussainsagar would perhaps be few notches better than this."

There is some new material (bricks, dirt, etc.) scattered around so it appears that there is some work being done but they have a long ways to go.  Also, you are limited to a very small area of the garden; most of it is walled off."

Currently more of a nice park for strolling. The three bus loads of children where having a great time racing through the paths surrounded by established trees and manicured lawn panels. Couples and groups of young 20 somethings where enjoying the benches and shade. A few labeled plant displays. Room for improvement."

We liked it to have long chats and click photos with friends. Photographers may find good view points here.Cons: Poor maintenance by the authorities. Because so many people visit this place on weekends, it's getting much of human waste which is making it look ugly sometimes. I guess cleaning and maintenance is not done properly. There used to be a drinking water tank which is not functional now."

However it's pleasant only in the morning. Problem with this garden is it is not well maintained. There is a tortoise shape building built for maintaining cactus plants but that building is a mere storage room now. Most of the plants do not have names written which is very much needed for plant lovers. You can see some peacocks and birds roaming around in the park. Parking facility is not bad. There is entry ticket of 15 INR and car parking charges are 20 INR.

We could even spot a few peacocks and hear different animal sounds. There are many plant species which we have not even heard of and colorful flowers that attracts the eye.

Sri_Lakshmi_Narasimha_Swamy_Temple,Somaseshu Gutala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-21,cleanliness and serene surroundings. Spacious area and all facilities.,"This temple is located very close to Hyderabad. It is 10kms from ECIL Cross Roads and 5 kms before Keesera Gutta. It is connected to ECIL X Road by a four-lane road. Many city people visit this temple to enjoy the peaceful surroundings. The big lake before we enter the temple, with green paddy fields and trees refreshes one’s mind. The temple arch one of the biggest arches in Telengana region is very attractive with colourful carvings. On the top of the arch the idol of Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy along with Lakshmi is seen flanked by idols of Ganesh and Hanuman bearing the Sanjeevani Mount. On the extreme ends two idols of Abhaya Anjaneya Swamy are seen. On the pillars of the arch the idols of Jaya and Vijaya and Garuda are seen. This is an exquisite specimen of architecture which captures the attention of the devotees.         The parking space before the temple is very spacious and there is a place assigned for breaking coconuts. There is a shoe stand just beside the parking place. On the way to the temple one can see stalls selling pooja material and a hotel. The temple hall is very colourfully painted with sculptures of various gods. Around the Pradakshina Patha (circambulatory passage) one can see the ten incarnations of the Lord Vishnu. The idol of Lakshminarasimha in the centre is very attractive. The idol of the founder (Sri Mallaram Eshwaraiah) is seen in a niche. There is a tortoise-pond behind with a beautiful statue of Lord Vishnu reclining on the serpent-bed in the middle of the pond. Inside the sanctum the idol of Shanta Narasimha with Lakshmi is seen under the shade of Adi Sesha.         There are many sevas done here. Every Friday Abhishekam is performed. Swarnapushparchana is done to the main lord. In every month on Swathi Nakshatra day, Swamy Kalyanam is done. There is a big hall for performing various rituals Satyanarahyanavratam, Sudarshana Homa, Annaprashana and Upanayanam. Many people make their wishes (Sankalpa) standing before Dwajha Stambham with a coconut in their hands and go round the temple for eleven, twenty-one or forty-one times. After their wish is fulfilled, they again come here and go round the temple for forty-one times. Many devotees come here on Saturday and spend the night here. The following day they do pradakshinas. Devotees believe that their wishes would be fulfilled if they sleep five Saturdays in this holy temple. The devotees who come here should not close their eyes before the main deity but look at the Lord with devotion. Here the devotees should come in traditional dress.  People wearing T-shirts and jeans are not permitted.          In 2015 the temple authorities constructed a choultry with 41 rooms with all facilities. On the days of Poornima and Amavaasya also, many devotees come here to spend the night and do pooja on the following day. So, this Lord is called “Sankalpa Siddhi Narasimha”. On every Tuesday special poojas are done to Lord Anjaneya and Lord Subrahmanaya. Kalasarpanivarana Pooja is also done on this day. On every Wednesday special poojas are done to Maha Ganapati. Special Poojas are done during the months of Kartik and Margasirsha months and on Vaikunta Ekadashi. In this temple Brahmostavams are celebrated in the month of April every year for three days.           There are many sub-shrines in this temple like, Maha Ganapati andAnjaneya. At the back of the temple near the choultry, one can see the shrines of Bangaru Mysamma, Nalla Pochamma and Subrahmanhya. These idols were found in the field of Ishwaraiah.           Regarding the founding of this temple, the credit goes to Mallaram Eshwarayya who is a staunch devotee of Lord Narasimha. He had a vision of Lord Narasimha who asked him to go to Yadagiri and worship the Lord there. He went there and brought a picture of Yadagiri Narasimha and kept it in his pooja room and lit Akhanda Deepam. Many people visited his pooja room and worshipped the Lord. Later His son, Mallaram Lakshminarayana too worshipped the Lord and received Narasimha mantra from Guru. Inspired by Lord’s vision he got Narasimha idol made on April19th 2007, and kept it in his pooja room. Later he thought a temple would be a suitable place to worship the Lord. So, in his field guided by the Lord he selected a suitable place and laid the foundation stone and did Pranapratishta on May 1st 2008. While digging the field, he saw a serpent as if blessing him. So, a shrine for Naga devata is seen in the temple. The shrines of Grama Devatas (Village goddesses), Bangaru Mysamma and Nalla Pochamma have been renovated.          In this temple the traditions followed by Yadagiri temple priests are followed here since devotees believe that Cheeryal Narasimha is a manifestation or Amsha of Yadagiri Lakshmi Narasimha. Many temples of Narasimha are seen in hill-caves. But here the Lord is seen on the ground floor and so devotees can go round the Lord to get their wishes fulfilled. Many Telugu serials’ shooting is done here. Telengana Chief Minister, Sri K.C.R visited this temple to fulfil his vows. The working hours of this temple are from 6.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.  On Saturdays and Sundays, the working hours are from 6.30 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. For city people this is a very nearby place to visit and spend peaceful time and worship the Lord who is regarded as very powerful and who removes obstacles and fulfils the wishes of devotees who pray to him with sincere devotion.                              ---------------------------------------------------"

Ratnalayam_Temple,Somaseshu Gutala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-22,A very beajutifuul temple with landscaped garden and sculptures nearer to the city,"On my Visit to Ratnalayam (Shamirpet, Hyderabad)For city people, “Ratnalayam temple” is a nearby sacred place of Lord Venkateshwara where one can see a model temple construction with beautiful surroundings, serene atmosphere, clean ambiance and modern facilities. This temple was constructed by T.R.Venkatesh just for family worship, but gradually expanded into a big temple. This temple was inaugurated by Swami Jayendra Saraswati on 19th February, 2003 with blessings of Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji Just like Birla temple, this temple is a tourist attraction. Here many T.V. serials are shot showing the landscape and shady trees dotted with beautiful fountains and statues. This temple is located at Aliapur Cross Roads near Aliabad bus stop. From the temple arch, it is only 200 meters distant.  It is nearly 30 kms from Hyderabad. The famous Saraswati temple at Wargal is just 25 kms away from this place. So, one can plan to visit both places.People of all ages including kids find this place quite interesting and delightful. The architecture of this temple and landscaped gardens is quite attractive and impressive. There is wide parking space with a beautiful garden at the entrance with water fountain structures in the form of Lord’s sacred Namam flanked by Shanku and Chakram. At another place one can see a fountain with figures of Lord Vishnu reclining on Adisesha with Lakshmi near His feet. The statue of Krishna dancing on the hoods of Kaliya amidst waters is another eye-catching spectacle. As one ascends the steps towards the main temple one can see the shrine of Lord Ganesha near the entrance. The statue in the main temple resembles the idol of Lord Venkateshwara in Tirupati. Lotus carvings in attractive colors are seen on the ceiling of the central hall. Poojas are done here as per Pancharatra Agama of Vaishanavite tradition. On either side of the main sanctum there are sub-shrines for Goddess Padmavati and Goda Devi. The idols are made of black granite and look very beautiful decked with jewelry and floral decorations. These idols were sculptured by the famous sculptor Sri Ganapathy Sthapathy and were brought from Kanchipuram. Near the main hall or mukha mandapam, there is a counter for selling tickets for various poojas and for selling prasadam packets. While going down the stairs on the way, there is a shrine of Goddess Kanyaka Parameshwari. There is also another shrine for Lord Hanuman.  In this temple there is a hall for doing tonsuring (Kalyana katta), a lecure-hall, a hall for performing homams, a goshala(cattle-shed). Along with temple rituals one can also perform ceremonies like Aksharabhyasam, Anna Prashan, Namakaranam, Sayanarayana Vratam, Gopuja and Vahana Pooja. Special poojas and rituals are done on festive days like Vaikunta Ekadashi, Janmashtami, Dussehra, Diwali and Sankranti. There is a separate area with swings and slides for kids to play. There is a small canteen beside the garden.  It is really a visual treat for city people to spend their time along with their kids in this temple located in serene and scenic surroundings. The temple timings are from 6.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon and from 4.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m."

IKEA,Utkarsh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-22,Definitely Visit but not sure about buying!,"IKEA is a fun labyrinth of home furnishing where you can easily spend 2-3 hours from entry to exit. Whenever you visit, just leave your wallet at home cause you will want to buy everything.Pros: A different shopping experience, restaurant was good and fairly reasonable.Cons: Directions/Signage are really lacking, build and quality of their product was nothing great."
IKEA,R Ramakrishnan,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-21,YELLOW BOX Courier service from IKEA is absolutely unprofessional and pathetic.,"While the shopping experience at IKEA Hyderabad was a pleasure, our experience with the ""Yellow Box"" courier service (which operates from the IKEA premises, just after the billing counters) was abysmally poor.While they initially entice you with a ""fixed price"" deal of Rs 1500 for a consignment of upto 50 Kgs - they add up GST, Insurance, Packing & Handling charges over that - which nearly doubles the amount to be paid. If you speak with Mr Vamshi, Mr Nazeem or MrTeja - they will verbally assure you that the consignment will be delivered in 5-6days.Thereafter, you will not hear from anyone till you call them after a week, upon which you are told that the consignment will be leaving ""tomorrow"". Two weeks later, upon repeated follow ups - they will give you some Truck Driver's number, who will promise to deliver it within 24 hours - but he wont show up for the next 3-4 days. Meanwhile - no calls will be attended to or messages responded to by YellowBox representatives - so the customer is left hanging without any confirmed information about the fate of the consignment.In short - a TOTALLY PATHETIC experience. I hope the IKEA leadership takes note of this and ensures that  corrective action is put into place. They should take morally take ownership of the vicarious liability that is involved, since YellowBox is operating from within their premises."

However post lockdown the safety norms which are extensive and elaborate have led to long ques as u inevitably have to keep waiting 1.5 hour for car parking and 1 hour to enter.... It's tiring, cumbersome with no facilities whilst u keep waiting. I understand the limit on ppl who can be inside but no information, long ques without water, bathroom are a big no. Click and pick is good if u have a good knowledge on ikea products. Overall avoid till ikea team can handle better. "
IKEA,EkMusafir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-20,Gigantic Furniture Showroom.,"The IKEA furniture showroom in Hyderabad is a huge place where you can see and buy furniture and appliances for your house. We visited the place in early March 2020 and were simply astounded by the variety and range of the furniture modules available. It is a one of it’s kind place right from the time you enter. The entrance itself is so mind blowing, we thought we were entering an airport. Every room inside is designed in a unique way, with the pieces of furniture in each room complimenting each other in texture and material, so the entire room gives you a feeling as if a master craftsman has planned and fitted the parts like a pretty jigsaw puzzle. There were many different styles of bedrooms, dining rooms, drawing rooms, modular kitchens and bathrooms, and more. We enjoyed walking through each room marvelling at the various layouts and the furniture in them.In addition you can buy furnishings, utility items and appliances, both small and big, for the house and kitchen. There is ample parking space in the compound, but it becomes crowded during weekends and holidays. At the end of all the browsing we went to the unique restaurant and had a sumptuous dinner."

Loved how it's organized and also requires the customer to go prepared. Right at the entrance, they give you a brochure and a ✏️ and one has to make a list of what one wants to buy and also use the measuring tape (made of paper) to check if the item you're selecting fits with the measurements from home (that's what I meant by be prepared). Since I traveled from Mumbai, I could only pick knick-knacks (👀 baggage allowance🙆) but if one lives in Hyderabad, there are so many options to choose from, right from chairs to study table and what not! Not to forget mentioning the restaurant experience, which is a new self-service concept In India. "

It is ideal for a newly married couple who want to setup a cosy home. This concept is new to India. The quality of furniture is good & prices are competitive. They have a tie up with a transporter - who has a shop in the basement - who will cart it to any place in India - for an additional charge depending on the size,weight & distance of the item. The canteen inside offers  good food at competitive prices.Strongly recommend this place to be visited - if you are coming to Hyderabad.

We have found there attractive well designed home furnishing all articles in an affordable range. Most products are flat packed, so it is very easy to carry and take them at home. IKEA  has invested Rs. 1,000 crore on the Hyderabad store alone and have a range of around 7,500 products over there. IKEA restaurant in Hyderabad offers a variety of snacks & meals and it houses 1000 Seats, IKEA'S largest..

My installs meant to be completed on 17th March... Payment was made. Only after payment done I was informed that some parts of drawer fronts not available. My installation date was given to someone else... made payment for drawer front on 15th May as I was told it has arrived.  Now I am told it has been sold to someone else.  I have to wait till mid June for next shipment. One of the drawers is badly scratched. I was told they would replace it. It was not done. During pre installation visit, the engineer marked walls where tiles could be put. The work site was completed. Finally, when ikea did show up, I was told the tiles should not have been put. The tap installed on the sink blocks my window from opening. I was told that it would be rectified. Not done yet... Overall, a nightmare. You have imported your products but unfortunately it is the same irresponsible, uncoordinated, lazy, poor work ethics. Huge disappointment. Shall not recommend kitchens to anyone."

During the check-out time, even if u are late they will not push you (If they don't have any other waiting customer)5. Don't miss their camp fire. Nice experience in chilled weather. Just put a note to them well in advance that u want camp fire and rest of the things will be taken care by their staff.6. 100% secured and safe, which means family members can just walk-in with your kids.7. Kids will enjoy all their rides and water games-ve things are listed below:-----------------------------------1. The water pool games need lot of maintenance work.2. The rooms need lot of maintenance work.3. We are shocked to see a big lizard / frog in our room. Don't know how they happen to check-in out entry fee.. Just kidding... But the lizard and frog which we have seen are too scary.4. The water pools will be under maintenance activity during night hours and the sound is too much while pumping the water out. It will disturb you if u are a sensitive sleeper.Note:-.1 Last but not the least, I heard from the staff that they are under going with huge renovation during this coming summer. If it happens then it can be considered good.2. Keeping all the above mentioned -ve points, i am giving it as 3 rating"

Maintenance not really at par as they named it water world.  The cost of the entry is too high with less facilities.  Can be maintained well with better staff otherwise this will be no more attraction in the future time.  I'm sure It has no charisma to get back it's visitors second time.

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Shruti M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,,AVOID ,"     Not worth the money we spend on the tickets. 390/- entry+rides. Need to pay extra for the rides in the ""water park"". Poorly maintained park.     The water world is another story. None of us dared to enter the water.     The so called restaurants given in their website were nowhere in sight. Only one restaurant ""Dolphin"" was open. Unclean. No food available other than a non-veg biryani and it's vegetarian counterpart.      Toilets look bad enough from outside. The weather in Hyderabad and the poor quality of this park makes a horrible combination.      Though we intended to, there was no way could we spend a whole day there.

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Iknallev,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Family,Horrible Experience,"It was a family re-union after so many years and We just wanted a nice family time out for 8 of us (that include kids, grand parents) and my nephew suggested this place as he heard about it about two years back from a friend of his. It only took 15 min into the park for us to realise what a terrible choice we had made.As we bought tickets, they started explaining about mechanical rides and water rides and we were like ""dude, give us the map of the park"". And they don't have a map. And there were no directions/signs that suggest us where to go. I guess, I may be expecting out of this poorly maintained place (and they call this resort... What a crap?). Out of the four allowed mechanical rides, one is not working (tea cup ride, I guess) and the others are in very bad shape with rusted seats and handles and garbage all around. One ride we had a little fun was ""Columbus"" but there was not much safety as the operator does not care if everyone on the board is properly secured before he can start and even worse was that he was on cell phone through out the two min ride.It was only 30 min Into the park and we were like ""oh god, can you make our day any better?"". Then after asking the operator what to do next, we were hesitatingly on our way to the water rides. On our way we noticed ""Go Karts"" with only one working yet strangely looking car with an extra fee (fee for this junk?) to ride on it and the ride track was seriously a joke. Blaming our selves for seeing such a pathetic place, we entered into this ""Crocodile Tummy"", the entrance to the water rides. The inside of this tummy was totally in a mess with stones and garbage every where. Don't care if it was going through some repair but the visitors deserve a well maintained place or at the least some directions/signs indicating repairs.The first ride that greeted was the boat ride pond that was full of water weeds and dirty water. Not sure how anyone can dare to think of doing a boat ride on it. Then there were two water slides that were so aged and rusted clearly seen from far. And they were not running. Out of kids curiosity, when we asked the operator as why they were not running... we were told that they would open these rides half-an-hour later as the other water ride (wave pool) is open. And he suggested us to go and enjoy the wave pool ride. Really? We cannot even choose where to go first and have to go with the crowd as they suggest? The roof of the shade shed around these rides and the boat ride was torn apart and looked very ugly.And the wave pool... The statue of the man above and water running out of his mid-riff reminded the kids to visit the rest rooms :). To enter the wave pool, nylon costumes are a must... and well we didn't bring for any of the kids. Kids were like we didn't enjoy any ride so far, let's enjoy at least this one. Then were told we could rent the nylon clothes for Rs. 100. Not bad, we said ... And guess what, the guy inside has a black garbage bag I front of him and any size we ask, he had to bury his inside to dig a matching swim suit and if it does not match what we ask then he has to put it back in and dig again. ""Dumbo! Why cannot you arrange them on the hangers per size and that will your and our life easy?""... Crazy! Anyway, there were only about 10/15 suites and all of them are for teen to adult size... too big for our kids aged 8 & 10. Kids were disappointed for not able to make into this one at least. And that's it.... It was just about an hour into the park (please, don't call this a resort, that's insane to make people fall for this crap)... and we were out of here. Then we went to Lumbini Park, which was far far better than this dumb Mount Opera and the entrance fee was 20 times less. We should have read the reviews before we visited.Mount Opera is ridiculously ill-maintained place and it is a crude joke to call this a multi theme park and even a resort. It is such a shame on the management to collect high fees but ignore the basic maintenance, cleanliness and safety. Total waste of money and the time."

Everything was quite amusing and entertaining.We enjoyed from 11.30 in the morning till 6.30 in the evening. The environment is quite good with lots of locations where you can take a lot of snaps. The mechanical rides with make sounds but you will still enjoy them overall.Go karting is not very economical(90 Rs for 3 small laps), other paid ride(dashing cars) has got only 3 cars (30 Rs for 3 mins) but you will enjoy it.There is a facility to avail swim clothes at a cost of 20 RS but you have an option to wear your own ones, provided they are nylon.Lockers are hardly available to store your valuable items, so take some small locks with you so that you  yourself can lock your cabinets there.Overall it was a great day for us.

The entrance is dirty, the entrance roof falling and except the security staff, none appears to be doing his job well. Every ride is in bad shape and the operators so rude with children, its un-imaginable.Since most rides are included in the entry fee, the operators feel they are giving free rides. We had to force them to start rides and their language foul and abusive. I doubt if the safety is monitored regularly ever by any one.Every place is neglected and dirty including the so called restuarent.The water games are so dirty with the entrance to them never having being swept for ages.Flooring in wave pool is broken and the water very unclean n dirty.

After that we went for some Amusement rides which were small but good. Then we were tired and hungry. We had our lunch which was really tasty. After that we went for the water rides and enjoyed all the rides many times till evening. Now we were tired and wanted to have some rest. We had tea and some snacks near the pool and then we were rushed back to home as it was getting dark. Overall a very good fun we had that day.

Sarath_City_Capital_Mall,Lavanya S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-19,Good experience terrible staff,"I took my kids to Sarath City Mall after hearing great things about it. This review is largely about our experience in the 4th floor gaming area. I am writing this review so that parents are cautious to look out themselves for their kids safety and to make management aware of how poorly trained the staff is. I work in customer service and it really baffled me why anyone would be paid money for such poor performance at work. This is what happened.We reached the 4th floor gaming area at around 2 pm on a weekday. It was not crowded at all except for a large group of college kids in some college t shirts. I assumed they were there on some kind of college sponsored visit and didn't think much. The games asked for a card and I couldn't see where I could swipe my debit card. I looked around for staff but only saw the aforementioned college group chatting and playing some of the games. For the water ride, there wasn't even any staff managing it. I told my kids to stay and went walking around to see who could help us. I was shocked to find out that these 'college kids in uniform' were the staff!!To me they had appeared like other customers. Two girls were sitting on some rides and even when we went and stood near them for our turn they did not get off. I asked one of them why aren't they helping us. I also asked to speak to a manager. The manager just apologized. After I expressed my disappointment and told him I would write a review was when a staff member came to help my kids. See second picture.In an age when customer staff is competing with each other to win customers, I found this attitude shocking. Why aren't these kids trained? What are they getting paid for? Except this experience, we really enjoyed the food in the food court and the exceptional service in all the other stores we went to. There is a good bouncy house too on the lower or first level that my kids liked. Advice to families: Go for the rides and watch out yourself for your kids safety. Ask questions. Ensure your kids are safely buckled in. Don't expect to get any help from staff."

Secunderabad_Clock_Tower,Niroop P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,Gr8 ancient architecture ,"A firman issued by Nizam Sikandar Jah established the city of Secunderabad after his name in 1806. [2] To honour the progress achieved by the British officers stationed atSecunderabad Cantonment in Hyderabad , the erstwhile British government established 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land for this purpose in 1860.[3] A 120-ft high clock tower was constructed in a park of 2.5 acres (1.0 ha) in 1896. [1] The tower was inaugurated by Resident Sir Trevor John Chichele Plowden on 1 February 1897. The clock on the tower was donated by Dewan Bahadur Seth Lachmi Narayan Ramgopal, a businessman. [2]In 2003, the tower was placed on a demolition list drawn up by the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad to accommodate the increasing traffic. A senior official at this civic agency of the Government of Andhra Pradesh said that they were trying their best not to demolish this structure. [4] In 2006, the park housing the tower was chosen for renovation by the same agency. Carried out at a cost of ₹ 10 million (US$150,000), the park's size was reduced to widen the roads. In addition, the tower was renovated, the park was landscaped with lawns and hedges, and a waterfall was installed. The renovation was completed in 2005, and the park was inaugurated by then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy in 2006. [1][5] A martyr's memorial was also established inside the park in memory of the first police firing in 1969 during a separateTelangana agitation .[6] Within a year after this, two of the tower's four clocks experienced technical problems and stopped working. [3]The tower was declared a heritage structure in the twin cities of Hyderabad - Secunderabad.[3] It was as a result of the efforts put by the civic agency at sites like this tower that the proposal to seek UNESCO Heritage status for Hyderabad was revived. [7]In 2006, the 200-year celebrations of the formation of Secunderabad were organised by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The clock tower was chosen as the subject of the logo, which was designed by a local firm. [8] The outline of the Clock Tower was first conceived by the students of a city architectural college. [9] A short cinema film of 9 minutes, 30 seconds by director Mani Shankar was released as a part of this celebration. The film, which relates the history of the city, features the clock tower in it.[10]The park housing the tower also served as a venue for promoting various citizen-centric events such as a children's film festival, [11] awareness programs among others.

Hyderabad_Central_Mall,Asma,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Disheartened for losing my money,I bought few items for sum amount of 5500 rupees and 3300 rupees on 19th jan 2019.Later i returned two items on 28th jan 2019( a shoe and t.shirt) worth 3000 rupees approximately and was given a credit note and that day itself that is on 28th jan 2019 i purchsed shoes for 1400 rupees from that credit note and i was given another credit note for remaining amount approximately 1600 rupees. Unfortunately I lost that credit note and the bill. I visited cebtral mall panjagutta and they were not able to help me out saying once credit note is lost nothing can be done. Then i wrote a mail and personally called to customer care central(1800-210-7777) and they said they too cannot help me out with this as it's not in their hands. However they asked me to visit store once. I did it and i was asked to write a mail to Hyderabad team. I wrote the mail on 26th feb 2019. And i contacted them. They again told me today that they too dont have any details. Before contacting  Hyderabad central i called payback center and they said they don't save details of purchase made frm credit note.Now my question is How come they dont save details of purchases credit note return etc in their system? It isnt a small amount.  I want to use my money of credit note. It was just a small slip. Help me out central team. Im not going to keep quite. My email id is asma_hafeeza@hotmail.com

I was there this weekend and it was chaotic.The first one to greet you would be the mall security and Punjagutta traffic, to let you know that there is no parking available. If you have tickets for PVR, you are on your own.Once you enter the mall, the elevators take you till 3rd floor and then you need to take the fire evacuation stairs.On the way back from fifth floor, there are absolutely no elevators - you need to walk down. The other day I saw parents with young kids and elderly people struggle a lot while getting down the stairs.Its a pity that the GHMC, Fire and Police let this mall operate with such low standards - The L&T Next mall a few metres away is much much better than this.Do avoid this mall if possible- there are much better and safer malls in Hyderabad. Have a safe visit by going to them."

Indira_Park,Mahanama,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Solo,Horribly Neglected Park,"In the early days this park was a nice place to spend some time. That was way back in the 1980s. But over the years the park has deteriorated terribly. I can mention 4-5 things which need immediate attention.1. Large sections of the park are dusty. The pathways are very hard, and the poor walkers have to suffer much. Foolishly some sections have been cemented. So you can expect foot trouble for many walkers.2. The large pond (I won't call it a lake!) in the middle of the park has been filled with sewage water, so that it is practically one sewage dump. You can see foam and froth at the edges of the pond. There is a small walkway (mini bridge) to cross from one side of the park to the other side. You can see the walkers holding their noses and walking over - the smell is so bad. Not only hydrogen sulphide, but methane also - are the poisonous gases emanating from the stagnant pond. Part of the lake is covered with weeds. Many who are working in the park throw rubbish into the park. If the pond is dredged, you can see the filth that is at the bottom. 3. You can always see stray dogs running around in the park. 4. Except for the section called the Rose Garden (where lots of money is spent!), every other spot in the park needs rectification. It is just one cheap third-rate municipal park, which is becoming worse year after year.5. Foolishly watering is done in the park in the early morning time, so that the humidity is very high. And the poor walkers suffer from colds, coughs, bronchitis and pneumonia - walking through the wet sections of the park, suffering the chill and the damp, especially in December and January. Proof: The increasing number of patients who go to Sai Vani Hospital opp the park for chest xrays!6. Some of the ugliest sculptures are found in this park. You don't know what those stone figures mean. It is one of those scams for which the Municipal Corporation is 'famous'. 7. Most of the park looks like a desert or scrub jungle trying its best to recover from the ill-treatment at the hands of the park authorities who have no idea of plants, gardens, horticulture or park management. 8. The best thing about the park is perhaps the vegetable and fruit vendors outside the park. Here you get good vegetables and fruits, fresh and at reasonable rates. In fact many people come to the park, not to enjoy the park, but to buy from the unofficial market that is outside the park premises! 9. Hyderabad is one city where lakes and parks are fast vanishing. One good park is the Sanjeeviah Park which is located in a secluded area. But I visited that park 2 years ago. It must have deteriorated by now, I'm sure."
Indira_Park,vibha123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-14,A Park away from city pollution..now losing charm,"I remember visiting Indira park sometime back and I was just traveling down the memory lane to draw a comparison....it has lost its charm...Its landmark on the map of twin cities, however like any other public place is running without maintenance and care..Might be worth while if you are close by to see this garden with kids else this place has nothing much to offer in comparison with NTR gardens and lumbini park."
Indira_Park,Beemidi Kiran,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Family,A very well planned park in the heart of the city,This is one of the best parks located in the center of the city by all means.

It is best for picnic with family during the day and it is also the best park to take out your kids to have a nice evening time. It has decent food options.

Indira_Park,plan41,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Couples,Indira Park - the Ideal Spot for a Week-end Picnic...,"When Indira Park was started somewhere in the nineties, it was considered to be such a beautiful concept providing greenery in the midst of rapidly growing urbanisation by way of multi-storeyed apartments and shopping complexes in this traditionally shy city that shunned modernism for a long, long time. There were a variety of saplings and trees planted by the State Horticulture Department who had maintained the Park so well for a number of years. The lake in the midst of the Park remained ever pure and un-contaminated and boating in the lake used to be such a pleasurable experience. There were a number of aquatic birds providing a visual delight to the visitors to the park. Alas! over the years there has been a systematic neglect of this once-upon-a-time beautiful Park right in the centre of the City. Today the lake has turned out to be totally lacking in maintenance, filthy with stagnant water and the boating having stopped long time ago. The present government is considering renovation of the whole area into something that is modern and attractive, for which plans are under way. Time alone will tell what kind of shape this sprawling Park is going to assume in the near future!"

Musical fountains, Rose garden, Boating, Rock Garden are the highlights of this park. its a good place for jogging and picnics for the family.  It is said that the Rock garden is developed by an Officer of Central Government..The drawback in the park is poor maintenance. Though acclaimed as one of the biggest part ( spread over 76 acres), it is not being maintained well. Thousands of visitors come here for boating, relaxing and for picnic.

The landscape is passable, with a rose garden and some other areas that actually are quite pretty (again, for Hyderabad standards).

It's a reservoir with sluice gates in case water needs to be released downstream and there's a nearby park. That's it.Reaching the place is quite easy, take the APPA junction exit on ORR and come towards the himayat Sagar road. There are plenty of signage so you can't get lost enroute.There is a parking ready to accommodate around 30 -40 cars. Once you are in the place, you see 2 gates, one for the park and other for the reservoir.The reservoir doesn't close till late but the park gate closes by 5pm, so plan accordingly.The gate for the reservoir takes you on a mile of walk along the reservoir fence right up to the sluice gates and you can cross the gates and have some extra walk. The waking road is clean and picturesque. You can take a lot of nice pics. You can see a variety of birds chirping around, just be ready with your cameras to take the best shot.The park beside the reservoir also had some nice species of flowers and birds. There's a small play area for kids.Best is to walk the long distance along the reservoir and then take some rest in the park. But choice is always individual.The reservoir and parking is free, however, for the park, adults are charges 15/- per head.Coming to the food, you see a lot of bhutta(corn) sellers. Refreshing to have them in reading season.Right opposite to the place you have small refreshments points with some tea and bhajji sellers.Few of them sell fish fry, it's cheap and tastes great, non veg lovers can have a bite."

Names of some of the stations are not properly selected as metro station name and actual place name are not at the same place (example are Bala Nagar, JNTU, Raidurg etc). Should start metro in other routes also where traffic is high."

L_T_Metro_Rail,savvyuec,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Excellent Service,"The Hyderabad metro provides very good service to the commuters.It can also be used to go to Secunderabad railway station which is .5 KM from the metro station. With the Hi-Tech City line also starting it provides very good connectivity as well and not as congested yet as the Bangalore metro.As some trivia, it is a tribute to the engineering prowess of L&T given the Metro Man (E Sreedharan) had casted doubt on its feasibility given the rocky terrain of Hyderabad."
L_T_Metro_Rail,EkMusafir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"Faster, Cleaner, Cooler, Cheaper.","Traveling by the L&T Metro Rail of Hyderabad is a much better option of getting around the congested city. It is faster because it avoids the long waits at the traffic signals. It is cleaner by far than the dusty streets, cooler because all the bogies are air conditioned and much cheaper than road transport if you are traveling alone. Recently the Blue Line got an extension from Ameerpet to Hitech City. We used the metro to travel from Hitech City to Secunderabad East to catch our Shatabdi Express from Secunderabad Junction Main Station. It took us 40 minutes in the metro and 10 minutes to walk from Secunderabad metro station to the main station. If we had taken a rickshaw or cab it would have taken us an hour and a half. At the metro stations, elevators are available to take you up from the road level to the platform level. The staff are very helpful and guide you to the concourse. There are some seats reserved for senior citizens and ladies. Small luggage can be kept under the seats.For the local commuters of Hyderabad, the Metro is a blessing, as it serves as a Rapid Transport System, avoiding the massive traffic jams and bottlenecked roads which the city is fast becoming. It serves the main areas of Hyderabad, but one still has to make use of the buses and autos to connect to the outlying areas. Work on expansion and new routes are still underway, and hopefully should be operative in the near future."

Took the metro from Begumpet to Secunderabad .Neat and clean. Less crowded during off peak hours. Fare is cheap- The fare is Rs 10 for 2 km, Rs 15 for 4 km and steadily increases to Rs 55 for up to 26 kms. The fare for a distance more than 26 km has been fixed at Rs 60. The maximum you pay is Aud$1.20 (1/3rd price of a cappuccino). I advise Visitors to avoid traffic and travel on the Metro Rail and have a wonderful experience while exploring the city."

All proposed networks shall be completed at the earliest and put on use for the public.4. LB Nagar to Nagole connection is strategic requirement and much needed, it shall be instrumental to make it a grand success, or else it is at present quite inconvenient, 5.

L_T_Metro_Rail,kkespana2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Practical & efficient!,"A welcome addition not only to Hyderabad commuter landscape but also for sheer pleasure of riding on a train which is what I did with my two young children. It was also an opportunity to take pride in the native land’s evolving infrastructure!My children loved the ride and I took delight in guiding them to my native city from an elevated level. The stations and the trains were clean, and the staff everywhere. Just needs ongoing daily maintenance to keep the user-experiences at higher levels. I do sincerely wish that the users let people get off the trains first before ‘barging’ in. Metro authority must do more to raise awareness and enhance travel etiquette amongst the general population!Shops and supermarkets located at Ameerpet junction, and presumably at major intersections offer convenience shopping for commuters.A few points on my wish list would be;1. There needs to be an option of buying a return ticket and it needs to be slightly cheaper, keeping in with Europeans rail networks. This not only will be user-friendly but also proudly announces to the world that India cares for its people.2. It was annoying having to leave the station, ie exit the barriers to buy the return ticket! One should be able to buy it without doing so I’d imagine!3. Can’t wait to see introduction of prepaid smart cards!4. Station parking facilities need to be more robust to encourage higher usage of the service.5. Last but not least, I didn’t agree with the policy that children were charged at adult rates. Sincerely request that this needs reviewing!On the whole,the Metro is a step in the right direction and I’m pleased to have used it with my children. Well done Team Hyderabad Metro."

Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,Ramm,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Poor facilities!,"Well, its a decent mall around Kukatpally and there is no doubt about it when it comes to proximity or positioning and also has few super stores like Shoppers stop and Hypermart along with few branded stores.Lets start from the parking: Poor direction signage's, parking to mall is entry is not at all welcoming.Important: If you plan to use the rest-room next to the lift lobby on Shoppers stop side, please carry a mask and enter, i suggest-avoid if you can. This was one of the point i want to stress on, value of a place is directly proportional to its cleanliness and this is lacking to the core.  Well, moving on to Cinepolis, you will have a bang during the intermission of the film, the food is over-priced, a piece of chocolate cake - INR 100+, Popcorn starts - 120+ etc. This pricing becomes value for money when the management provides the right amenities to the visitor.A place, has a lot of potential to improve in all means!"

This is a quotation on one of the boards displayed as you go cycling around the well laid out cycling tracks in the Pala Pitta Cycling Park in the Kothaguda Reserve Forest in Hyderabad. It is located just opposite the Botanical Gardens in Kondapur.Here you can hire bicycles for ₹50 an hour. The track goes around a fenced in forest and is about 2.5 km in circumference. The track is a mixture of sand, gravel, and mud and is quite suitable for the sports bikes of which they have plenty available in their shed. They have ladies bikes, as well as smaller bikes for kids too. The park opens at 6 am and it is best to go early in the morning when it is cooler. It is only for cycling, and walking is not allowed on the cycle track. There are benches for sitting and there is a washroom.The terrain is flat but there are some small hillocks to challenge your pedal power, and the track curves around treacherously in some places, making your ride a bit challenging. If you are lucky you will get to see peacocks wandering around in the forest."

Laser_Shooter,Raajkumar1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-17,Best place for team activity,We went to this place as a part of our office team activity. It is a very good place to enjoy the lazer game. Sufficient place is there to run and hide as well. Bunkers are also designed very perfectly. overall it is very good. But the managers of the place are not so pleasant. 
Laser_Shooter,Jikuza,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-17,Good place to enjoy a laser tag game,I visited this place twice- once with my friends and once with my office colleagues. The floor is quite big and the equipment is top notch.

Worth trying if you haven't yet."

So, me and my friends visit here."
Laser_Shooter,anvesh2502,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Good adrenalin rush!,Good place and good arena. Detailed statistics post match. It would be exceptional if teams have a target to attack on rather than just attacking the opponents.
Laser_Shooter,Zain A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,Lazer ops fun,"this is the second time I have visited Laser ops..I had great fun with my friends for 12 minscoming to the improvements..

You get individual and team scores. We will be back.
Laser_Shooter,Gaurav5430,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Just had good times and very exciting fun with school friends in Lazer Ops city center.,one of the few laser tag places in the city. it is an unbelievable workout and too much fun. It is also very addictive
Laser_Shooter,meet_smokie3s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Good place to visit with friends,"The gear is in good shape. You get about 20 mins of gameplay. It is costly as compared to other cities.The arena is asymmetric, the team areas/sensors won't be activated unless you have teams of 5, friendly fire can't be turned on.Overall, well maintained, but costly. Worth trying if you haven't yet."
Laser_Shooter,avinash6583,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Overall a good experience needs improvement,"Just Tope fun visited many times in a year. Just want a membership of Lazer Ops city center mall. Visit atleast 200 day a year with friends. This is the only nearest place of gaming with bowling and Lazer ops. So, me and my friends visit here."
Laser_Shooter,anvesh2502,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Good adrenalin rush!,Good place and good arena. Detailed statistics post match. It would be exceptional if teams have a target to attack on rather than just attacking the opponents.
Laser_Shooter,Zain A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,Lazer ops fun,"this is the second time I have visited Laser ops..I had great fun with my friends for 12 minscoming to the improvements.. I feel that we do need to have a laser pointing all the times rather than having it at the time of firing it i.e, I see the red spot when I fire at a person which is not required after you fire."

Laser_Shooter,tangbot1111,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-18,Best Team Outing,"Lazer Ops is one of the best physical indoor game zones for the team playing, You will get a good exercise here"
Laser_Shooter,Raajkumar1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-17,Best place for team activity,We went to this place as a part of our office team activity. It is a very good place to enjoy the lazer game. Sufficient place is there to run and hide as well. Bunkers are also designed very perfectly. overall it is very good. But the managers of the place are not so pleasant. 
Laser_Shooter,Jikuza,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-17,Good place to enjoy a laser tag game,I visited this place twice- once with my friends and once with my office colleagues. The floor is quite big and the equipment is top notch.

Laser_Shooter,Sravan Vadde,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Could offer more customization in the gameplay,I have been to many Laser tag place in the US and this one meets international standards. The staff was helpful and helped our group of 12 to be split into two teams. The game itself is about 20 minutes and lots of fun. Just be careful so you do not run into each other. You get individual and team scores. We will be back.
Laser_Shooter,Gaurav5430,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Just had good times and very exciting fun with school friends in Lazer Ops city center.,one of the few laser tag places in the city. it is an unbelievable workout and too much fun. It is also very addictive
Laser_Shooter,meet_smokie3s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Good place to visit with friends,"The gear is in good shape. You get about 20 mins of gameplay. It is costly as compared to other cities.The arena is asymmetric, the team areas/sensors won't be activated unless you have teams of 5, friendly fire can't be turned on.Overall, well maintained, but costly. Worth trying if you haven't yet."

Just want a membership of Lazer Ops city center mall. Visit atleast 200 day a year with friends. This is the only nearest place of gaming with bowling and Lazer ops. So, me and my friends visit here."
Laser_Shooter,anvesh2502,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Good adrenalin rush!,Good place and good arena. Detailed statistics post match. It would be exceptional if teams have a target to attack on rather than just attacking the opponents.
Laser_Shooter,Zain A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,Lazer ops fun,"this is the second time I have visited Laser ops..I had great fun with my friends for 12 minscoming to the improvements.. I feel that we do need to have a laser pointing all the times rather than having it at the time of firing it i.e, I see the red spot when I fire at a person which is not required after you fire."

It is costly as compared to other cities.The arena is asymmetric, the team areas/sensors won't be activated unless you have teams of 5, friendly fire can't be turned on.Overall, well maintained, but costly. Worth trying if you haven't yet."
Laser_Shooter,avinash6583,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Overall a good experience needs improvement,"Just Tope fun visited many times in a year. Just want a membership of Lazer Ops city center mall. Visit atleast 200 day a year with friends. This is the only nearest place of gaming with bowling and Lazer ops. So, me and my friends visit here."
Laser_Shooter,anvesh2502,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Good adrenalin rush!,Good place and good arena. Detailed statistics post match. It would be exceptional if teams have a target to attack on rather than just attacking the opponents.
Laser_Shooter,Zain A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,Lazer ops fun,"this is the second time I have visited Laser ops..I had great fun with my friends for 12 minscoming to the improvements.. I feel that we do need to have a laser pointing all the times rather than having it at the time of firing it i.e, I see the red spot when I fire at a person which is not required after you fire."

Laser_Shooter,Raajkumar1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-17,Best place for team activity,We went to this place as a part of our office team activity. It is a very good place to enjoy the lazer game. Sufficient place is there to run and hide as well. Bunkers are also designed very perfectly. overall it is very good. But the managers of the place are not so pleasant.

Laser_Shooter,Sravan Vadde,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Could offer more customization in the gameplay,I have been to many Laser tag place in the US and this one meets international standards. The staff was helpful and helped our group of 12 to be split into two teams. The game itself is about 20 minutes and lots of fun. Just be careful so you do not run into each other. You get individual and team scores. We will be back.
