B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Space and Undersea travel experience,"The show starts only if there are 15 people. So it is advisable to first visit the science museum. In case the no of people wanting to see the show is 15, the security guards in the museum will tell you. You can they buy the ticket, watch the show and return to the science museum to complete your visit. This way you will optimize your time.The show changes. When we were there they were showing a film on Mars. One of the first planetariums in India it gives you a great space travel feel. After the show you move on to a different room where you see a 3D film on underwater corals.Not much of space travel fan, we enjoyed the underwater 3D show more."
B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Kaushik G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Nice show,We had visited Birla Planetarium during our sightseeing in Hyderabad. Tickets are priced at 100 rupees per person and there are shows in English and local languages at different times of the day. From the parking lot one has to walk up an inclined path to reach the Planetarium building at the top. We enjoyed the beautiful architecture of the building and the show about planets.

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Shalini N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Not the best planetarium ,"The Planetarium cum Museum is very huge.. lots of exhibits are there related to various subjects.. However,  the planetarium show can very well be avoided. The charges for the show is exorbitant and its not exactly a sky show. I would rather call it a slide show, for which don't need a dome shaped planetarium but a normal white scree projector is enough.  This is not how a planetarium show should be, given the fact that it is known to be one among the best planetariums in the country. The exhibits are all in working condition and very informative.."

We booked the evening 7.30 pm hindi show ticket and before that saw different museums. Dinosaur museum was good with a big skeleton of a dinosaur on display. The museum on ISRO was very inspirational as we can see the models of different rockets and satellite kept on display.The space show was excellent inside the big dome theater as it provides a lot of information and at the same time beautiful to watch. The entire place is worth visiting with kids.

There was also a 3D show about marine life in the Barrier Reef which was a nice add-on.  Unfortunately there wasn't time for us to take a look at the science museum, but the short walk across from the Birla temple to the planetarium was worth it for that alone."

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,suresh n,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,The Sky show is the most attractive feature of the Planetarium. ,"Birla Planetarium Hyderabad: Located at Naubat Pahad in the heart of Hyderabad city, Birla Planetarium is one of the most modern planetariums of the country. Not just children, this is one of the popular Hyderabad sightseeing places that attracts everyone. It was inaugurated in the year of 1985 by the late Sri N.T.Rama Rao. This planetarium is the first phase of the Birla Science centre in Hyderabad, which was nothing less than a landmark in bridging the gap between science and the common masses. This dome shaped structure was developed with the technological help from Japan. This place present its visitors with latest information about Universe and about various invention and theories related to it."

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,UllasMumbai,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,"Boaring Presentation, Not much Knowledge sharing","It was very stereo-type monotonous presentation. Practically now shown anything even what we knew. Show has some screens on wrong side - which means on some part it is flipped screen for you and you have to adjust to view / read that screen. After planetarium they taken us to 3D show - frankly, it was with not much 3D effects and could not understand what they wanted to tell. Whole movie they shown Dinosaur running, fighting and fighting. Waste of money and time."
B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Gowrish P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Little astronomy. Boring content.,"Birla Planetarium (BP) is a part of the Birla Science Center, but, only the Planetarium  is reviewed here.I think the BP set up is good, but the content has been not well thought out at all. We went with expectation of an astronomy focused visit, but were let down by the content. Very little relevance to science of astronomy. BP needs to buck up to remain with the times.Planetarium has three parts to it - Dome, 3D theater, and observatory. We did not visit the observatory as it was overcast and raining.*The dome* is designed for 70 or so people and it fills up fast. Take your tickets and make it to the show time as printed on your ticket. Shows run hourly from 10 AM till 5 PM. There might be shows in Telugu. Check with the ticket counter. *The show itself* was boring. The focus of the show evolution of astronomy from a historical perspective. This did not need a 40 minute treatment and turned out to be a drag. There are many advancements in astronomy and it would have been useful to show that. More than talking about symbolism of different cultures/civilizations (and how they converge) over time, it should be kept basic for children's sakes - basic solar system model visualized, how far we have gone with our travels in it, what planetary bodies can be observed with eyes, what methods exist to look farther, something about Hubble telescope, radio telescopes... these would pique the curiosity to explore further.*3D Theater* is a decent set up as well. However, the content was a let down. Our ticket said '3D Universe' for the name of the show. However, what was shown up was a 3D Animation movie about story of a T-Rex. It's all good for someone who has never seen a 3D movie, but today every mall and amusement center has 3D. You can see 3D on the cellphone for a small cost of the glasses. What's the big deal with a Jurassic Park kind of show at a Planetarium?BP needs to really think what people expect when they visit a planetarium. If they want people, esp. children to come back with more interest, BP need to think how they need to rejig the content. Else, the planetarium is just a tick in the box for someone who has not seen one in HYD."

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,FoodieYogiKrishna,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Not for noisy kids :),"Thanks to google maps , else locating this place would have been very tricky. One you reach the well designed centre is impressive. A  brief astronomy(based on modern as well as vedic science) video is played against the ceiling of the circular auditorium. Suggest kids  6+ to be brought here. The toddlers were getting frightened/impatient in the dark room with heads pointed towards to the ceiling.  The show itself seems very outdated in terms of the clarity of the video, voice or music. But the content is exceptional and well detailed. From the time the universe was created till when it may pass the subject is covered well with basis from ancient vedas(pure sciences). A good visit for inquisitive children and parents."

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Bharatbackpacker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,Good place for children,"A very clean and decent place, but, I think is priced a little too much. The planetarium and science museum are in the same complex but has a separate fee for each. Also, there is a Art gallery. went for a planetarium (cost Rs. 100/-) which was not bad. There is one show in the planetarium for 30 mins which was very good and another in the science building which supposed to be 3D but was'nt. It was simulated 3D. The sad part is that I think that they did not know how to set it up otherwise it would have been true 3D."

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Aishwarya R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Experience that hasn't changed for years,"I had visited the planetarium just after going to the Birla Mandir. At first, I was very enthusiastic about the fact that I was setting foot in a scientific zone after a very long time. I stood in line to purchase the tickets. I had purchased a combo ticket for the Museum and Planetarium, and it cost me around Rs 150. The show was perfectly on time, so no issues with that. Once the content started playing, I felt that I was watching the same version that I had seen almost 10 years ago. There seemed to be negligible improvement in quality and content. I wish it was better. But, it is worth a visit if you're going with kids. They might like the visual experience. One most important factor that you should keep in mind if you are going during a weekend - try and buy your ticket as soon as you enter the premises, because the English show's tickets get sold out very soon.

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Vishal Goyal,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Not worth your time,"Visiting the Birla planetarium is certainly not worthwhile. The entire show is very sloppy and boring. If you have seen the planetarium at Delhi or Kolkata, you'll find this extremely pathetic in comparison. The Aqua show that followed was also not up-to-the-mark. This activity (if in your to-do list) can be skipped."

The visit was very informative & educational. There are good shows which keep on sharing updates on space research & science. A must visit for people of all ages. We had visited the Nehru Planetarium in Mumbai & this was also a similar experience.

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Repala S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Fun place for young kids,"This Birla Planetarium in Hyderabad is like any other planetarium. Here the interesting thing is that they have different shows every year which is good as they present shows on recent developments in science.Although the quality should be much better, it is worth going once at least. Birla Planetarium is offers definitely something different from other hangout in the city."
B_M_Birla_Planetarium,MIHIRDAKWALA,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Not only Educates but entertains ! Must Visit with 4-5 Hours time as the museum collection is excellent.,"It not only educates but also entertains its visitors in different ways. It has international standards of presentation, which has been rated among the best and highly visited planetarium of the world. It is a place for everyone and can be afforded by everyone too as the Birla Planetarium entry fee is also minimal. What I liked the most in the center were the exhibits where the different working model of various scientific principal are displayed and kids are encouraged to play with them. So the children visiting the museum can not only see the exhibits they can actually try them out and learn science principals that they may be aware only by theory from their school curriculum. Overall I would highly recommend visiting Birla Science Museum and Planetarium with your kids and spend a day learning about not only science, dinosaurs, planets, stars but it will be a day well-spent bonding with your kids."
B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Venkat_Mumbai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Sky Theatre + 3D show,"The Sky theatre show was at 4 pm in english.  (They run shows in English, Hindi, and Telugu) please check their website for revisions if any.  The area is on a hillock and felt cool.  We clubbed the same along with Birla Temple.  The show inside the sky theater was very good. The projector is the older one as compared to the one in Nehru Planetarium in Mumbai, and wanted to show my son, how that works.  Post this show, there is a 3D show in the next block, on ocean and aquatic creatures.. Show at sky theater is for 30 min and the other one for 15-20 min.  Value for money and time spent."

B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Vipul556,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,No entry,"with a lot of excitement we visited this place to watch a show in the evening but unfortunately there were not many visitors that day and they require a minimum of 15 people to be there for shows which did not happen so we could not watch any... there are 3 shows in English, 1 in Hindi and rest in Telegu.. not enough audience for any of them.. the goverment should do soemthing for if in a city like Cyberabad there arent many takers then where would they be in India"
B_M_Birla_Planetarium,itspriyanka,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Sky theater show was good,"We went on one of the weekdays and the place was full of school kids. The first show at 11:30 was already booked by schools, but luckily for us some kids did not turn up and we got the seats at the last min. The show inside the sky theater was very good. It would have been better without school kids shouting, but nonetheless the content was good. Our 6 yr old son loved it too! There was another show on ocean and aquatic creatures. The audio for that was very poor and we could hardly hear anything. Show at sky theater is for 30 min and the other one for 15-20 min."
B_M_Birla_Planetarium,Vijay M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Worth a visit for piquing your kids intrigue,"The pros: Museum and planetrium in the same complex. Good planning ensures you see the 2 places in half a day. One can add the Birla temple to the list of places to be covered in half a dayThe cons: Bad approach, narrow roads that are further congested with parked vehicles. No card/paytm accepted....Ahem..is this not accounted for money or black money 😢. Just 2 English shows from 10 am  to 5 pm. No restaurant on the  campus. No seating in museum or planetrium. Parking in the campus is tough. Museum can be further developed.   "
