Bus No: 5K,5S,5 From Secunderabad to Mehdipatnam any bus no. 113 from Uppal to Mehdipatnam.Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple, built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The construction took 10 years and was opened in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all of which are known as Birla Mandir....The temple manifests a blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani and Utkala architectures. It is constructed of 2000 tons of pure white marble. The granite idol of presiding deity Lord Venkateswara is about 11 ft (3.4 m) tall and a carved lotus forms an umbrella on the top. There is a brass flagstaff in the temple premises which rises to a height of 42 ft (13 m). The temple does not have traditional bells, as Swami Ranganathananda wished that the temple atmosphere should be conducive for meditation.Apart from the main shrine, the consorts of Lord Venkateswara, Padmavati and Andal are housed in separate shrines. The temple also has separate shrines for various Deva and Devi including Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh, Hanuman, Brahma, Saraswati and Lakshmi. Selected because teachings of men and Gurbani are engraved on temple walls. Birla temples are open to all, as identified by Mahatma Gandhi and other Hindu leaders."

Birla_Mandir,Sriramramanathan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Pristine and Serene granite temple,"This is on the shores of Hussain Sagar, but the approach road is very narrow. This will lead to traffic chokes. Either go @ 7 am or if you go later, alight and walk to avoid delays. All vehicles ( specially cars) cannot turnabout until the temple gate and hence you will always have a backed up traffic to challenge. once you get into the temple , you have to deposit your mobile/ electronics and footwear into its respective lockers/ spaces. The mobile locker line will delay you further if you don’t go early morning. After this, the pristine beauty of the granite hill top temple will captivate you no bounds. The temple main deity is Venkateswara and you have the related gods and goddesses en route. The view from top, of the necklace road and Hussain Sagar is breathtaking."
