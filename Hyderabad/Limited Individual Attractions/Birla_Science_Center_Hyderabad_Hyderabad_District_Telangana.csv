Birla_Science_Center,Global-Bhatakanti,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,"Hyderabad Science museum, a thing to do for anyone above 6 year old",Science museum suitable for age group 6 and above. Personal experience is children below 6 doesn't understood much of what's showcased. Min suggested time to spend and require to see most things is 1 hr. Ticket price is INR 150 for all above 3 yr old. They should lower the children fee. Parking available in the premises but difficult to find on weekends and public holidays. On display is 160 milion dinosaur skeleton found in Telengana. Outside public premises has many antique idols and statues. Planetarium is right besides science museum. 
Birla_Science_Center,Ravindra V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Family,Lot to learn and explore,"Lot to learn for people of any age group. There are so many science experiments.

Birla_Science_Center,Gowrish P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Great place for children. But can do better.,"Birla Science Center and Planetarium are in the same complex. There is a separate listing for Planetarium. This is a review of the Science Center only.BSC is one of those places that every city needs and I am sure that was the intent of this as well. However, I can see that BSC could do more to keep up with the times. That said, this place is still a good place to spend half a day, including if you have children, say in primary and middle school.Location: Set atop a hillock, BSC boasts of some of the best views atleast to on three sides. You go up through a narrow hill to find the main gate to the left. There's *paid parking* inside the gates.*The ticket counter* is right by the parking lot and pick up all your tickets beforehand. *Suggested itinerary* is to visit the Planetarium and then go to the BSC. That way you can visit the BSC without anxiety of the show time of the Planetarium.What to do: These are the key venues here*Interactive Science Center at the reception or Ground level *Archeological Exhibits at Level -1. This level also has the Nirmala Birla personal collection section.*Remote Sensing and IEEE exhibits at Level 1*Dinosaurim at Level 2*Interactive center is where children will enjoy the most. It shows with hands on experience how some fundamental principles of physics, mostly, work. Some exhibits were not working or in poor condition. Signages were missing in a few places.*Archeological collection is worth the visit. It traces thousands of years of cultural and art history - war implements, household and occupational tools, scriptures, a good collection of South India mythological sculptures and paintings, coins and other miscellaneous artifacts. Do not miss the *Room Royale* that houses some of the rarest and most expensive item of interest including an ornate carpet, one guard told us, runs into hundreds of crores in value. There are no descriptive signages for anything. They are labeled, but do not tell much. BSC could consider providing audio tours for the exhibits to provide appropriate context.*Remote Sensing and IEEE* floor has some computer based and model based learning around how RS technology is applied  to the field of archeology and agriculture. Some models of advanced physics concepts are displayed here. E.g. How Raman Effect is used in Oncology.*Dinosaurim* is interesting too. The full scale skeleton of Sauropod makes for a good exhibit. The artifacts, here, were found in the neighborhood of Hyderabad I.e in Adilabad. *The guards are intrusive* about not taking pictures, while there really was no signage on this floor prohibiting pictures. One should wonder why this should be even prohibited. This is a nuisance.All in all this good place to spend indoors, in summer.Some additional pointers for BSC management:* You have a grand reception counter, but it was not at all manned. There is nothing useful there even if someone were present. Can some information and brochures be put up here?* What is the use of a Pearl Shop for a souvenir shop? This is a an example of where BSC could keep up with the times. There's  much opportunity lost for marketing BSC here."
Birla_Science_Center,Mitali S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Kids loved the Science Museum (v interactive),"Do go here if u have kids above 6, this place actually allows you to see the results of few science theories.Its a  very interactive museum where kids can physically see the reactions of certain science principles.You can skip the planetarium and dinosorium (as they call it) nothing exciting and new "
Birla_Science_Center,Mayank Dwivedi,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,"Nice Idea, outdated execution, zero maintenance","I visited this based on the top destination in Hyderabad online, and me being a science geek.The centre is in a deplorable condition. Zero maintenance. Some exhibits are falling apart, or already gone.Most of the displays are outdated, even the staff don't seem to care about them.The science museum could have so much more potential to become a centre that excites young individuals to pursue science, and instigate excitement about the same. Science museums across the world use much better technologies, display fonts and methods, interactive science displays, right lighting & positioning etc.Audio tours, guided tours, merchandise selling etc. can add additional revenue to the science centre (which can be used hopefully for maintenance / upgrade).I sincerely hope this centre gets a much needed renovation, and gets updated on the modern advancements in science. - Mayank"
Birla_Science_Center,Pradeepk79,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,A good Science Centre spoilt due to complete neglect.,"I went to this place with great expectation.

Birla_Science_Center,BhautikVVaidya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,A must see location in Hyderabad.,"This science center is one of its kind. It has objects related to history, science, space and dinosaurs. The trip is definitely worth the money. The most unique part is the history section in which there are idols that are older than 1000 years! The ground floor had many experiments, which show the workings of scientific principles in a practical sense. The 1st floor had models of the part of Antarctica which is controlled by India and had the model of the sunken city of Dwarka (very informative). The 2nd level had the bones and information on Dinosaurs and other animals that lived with the dinosaurs. The museum has a lot to show and see so it could be completed in about 3 hours. We have visited many Science Museums, and we can surely say that the history and Dinosaur section is better than those at most places."

Birla_Science_Center,MrH0rnet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Best science and art place to visit,"This place has 5 sub category to visit1. Planetarium: Amazing experience , specially for students and science enthusiast. Well explanation and 360° screen are like you are sitting under clear sky. Though , I felt explanation can be made little easier fir understanding of school children.2. 3D movie about solar and space facts:Great for young school children knowing already and having watched many 3 movies it felt boating. 3. Art Galary : perhaps biggest one I hva visited so far. Spread on 3 floors, most people just visit modern art Galary and miss the best part. In front of art Galary there is huge series of art, Specially we liked painting by Iqbal Hussain on Indian Mythology and history . Amazing details. I wish I could take photos but it wasn't allowed.4.Dianasorium: Huge skeleton of Dianasour found near Hyderabad and information are gear. Touching 200 million old fossil is just a great experience.5.Science Museum with live experiments: this is just a unique experience of day to day life physics. Huge learning for any student. There is IEEE experiments to hands on too. This must for any student to visit.Overall, in 200 per head, this is most fun place in Hyderabad so far."

Birla_Science_Center,CaptainBasu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,"Great potential, poor maintenance","The place is a storehouse of some greatly intriguing science objects. However, it is very poorly maintained. The planetarium is small but the explanations were clear. Remember to bring lots of water on a summer day. Though not too big, you will need to walk up and down a number of stairs.Suggest climb right up to the planetarium first (shows in English starts at 1130) walking your way down thru the galleries on different levels to reach the science museum at the ground level. There is a separate ticket for the Planetarium which includes the 3D show, and separate ones for the rest of the place. The entry prices kept changing based on God knows what. It was RS.60 on Monday when we arrived, but came up to RS.80 by Wednesday when we actually visited.The science section needs serious maintenance, many gizmos are either inoperative or totally absent.  The Planetarium offers some interesting shows along with the 3D theatre of the seven wonders of Solar system. Expect to spend three hours at leisure."

They will spend the day discovering, learning, experimenting and watching. At the end of 3 hours, we were still not done. The Nirmala Birla Dolls Museum , then the Archeology museum, where we really saw the grandeur of our past - stone age, iron age, pottery meticulously preserved, terracotta animal figurines that reminded me of Harappa valley pottery figurines.  Then there was Indian painting, Philately, Numismatics, Art. It was 2 hours before the children exited just the basement floor. Then we went to the science experience center, where children play with specially created learning toys. You can easily put kids there for 90 minutes and forget about them. After that it was time for the observatory in the planetarium next door, so off we went. We could see Mars (nothing impressive) and Jupiter(we saw the stripes of Jupiter and the 4 moons of Jupiter). It was awesome! Then we came back to the Dinosaurium. It has a full skeleton of a large dinosaur, one preserved egg fossil, and some bone fossils. Its an awe inspiring skeleton. The building is basic, but that skeleton.. is something!! We missed the space and Antartica Diorama, but we have seen that earlier. MOre than anything else, this visit got me thinking about private museums in the country. This was absolutely fantastic."
