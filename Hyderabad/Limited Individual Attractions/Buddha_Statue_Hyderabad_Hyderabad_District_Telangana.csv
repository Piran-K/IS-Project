Buddha_Statue,Gorgan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,NOT ALLOWED! NOT ALLOWED!,"""Not allowed! Not allowed!"" has become one of the most popular Indian mantras in recent times. It is chanted whenever a tourist carrying his camera is about to enter the site. Fortunately there was a cloak room where I could temporarily store my camera otherwise I would have been asked to pay a 1000-rupee fee. The same mantra was repeated to me at the entrance of other two parks but in those cases there were no cloak rooms. As a result I had to give up on them otherwise I would have been charged 2000 rupees.It's hard for me to understand what is wrong in taking pictures of a Buddha statue, or gardens or the Indian flag or whatever. With that being said it was nice to take the boat to visit this landmark in Hyderabad."

The Statue of Buddha stand on a small island in the middle of Hussain Sagar Lake. The tall statue is mounted on a pedestal and is visible from the shore. The island can be accessed by boat, which are available from the Lumbini Park. There are various types of boat services available on different payment options. The boat service makes the experience of visiting the island, ordinary.First of all, there was a long queue to buy the tickets, then the visitors had to queue to get on the boat. Later, there was also a rush to return from the island to the shore. Overall, this whole visit was quiet taxing.Best is to avoid going to the island and absorb the beauty of the statue from the shore."

Buddha_Statue,Arun Karthik,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Good Place to Hangout,"The creation of Buddha statue, which has been carved out of single stone, took close to 2 years. About 200 sculptors have worked endlessly to give birth to this marvellous sculpture. It has been carved out of white granite stone which was found on a mountainside, near Nalgonda, located about 40 miles from Hyderabad.Not many are aware of the fact that the Buddha statue in the Hussain Sagar boasts of being a holy pilgrimage as well. It was sanctified by the spiritual leader Dalai Lama himself in the year of 2006.This grand Gautam Buddha statue in Hyderabad owes its construction to then CM of Andhra Pradesh, Sri Late N. T. Rama Rao. The idea to create this monolithic statue of Buddha germinated from his visit to New York where he got inspired with the startling beauty of Statue of Liberty. It was after this visit, he showed keen interest to have a symbol which can stand for the opulence of our culture as well as represent the depths of our distinctive heritage.This statue is a result of the Buddha Purnima Project contribution, which was held in 1985. In the year of 1988, the statue was shipped to Hyderabad. Covering 60 km of distance, it was brought on a gigantic carriage, which had about 192 wheels. There were some troubles initially for mounting the statue. However, in the month of April in 1992, this captivating huge statue of Buddha was raised over the serene waters of Hussain Sagar Lake. Since then, it has been captivating visitors with its incomparable beauty. At the same time, the Lumbini Park with its famous musical fountains was also inaugurated.To reach the Buddha Statue, you have ferry service from Lumbini Park to the rock of Gibraltar, on which this statue stands. Although a sight worth capturing even from far, it is an enchanting experience to get a close look at the statue. You can also sit at Eat Street and enjoy the view with some mouth watering snacks.The best time to visit is evening. In evening, the statue is illuminated in different colourful lights. The sight of illuminated statue of Buddha, with just water all around it, is mesmerizing. It is something you cannot miss. The timings are from 8 am to 10.30 pm.Built in 1562, by Hazrat Hussain Shah Wali, Hussain Sagar Lake is spread over an area of 5.7 square kilometres, across a tributary of the Musi Rive"

And you need to purchase a camera permit if you use a Camera other than mobile phone. (Digital DSLR or any small or large camera).  It is cost INR 100 per camera. I went with my Digital mini Camera so i purchased. You have to keep your bags on bag counter and obtain a token too. Ferry Boat ride to the island (round tour) only cost INR 55 per person. and entry to island is free of charge. Boats leave on time schedule. and will wait for 15 minutes to your sight seen in island. once the tour ends within 15 min, boat will call to you to get back. Toilets are located in Lumbini Park just for INR 5 per use. Lumbini Park is great pleasure to children. In evening, lazer show also available. I had a pleasant experience in the morning. You can't get out from the entrance. You have to use exit at near toilets and passing over restaurants etc and back to main road, and need to walk to bag counter to collect bags. You can have good foods and shopping at cafes, restaurants etc at the exit of the Lumbini Park. All together ticket cost for two person was INR 260 (entry, boat, toilets and camera permit).

Buddha_Statue,RitaKakkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Majestic Buddha,"A ferry ride takes you to the Buddha statue, where you can look around for a few minutes and then return by another ferry or motorboat. They do not wait for the ferry to fill up, but start as soon as there are a few people on board. Very well managed by the Telengana tourism department. They are helpful, but the tourists are not. In spite of our age, they were pushing past us. Buddha stands tall and majestic, carved from a single stone.Nice shops and eateries when you return to the park. "
Buddha_Statue,MSR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,"Buddha statue, Hussain Lake, Hyderabad","Legendary Telugu film actor turned in to politician Sri. N.T.Rama Rao, then Chief Minister of united Andhra Pradesh between early 1980s to late 80s conceived the idea of having something great deed in the lines of Statue of Liberty and chosen Goutham Buddha. Even today, one can able to see the granite besides Hyderabad to Warangal highway near Yadagirigutta location, the rock out of which the statue was made by Sri. Ganapathi Stapathi, a famous temple architect and expert in  sculptures. I still remember those years, how much sum was expensed to create 58 feet toll and about 400 tones of   monolithic sculpture said to be World’s tallest statue of Buddha. Even, still remember the pain staking journey of the sculpture from Raigiri to Hyderabad by expanding roads to reach the Hussain sagar lake. Even remember the accident occurred while erection of statue which had taken couple of lives and fallen in to lake. Later, it was salvaged from lake and brought to the shore of lake again by using high technical expertise the same was successfully erected on a massive concrete platform in middle of the lake after couple of years. And, still remember the ceremony of statue consecration by His Holiness Dalai Lama and then become one of the tourist attractions of Hyderabad. One can reach this island from Lumbini park by boats. To be frank, this lake water to be cleansed. One suggestion for all, being water around, be careful while visiting this place with kids."
