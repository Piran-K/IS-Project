Charminar,Rahul2604,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Solo,Little bit disappointed,"Disappointed, Landmark of Hyderabad still not well maintained,expected something better,also the area surrounding is full of street vendors,not saying that everyone should be removed but at least make a 10-20 m buffer zone surrounding the Charminar,vendors are as close as they can from the monument,not an pleasant experience for tourists when they are here to explore Charminar.The area around the monument is just like any old city area in India eg Old Delhi/Chandani Chowk,congested,crowded but full of life,lively,many legendary restaurants to enjoy,also this area is famous for pearls and pearls jewelry.During Ramazan worth to visit in evening/night if you are a foodie."
Charminar,Saurabh M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,The Grandeur that lines in the heart of Hyderabad......,"Exploring Telangana....... Hyderabad......at Chairminar........Best way to reach is get down at  MGBS metro station and take bus or auto..... Or directly auto from anywhere....An identifying feature of the city, Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar.Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar has been synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era. It is a massive structure which has four minarets which many believe stand for the first four 'khalifas' (Prophets) of Islam. Towards the north of the monument, there are four gateways known as Char Kaman which have been constructed in the cardinal directions. The structure was intended to serve as a Madrasa or a Mosque. In its present form, Charminar, has been added to the 'tentative list' of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.The structure of Charminar is an exquisite example of Indo-Islamic architecture with Persian influences. The arches and domes of the monument define the influence of Islamic architecture, while the Persian influence is prominent from its minarets. The balconies and the outside walls, embellished with delicate stucco floral ornamentations on the ceiling, showcases the influence of the Hindu style of architecture.At the base of the Charminar is a small temple called as ""Bhagyalakshmi Temple""....The Charminar was built to commemorate the decision and eradication of plague from the city. It is known as Charminar as it is supported by four minarets on four sides which were possibly meant to commemorate the first four caliphs of Islam. The old city of Hyderabad was designed keeping Charminar as the centre of the city. According to some legends, Quli Qutub Shahi saw his beloved wife, Baghmati, at this very site. He built Charminar as a symbol of his eternal love for his wife. There is also a legend that talks about the existence of a secret tunnel under the Charminar that connects it to the Golkonda Fort. It was created as a means of escape for the royal family in the time of emergencies.Charminar is famous for many things but is most known for the lip smacking dishes and great bargain shopping. There is no better place for shopping in Hyderabad than the area surrounding the Charminar. The streets are brimming with people at all times, with the shops displaying attractive and colourful bangles and jewellery. It is popular for bangles, pearls, jewellery, semi-precious stones, silverware, Kalamkari paintings, sarees, silk materials, gold embroidered fabric, lacquer bangles, ittar and the traditional Khara dupatta. This street is filled with people and haggling is part and parcel of this market....."
Charminar,jojo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Charming Charminar,"Of much historical importance the monument was crowded when we visited. It was properly maintained but the surrounding areas needed proper control.Being the lanmark of Hydrabad attractd visitors. Area near parking was not properly kept neat and clean.. The area was famous for shopping. especially clothing,, novelties, artificial jewelleries, domestic items etc. Bargaining was must. The people around were very cordial and friendly. Rather congested area more attenton was required.. The evironment of festival making happy especially the kids."
Charminar,Xavier D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Charminar,Charminar is symbol of Hyderabad for rest of the country as well as for the world. Unfortunately during my visit it was very highly crowded.
Charminar,vasant agshikar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Charminar trip,"Best time to visit charminar by 9 am if you wanna enjoy the view without hustle bustle. You can click some pics too and observe the ancient monument. Evening time visit has its own charm as the crowded with full of people and lively market.  One can do local shopping of bangles, pearls and other stuff"
Charminar,Gurutej,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,Charminar ,"Nothing very special here. To be visited only because it is the landmark of Hyderabad. The parking area is almost non-existent, and the place is fully congested. "
Charminar,Raman G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,A crowded place. To visit only because it is popular ,Went in the afternoon.  We walked in 5 minutes to this place  from Chowmullah Palace. A visit only because it is popular. And has been advertised a lot. The area around is dirty and crowded with hawkers. The latter keep pestering.  The segregated area around it has hawker stalls which is a pain for a tourist. It could have been developed beautifully.  One is allowed to climb up to the first floor. We did not do so.
Charminar,OctOriental,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,A good draw but horribly congested,"Touted as a hallmark of Hyderabad. But it's a risky, unenjoyable and terribly congested place with a million or so hawkers cluttering up the place and rendering it unworthy of your time and effort. The least the administration could have done is clear up the central area at least to afford a good view of the Charminar."
Charminar,Chandra J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Grand but very busy,"Incredibly  busy, hard to walk.  Good chai tea bakery right near monument.  Went during Diwali so it might have been busier than usual.  Couldn't get up close."
Charminar,stevebintley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Colourful and full of action,"What a place! This is a must visit for anyone in the city and the colours and atmosphere in an evening are superb. I’m reliably informed that weekends are particularly busy, and given the number of people on the mid-week day I visited I’d encourage to avoid too, but it’s well worth battling the crowds to get into the centre of the action. There’s so many market sellers although none are too pushy, live performances and a generally friendly vibe. The history is great, so many good photo opportunities and a real insight into the local culture. Highly recommended!"

Charminar,Vaishnavi_g,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Good for shopping. But nothing much for sight seeing,"Charminar looks well maintained from outside. Impressive structure. But not worth going in and climbing up. Interiors are not well maintained. You get pigeon smell. I guess the whole hype around charminar is for the huge flee markets and other shopping areas around it. Where you you can shop just everything from clothes, pearls, bangles and other collectibles. Otherwise you can just watch this on postcard. Not worth investing time. "
Charminar,Sajid,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Awe-Inspiring Heritage,"The building, the structure is awe-inspiring and to think that it stands there for more than 4 centuries is amazing. What disappoints though is the fact that like most of the places in India, this monument is also not being maintained properly. I fail to understand, why do we find it so difficult to maintain our heritage. This is such an amazing piece of architecture, yet the neglect from authorities is glaring."

Charminar,Raja vishnu vardhan Reddy (visrey),5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Charming Charminar in late night ride,Seeing Charminar in a normal time is just like attending a fair with thousands of people bustling without even inch space. Best way to see Charminar without the crowd is visiting it after 12 though you can't actually enter inside charminar late night but it's a good measure to avoid crowd because of the covid and you can see no one wearing a mask in your vicinity if you are there in normal times.

Charminar,Lalz,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"Claustrophobic, suffocating and NOT WORTH IT.","The structure is iconic and is pretty much the face of Hyderabad but, is maintained horribly. I would strongly advise people not to go to the top. The staircase is extremely suffocating and cramped. No railing and once you go in, it's impossible to get out because there're people behind you. You have to get to the top, take a breather, and go down through a similar staircase. We went there and my mom almost fainted. If you're claustrophobic, DO NOT take a chance here. The marketplace isn't that well maintained either. I was born and brought up in this city and was really excited to visit the monument. Ruined everything for me."

The place is very crowded with small vendors occupying the entire road outside the beautiful heritage structure.

Charminar,Greg48,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Icon of Hyderabad,I first heard of the Charminar years ago by way of a cigarette brand which featured the structure on its packages.The iconic symbol of Hyderabad dates back to the 1500's and is an interesting structure with 4 Minarets and 4 arches. The area surrounding it is a busy street and jewelry market. You can find inexpensive bangles (bracelets) as well as very low priced 'pearls' which would make a cute item for young girls. There are also a number of Pearl Shops supposedly selling the gem that the city is famed for. Not being knowledgeable about jewelry I stayed with the costume jewelry and found the market to be enjoyable.

It was perfect timing. No traffic, no crowds, no bustle in the adjoining markets... Basically, it was easy to get in and out. I've been here three times before and as always, the Charminar was under repairs, this time around too. There was a scaffold around three sides of the monument. So a good selfie wasn't possible. However, it felt good to walk around it and have an Irani tea and a wedge of Dilkhush (bread stuffed with dried fruits) as an early breakfast from one of the many tea shops in the area. I hung around for less than an hour before heading over to my next destination. "
Charminar,Aratrika Basu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,The life of Hyderabad,"Chaminar is a lovely place. I really like to go here quite often, but I suggest one to visit it during the month of  Ramzan.

Nevertheless, Charaminar is awesome and one must go there when they come to Hyderabad."

It is possible to alight up the steep stairs to get a birds eye view of the city. However, the stairs are steep and made in a circular fashion, so aged people or anyone with even slight discomfort in walking should not explore this. The view from top is amazing. The insides are adorned with carvings. The ticket counter closes at 5.30pm. We got our tickets at 5.29 pmso we were lucky that way. The area around charminar is nice for street shopping especially bangles and jewellery."

Charminar,TheoP0001,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"if you are not afraid of crowds, this is a must visit in the old city","Especially on the weekends, the colours and tastes are breathtaking. But brace for enormous crowds. Yet, we never felt scared or concerned. But yes, there are thousands of merchants selling every cheap bangle, scarf and shoe you can imagine with dozens of fruit vendors and drugists.  All in the open space around the historic monument. But brace for the crowds. "

Charminar,Lyn V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Historical + architectural delight,"We visited Charminar with a guide one afternoon and enjoyed seeing the history of the place. We walked up the spiral staircase and enjoyed the view from the top. It was pretty crowded and in particular, the bazaar /markets below. We would recommend seeing this impressive monument built in 1591 and still standing the test of time. It gave us an insight into India's history. 🕌"

Charminar,Abhishek B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Not worth the climb,It’s enough to have a look at it from the ground floor. There’s absolutely no need to climb up the narrow path of stairs. The view is just like you would get from a big building .
Charminar,JeffCarter,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Great Crowd Watching,"I had one day to visit several places in Hyderabad. So I Arranged for a driver and struck out for the day. This is one place I definitely wanted to see, and climbed the steps to the top of the gate to see the views. The place was crowded (and Jan was off season) and full of locals selling almost anything. I wish I stopped an bought more items but I was on a mission to climb the tower and take photos. THe line to climb was long but moved very fast. It was not pricey to get in, and the climb was not bad. The spiral stairs were no worse than cathedral tower climbs in Europe. Beautiful views and the crowds were friendly. I assume pick pocketing might be an issue but i was careful to not bring anything but my camera and very small shoulder pack.   I definitely recommend a stop here and encourage you to take time to stroll around (I wish I did more)."
