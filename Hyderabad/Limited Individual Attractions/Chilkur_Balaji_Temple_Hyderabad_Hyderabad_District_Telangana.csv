Chilkur_Balaji_Temple,Michael P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Popular temple outside of Hyderabad,"Chilkur Balaji Temple, popularly known as ""Visa Balaji Temple'', is an ancient Hindu temple of Lord Balaji on the banks of Osman Sagar in Rangareddy District. It is one of the oldest temples in Hyderabad. There are many devotees, so it is usual to queue, see the deity and move on. There is a small bazaar in the temple grounds selling religious items and the usual tack. Well worth a visit to get away from the big city. Ola cabs provide 2,4 and 6 hour packages - 4 hours will probably cover a lengthy visit (travel time up to 1 hour each way) or you can catch a city bus."

Chilkur_Balaji_Temple,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Chilukuri Balaji - The wish fulfilling God including Visas,"This God is very powerful and people believe that your wishes will be fulfilled if visit and pray this God. I don't believe in such foolish beliefs without hard work. At the same time believe in God and pray regularly.But my suggestion is nothing comes free without hard work and effort. But belief in God may help you put your best efforts and and the efforts get fulfilled with God's blessings.OK. Let me tell you about the temple. The temple is very small. I so you must go early in the morning. How early you start and reach Chilukuru, you will still find devotees offering pradakshinas. It's over crowded with believers. So start as early as possible.For the first time when you visit you offer 9 or 11 pradakshinas and wish for your highest goal in the presence of God. Once your wishes come true you will have to visit the temple again and finish 108 Pradakshinas. 🙏* But one thing I found here its very difficult to finish 108 Pradakshinas in a single day for most of the people because of the crowd and conjusted temple. You need not worry about this because you can finish the remaining Pradakshinas in multiple attempts.* One more best thing that I found was that here is that you will not find find Hundi and Pujaris also don't take money from the devotees. That's really great.Overall as a strong believer of God I would say there is some special power that helps you fulfill all your genuine wishes by praying regularly."
