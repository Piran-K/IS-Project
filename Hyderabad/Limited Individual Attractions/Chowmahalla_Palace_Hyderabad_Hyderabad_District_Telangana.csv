There are no long queues to buy tickets. Photography is allowed on payment of a small fee. Do not be conned into hiring a guide because all exhibits are well explained and it is a nice stroll visiting the various palaces inside. Visit the Khilawat last because it is always crowded. If you can go early on a non weekend around 10 .30 when the place does not get too crowded. There is a nice shop inside the compound from where you can buy books and other souvenirs, The  canteen is about average and you can get tea , coffee, biscuits and sandwiches. There are clean washrooms inside the complex."

Once again we had fun being stopped by the other visitors to have our photo taken with them.

Surprising for a royal palace of the former Maharajas, this palace is still owned by the titular Nizams, although they don’t actually live there anymore.Much of the building is built in an Indo-Islamic style, but there also seems to be Neoclassical and Renaissance influences too. The durbar hall is probably the best room of the palace as its exceptionally beautiful with a white throne, marble floors and bright crystal chandeliers. The best thing to see in Hyderabad"

The rugs we walk on are low quality and some areas are dusty or paint peeling from the walls, so it needs more maintenance. A couple of buildings were closed but with interesting furniture and decorations seen through the windows. I especially enjoyed the lady's quarters area because it was fascinating to see how they lived, they had mannequins dressed up and protected behind glass. I saw a few vehicles outside that were completely old, dusty and falling apart. What a shame! I didn't see where the vehicles inside were, it might have been closed for renovation."

The Chowmahalla Palace has been meticulously restored to bring its past-beauty back to life. Once a seat of the great Nizams, this palace has played a perfect host to numerous royal guests and still welcomes its admirers with a majestic charm.Embellished with gushing fountains and opulent gardens, the palace-complex now retains two courtyards (northern and southern), marvellous palaces, the Durbar Hall, Clock Tower, Roshan Bangla and the Council Hall.

Chowmahalla_Palace,Bulbul,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Ideal for history buffs and photographers,"Also knows as Nizam Palace, the complex is clean and well-maintained. The palace was the seat of the Asaf Shahi Dynasty and was the residence of the Nizams of Hyderabad while they ruled their state. Shah of Iran’s palace in Tehran was a model for this palace.I found the royal court (durbar), known as the Khilwat Mubarak the most attractive. The ceremonies used to take place here under enormous chandeliers of Belgian crystal. There is Kilwat Clock above the main gate to Chowmahalla Palace which has been ticking away for around 250 years. The people of the locality wait for its chimes and correct their own watches by the accuracy of this clock’s timingVarious galleries in the Palace with each presenting an interesting display of crockery, clothes, furniture, coins and currency notes, pictures from the Nizam era, etc. will keep you engaged. Weapons are displayed interestingly not just inside the glass cabinet but on the walls as well, reaching till the top.The palace is ideal for history buffs and photographers."
