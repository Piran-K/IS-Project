Laser_Shooter,om a,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 â€¢ Family,AMAZING,"This trip was really fun. We were divided into teams and sent into the dark. The lights were the only thing guiding us. We shot each other with those play laser guns on the lit shields. This was for a bday party. I think the time flew by really fast, though I don't know whether it was less time or more enjoyment."
Laser_Shooter,tangbot1111,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,Best Team Outing,"Lazer Ops is one of the best physical indoor game zones for the team playing, You will get a good exercise here"
Laser_Shooter,Raajkumar1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,Best place for team activity,We went to this place as a part of our office team activity. It is a very good place to enjoy the lazer game. Sufficient place is there to run and hide as well. Bunkers are also designed very perfectly. overall it is very good. But the managers of the place are not so pleasant. 
Laser_Shooter,Jikuza,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017,Good place to enjoy a laser tag game,I visited this place twice- once with my friends and once with my office colleagues. The floor is quite big and the equipment is top notch.

Laser_Shooter,Sravan Vadde,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 â€¢ Friends,Could offer more customization in the gameplay,I have been to many Laser tag place in the US and this one meets international standards. The staff was helpful and helped our group of 12 to be split into two teams. The game itself is about 20 minutes and lots of fun. Just be careful so you do not run into each other. You get individual and team scores. We will be back.
Laser_Shooter,Gaurav5430,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 â€¢ Friends,Just had good times and very exciting fun with school friends in Lazer Ops city center.,one of the few laser tag places in the city. it is an unbelievable workout and too much fun. It is also very addictive
Laser_Shooter,meet_smokie3s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 â€¢ Friends,Good place to visit with friends,"The gear is in good shape. You get about 20 mins of gameplay. It is costly as compared to other cities.The arena is asymmetric, the team areas/sensors won't be activated unless you have teams of 5, friendly fire can't be turned on.Overall, well maintained, but costly. Worth trying if you haven't yet."
Laser_Shooter,avinash6583,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 â€¢ Friends,Overall a good experience needs improvement,"Just Tope fun visited many times in a year. Just want a membership of Lazer Ops city center mall. Visit atleast 200 day a year with friends. This is the only nearest place of gaming with bowling and Lazer ops. So, me and my friends visit here."
Laser_Shooter,anvesh2502,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 â€¢ Couples,Good adrenalin rush!,Good place and good arena. Detailed statistics post match. It would be exceptional if teams have a target to attack on rather than just attacking the opponents.
Laser_Shooter,Zain A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 â€¢ Friends,Lazer ops fun,"this is the second time I have visited Laser ops..I had great fun with my friends for 12 minscoming to the improvements.. I feel that we do need to have a laser pointing all the times rather than having it at the time of firing it i.e, I see the red spot when I fire at a person which is not required after you fire."
