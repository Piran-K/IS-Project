GVK_One_Mall,ShvRm_Traveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Nothing out of ordinary,"The GVK One Mall is not any different from similar malls at other locations. The Mall is multistory with most well known fashion brands having their outlets here. Visited the place during the evening on a weekday. The place had relatively fewer visitors, compared to other malls of similar type.It was also difficult get a public transport from the mall when we left, later.It may be a popular place to shop among the locals, however, the tourist may consider to skip this place, if they do not have any specific branded items on their shopping list."

The mall is VERY basic and is very quiet.  not much going on and not a lot of people.  The stores are very basic stores and nothing too flash.... you can go to Fabindia or Chumbuck or Soles.... but this is not a high end mall.  It is still ok, but not what I expected.  The food court leaves a LOT to be desired.  A few fast food stalls and that is it.  Compared to other malls in the area, I would not bother going to this one unless it has something specific you need...."

Everything from Shoppers Stop, Crossword, Mustard, Soch, Maanyavar Mebaz etc. You just can't help buying. The window displays are very enticing.

Mall is sparkling clean so also the rest rooms. It is located in Banjara Hills in the heart of the city. Only three words for this place Entertainment! Entertainment! Entertainment."
GVK_One_Mall,SreejithSreekumar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Average mall by Bangalore or other metro standards ,An average sized mall with sufficient shopping options.

GVK_One_Mall,SvenProescher,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018,Small but nice,"As all bigger shopping malls in Hyderabad are almost like any mall in the world, the GVK is different in terms of the fbb shop where you can buy more local clothing at an average price range. The much larger Inorbit Mall or Hyderabad Mall are all about international brands and there is not difference to a mall in Melbourne, Paris or Rome. So I would recommend the GVK even it's 1/3 of the other malls.  "
GVK_One_Mall,Dhruv M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Please renovate the interior. ,"This is a good mall, and has been amongst the top ones in the city. However, it is loosing its charm as it gets old. It needs a renovation on the interior if it wants to compete with other malls in the city like Inorbit and Forum.

This a very good place for shopping. It does have a INOX & food court. So if you're looking for some fun on weekends especially evenings this is a great place!
GVK_One_Mall,stantp1916,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Very nice mall,"Very nice mall, though not very big in size. There was a lovely aquarium in the first floor. Hosts almost all big brands as well as small ones too. We ate in the food court. Food court is not very big but has variety of food."
GVK_One_Mall,Travelcalm,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,GVK one mall,Overwhelmingly too much of international brand shops one next to each other. Nothing unique unless you have a requirement to visit a particular brand shop

GVK_One_Mall,Sanjaymit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Un clean restrooms neat food court,I visit this mall and watch all movies in its multiplex. I and my family usually enjoy quality time in its food court ( 3 rd floor) after movies and hence use rest room on this floor. But they are really unhygienic and unclean. A foul smell is a part of this rest room ( ladies) . It even doesn't have paper napkins to use after hand wash. The cleaners there are always busy in chatting n dressing themselves . I request concern authorities to rectify the matter which definitely is bringing bad name to entire mall.  
GVK_One_Mall,SKYLA S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good mall,"This is one of the good malls in the Hyderabad City.  Shopping - Good Branded Stores, Multiplex Screens, Good Choise of food. As the mall is located in a prime location and Movie screens are located in the 5th Floor you can expect the crowd through out the day. The mall is ideal for shopping/window shopping."

GVK_One_Mall,SuvodipMoitra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good Mall,"Its a decent/good mall. But too far away from Hitec City/ Gachibowli area. It has a good brand presence, a hard rock cafe, shoppers stop, pubs, restaurants & a INOX. Good for people staying in Banjara Hills area."
