Gandi_Maisamma_Temple,Deepika E,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Some corrections for temple austerity,"I am firm believer of Kali Mata and I hail from Hyderabad, But I wish there is less of meat cutting & cooking and more of fresh vegetable cooking and offering. And I wish people chant Devi Aswadati stotram written by Kalidasa mahakavi when in the temple. I wish it rings in the temple."

Gandi_Maisamma_Temple,Usha65,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Friends,Good but neglected temple,"While going to Umamaheswaram in  in Mahabubnagar District, on the way we visited this  temple  which is  very different than the other temples. This temple is in the Maisigandi village in Ammanagal mandal in Mahabobnagar district of Telangana state. Those who are visiting Srisailam can visit this temple on their way and it is about 70 km from Hyderabad. From Hyderabad one can go in the morning and return by evening. The temple is big with a giant (about 20 feet ht) idole and the Gopuram is also huge and different from all south Indian temples; Maa kaali is worshiped here.There are many small idols inside the temple and major attraction of this temple is the huge snake mound in the center of the inner side of the temple. However, it is not maintained very well and can see lot of dirt around. It is a very good temple with a very good idol and can not be missed."
