Gandipet_Lake,Ankur_the_explorer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Clean and peaceful lake,We went to this lake in the evening. There is ample car parking. Car parking is 20 Rs. After parking you can see a park. On paying Rs 10 per person you can enter the park. Nice for strolling around. You have some slides and see-saw for kids to play. Lot of people were picnicking here. You can also get view of the lake. Outside the park there is a small canteen. From there you can walk on the bridge and admire the lake. However you cannot go to the lake as it is fenced. Near canteen there are few stairs which take you to a sort of view point from where you can get clear view of the lake.

Gandipet_Lake,Daniel T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,"For the price, its a perfect option for day-out","Its a public place, so effectively you have a lot of space to walk round. Entry into the near-by park is nominal, this makes it a nice option for a day-out with family.Be careful when you walk over the bridge & go closer to the water from the park.Ample space for vehicle parking."

The water is abundant here and the rocks below the bridge make the scene more beautiful.We have a park beside this where the kids and family played, ate and enjoyed. At the other end of the bund, we can get down on the opposite side than the water. Its much greenery there with really small pond of clean water. But dont know if its allowed to get down there.
