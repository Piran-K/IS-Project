Golconda_Fort,Saurabh M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Historical Golkonda fort.....“Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far they can go.”,"Exploring Telangana........Hyderabad..... At the famous Golkonda fort......How to reach can take a auto or ola directly there....... Golconda Fort Hyderabad is an outstanding example of brilliant engineering and magical architecture. Located at a distance of 11km from the city, it is the most famous of all Hyderabad tourist places. The name of the fort has been derived from the Telugu words ""Golla"" and ""Konda"" which together means 'Shepherd's Hill'.An impressive structure, which once, would have bewitched every onlooker, stands majestically even today. Golconda Fort is sure to impress you with not only with that highly advanced techniques were used back then and sturdy structure, but also with an outstanding view of the surrounding city.Founded in the approximately 12th Century by the Kakatiya Kings, this massive Golconda Fort with eight gates and 87 bastions was later built by Qutub Shahi Kings.The name Golconda Fort has a legend behind it. As per the story, a shepherd boy was once walking on this hill when he had come across a God idol. The news about the shepherd boy and his findings reached the then ruler of Kakatiya Dynasty. The King then decided to built a fort on the hill, which then came to be known as Golconda (Shepherd’s Hill) Fort.However, almost 200 years later, the fort came under Bahamani rulers. Later Qutub Shahi Kings took the fort under their control and extended it further. The fort was fortified and expanded during the reign of Bahamani rulers and Qutub Shahi Dynasty. Later in 1687, this fort came under the rule of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. It was then the fort was left unattended.At present, the Golconda Fort constitutes a complex layout of palaces, temple mosques and pavilion, all of which unfortunately are in ruins now.Architecture of Golconda FortWith perimeters of around 11 kilometers, the fort has 15 to 18 foot high walls. It has huge gates that have pointed iron spikes on them. This protected the fort from Elephants damaging the fort as well as enemy attacks. Golconda fort presents a mesmerizing architecture which will astonish you at each and every step. This fort has been built on a granite rock with a height of 12 meters. Huge rampart around the golconda fort was built, a glimpse of which can still be seen.The system of acoustics in the Fort is something which attracts each and every visitor. The sound of clapping at the entrance can be heard at the ‘Bala Hissar' which is the highest point and almost a kilometre away. This system was apparently used for communication purposes, especially to alert royal in case of any attack.Other attractive features of the Fort include water supply system which does leave many marvelling at the advancement of the technical and scientific knowledge while constructing this fort. Another popular aspect is the 'Rahban' cannon.Ramdas’ prison is one of the popular spots inside the fort. According to legend, Ramdas who was a revenue collector in Abdul Hasan Shah's court was imprisoned. During his imprisonment, he carved Hindu deities on the wall of his cell. One can see many carvings of Hindu Lord Hanuman on the wall, which are now smeared with holy vermillion. A holy lamp or two (diyas) is also kept lit in front of the carvings."
Golconda_Fort,Nazura Javed,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Golconda Fort - Climbing for History,"The place is in ruins , needs better maintenance  and amenities like toilets. The approach road is through crowded narrow roads. Reaching the top of the fort requires a bit of stamina for one has to climb up steps and it can be a little hard for those not used to it. Also the day we went the place was pretty crowded.The good thing is that one does get a feel of history (especially if one is somewhat aware of Deccan India history) and also a great view of the city once you reach the top of the fort."
Golconda_Fort,Ruzan Desai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,"History, Hike and Panaramic Views",The Golconda fort is a great place for spending half a day. It is recommended to take the government approved guides( INR 750) to understand the true essence of the place. The guides are helpful with showing the stellar architectural nuances of whispering walls and echo points. It is worth climbing to the top of the fort. It is about 400 steps each way. The city view is excellent from there- panoramic in every sense of the word. There is a stall on the top with basic water and chocolates which provides adequate replenishments.
Golconda_Fort,jojo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Scenic Background with Historical Memories.,We visited the fort in the noon time. Ticket was Rs 25 per adult. It was almost crowded. But it was properly maintained. The fort was very beautiful and has historical importance. Having a majestic look spread over with memories of the past. Excited crowds being busy with photographs and the excellent scenic background.Guides were available.
Golconda_Fort,Andrew D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Lovely view from the top,"Compared with other forts in India, Golconda is not particularly different but it does have a good view of the surrounding areas from the top. That being said, I would still recommend a visit to the Golconda Fort for a taste of how lives must have been during the nizam's times."
Golconda_Fort,vasant agshikar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Golconda fort visit,I visited the fort and took a guide who provided me good enough about the fort. It is advisable you negotiate with the guide .the fort is well maintained and one can enjoy the view from various levels of the fort. The view from the top most point of the is awesome. The 700 step well is an uphill tasks if your having health issues like heart BP etc kindly avoid taking the stairs. The architectural is amazing and the science behind construction is also an interesting subject to study to know how advance we were then. It would take you 2 hrs to cover the entire area with enough rest and photography.
Golconda_Fort,TANISHK REDDY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Golconda lo Gola,Golconda is one of the iconic sites in Telengana state. I visited on a cool day and the views of Hyderabad hitech City was very good. It's a must visit place for all ages.
Golconda_Fort,Raman G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Can make a visit,"We visited the fort as part of our holiday to Hyderabad.  It is part of your sightseeing itinerary.  Managed by Archaeology Survey of India. We did not take a guide. ( as compared, for Agra fort you surely need a guide). It is mainly a walk in the grounds and a abt 300 step walk to the highest point in the fort open for tourists. As Senior Citizens,  we did  walk to the top. It is tiring. Did it at a slow pace. The main attraction is the view from the top."
Golconda_Fort,OctOriental,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,A feel of history,"Straightaway you get a feel of history of an old fort. It looks good as well, spanning a great distance from left to right. But do beware, there are several spots where the guards warn you not to venture into as some stone structures have loosened up and could collapse. Some people disregard the warnings. Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it. Do read it to get some first hand history."
Golconda_Fort,madhavi2022,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Awesome Golconda,read up before you go - guides are scalpers. Reach early to dodge the heat and crowds! Mask up as poor social distancing
Golconda_Fort,Chandra J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Great views.  Take a guide for maximum  enjoyment ,Easy trek up hillside unless you have problems navigating stairs.  Great views of the city and of the whole area.  Helpful with a guide so you know what you're looking at
Golconda_Fort,casandeep,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Fantastic Place....,If you are visiting Hyderabad this place you must visit. Though you will have to walk a lot but its worth to do so.  Taking a guide along is must if you really want to understand the rich history and the beautiful architecture. How things were visualized 500 years back is simply unbelievable.
Golconda_Fort,skychaserCalgary,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Great Views,"Very historical place, walked up to the top and back down again….superb views of the city from on the top"
Golconda_Fort,Michael M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Amazing,"We were in Hyderabad for work but I was taken with colleagues to the Fort so I could see some of Hyderabad not just do work.The old (800+ years old) decorative carving showing the connection to what is now called Iran was incredible.There are several locations that have perfect acoustics - experiencing them is the only way to give it justice as words fail. For example there is a spot where if you clap you can hear an echo but walk two steps away from that spot and there is no echo. The age of the Fort is comparable to the early Norman kings of England - I had no idea that buildings like this existed in India that far back.There is a lot to see, and a lot to climb - depending on how adventurous you are you could climb to the top mosque.Alas there is a entry fee for Indians and a much higher fee for foreigners......"
Golconda_Fort,ullacarinquiterio,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Golconda Fort,The fort was a nice experience but the biggest disappointment was that there is no  sound and light show as it is under repairs and no-one can tell when it will start again. 
Golconda_Fort,sramanujamk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Very good place to visit with kids,A must place to visit with children.

Golconda_Fort,jasno,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,"Rich history, hire a guide","Truly an impressive historical landmark.  Pretty substantial walking and uneven stairs, which adds to the authenticity but FYI for those that don't get around well.  HIGHLY recommend hiring a guide (~500-1,000 rupees for english speaking), there are really need sounds, echos, and histories that require some explanation."
Golconda_Fort,Wellwomen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Golconda,Had a good trip going around the fort walls Lighted well in evenings because of local bonalu festival Colourful festival with lot of live music and colourful characters Missed sound and light show though as it was raining had to get back

Especially how sound gets transferred from one area to another.There is a Light and Sound show in the evenings. Plan your visit accordingly. There is an entrance fee.
Golconda_Fort,Michael P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Fort towering above Hyderabad,"The fort covers an immense area although the outer walls have mostly disappeared now. Originally an 11th century temle was built at the top of the hill, Mahankali Temple. The history is fascinating as are the acoustical wonders. Unfortunately, as was the custom, the architects were executed after completing their work - so their secrets remain. It is well worht taking an official guide - 750 rupees for the shorter one hour tour or 1000 rupees for the longer tour - 2 hours in my case."
Golconda_Fort,rd07,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Its in ruins!,"Beautiful fort,  in complete ruins and not been taken care of. Its a massive fort with broken, unknown history spread over 500-700 years. Its not been kept in a best shape as vandals have written their names across the fort. Entry ticket is way too less at Rs.25. The management should charge higher amount and keep the fort in a good shape and preserve history.   "

I enjoyed driving there even though it was a narrow road. The only problem is it’s similar other forts on Delhi and elsewhere in India. So, if you are short on time, there are better places to visit in Hyderabad."

Golconda_Fort,Ardhanareeshvara,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Couples,Ancient Fort in a Modern City,"The Golkonda Fort looms over the modern city of Hyderabad in Telangana where it has stood since the 15thcentury. Built on a hill it is a fortified citadel which passed through several hands  before the Qutub Shahi dynasty was established.The nearby diamond mines produced the fabled Koh-I-Noor diamond now among the Crown Jewels in the U.K. with several other renowned ones.A massive granite fortification extends around 5km in circumference. The fort later fell into ruin and taken over by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century.The Fort continues to impress with its Victory Gate, Main Entrance Gate and the Durbar Hall and  the Baramati atop the hill. There is a Mosque of Ibrahim also there.The structure is in fairly good state of repair and the various tombs,Gardens, rooms and tanks are worthy of spending a 2-3 hours visit.The Golkonda Fort is popular with tourists and the local people alike. it is recommended that the tour is commenced as soon as the fort is open at 10 a.m. to beat the rush (esp at weekends) and the heat.There are plenty of photo opportunities so do not be in a rush."

One thing that I loved was the initiative taken by the authorities wherein each plastic item is marked and on return, you show them and get your money back. Quite innovative to keep the fort free from littering. Kudos to them."
Golconda_Fort,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Prime tourist attraction in Hyderabad,Golconda Fort is one of the prime tourist attractions in Hyderabad and we had visited the same during our sightseeing in Hyderabad. Entrance tickets are priced at 25 rupees per person. The Fort area is vast and one can climb steep steps to reach the top which offers amazing views of entire Hyderabad city. It was a hot day and we had a tough time reaching the top but it was worth the effort. There is a cafeteria within the Fort premises.
Golconda_Fort,Sunil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,The fort ,This place is very and need to have a car. The fort is too old and it is very beautiful constructed and its looks too good.

Golconda_Fort,PsychoEdinburgh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Excellent well preserved Fort,We visited the fort in the morning to avoid the heat of the day. You have to have a reasonable level of fitness to get to the top. There was lots to see on the way up and there was a lot of good signage too. You need to give yourself a good 3 hours to do it any sort if justice 
Golconda_Fort,Talent P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,greatest architectural wonders,"even after almost 800 years, the fort still stands as one of Hyderabad’s greatest architectural wonders. One of its greatest engineering marvels is the fantastic acoustic effects: one hand clap at a certain point below the entrance dome can be heard at the highest point of the pavilion almost a kilometre away. This was said to be used for warning the royals in the case of an attack."
Golconda_Fort,Sardev2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Impressive historical site,If you can cope with traffic then definitely worth a visit to GF. Best done during the day. Look out for secret tunnel at base of fort. Impressive site that is reasonably well maintained. Visited both day and drove past at night. Access is very limited as getting to the fort requires access thru old narrow gate which in Hyderabad means crazy traffic queues. Worth it.

Golconda_Fort,Alok Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Golconda Fort .. for thosecwho visit for atleast  2 to 3 days ,Golconda Fort is in the outskirts of city... the tourist guide are must who explains the stories of glory .. they will take yiy back hundreds of years back.. in history... Good for visiting in a cloudy day.. as it's hot in summer.. Specially if sun is scrotchy .. govwirh goggles and umbrella
Golconda_Fort,The Route Edit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Visit the fort skip the light and sound show,"This was my second visit to the fort. Last time we visited we didn't have time for the light and sound show so this time I made it a point to stay back for it. The fort itself is very beautiful provided you like historical places or else it would seem brick and mortar debri. Take a registered guide and remember to bargain for the rate coz without a guide it might seem boring. The view from the top is worth the climb and do check the amazing architectural acoustics of the fort. Coming to the light and sound show, I would suggest you give it a miss. They give you a complimentary odomos tube with the tickets so you can imagine the amount of mosquitoes you are about to face during the show. You will be so busy battling mosquitoes that the real battle stories wouldn't seem that interesting. I sat there and dozed off for a major part of the show. I like history and have watched lots of light and sound shows but I guess this experience wasn't that great for me. "
Golconda_Fort,Nipunika J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Interesting visit,"Visited it in late afternoon in December hence was pretty hot. It was pretty crowded, the fort is interesting place. Worth a visit when in Hyderabad. The roads around are narrow, hence plan your visit likewise if driving there. "
Golconda_Fort,doug m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Well worth a visit,"Fascinating old fort with extensive fortifications. Allow plenty of time for the long and very hot climb to the top where extensive views are to be had, including the nearby tombs (which are also worth a visit)."
Golconda_Fort,NITHIN KUMAR CHINTHAKINDI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,great place,"Golconda Fort, also known as Golkonda is a fortified citadel and an early capital city of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, known as the Golconda Diamonds."

Golconda_Fort,Praveen K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,wait for light & sound show in the evening,"Visit to this magnificent fort is incomplete without attending light & sound show in the evening, which tells the story of fort and the city"
Golconda_Fort,Oneil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Worth a visit,This is one of the places worth visiting when in Hyderabad. It has been maintained & kept fairly clean & enforced by their vigilant security staff. The only short-coming is the rates fixed by the guides there. INR 1250 charged by them is a little excessive.Electronic audio guides need to be installed by the Government/Management at the earliest.

Golconda_Fort,Lyn V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Great historical and architectural site,We really enjoyed the history of this ancient fortress. We went on a very warm day so take water with you. Love the old ruins and architecture and how they built into rocks and surrounds. Try to get to the top for the view and photos. Still in great condition for a fortress from the 12th century!
Golconda_Fort,Vikhil S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Historic visit ,"One of the most wonderful Historic destination in Hyderabad to Visit. It is recommended to visit this place early in morning when it get open, as it becomes easy to climb on top. Colourful light show at night inside the fort is shown. View from the top of fort feels amazing 😉 as it give panoramic view of Hyderabad city. Better to go in groups to enjoy the moments."
Golconda_Fort,om m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Fort Golconda..,Interesting fort to visit.would recommend it to future tourists. The visit will take about an hour.some of the areas in the fort are at a height and one has to climb a good number of steps.

Golconda_Fort,rachelsdnl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,A day well spent ,We visited the fort on a sunny afternoon. It was hot but still managed to walk through the fort. Its really awesome to know the facts about this fort so a guide is a must. This is the fort where the saying even the walls have ears originate from. It's so accurate. In the evening they have a light show showcasing the life of the nawab and his fort. There are 2 shows one in hindi and English. So if visiting this fort make it by evening so that you can watch the light show. It's enjoyable
Golconda_Fort,Martin W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Well worth a visit,"This is a massive fort set on a hillside just outside hyderabad.  If you are feeling fit, you can climb to the top, but it is perfrectly possible to see everything that matters from the bottom."
Golconda_Fort,AbhiMone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,A must see,A very well maintained fort by ASI. Try to take a guide as it enables you to understand the history better of this wonderful city
Golconda_Fort,Jimmycontra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Golconda Fort,"The Golconda fort is a real marvel of a fort as it has been built with scientific knowledge which in those days was not well known. When you first enter the gate, you go across stone pavings which give large echoes which can be heard right throughout the fort. Then the far at where the king would sit n you could never hit him. Then the air conditioner in the king’s bedchamber or the whispering wall. I would advise you to take a guide at the gates of the door , who would explain all the finest details n history of the fort, without it it’s just a ruined fort. Long walk upto the top but well worth it. In the evening there is a sound n light show, but do see the fort in the daylight to get the best of this beautiful fort."
Golconda_Fort,Akillchowdary,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Monuments and historical places,"Golconda Fort is one of the major tourist attractions in Hyderabad. I shifted from Delhi to Hyderabad in the last quarter of 2009 and visited several tourist attractions with my family thereafter. However we could visit Golconda (or Golkunda) Fort on 26.01.2011 only. We visited in the morning hours and enjoyed a lot from around 10 a.m. to the afternoon time before returning back to our home at B.H.E.L. colony (near Lingampalli). On 13.01.2013, we visited there for the second time, this time during the late evening hours and watched the Light and Sound Show. On both the occasions, the experiences of myself were simply mesmerizing. After the second visit, my daughter urged me to pen a review on Golconda. So, here comes the review.Golconda Fort is easily accessible from any point of Hyderabad city. It’s situated at around 18 kilometres from my residence, around 8 kilometres from the Secunderabad railway station and around 13 kilometres from the famous Chaar Minaar. Since I visited it during both the main timings, i.e., the morning time and the evening time, I enjoyed the outing in two different ways. The morning and the day time is quite useful in enjoying the geography of the fort containing 9 doors, the lengthy and high walls, the cave-like basement, the ammunition store, the various mosques, the graves, the Madanna Mandir, the Nagina Baagh, the residences of the erstwhile queens and the princesses and also the Bala Hisar which might have witnessed several conferences and seminars. The fort has three lines of influential fortification walls, one within another. The thickness of the very strong outer boundary well varies from 5 to 10 metres.From the height (Petla Burj), if you cast your eye from any ventilator, not only you will be able to enjoy cool breeze (until and unless, it is a damn hot day) but also have a bird’s eye-view of the city of the Hyderabad. Hyderabad appears to be like a beautiful painting from that height. If the wind is stormy, it may scare someone and it may also touch the soul of a sensitive person like me.Originally built by the Kaakatiyas of Waarangal and developed by Mohammad Shaah and Qutub Shaah, this fort is spread in 8 square kilometres. However for a tourist, it’s not feasible to roam about the whole area covered by the fort. So, just enjoy the practically walkable and climbable distance. Despite the affect of the passage of time being visible on it, the grandeur of the fort and the time when it was a symbol of glory can be felt quite easily. The famous diamond Kohinoor is said to be mined and preserved here only before it got looted and sent out of India.On a pleasant weather day, the visit to the fort can be enjoyed like a picnic too. The whole procedure of entering the fort by purchasing entry tickets and thereafter roaming inside is simple. I found the employees working there as customer-friendly and cooperative. During our second visit, after the Light and Sound Show, my wife and daughter forgot their purse and camera on their seats but upon coming to know of it, when we rushed there back, we got both the purse (containing money, driving license etc.) and the camera because the security people had preserved them and they returned them to us without a fuss.Eatables can be bought from the shops inside the fort and there is a cafeteria also at the top. Outside the fort, there are restaurants aplenty which can be approached for breakfast / lunch / dinner either before entering the fort or after coming out of it, depending upon your own programme. Beautiful pictures of the are also sold there which can be kept as memento. As far as wandering inside the fort is concerned, let me say that the whole fort is beautiful and it’s a pleasure to see different parts of it carrying different significance of their own. The thing, in my opinion, required to enjoy it to the full is your imagination power to visualize that period and those people. Even it is not-so-good, never mind. The Light and Sound Show in the evening (in both English and Hindi) is there to help it.I found the Light and Sound Show as the best attraction of the fort. Though I have seen the Light and Sound Show in the Red Fort of Delhi too, this Light and Sound Show, taking us back into the bygone era, proved to be an altogether different experience for me. Not only the dialogs and different relevant sounds impressed me and made me feel like watching a good historical movie; but above all,  the pieces of music and songs inserted in the narrative depicting the love (male-female) of the characters that existed in that time effortlessly won my heart. Any music lover will be just too happy to witness this programme.The charges for entering tickets as well as for the Light and Sound Show appeared reasonable to me. We enjoyed the show in ordinary class, however there’s an executive class too with separate seating arrangement. Perhaps that place gives a better sight of the light switching from place to place (in the fort) during the show. I have come to know that there is concession in ticket rates for the school troupes.I have not given the minute details of the fort as well as its history which must be available on the internet. I just say that Golconda Fort is one of the best places to visit in Hyderabad. I have visited Chaar Minaar on one hand and Ramoji Film City on the other and I frankly admit that my visits to Golconda Fort have been the most satisfying ones. This mighty fort is the pride of Deccan. Once the centre of the Bahmani Kingdom as well as the centre of the diamond-trade, this grandiose fort gives you a call. Whenever you make a trip to Hyderabad, please don’t miss visiting it."
Golconda_Fort,Neelam Rawat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Winter destination !!,"The best months will be October to mid February as weather will be suitable for this place and best time is 9 to11am and 4 to 5:30 if visiting in summer .Please carry sunscream, hat, water bottle and shoes with good ground grips.You can also carry camera but you need to pay 50 rupees in addition to tickets.Inside the fort you can eat or drink as they have canteen inside the fort."
Golconda_Fort,betty u,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Not to be missed!,"The tour of Golconda Fort and the tombs was mesmerizing. My tour guide, Mr. Kalakundhi, was awesome and was full of information, very professional.  I was hesitant to go on this tour solo, since my daughter was in school, but SO GLAD I did. Gave me such a better historicial understanding of Hyderabad and surrounding area."

Golconda_Fort,Tara S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Nice fort to walk around and get view of city,Great place to spend a few hours walking around and exploring. Worth going to the top to see the temples and views.
Golconda_Fort,Sunder S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Disappointing!,"This was a huge let-down. The fort is a crumbling ruin, poorly maintained. All that has been done is to create a lawn-like space in the front. The rest of the fort is left as it is - overgrown weeds/plants, run-down look, and a general sense of decay. This could have been developed into something worthwhile - a pity! India has too many of these forts for us to bother about maintenance. Perhaps if the ASI could hand over these monuments to the local state government it would be better off.The tour guides simply try to rip you off - they start with a price of Rs. 1200, and what you pay is your skill to negotiate. We paid Rs. 800 for the long tour. Why can't the ASI also publish the tour guide prices like they do in other places?"
Golconda_Fort,Scarlet Fernandes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Golconda Fort,Great arrangements and stone carvings!!One can view the whole of Hyderabad from the top of the fort
Golconda_Fort,Saarah B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Beautifully buily,The fort is very marvelously built and the structure is one worth seeing. The fort is huge and it’s awe inspiring that such a beautiful construction was made in times where there were no machines and nothing to help people make the fort. The sunsets at Golconda Fort are ravishing. Will recommend going here if you have come to Hyderabad. 
Golconda_Fort,Ken W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Sound and light show,"We came in the evening to watch the sound and light show.  It’s about a 4 hundred metre walk from the entrance to where the seats are located.There are 2 sets of seats...vip on a raised area up some steps, and ordinary at ground level.  To be honest, I think the view was probably as good from the non-vip seats.  Bottom line, there’s not a lot of difference.They do give out tubes of insect repellent, but we had applied our own spray before arriving.  There are plenty of mosquitoes, but we weren’t bitten.The sound and light show was ok, but there were many songs and poems included  in the performance, which meant that the whole thing dragged on quite a bit.  We’d previously been to a similar show in Jaipur and Udaipur which were superior.  However, if we hadn’t been to the other shows, we probably would’ve enjoyed this one more.Overall, it was worth going but we won’t return."
Golconda_Fort,James L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,One of my stops with ASLI HYDERBAD,"It's quite a climb to the top, but worth it!  My guide Nagarjuna from Asli Hyderbad took me here, and had great knowledge about all the history.  Also kept me safe from all the people asking to be my guide!"
Golconda_Fort,JeffCarter,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Amazing,"I am so glad I came here. I was in India for a wedding and had a few free days so took a tuk tuk and came to the fort and learned a lot of history, the hope diamond is here or was, the only geocache in Hyderabad is here, and I had a wonderful afternoon just walking around. The weather was not bad in late January. There was a lot to see and do I even stumbled upon an indoor area that had a swarm of bats that was very cool to discover. The entrance fee was nominal and I think it was totally worth it a good way to spend a few hours and an interesting thing to see in Hyderabad."
