First of all, the temple is very good and awesome as it is golden and so many lords are there but why I'm saying it as above average, the reason is that I always feel like it was built with no proper planning. Why because the way for entrance and exit has not been constructed well as it is mixture of ups and down. I know the temple was built on hills, even-though it should be proper planned. The surroundings and outside place also be kept in a smooth structure. "
