Himayat_Sagar_Lake,Ashish Kumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018,"Nice place for bird-watching, but no proper maintenance.","The place is nice with different kind of birds all over, but need a lot of improvement with the waste management.A lot of plastic bottles can be seen all around with all sitting placed in damaged condition.Though a nice place to watch birds like earget, pond heron, cormorant, blue tailed bee eater, swallow, parakeet, shikra, Oriental Robin, water hen are few to be named.During entrance you'll be warned with a board ""Beware of Crocodiles"" but i didnn't found any in my 3 visits."

Himayat_Sagar_Lake,Amartya1987,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Walk a mile with the nature,"Let's set the right expectations. It's a reservoir with sluice gates in case water needs to be released downstream and there's a nearby park. That's it.Reaching the place is quite easy, take the APPA junction exit on ORR and come towards the himayat Sagar road. There are plenty of signage so you can't get lost enroute.There is a parking ready to accommodate around 30 -40 cars. Once you are in the place, you see 2 gates, one for the park and other for the reservoir.The reservoir doesn't close till late but the park gate closes by 5pm, so plan accordingly.The gate for the reservoir takes you on a mile of walk along the reservoir fence right up to the sluice gates and you can cross the gates and have some extra walk. The waking road is clean and picturesque. You can take a lot of nice pics. You can see a variety of birds chirping around, just be ready with your cameras to take the best shot.The park beside the reservoir also had some nice species of flowers and birds. There's a small play area for kids.Best is to walk the long distance along the reservoir and then take some rest in the park. But choice is always individual.The reservoir and parking is free, however, for the park, adults are charges 15/- per head.Coming to the food, you see a lot of bhutta(corn) sellers. Refreshing to have them in reading season.Right opposite to the place you have small refreshments points with some tea and bhajji sellers.Few of them sell fish fry, it's cheap and tastes great, non veg lovers can have a bite."

Himayat_Sagar_Lake,travelMakesWiser,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,Non tourist spot,"This place is not meant for tourists, though you will find people loitering around trying to get a good look at the lake. A reservoir, meant for water replenishment for the city, barricaded all around with high fences. The nursery next to the lake is in state of ultimate neglect. If you are a local who has kind of done everything else in Hyderabad this may be just a casual thing to cross off you ""things to do in hyderabad"" bucket list."

The place require slightly more maintenance, like the steps to go down opposite the dam.  There used to be a garden, that can be renovated and maintained.Stray Eunuchs still come to beg, but we did not find them as aggressive as encountered in Maharashtra and trains. The walk on the adjacent road is pleasant, best time to visit would be in December January, sunsets are really good near the lake."
