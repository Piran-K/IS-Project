Hussain sagar lake is a lake that has a buddha statue which is apparently carved out of a single stone. The statue is beautiful and for seeing the statue you need to take a boat ride either from ""Eat Street"" or from ""Lumbini Park"" there are also private small ships namely bhagmati etc which can be used for a private party, kitty party etc which has a restaurant inside it. These boats also have a live dance performance. The regular boat ticket is priced at 50INR which is adequate. The statue is worth spending it.  The boat ride is amazing and it drops you at buddha statue and gives you 15 minutes to enjoy the beauty of the statue and click pictures. After 15 minutes it takes you back to either ""Eat street"" or ""Lumbini park"" where ever you took the boat from. The experience is worth it for 50 bucks."

Overall a good place for evening strolls around the lake on park"
