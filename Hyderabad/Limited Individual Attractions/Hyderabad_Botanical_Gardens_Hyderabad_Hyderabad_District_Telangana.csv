Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,BhaskarVVB,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Multiple early morning health based trips,"Signed up for couch to 5k Hyderabad runners program being held 3 times a week since January 2020.As part of this program, I end up being there at 0600 am for about 90 minutes.There are quite a few health freaks trying to run, jog, walk, stroll with kids, stroll with spouse, play badminton, do yoga or just laze around to get free vitamin D.I took the monthly pass which makes it a little easier for this month.You get to drink some hot flavored health drink at the entrance. I cannot endorse as i haven't tried yet. However, do see folks relish it.All in all recommended as a good place early in the morning if you want some clean air and fresh surroundings.Happy botanicking & stay healthy."

Fun fact: A single round from the entrance, round through the Conservatory and back to entrance  is a distance of 3 km, with a lot of greenery making it a good place to jog. The only complaint is the small pond present could be cleaned to avoid the voluminous mosquitoes."

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Nitin A,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Still thinking what is there to do here,"Tortoise shaped building with a basic gym , few walkways and stinking water bodies. A covered area of different varieties of cactus is all I could find in this place.There were so many possibilities to make this place an educational place for kids but sadly the place is nothing to offer for kids.It is more of a joggers park rather than anything botanical about it.Disappointed."

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Vikram,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,A park that has botanical plants and scope to do more,"This is one of the last few lung spaces in the HiTech / Gachibowli area of the twin cities. Amidst the concrete jungle, this garden has greenery and plants with medicinal value. This space could have been invested to yield more and provide more herbs as well as home to many species of insects, & birds. The lack of water for the plants is affecting many invaluable ones.   "

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,EkMusafir,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Open Space For Recreation.,"The Botanical Gardens of Hyderabad, officially known as Sri Kotla Vijayabhaskara Reddy Botanical Gardens, is located on the Miyapur-Gachibowli Highway in the Kondapur area. There is a huge free parking lot for cars and two-wheelers.Upon entering you have to buy a ticket for ₹25 per person, and there is a stiff fee for photography and videography. It seems that these fees are meant for commercial shootings, but everyone was entering without paying for their cell-phone cameras, and many were taking selfies. If you are a regular morning walker you can buy a pass for ₹400 per month or ₹1500 for an annual pass.As you enter there are some life-like statues of animals and birds laid out in neat gardens. There are some demarcated areas for yoga, a wellness center, a party zone, skating rink, mini golf course, fitness center, an adventure arena, a video hall, conference hall, and an amphitheater. There are some cottages for rent and a Food Court which opens later in the day.The main walking track leads into a dry forest which is more brown rather than green. The track is made of a mixture of sand and gravel. The full round of the track is about 3.5 km. You can hear peacocks early in the morning, and if you are lucky you may even see some. Other smaller birds like bulbuls, babblers, sparrows, and bee-eaters can also be seen and heard.It is best to go early in the morning if you want to exercise your limbs. Compared to parks in other parts of the country, like Bangalore or Pune, the entry rates are very high, and the park is not so green and soothing to the eyes. The Telangana Forest Department should work on these aspects to make it a better experience for the nature lovers."

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,nik c,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Some people would call this extortion,Went to these gardens recently expecting to visit botanical gardens.When we went to buy entry tickets they wanted to charge the four of us the equivalent of $160 each for each of our cameras.   Needless to say we didn't go in.   Is this just another attempt to take advantage of tourists who might not know the value of the rupee exchange rate?
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,SURESH babu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Good,We are happy with their service and quality of food. We will definitely visit again and again. It's great pleasure to us.
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,GBee,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,"Very little to see, scamming tourists with cameras","They are charging upwards of 4000 rupees (£43, $56) just to take a camera into the 'gardens' - since no right-thinking local would pay even a fraction of that amount. I can only assume they are trying to scam clueless tourists who have no idea of the relative value of the rupee.Once inside you'll be glad you didn't pay that charge, because the ornate entrance is just hiding a very tiny space that contains nearly nothing to deserve the 'botanical garden' title. It's smaller than most parks in the city and lacking in botanical interest - you'll see more plant species in the nearby waste ground than you will inside the perimeter.There are a few attractions  for the kids - a mini-golf course and an adventure/activity area for which you'll pay extra."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,karthik D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Worst Govt Policies,"Definitely it's a big thumbs-down 👎 for the tourists visiting here with their cameras. They are charging like 4000 to 8000 rupees to allow a camera. You know, a camera lens can be bought with that money. Too ridiculous to charge that much. If it is a commercial photo shoot or film making it would be appropriate to charge as they would be getting money from the shoots. But for family and friends to make some good memories and store them as photos, it is too much to charge those amounts. I saw foreigners arguing with the staff and even left the place as they found the charges are to high.  It's not only about this place,every where in hyderabad they are charging like this only. There are only few places in hyderabad to visit and due to this camera charges we are not able to visit any of them. It will surely impact the tourism in hyderabad over the course of time."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Maït F,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Now extortionate for nature photographers :(,I came early in the morning for birdwatching with my pocket digital camera. The entry fee is still INR 25 but the camera fee has recently jumped from INR 500 to INR 4000-8000 (I was asked for 4000). The website hasn't been updated though...

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,SeshKomanduri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Too much concrete- dry place,"It seems to be a very popular place for walkers and joggers and people rave about it. I could not understand what the fuss was all about. In the quest for ''modernizing'', there are too many concrete structures that have been erected and the gardens no longer feel natural. The gardens itself are very dry and dusty.  Went for an early morning walk and came back with clothes covered in dust! Not a satisfying experience at all"

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Mega B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Well maintained park,"This park has improved immensely in last few years.

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Ashish Kumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,Morning walk & bird watch,"The place is improving every month, with more maintenance activity going round & better public amenities being introduced.A wonderful place for morning walk, yoga or meditation, but noting unusual to call it a botanical garden."

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Ritesh J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Wonderful Place,"This place has been redeveloped recently and there are many adventure activities available at an extra charge. The charges are nominal. Entry fees for adults is 25 rupees and 10 for kids above 5 yrs. Below 5 years is free. This place is vast with food court, gardens, adventure activities, cactus garden, jogging track, open air gym, enclosed gym, party area and lot of open place etc. The pics you see are very old but I am uploading the new pics today. It's clean and maintained well. But I saw someone dropped empty tetra packs in the cactus garden. The government is trying it's best but it is the citizens who also need to drive the culture of cleanliness.Feel free to like my review if it helped you.Enjoy your visit.."

The garden is bestowed with dense flora with a few sparsely grown areas for visitors’ walking. Along with its vast flora variety, it also attracts many birds and insects, which further enhances the natural charm of this garden. Bamboo sector is the major attraction of the garden. All the bamboo trees have specific signboard with the scientific name and generic name of the trees. Another popular sector of the Botanical Garden is the Palm sector."

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Partha Sarathi M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Too much money looting for camera,"The princes for photography are pathetic. Don't know how many people are affording it. How come they charge Rs 3000/- for photography? If mobiles phones are allowed what's wrong with DSLRs, since every phone has camera snow? They are looting too much mindlessly.In Hyderabad many such places even don't allow cameras. It's ridiculous. The reason is not yet clear. But such practices should be stopped, or they will be loosing their own credibility."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Ravindra V,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Waste of time,"I have given it earlier 3 stars and now it doesn't deserve even 1 star. We went there to have photoshoot for our kids. But once we went there we were shocked after seeing the photography charges. It is 3000 INR. Yes, you read it right. Where in the world does any park charge that much for taking photos. There is another ticket for photography for INR 500 if you are there between 5 am to 8 am. We didn't take the photography ticket (well, who will take it) and went in to spend some time. It's good that we didn't take it. There is not much greenery in the park and it is getting converted into concrete park. They are building some buildings (like gazebos etc) and making it more like a public park than a botanical garden. This garden has lost the points which it had for whatever greenery it had earlier. Total waste of time."

Nothing to see at the moment, very small area to walk (I walked it all round in 10 minutes, the most of the area is closed). However there is lots of work in progress, so I’d like to return in about a year to see a big and nice organized garden. Keep going!"

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,David D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Poorly maintained,"Very puzzled by positive reviews. There's potential here (or faded glory) but this park is cluttered by crumbling ""improvements"" and is very poorly maintained. No comparison to KBR National Park, which is model that should be followed. People are ""working"" but they're not doing any maintenance. Visitors are confined to a limited area. Trails to most of the park (which must be where peacocks have escaped to) have been closed the two times we've been here. Go with very low expectations. Sad because there's clear potential here and this area of the city would benefit from a nice park."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Akanksh S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,Variety of plants.,The bloomed up plants are best viewed both in day and night.

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Jikuza,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Nice place to start the morning,"I have been to this park a few times and it has been a wonderful experience so far each time. It is a great place for morning walks/runs. I generally used a track which was about 400m, though once I went onto a track that was far far longer. Peacocks are very much a part of this garden."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Travel-Adhikari,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Visit to Botanical Garden,"Though we lived in Secunderabad for years we didn't know existence of a 'botanical garden'. We visited it after we came across the information. May be due to peak summer season, the greenery would have depleted and water in two small reservoirs had evaporated, apathy towards maintenance was glaring. Again the same belief that government run institutions are most inefficient and employees get in them just for the sake of constant source of income, was seen to be true. But we had a very enjoyable experience of watching full grown gorgeous male peacocks....about 7 of them. One was atop the wall at one end of the garden. After sitting there for some time it slipped into the other side and we followed through a gate (no signs about whether we can actually cross over) and penetrated through the dried bushes stealthily. In a small open space surrounded by dried up trees about 7 peacocks had assembled around their feeding site. Other than this there is not other charm in the garden. Sanjeevaiah Park beside Hussainsagar would perhaps be few notches better than this."

Was surprised as to how large it actually is. The Botanical garden area itself isn't​ much and can be much better . Am happy that there is such a place in the city and can imagine how it'll be in time 
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Nate J,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,Under Repairs,"I explored the botanical garden today and what little there is of it has fallen into disrepair.  There is some new material (bricks, dirt, etc.) scattered around so it appears that there is some work being done but they have a long ways to go.  Also, you are limited to a very small area of the garden; most of it is walled off."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,shivaraikod,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Good for students,This place is on my way to office so thought of paying a visit on my way back home. This seems to be good for botanical students to grasp real knowledge otherwise a one time visit
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Susan H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,Big Park in Concrete Jungle,"The bones of a well thought out Botanical garden are still present, but you'll have to look through creative eyes to see the what could be from the what is currently there. Currently more of a nice park for strolling. The three bus loads of children where having a great time racing through the paths surrounded by established trees and manicured lawn panels. Couples and groups of young 20 somethings where enjoying the benches and shade. A few labeled plant displays. Room for improvement."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Dhwanit S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Average place but scope for improvement,It's a big place to walk around and relax. Not for summers. It needs lots of improvement and has potential to be one of the best place to visit.

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Lav Dwivedi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016,"Green grounds, full of fresh air.","We enjoyed our Sunday evening at Botanical gardens.Pros: The greenery is picturesque and full of fresh air. We liked it to have long chats and click photos with friends. Photographers may find good view points here.Cons: Poor maintenance by the authorities. Because so many people visit this place on weekends, it's getting much of human waste which is making it look ugly sometimes. I guess cleaning and maintenance is not done properly. There used to be a drinking water tank which is not functional now."

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,pjanil1968,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Good for a walk,Nothing much to see here. Good place  for morning and evening walk. You can park vehicles in the opposite ground. Very near to Kothaguda junction.  Not a well maintained garden
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,TravellingMe1234,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,place to walk and work out,"ITs really not a place to visit, but apt for morning walks/ workout/yoga sessions. Recent rains helped to regain some of lost greenery and you can spot peacock/ other birds."
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Ravindra V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Good place for walking but  ..,This place is very good for morning walk as you get to walk in a natural garden away from city's pollution. However it's pleasant only in the morning. Problem with this garden is it is not well maintained. There is a tortoise shape building built for maintaining cactus plants but that building is a mere storage room now. Most of the plants do not have names written which is very much needed for plant lovers. You can see some peacocks and birds roaming around in the park. Parking facility is not bad. There is entry ticket of 15 INR and car parking charges are 20 INR.
Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,Swetha Nagarjun S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,An excellent place for walk,"We were surprised when we came here for a walk. I did not know that amid the concrete jungle lies a real jungle. A haven for nature lovers and joggers, this botanical gardens is an excellent place to breathe in fresh air, exercise, yoga and fun activities for early go getters. We could even spot a few peacocks and hear different animal sounds. There are many plant species which we have not even heard of and colorful flowers that attracts the eye. A good place for ladies to do jogging and yoga. Starts at morning around 5 am and entry fee is rs 10."

Hyderabad_Botanical_Gardens,bkumar123,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Friends,Not so good to visit,"Have been to Botanical gardens many times, but these days the management of garden has become very very poor causing lot of inconvenience to the visitors. All the grass have become dry, water wont run from the outlets. The pond also has become dry and has lost its charm. Only you can find college going boys & girls sitting at the farthest points engrossed in chatting etc."
