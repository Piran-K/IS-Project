Hyderabad_Central_Mall,Baburao S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Very bad experience,"Worst shopping experience that I ever had.(1) Buy2Get1 Offer: Even though we selected apparel from offer spot, cashier told couple of items were not categorized under offers. We end up going back and forth, contacted manager to get offer. Wasted 30 mins time at billing. We couldn't alter our jeans due to this time wasted by staff.(2) Buy for 5999 and get 2000 vouchers: This is another false/fake promise. I didn't receive vouchers even after 4 days to my registered phone number.(3) Website, Email and Phone numbers as shown on the receipt won't work. Please see the pics attached."

Unfortunately I lost that credit note and the bill. I visited cebtral mall panjagutta and they were not able to help me out saying once credit note is lost nothing can be done. Then i wrote a mail and personally called to customer care central(1800-210-7777) and they said they too cannot help me out with this as it's not in their hands. However they asked me to visit store once. I did it and i was asked to write a mail to Hyderabad team. I wrote the mail on 26th feb 2019. And i contacted them. They again told me today that they too dont have any details. Before contacting  Hyderabad central i called payback center and they said they don't save details of purchase made frm credit note.Now my question is How come they dont save details of purchases credit note return etc in their system? It isnt a small amount.  I want to use my money of credit note. It was just a small slip. Help me out central team. Im not going to keep quite. My email id is asma_hafeeza@hotmail.com

Make of it what you want of all the photos posted of the inside on whether there is a difference between a smartphone and a camera.The inside of the mall is ok, fairly typical. Did not check on the quality of the bathrooms or anything, which makes are usually good for. Poor review primarily because of silly rules."

Hyderabad_Central_Mall,TrueCityZen,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Absolutely clumsy;Pathetic parking;Limited elevators only till 3rd floor;None while coming down,"This one of the centrally located places in Hyderabad but with the worst facilities and management. I was there this weekend and it was chaotic.The first one to greet you would be the mall security and Punjagutta traffic, to let you know that there is no parking available. If you have tickets for PVR, you are on your own.Once you enter the mall, the elevators take you till 3rd floor and then you need to take the fire evacuation stairs.On the way back from fifth floor, there are absolutely no elevators - you need to walk down. The other day I saw parents with young kids and elderly people struggle a lot while getting down the stairs.Its a pity that the GHMC, Fire and Police let this mall operate with such low standards - The L&T Next mall a few metres away is much much better than this.Do avoid this mall if possible- there are much better and safer malls in Hyderabad. Have a safe visit by going to them."
