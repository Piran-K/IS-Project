Hyderabad_International_Convention_Center,Rahul_and_Niyanta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017,Banquet event,"I attended the Wedding Times Fashion Fiesta at HICC on Monday evening (20th March). I am a hotelier myself and have been privy to a number of such PR and media events at the various hotels that I have worked in. However, I must say, that the execution of the event on Monday evening on your end was exceptional. I am not referring to the actual fashion show or the event set p inside the hall. I am referring to the hospitality rendered to guests both, pre and post event. I was lucky enough to attend the after party on the first floor as well. All your staff was courteous and polite, and always smiling. I know Banquet staff is generally very stressed because of their long hours, not to mention handling a complimentary event. However, each and every one of them were brilliant. Always smiling and ready to extended any assistance. For instance, on a number of occasions, your staff ensured that our drinks were brought to us instead of us having to walk up to the bar. Snack service was prompt and if  we requested one of the boys to bring one of the other snacks on rotation, it was promptly brought. Bartenders remembered our drinks and made it promptly. I would like to mention a few gentlemen whose names I caught - Mohiuddin and Anand Ravi, both managers I guess because they were dressed in a jacket, and Saroj (snack server) and Ankush (bartender at the after party). Amongst others, these four brilliant people ensured that we had a memorable evening, one that will last in our collective memories for a long time. And not to forget the food - it was delicious. The chicken satay served at the after party were generous sized and succulent. The chicken biryani, the stew and appam, the anjeer ice cream and the tres leches dessert were all mouth watering, served at the right temperature and delicious. Again, staff was helpful enough to bring us bottles of water to accompany our dinner without being prompted. A classic example of brilliant service. Thank you once again and I do hope you will share my good wishes with your banquet staff to let them know how much we appreciated their efforts that evening. "
