IKEA,Shubham Mishra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,"For all the peeps moving into their new houses, this is your go-to place","Do check out the warehouse, it looked like straight out of video game where shootout happens, and your character kills the final boss!"
IKEA,Utkarsh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Definitely Visit but not sure about buying!,"IKEA is a fun labyrinth of home furnishing where you can easily spend 2-3 hours from entry to exit. Whenever you visit, just leave your wallet at home cause you will want to buy everything.Pros: A different shopping experience, restaurant was good and fairly reasonable.Cons: Directions/Signage are really lacking, build and quality of their product was nothing great."
IKEA,R Ramakrishnan,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,YELLOW BOX Courier service from IKEA is absolutely unprofessional and pathetic.,"While the shopping experience at IKEA Hyderabad was a pleasure, our experience with the ""Yellow Box"" courier service (which operates from the IKEA premises, just after the billing counters) was abysmally poor.While they initially entice you with a ""fixed price"" deal of Rs 1500 for a consignment of upto 50 Kgs - they add up GST, Insurance, Packing & Handling charges over that - which nearly doubles the amount to be paid. If you speak with Mr Vamshi, Mr Nazeem or MrTeja - they will verbally assure you that the consignment will be delivered in 5-6days.Thereafter, you will not hear from anyone till you call them after a week, upon which you are told that the consignment will be leaving ""tomorrow"". Two weeks later, upon repeated follow ups - they will give you some Truck Driver's number, who will promise to deliver it within 24 hours - but he wont show up for the next 3-4 days. Meanwhile - no calls will be attended to or messages responded to by YellowBox representatives - so the customer is left hanging without any confirmed information about the fate of the consignment.In short - a TOTALLY PATHETIC experience. I hope the IKEA leadership takes note of this and ensures that  corrective action is put into place. They should take morally take ownership of the vicarious liability that is involved, since YellowBox is operating from within their premises."
IKEA,Amberlicious,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Failed delivery excuses ‚Ä¶ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,Ordered products for home delivery. Delivery was due 6th December. Every evening i get an email saying that the delivery has failed. I have called them everyday and even given my husbands number as an alternative contact. No phone calls no delivery‚Ä¶. IKEA has brought its stores to India but not their work culture or customer service.
IKEA,Christopher F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Just like all the others.,As with all of the IKEA stores this is exactly the same which is why I love to just walk around and feel at home. The one thing I wish they had were the beef Swedish meatballs not a poor chicken facsimile.
IKEA,Naveen Gd,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Pathetic Customer experience,Quite pathetic customer service . Humans may land on Mars before they address minor complaints . It takes at least 25 follow ups to return a product / exchange :(
IKEA,Amit Khare,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Wow just wow,It was an amazing shopping experience. They have loads n loads of amazing stuff. Just so creative . I loved the way the themes and decors were matched. Definitely worth a visit. The restaurant caters for amazing Swede food as well as Indian food. Overall amazing experience 
IKEA,Anil Sharma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Great Shopping experience ,Nice place for shopping good options and rates available. Huge place and huge options with lot of good people with lot of support.
IKEA,beyondtravel,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Avoid if not necessary,"On a normal day I would have recommended a 5 star just for the way Ikea store is so well organised, the options and product range... However post lockdown the safety norms which are extensive and elaborate have led to long ques as u inevitably have to keep waiting 1.5 hour for car parking and 1 hour to enter.... It's tiring, cumbersome with no facilities whilst u keep waiting. I understand the limit on ppl who can be inside but no information, long ques without water, bathroom are a big no. Click and pick is good if u have a good knowledge on ikea products. Overall avoid till ikea team can handle better. "
IKEA,EkMusafir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Gigantic Furniture Showroom.,"The IKEA furniture showroom in Hyderabad is a huge place where you can see and buy furniture and appliances for your house. We visited the place in early March 2020 and were simply astounded by the variety and range of the furniture modules available. It is a one of it‚Äôs kind place right from the time you enter. The entrance itself is so mind blowing, we thought we were entering an airport. Every room inside is designed in a unique way, with the pieces of furniture in each room complimenting each other in texture and material, so the entire room gives you a feeling as if a master craftsman has planned and fitted the parts like a pretty jigsaw puzzle. There were many different styles of bedrooms, dining rooms, drawing rooms, modular kitchens and bathrooms, and more. We enjoyed walking through each room marvelling at the various layouts and the furniture in them.In addition you can buy furnishings, utility items and appliances, both small and big, for the house and kitchen. There is ample parking space in the compound, but it becomes crowded during weekends and holidays. At the end of all the browsing we went to the unique restaurant and had a sumptuous dinner."
IKEA,saradurban,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,ok store,have been to other ikea branches this one was a bit llimited in options but well laid out not too busy as we went close to close up time good helpful staff
IKEA,richagoel15,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Vast store and good time spent,"Even if you do not want to buy anything, you still should visit the IKEA store once.  It is huge and has a very good appeal.  The stuff they have is not at all overpriced but you can easily spend 1-2 hours here by just roaming inside.  There is a restaurant inside incase you are hungry."
IKEA,Indusman248,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Day visit with Spouse during Christmas,"IKEA has a great arrival experience of traffic movement/drop off/pick-up. However, they need to control the human traffic as the crowd sometimes spoils the shopping experience - which happened with us. "
IKEA,Ashish Sehgal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,IKEA,Nice outlet for furnitures which can solve your purpose with compact and international designs.Still quality is lite and still more options to view.
IKEA,CuriousTraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,One stop shop for home furniture,"IKEA is one of the best shops in Hyderabad. They have around 400+ stores all over india. They have home dcors that onclude bedsheets, curtains, sofas, chairs, computer tables, shandliers, readymade kitchens, chimneys, refrigerators, carpets,Bedsheets. They also have foodcourt to reload yourself to gain some energy after a tiresome shopping."
IKEA,Primal Survivor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Concept Home Furnishings ,"Only store in India & surprisingly not in North India ü§£Over crowded / been there thrice and every time I had to push and jostle my way.Long queues at billing counter .Safe Ample parking though .Good stuff not very reasonable though .On average one tends to spend minimum 3000 to 10,000 Rs But to my dismay many non shoppers /pick pockets / nuisance creators  too come ~ but don't think any way to stop such.Food is average , costly & lacks variety."
IKEA,Georgio Valentino Rayala,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Need Some New Collection,I visited this store last month along with a friend after a while and nothing much changed from my last visit. The crowds have reduced a bit and the collection has become old.I was pleasantly surprised with the lack of queue in the restaurant. The food tasted ok but I think they need to bring in new collection.

IKEA,Sheetal S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,good home furnishing,good and mid to high range home furniture and utilities here. Perhaps would appreciate if they were made in India stuff than imported so did not buy much here.
IKEA,jainms,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Good Furnishings,"I feel Worth buying furniture and household items here, Flexible to use and nominal price charged. Store also very large with many listings."
IKEA,Georgio Valentino Rayala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,First IKEA Store in India,This is the first IKEA store that has opened in India. I visited it when they opened last year in September. It is on par with most of the IKEA stores in other parts of the world. Their pricing is a bit less also compared to their stores in Asia.My only problem with this store is their food quality. I think they need to improve taste of their food as well as introduce dishes like fish n chips etc.
IKEA,Kagar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Business,Dint find much,"Went with great hopes but didn't find much and full of crowd , it's better for anyone to go to ikea on morning sessions only"

But you will get all the things at one place, its good for office furniture's as well as for home.Food court is available plenty of parking available, avoid weekends as crowd would be there. "
IKEA,misskark7,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,literally nothing new,availability range of products and cost no much different from regular malls and multiplexes. further too long to get anything. and literally parking is a hell. totally to say one needs to have lots of energy and money to spend and buy there.nothing new or great .it would be out of only one's enthusiasm to go crazy over ikea.
IKEA,Jeff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Amazing concept and organisation,"The first IKEA store in the country is in Hyderabad, and it is totally worth a visit. The store space is huge and it is totally on the lines of thier stores from any other part of the world. The variety of goods and thier inventory is on par with the other stores and the quality, ofcourse the quality is the best part about IKEA right.. The price on the goods is very economical and it is very easy to splurge here without any hassles. If you love shopping you must visit here, if not for shopping atleast for the experience. "
IKEA,veronica_lalwani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Excellent collection and an inventory management case study ,"Made a visit to the IKEA store and finally got to see the massive collection. Loved how it's organized and also requires the customer to go prepared. Right at the entrance, they give you a brochure and a ‚úèÔ∏è and one has to make a list of what one wants to buy and also use the measuring tape (made of paper) to check if the item you're selecting fits with the measurements from home (that's what I meant by be prepared). Since I traveled from Mumbai, I could only pick knick-knacks (üëÄ baggage allowanceüôÜ) but if one lives in Hyderabad, there are so many options to choose from, right from chairs to study table and what not! Not to forget mentioning the restaurant experience, which is a new self-service concept In India.¬†"
IKEA,Akmands,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Shopping ,"On our trip to Hyderabad went here on Sunday,  very nice place with big range of shopping options.  Must visit place. "

IKEA,Kinggops,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Ideal for a newly married couple who want to set up a cosy home!,"You can spend one full day at Ikea, Hyderabad. It is ideal for a newly married couple who want to setup a cosy home. This concept is new to India. The quality of furniture is good & prices are competitive. They have a tie up with a transporter - who has a shop in the basement - who will cart it to any place in India - for an additional charge depending on the size,weight & distance of the item. The canteen inside offers  good food at competitive prices.Strongly recommend this place to be visited - if you are coming to Hyderabad. Suggestion for Ikea - More Household Items & Kitchen appliances can be included to make it more appealing to older couples/ Families."
IKEA,sanaser,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,An excellent home furnishing outlets in Hyderabad,"Swedish home furnishings major IKEA opened its first store in India at Hyderabad city. IKEA store might have opened in Hyderabad last year. It is located in HITEC CITY. We visited the store last Saturday evening. Observed too much crowed over there. We have found there attractive well designed home furnishing all articles in an affordable range. Most products are flat packed, so it is very easy to carry and take them at home. IKEA  has invested Rs. 1,000 crore on the Hyderabad store alone and have a range of around 7,500 products over there. IKEA restaurant in Hyderabad offers a variety of snacks & meals and it houses 1000 Seats, IKEA'S largest.. Our first visit IKEA store at Hyderabad was impressive and enjoyed having light refreshing items with free cold beverage."
IKEA,Amberlicious,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nightmare kitchen installation,"Terrible service, nightmare installation team, no coordination. My installs meant to be completed on 17th March... Payment was made. Only after payment done I was informed that some parts of drawer fronts not available. My installation date was given to someone else... made payment for drawer front on 15th May as I was told it has arrived.  Now I am told it has been sold to someone else.  I have to wait till mid June for next shipment. One of the drawers is badly scratched. I was told they would replace it. It was not done. During pre installation visit, the engineer marked walls where tiles could be put. The work site was completed. Finally, when ikea did show up, I was told the tiles should not have been put. The tap installed on the sink blocks my window from opening. I was told that it would be rectified. Not done yet... Overall, a nightmare. You have imported your products but unfortunately it is the same irresponsible, uncoordinated, lazy, poor work ethics. Huge disappointment. Shall not recommend kitchens to anyone."
IKEA,Pradeepkumar008,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Awesome place for all home owners,"The place is well designed and has items for all needs in a house. It is a paradise for new home buyers. One can get all the items needed to set up a new home or even refurbish an existing home.The prices are reasonable. They even have small items that can be picked up to decorate your home. The restaurant has limited food and drinks option, but the food was good.It would take atleast 3 hours to just glance through the entire place. The parking space is huge."
IKEA,yesarar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A well organised display,"It's almost like a conducted tour , all household articles displayed in different sizes of homes.  Good quality and not very expensive. Nice Swedish lunch ."

IKEA,TravellingReddy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Massive place for furniture and furnishing,One of the main reasons for me to plan a trip to Hyderabad is to visit this place. Location is strategic and has massive parking space. Focus is more on small nitty gritties required for setting up a home and also the requisite furnishings. I felt the furniture designs need to be more to satisfy Indian mindset. A go to place for people who want to set up a new home
IKEA,Shashank R Misra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Enourmous and absolutely awesome,"the newly opened Ikea store (the first in India) is worth a visit, if only to see what international Retail looks like ....and how far the Indian retail outlets whether it is More or Big Bazaar or Reliance have to go in terms of store design and layout, customer service, the variety of items available .... i doubt if anyone can visit the store and come out without spending a small fortune....even if you went with the specific objective of ""looking and window shopping"""
IKEA,Suryanarayana K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A large single brand store for furniture.,"Consisting of about 5 lakh sq feet, it consists of two level car parking, 1000 seat restaurant, one floor of displays including model homes, kitchens, bedrooms etc and a floor of self service stock. This is the first store in India for the company. The store has its own app to guide you and to select your purchases. A casual browse will take at least two hours.For anybody building a new house or moving into a new house or renovating, this is a must visit place.Though some products may appear expensive, i felt you cant get them at a cheaper price elsewhere or by getting it made by your carpenter. Ikea is famous for self assembled furniture. Delivery and installation services are also provided at an extra cost."
