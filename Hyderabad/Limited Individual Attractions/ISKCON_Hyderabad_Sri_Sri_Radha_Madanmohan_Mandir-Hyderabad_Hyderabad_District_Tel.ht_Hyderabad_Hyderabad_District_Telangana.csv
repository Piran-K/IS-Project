It is dedicated to Lord Krishna. Aarti is conducted every morning and evening. It's good to visit during aarti to be a part of this enchanting way of worship. Enchanting of mantras and singing bhajans was so fulfilling and engaging. You really feel the holy energy here.

It is spread over ideally a very large area but only has the Ground Floor hence looks small. There is space for Car Parking for max 5 - 8 Cars as it is actually not a designated place.Come just on time & you would be able to see the deities without any rush!
