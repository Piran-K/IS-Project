Indira_Park,Kaushik G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Good Park but needs better care,"During our sightseeing in Hyderabad, we had visited Indira Park which is located right opposite Ramakrishna Math. Entrance tickets are priced at 10 rupees per person. The park has pathway in between different varieties of trees to walk around and a small lake where one can enjoy boating. The place needs better maintenance especially the Lake with smelly water. We saw a baby owl on the branch of a tree and another big bird with long tail in the bushes. "

Indira_Park,Mahanama,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Solo,Horribly Neglected Park,"In the early days this park was a nice place to spend some time. That was way back in the 1980s. But over the years the park has deteriorated terribly. I can mention 4-5 things which need immediate attention.1. Large sections of the park are dusty. The pathways are very hard, and the poor walkers have to suffer much. Foolishly some sections have been cemented. So you can expect foot trouble for many walkers.2. The large pond (I won't call it a lake!) in the middle of the park has been filled with sewage water, so that it is practically one sewage dump. You can see foam and froth at the edges of the pond. There is a small walkway (mini bridge) to cross from one side of the park to the other side. You can see the walkers holding their noses and walking over - the smell is so bad. Not only hydrogen sulphide, but methane also - are the poisonous gases emanating from the stagnant pond. Part of the lake is covered with weeds. Many who are working in the park throw rubbish into the park. If the pond is dredged, you can see the filth that is at the bottom. 3. You can always see stray dogs running around in the park. 4. Except for the section called the Rose Garden (where lots of money is spent!), every other spot in the park needs rectification. It is just one cheap third-rate municipal park, which is becoming worse year after year.5. Foolishly watering is done in the park in the early morning time, so that the humidity is very high. And the poor walkers suffer from colds, coughs, bronchitis and pneumonia - walking through the wet sections of the park, suffering the chill and the damp, especially in December and January. Proof: The increasing number of patients who go to Sai Vani Hospital opp the park for chest xrays!6. Some of the ugliest sculptures are found in this park. You don't know what those stone figures mean. It is one of those scams for which the Municipal Corporation is 'famous'. 7. Most of the park looks like a desert or scrub jungle trying its best to recover from the ill-treatment at the hands of the park authorities who have no idea of plants, gardens, horticulture or park management. 8. The best thing about the park is perhaps the vegetable and fruit vendors outside the park. Here you get good vegetables and fruits, fresh and at reasonable rates. In fact many people come to the park, not to enjoy the park, but to buy from the unofficial market that is outside the park premises! 9. Hyderabad is one city where lakes and parks are fast vanishing. One good park is the Sanjeeviah Park which is located in a secluded area. But I visited that park 2 years ago. It must have deteriorated by now, I'm sure."
Indira_Park,vibha123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014,A Park away from city pollution..now losing charm,"I remember visiting Indira park sometime back and I was just traveling down the memory lane to draw a comparison....it has lost its charm...Its landmark on the map of twin cities, however like any other public place is running without maintenance and care..Might be worth while if you are close by to see this garden with kids else this place has nothing much to offer in comparison with NTR gardens and lumbini park."
Indira_Park,Beemidi Kiran,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Family,A very well planned park in the heart of the city,This is one of the best parks located in the center of the city by all means. The plan and the layout of the park is perfect for all purposes. Its best for early morning jog and walk along the park. It is best for picnic with family during the day and it is also the best park to take out your kids to have a nice evening time. It has decent food options. The other main plus to this place is the water pond which is huge and gives a very beautiful outlook to this park. A must visit if you are in anywhere around Himayatnagar or tank bund.

Indira_Park,Praveen K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014,Serene park.,a nice botanical park near tankbund. Indira park is a walkers paradise for people near the CBD. The park has an artificial lake and has boating. It is spread across a large area and is opposite Ramakrishna mutt. 
Indira_Park,plan41,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Couples,Indira Park - the Ideal Spot for a Week-end Picnic...,"When Indira Park was started somewhere in the nineties, it was considered to be such a beautiful concept providing greenery in the midst of rapidly growing urbanisation by way of multi-storeyed apartments and shopping complexes in this traditionally shy city that shunned modernism for a long, long time. There were a variety of saplings and trees planted by the State Horticulture Department who had maintained the Park so well for a number of years. The lake in the midst of the Park remained ever pure and un-contaminated and boating in the lake used to be such a pleasurable experience. There were a number of aquatic birds providing a visual delight to the visitors to the park. Alas! over the years there has been a systematic neglect of this once-upon-a-time beautiful Park right in the centre of the City. Today the lake has turned out to be totally lacking in maintenance, filthy with stagnant water and the boating having stopped long time ago. The present government is considering renovation of the whole area into something that is modern and attractive, for which plans are under way. Time alone will tell what kind of shape this sprawling Park is going to assume in the near future!"
Indira_Park,kijji,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Family,park for all activities,"Free entry in the morning hours,otherwise nominal entry fee.Indira park is 3km away from my home.In summer we go here for walking.It has beautiful trees ,green  lawns,rose garden,lake for boating,you find children playing in the park (Merry go round,see saw,slide etc...),people play different games.small canteen is there,musical fountain is there,free yoga demos in the morning.cinema shooting is done here sometimes,change of atmosphere,nice air.families come here as picnic spot,vanamahotsav in the month of july will be celebrated by people."
Indira_Park,madabushi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,"Beautiful park with boating, trees and plants and large lawn and play areas for all.","Indira park is located between Secunderabad and Hyderabad, at the lower side of Tank Bund.  Boating rock garden, and some plants organised attractively are good to enjoy.   The water may not be that good in the boating area, but boating is neverthless enjoyable, as pedaling becomes a part of physical activity.Large lawn is available for kids and adults to play throw ball, football, and other games.  Some childrens' play structures are available to climb,slide, jump, rock etc.,   This park is good for picnic and family time pass and you can spend much longer time here especially in winter seasons.The other side of the water boating, you still have large trees and land space, you can walk around and enjoy.It is a good park and we keep visiting often as it is much inside the city only 7 kms from our home and near many other tourist attractions and amusement parks etc."
Indira_Park,Pankaj_Zaparde,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Couples,Nice & Beautiful,"Superb for first timers.. If you are new to hyderabad, its worth visiting Indira Park. The environment is great there.

Indira_Park,KASI VENKOBA RAO,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Couples,Park So So,"Indira Park,  located at Lower Tank Bund near Domalguda,  is a Public Park with greenery. It is located at the heart of the city and well connected to both Hyderabad & Secunderabad.The Park is named after the late Prime Minister of India Mrs. indira Gandhi. Musical fountains, Rose garden, Boating, Rock Garden are the highlights of this park. its a good place for jogging and picnics for the family.  It is said that the Rock garden is developed by an Officer of Central Government..The drawback in the park is poor maintenance. Though acclaimed as one of the biggest part ( spread over 76 acres), it is not being maintained well. Thousands of visitors come here for boating, relaxing and for picnic. I have visited this park recently and I am of the opinion, that the concerned authorities can improve the maintenance and attract more visitors."
Indira_Park,ExplorerAwasthi,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,Smelly Lake,"We went for the first time to do a boat.

You can avoid going there."
Indira_Park,mdgouse,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,park,a good place to go with friends for just like outing.one of the very good parks in hyderabad to visit.
Indira_Park,MARGDARSHI,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Solo,"Average Park, Not Maintained","The Indira Park is on the lower Tank Bund road & its only significance is the idea behind it `To keep the natural existing landscape without disturbing it much to construct a new park`! So you have semblance of a rock formation with some famialar trees of sandalwood,wild Date palms & flowers.A small lake with boats.There is also a Maisamma Temple often visited.The musical fountain installed here rarely works.The park is now often used for public  rallies & agitations.Not worth wasting your time."
Indira_Park,nanajiak07,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Family,Enjoyment in Indira Park,Ihave been visited Indira Park with friends on December 2014 at evening time. A pleasent experience in our life for this memory with friends.
Indira_Park,Karthik A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,Not preffered for families,Indira park is not that much of charm. Families can avoid going there. It is even not maintained well.
Indira_Park,Janet S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Couples,"OK, but nothing special","For Hyderabad, this is a decent place to spend some time walking, but that is about it.  Small lake in the middle has some boats available.  There is a 10 year old lovely fountain with cascading waterfall area in the back which is no longer functional, falling apart , and must have not been maintained to be in such condition after only so few years.  The landscape is passable, with a rose garden and some other areas that actually are quite pretty (again, for Hyderabad standards).  I wouldn't go here unless desperate for a place to walk...which we were.  Lovely temple on the street side of the property."

Indira_Park,digitalldreamzz,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2012 • Friends,Don't waste your time going here...,"It's great that people still consider this as a good park and it has obtained a place in Tripadvisor. The only plus is the skating rink in this park which is one of the biggest in Hyderabad.No greenery, No play pen, No boating... the entrance of the park is always busy with people who are doing dharnas and strikes and the other end of the park is always stinking as it's close to the municipal dumping yardIt's used for walking and yoga for many people around the park who stay at a walkable distance but it's not worth for any one else"
