Inorbit_Mall,Mickey Uppal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Family,A little bit of everything under 1 roof,"One of the few BIG malls of hyd, which has many different brands under one roof.. you can start your day from having lunch in the food court which has reasonably price vendors to up market restaurants like Fusion9. brands like Shoppers stop, pantaloon, M&S, H&M,  are there to carter to men/women shopping needs.Entertainment zones like SMASHH, Dilouge In The Dark, Fun zone for kids.. The few drawbacks are, the drive to the mall is very tiring coz it's located in he middle of an IT HUB which means going there after 5:30-6pm is a pain in the back side. The Durgam cheruvu lake located next to the mall has got an amazing rope bridge which is visible from the mall and looks stunning in the evenings  They have ample parking so finding a spot is not hard .. OVERALL... Go there if u don't like online shopping..."

,,,,,"Good location, newly constructed hotel. It is a good hotel but calling it a Luxury Collection is overrated.It’s a good business hotel with zero family orientation.Breakfast is ok but inferior to other hotels of similar type.Lounge is for name-sake with nothing but a couple of snacks and manned just by 1 employee. It is far inferior to any other lower category Marriott properties that I stayed at.Customer service is inferior compared to even lower rated hotels. There are many hotel employees in the lobby but no one seems to pay attention to the customers.I may stay there again primarily due to proximity to work but no other compelling reason."

Inorbit_Mall,jainms,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Good choice of outlets,"You can end up spending lot of money in this mall. Many of the shops sell high priced goods and even food there is costly.

It is in the Tech center of the town and has lots of major brand stores with high end stores as well. There are also a few traditional Indian merchants that sell local merchandise which is nice. Do not expect too many price deals in this mall, but it’s nice to visit. They also have restaurants like Chili’s where I recommend ordering the sangria and veggie burger.

Inorbit_Mall,SAnkeath,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Inorbit Hyderabad,Inorbit mall in Hyderabad is a spacious shopping mall in Madhapur by Raheja Group. The parking lot is spacious and a fountain at the entrance of the mall makes it appealing. As far as shopping is concerned I did not find many good outlets here.The first floor is completely occupied by a supermarket and the other floors too do not have a good number of branded outlets. I visit this mall only to buy perfumes for which there is an exclusive store on the 3rd floor that stocks almost all good fragrances.The mall is not easily accessible except to those who work at Madhapur. It is situated a bit far from other main localities of Hyderabad. It has a food court and a multiplex both of which are not so attractive. Not a good place for a quality shopping.
Inorbit_Mall,Dilip kumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,One of the Biggest mall,This mall is one of the biggest in IT corridor and it has its own style.PVR cinemas. Smaash gaming. Food courts.shopping.It has everything.
Inorbit_Mall,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Inorbit : One of the best malls & Multiplexes in Hyderabad,It was nice mall. Enjoyed almost half day from 4 pm to 2 am. As soon as went there we went to the food court. Kids wanted to have ice cremes. Coldstone was the best choice we felt. Later we booked tickets for movie. We went to Jai Lava Kusa. It was recently released. It was a flop movie. That too we watched the latenight show. So everybody slept except two or three kids. Because it was a boring movie. The main reason for watching is kids wanted to see the multiplex. PVR Theatre was very well maintained. Everybody slept except few. Overall it was a nice mall. We went home by Ola. You can spend the whole day once you enter the mall.

Inorbit_Mall,Anita,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Great place to hang out while in Hitech Area,"During our visit to India, while staying at hotels (both at Sheraton and Westin Mindspace) Inorbit Mall was a must see. It has both stores likely to be found in U.S. including H & M as well as FabIndia for fabulous Indian attire. For the last few visits, my daughter and I visited the ""fish pedicure"" which might not be desired by all visitors but we loved it. We have also watched movies too."
Inorbit_Mall,Sudha T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Great Mall in Great location,"Visited Inorbit Mall 3 times recently during our stay at the nearby Hotel. Definitely worth visiting. Has a great selection of stores with high end products. Mall is very crowded in the afternoon, especially the food courts and it is very difficult to get seating. Interesting aspect is that most of the stores have very limited shoppers, it appears customers are just window shopping. Would definitely recommend buying products at the stores, comparable prices in a very well maintained stores. Would recommend going early in the day for lunch as the food courts are too crowded, definitely not comfortable to have family lunch. Fusion 9 is a great sit down restaurant and is ideal.Overall great experience. Would love to visit again for shopping."
Inorbit_Mall,Anu789,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,One stop shop,"Inorbit mall is a one stop shop for movies, shopping and food. If you are planning to watch a movie here, do book i advance as tickets sell out fast. The food court has plenty of options to choose from. What stood for me of malls in Hyderabad is that they have ample water coolers for drinking water instead of pushing people to buy bottled water."
Inorbit_Mall,copenhagenvisito2017,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Business,Premium Mall,"This is the mall in Hyderabad that sports the high end brand names. Secure mall. Food court and movies if you in the mood for some entertainment. If you using the Auto Rickshas, they can be a rip off and dishonest. Rather use an Uber. Wifi concept at this mall is still challenged by the regressive India mindset of a sim card is the golden key."

The Food court is amazing and once you enter this mall you don't have go anywhere else for your shopping needs and meals. Limited but good entertainment for toddlers/ kids. They always have some activity going on at the Atrium. Washrooms are well kept, the housekeeping should be given a pat on their back. As we know the prices are on the higher side in malls but toys in one particular toy shop on the second floor are over priced. You'll know the name when you get there. Anyways, this is the place to enjoy with your family."

I could by most of the clothes cheaper in Melbourne...Made in India too :-)"

Next we ate ice cream at ""Mini Meltz"" outlet followed by chai at ""Chai Point"". Next we looked at home collections at ""Home Town"".Finally after waiting for 3 hours we watched the movie ""Avengers"" at PVR Multiplex.

Inorbit_Mall,Suchig06,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,"Decent Mall for shopping, hanging out and good food options","The mall provides an accessible break venue for people - professionals, families, singletons...just everybody. Meaningful and ample shopping and food options. I saw 3 ATMs in the food court but none was ICICI which was pretty disappointing. It is weird how the staff is not aware of facilities. In fact, ask them anything, in general, they would not answer at all (lack of knowledge) or not confidently. A fairly decent level of customer service is missing - be it food court, clothing stores or others.People here need to realize the growth and development in their city that has brought in and continues to draw people from diverse backgrounds to Hyderabad. People working in the mall -you can do better:)"
Inorbit_Mall,Nishita Jindal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Different From Others,I've been going to this mall since it was built and remember every part of it very vividly. The shops are countless in number with H&M and Marks and Spencers being the newest additions. The kids play zone and the food court are strategically located and  easily accessible. There toilets also and drinking water is available. There's also a cinema theatre. The décor and architecture of the mall with it's interior design changed for every occasion is a sight to behold.

Inorbit_Mall,rabhola,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,New and Lovely Mall,"The mall is located in the newly coming up Hitech Township. It is about 45 minutes drive from the central place - Begumpet. It is a new mall and has all good brands viz. Marks & Spencer, H&M etc etc. It has on the Ground Floor one very good tea shop which has very distinct flavors of Indian teas. Overall it is a nice experience but for the location which is far off from the main areas of the town.Dr. Rajesh BholaSpiritual Writer & Columnist"

Inorbit_Mall,chandresh k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Regular visitor,"Mall is good if you want to do window shopping or looking for some fun time activities like movie,Gaming etc. it has a terrace through which one can take complete view of surrounding places. Not very good for shopping as prices seems to be quite high. Overall good for weekends."
Inorbit_Mall,DreamerDisha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Business,Not a tourist place. Good for locals,"If you happen to be touring Hyderabad and need to urgently shop for some brand, you can go. Else the place is not worth a tourist attraction. Nothing is like Hyderabad special. Same brands that you get in any other city."
