At the end when I end seeing park I was concluded it's best park for walking only. Foreigner and other people used to come here for walking only. I'll advice when you plan for KBR National park at the same time plan for Jagan nath temple. It's near by only."

KBR_National_Park,raman p,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Joggers Paradise,"In the center of the city, you cant ask for more when you have a place like KBR park. Its a joggers paradise, so serene and green around you feel like you are in a tropical forest. You will see peakcock, birds and if lucky some animals too. But a great place to jog full circle of 5K km, the second boundary which is a parallel track to the  park as you need not pay any money. If you go inside the park, you have to pay 20 INR and spend going around 4km stretch. "
KBR_National_Park,Surya T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016,Nice place for a jog,"Whenever I wanted to go for a run I would pick up my bike and head to KBR Park. It's one of best places in Hyderabad(in terms of nature/greenery). You can actually feel the breeze of cold air kissing your cheeks in evenings even in hot summer. There's one outer path of the park which free to use, another is inside for which you pay a small amount of 10 INR."

KBR_National_Park,MR_F00DIE,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Solo,Pathways made rocky!,"In a bid to replace the soil due to erosion, the management has carelessly  laid stony gravel instead of soil on all the paths. It is more of treak now, as lot of tiny gravel make walking/running a pain, rather than pleasure."

KBR_National_Park,clementbenj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,A Walk To Remember Right in the Heart of Hyderabad,"Who could ever imagine a pristine natural park right in the center of the busy roads of Hyderabad? This was one big surprise the first time I had the opportunity to visit KBR park. From the outside it is very hard to imagine how peaceful the interiors are, because all around you are surrounded by the noise and movement of traffice, the people, the vehicles, the hot weather, the humidity and so many other pressures. But once you enter inside, you are transported into a world that has remained pure and calm inspite of all that happens outside. The quietness can surprise you along with a few majestic peacocks that call out and walk across your path. The lush grass in specific areas is temptingly inviting and you will be inspired watching the many elderly gentlemen taking a walk and doing stretches. All in all, it's an absolute MUST Visit to get away from the pressure of the outside world. The more often you visit, the more therapeutic you will feel. "
