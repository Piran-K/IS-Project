Karmanghat_Hanuman_Temple,krishna292,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018,A Grand and Historically Significant Temple,"The Karmanghat temple situated on Ring Road is just a km away from house. The main deity is Lord Hanuman. Established in 12th century It has an interesting history. It is said that King of Kakitya dynasty while on a hunting expedition in the jungles around this area was taking rest when he heard some voice chanting Lord Ram's bhajans and it was a stone carved like Lord Hanuman. Then he ordered the installation of that large Stone (vigraha) and built a temple around it. For regular income to this temple, he arranged revenues from the nearby village which is now named Karmanghat. There is also an interesting story about the name of the temple. In 16th century, the Moghul emperor attacked Golconda and ordered the demolition of all temples nearby but his soldiers could not do so when they reached the temple because of some divine light and noise. Then the emperor came himself and was about to hit the temple deity when he heard a divine voice KAR (do) MAN (heart) GHAT (hard), which means Harden your heart and thus afraid he went away. There are many other small temples with deities of Lord Ganesha,Rama, Shiva, goddess Durga and others. About 3 years back, the temple was renovated and a grand 'gopuram' was constructed. I have been visiting this temple almost once a month for several years. It has a large courtyard and the main sanctum is also very spacious. Marriages and worship of new vehicles by devotees are common sights in the temple. It is believed to a powerful temple."

Karmanghat_Hanuman_Temple,plan41,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,"ŚRĪ DHYĀNĀNJANÉYASWĀMI TEMPLE, “KAR-MAN-GHAT”, HYDERABAD","Laxmi and I were inspired a few days ago to visit and offer our prayers to the Powerful Deity – Lord Śrī Dhyānānjanéyaswāmi of this most holy, ancient temple located in what is known as “Kar-Man-Ghat” – that got gradually transformed into “Karmanghat” over the  nine centuries of its existence to the present date when people continue to revere Lord Śrī Hanumān and seek His protection and blessings for success in their pursuits in life – and He indeed ensures that their pleas are answered by His eternal grace – provided His devotees are honest,  humble, sincere, righteous and non-injurious to others. The Temple is located in a  sprawling area adjoining the highway leading from LBNagar to the City’s Airport at Shamshabad. The whole complex is very serene and peaceful – quite conducive to the mind to be calm while offering prayers. There are as many as 15 temples located in the campus, dedicated to almost all the principal gods who are usually worshipped in the Hindu pantheon. The story behind the origin and existence of this Temple is true and historic: King Padaraju of Kakateeya Rulers of Warangal, located about 150 kms. east of Hyderabad, had built the historic Golconda Fort. His son Prince Pratap Rudradeva the Second, while on a hunting expedition, got tired of a tiger hunt and stopped to rest at an isolated location where suddenly he heard a constant recitation in prayer to the Hindu God Lord Śrī Rāma in a very melodious voice. Curious to know the origin of  the voice in a wild and deserted area, he searched around and discovered a five-feet high idol. Later, in a dream, he was commanded by a Divine Will to preserve the idol in a Temple and arrange for daily oblations to be performed to the Deity represented by the idol, which is none other than that of Lord Hanuman, the faithful servant of Lord Śrī Rāma of the Hindu epic Rāmāyaņa. Since He was heard  reciting the prayer addressing Lord Śrī Rāma, the Deity was named Dhyānānjanéyaswāmi and a grand Temple was built in the present location in the year 1143 AD. The Temple became very famous and renowned for its miraculous powers, ever since then…Golconda Fort was annexed from the then Qutb Shahi Rulers by the Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb in the year 1687 AD.  Aurangzeb, in his intolerance towards Hindu religion, went on destroying several temples and when his warriors came to destroy this Temple, they were chased away by the Divine Power. Disbelieving, Aurangzeb himself went to demolish the Temple. When he approached the Temple entrance, he heard a deafening loud noise and was astonished to see a super-bright tall light extending over the height of the Temple. He then heard a sweet voice telling him “KAR MAN GHAT” – meaning: “Strengthen your heart”, before touching the Temple. The Emperor, quite convinced of the Power of the Deity presiding over this Temple had retreated with no second thought. The Temple had since then come to be known as “Karmanghat”.We were quite impressed by the serenity of the location, the forms of the deities, the religiosity, preservation of the ancient and time-tested methodology of worship and offering of various oblations to the respective deities in each of the fifteen  sacred ancillary temples – some very ancient, and so on. There is no entrance fee and people are free to worship in the mornings and evenings. There were no jostling crowds and one could have very comfortable darshan at each temple within the complex. For those who have faith and belief in Hinduism, a visit to this Temple – the oldest in the City, I guess – is highly recommended! On our part, Laxmi and I felt we were abundantly blessed…!"
Karmanghat_Hanuman_Temple,KASI VENKOBA RAO,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Lord Hanuman in Meditation,"Karmanghat Hanuman Temple is an ancient temple purported to have been built in the 12th Century. The main Deity is Lord Hanuman and said to be very powerful.  Large devotees gather at the temple to pay prayers to the Lord Hanuman and the number is ten times folded on Saturdays, said to be a auspicious day for the Lord. Daily pooja with Pan leaves and abhisekhams are performed at this temple. The complex has a huge space for parking of vehicles.The Legend say that a Kakatiya king went hunting and was resting under a tree, he heard the chanting of Lord Rama's name. Wondering who it was in the middle of a dense forest, he discovered a stone idol of Lord Hanuman, in seated posture and the voice coming from the statue. He paid his respects.and  returned to his capital, The same night, Lord appeared in his dream and asked him to construct a temple. The temple was built immediately and successive kings ruled it well.Later, Moghul Empire  Aurangzeb with an intention of expansion of his Kingdom sent out his armies to all corners of the country.  At this temple, the army couldn't even step close to the compound wall. When the General reported this to Aurangzeb, he himself went with a crow bar to break down the temple. At the threshold of the temple, he heard a loud roar rumblning like thunder, and the crowbar slipped from his hands as he was shaking in fear. Then he heard a voice in the heavens ""Mandir todna hai rajan, to kar man ghat"" meaning that if you want  to break down the temple, then make your heart stronger.Kar means make, man means Heart and Ghat means stronger.Since then this temple is being called as Karmanghat Hanuman temple.Since Lord Anjaneya sits peacefully meditating and blessing devotees,this Hanuman is also being called as ""Dhyana Anjaneya Swamy""."
