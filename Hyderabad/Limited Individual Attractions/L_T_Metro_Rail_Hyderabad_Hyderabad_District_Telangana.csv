L_T_Metro_Rail,Sri Satya Sai S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Excellent mode of transport for Hyderabadis,"Good quality metro coaches, neat & reachable stations, mostly ontime metros, cleanest coaches describes L&T Metro Rail. This is the most efficient mode of transport for Hyderabadis. Its a boon to the citizens of Hyderabad. Thanks to the Metro, some of the roads of Hyderabad are widened and u-turn concept is brought at many junctions instead of traffic signals which is helping a lot in traffic movement. Names of some of the stations are not properly selected as metro station name and actual place name are not at the same place (example are Bala Nagar, JNTU, Raidurg etc). Should start metro in other routes also where traffic is high."

L_T_Metro_Rail,Shanti Swaroop K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Never before experience in Hyderabad,The best way to commute in Hyderabad. I was a regular commuter before I shifted near to my workplace. The prices are reasonable and it is definitely a state-of-the-art mass transportation system in Hyderabad.
L_T_Metro_Rail,BRKanth,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Great international experience,I have traveled using the Hyd metro rail and it was a pleasant experience and the staff and others are very cooperative. Truly worldclass experience. 
L_T_Metro_Rail,Srinsiri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Hyderabad Metro,"Hyderabad Metro, makes every hyderabadi very proud. It is adding a new feather in already super duper hyderabad city. "
L_T_Metro_Rail,savvyuec,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Excellent Service,"The Hyderabad metro provides very good service to the commuters.It can also be used to go to Secunderabad railway station which is .5 KM from the metro station. With the Hi-Tech City line also starting it provides very good connectivity as well and not as congested yet as the Bangalore metro.As some trivia, it is a tribute to the engineering prowess of L&T given the Metro Man (E Sreedharan) had casted doubt on its feasibility given the rocky terrain of Hyderabad."
L_T_Metro_Rail,EkMusafir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"Faster, Cleaner, Cooler, Cheaper.","Traveling by the L&T Metro Rail of Hyderabad is a much better option of getting around the congested city. It is faster because it avoids the long waits at the traffic signals. It is cleaner by far than the dusty streets, cooler because all the bogies are air conditioned and much cheaper than road transport if you are traveling alone. Recently the Blue Line got an extension from Ameerpet to Hitech City. We used the metro to travel from Hitech City to Secunderabad East to catch our Shatabdi Express from Secunderabad Junction Main Station. It took us 40 minutes in the metro and 10 minutes to walk from Secunderabad metro station to the main station. If we had taken a rickshaw or cab it would have taken us an hour and a half. At the metro stations, elevators are available to take you up from the road level to the platform level. The staff are very helpful and guide you to the concourse. There are some seats reserved for senior citizens and ladies. Small luggage can be kept under the seats.For the local commuters of Hyderabad, the Metro is a blessing, as it serves as a Rapid Transport System, avoiding the massive traffic jams and bottlenecked roads which the city is fast becoming. It serves the main areas of Hyderabad, but one still has to make use of the buses and autos to connect to the outlying areas. Work on expansion and new routes are still underway, and hopefully should be operative in the near future."

L_T_Metro_Rail,Paul G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,Bird's-eye view -- of widely travelled roads when growing up in Secunderabad,"It was nostalgic as I enjoyed the Metro Rail travel looking at the places from above, which I frequently travelled on my 1962 Vespa, while growing up in Secunderabad. Took the metro from Begumpet to Secunderabad .Neat and clean. Less crowded during off peak hours. Fare is cheap- The fare is Rs 10 for 2 km, Rs 15 for 4 km and steadily increases to Rs 55 for up to 26 kms. The fare for a distance more than 26 km has been fixed at Rs 60. The maximum you pay is Aud$1.20 (1/3rd price of a cappuccino). I advise Visitors to avoid traffic and travel on the Metro Rail and have a wonderful experience while exploring the city."
L_T_Metro_Rail,vijayagopal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Business,Has made local travel stress free,Traveling from Nagole to most parts of the commercial parts of the city has become easy with the metro. Just awaiting opening of line till hitec city.
L_T_Metro_Rail,Lokesh1981,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Hyderabad Metro ,"1. No doubt that it is a breakthrough transformation for the City both social as well as on economical front.2. I took many trips in last couple of months, however on long run how management is going to sustain maintenance related issues that may be a herculean challenge.3. All proposed networks shall be completed at the earliest and put on use for the public.4. LB Nagar to Nagole connection is strategic requirement and much needed, it shall be instrumental to make it a grand success, or else it is at present quite inconvenient, 5. Price is on much higher side, for daily users it is painful and not economic at all, management may rethink and plan accordingly.6. Naming of all stations may be re looked  which is at present quite confusing !!!!All the best management, no doubt it is pride of hyderabad!!!!!"
L_T_Metro_Rail,koteswararao,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,New and good Metro Rail,In India this is  new metro rail  People of Hyderabad happy with the rail   The transport is good  The govt done good work
L_T_Metro_Rail,kkespana2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Practical & efficient!,"A welcome addition not only to Hyderabad commuter landscape but also for sheer pleasure of riding on a train which is what I did with my two young children. It was also an opportunity to take pride in the native land’s evolving infrastructure!My children loved the ride and I took delight in guiding them to my native city from an elevated level. The stations and the trains were clean, and the staff everywhere. Just needs ongoing daily maintenance to keep the user-experiences at higher levels. I do sincerely wish that the users let people get off the trains first before ‘barging’ in. Metro authority must do more to raise awareness and enhance travel etiquette amongst the general population!Shops and supermarkets located at Ameerpet junction, and presumably at major intersections offer convenience shopping for commuters.A few points on my wish list would be;1. There needs to be an option of buying a return ticket and it needs to be slightly cheaper, keeping in with Europeans rail networks. This not only will be user-friendly but also proudly announces to the world that India cares for its people.2. It was annoying having to leave the station, ie exit the barriers to buy the return ticket! One should be able to buy it without doing so I’d imagine!3. Can’t wait to see introduction of prepaid smart cards!4. Station parking facilities need to be more robust to encourage higher usage of the service.5. Last but not least, I didn’t agree with the policy that children were charged at adult rates. Sincerely request that this needs reviewing!On the whole,the Metro is a step in the right direction and I’m pleased to have used it with my children. Well done Team Hyderabad Metro."

The cost seems to be a bit higher when compared with other metros however the staff are really helpful who are helping out at every stage in each station for the convenience of the public as this being a new one to the city.

L_T_Metro_Rail,Kirannelli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Pride of Hyderabad ,Went to Ameerpet from Rasul pura in metro which took 10 mins(normally it takes 40mins by road). Thanks to metro. Journey was so convenient and smooth. Best for hyd to avoid heavy road traffic.
L_T_Metro_Rail,TraveFreak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Life saver,"can you imagine reaching Ameerpet to Kukatpally in 15 mins? Well, now you can with train services every 8 mins on a luxurious Air conditioned coaches. It feels more secured with a security check towards the platform and with train doors automatically closing avoiding people dangerously hanging on the steps.There are still some small vendors selling stuff inside the coaches and some irritated folks issuing tickets at the counter. But, with smart cards, easy recharging options can help avoid queues making life damn easy. Kudos Hyderabad!"
L_T_Metro_Rail,Georgio Valentino Rayala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Awesome Metro Train Service In Hyderabad,It has been in the making for a long time and finally it opened its service on November 28 th 2017. Only half of the two lines [Red and Blue] are opened i.e. from Miyapur station to Ameerpet station [Red Line] and Nagole station to Ameerpet station [Blue Line] and you have change the train at Ameerpet station if you want to travel from Miyapur to Nagole.I travelled the full length i.e. from Nagole station to Miyapur station and it cost me sixty rupees on January 2 nd 2018 and it has been a great experience. The train coaches were modern and the staff working were very efficient. I hope they start the full operations very soon which will help reduce traffic and pollution in Hyderabad.
