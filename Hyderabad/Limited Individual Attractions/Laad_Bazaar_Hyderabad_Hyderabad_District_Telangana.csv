There are many shops selling bangles and pearls. There are unbranded clothes and other knick knacks being sold on the street.The place, though, appears heavily crowded because of small lanes and the large number of people visiting. This takes lot of effort to just walk through the area. There appeared to be more tourists than the locals, who were shopping there, as Laad Bazaar as well as the adjacently located Charminar is among the tourist attraction of Hyderabad.Overall, a good place to visit for those who want to shop as well as for those who just want to check out the shops."

Laad_Bazaar,Oxymoronish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,"Interesting, but incredibly crowded","It was tiresome navigating the minuscule walking space with children. People kept bumping into them causing them pain. So, if you're going to with kids, be prepared to carry them all the way. The shops are interesting and make for a nice evening stroll. Even if you don't buy anything, there's great opportunity for street photography as well as lots of material for observation. That said, keep your belongings secure as pickpockets abound (even the police station there warns us so). Lots of bangles shops; how much you pay for them depends on how good you're at bargaining (which I'll confess I was rubbish at). There's an old cafe right next to the Charminar, Nimrah Bakery; they had some good Irani tea and lovely biscuits. Lots of knickknacks to browse through. An enjoyable experience if you aren't too bummed out by crowds and people bumping into you. That said, I didn't have even a single bad experience as a woman - no perverted touching/grazing/grabbing. Good for you, people of Laad Bazaar!"

Laad_Bazaar,NasehaAlok,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Learn to Bargain,"Laad Bazar or Choodi Bazar as it is popularly know is adjacent o Charminar. The Bazar has been operating since the time of the Qutb Shahis and the Nizams. Pearls jewelry along with hollow bangles are the main attraction of this place. Unfortunately, the popularity of hollow bangles which was once the must have for anybody visiting and in Hyderabad is declining. However, it is something to have. Very light and graceful, delicate I must add. Another thing which is found only is Hyderabad's Laad bazar is the 'Chiksa'. It is a kind of beauty mask. Can be used in hair and skin. Before the facial, and body polish, every Muslim family which had a wedding planned, would make sure to get this. Brides used to use this every day for 21 or 14 days for a beautiful and naturally fragrant skin. It is worth a try. Before going, have an idea about the cost. If you are good with knowledge of price and quality of a commodity, and with bargaining, this is a place for you. Cheap and nice, but if you are someone like me who has no idea about quality and price and is bad with bargaining, be ready to get ripped off. The first price that is quoted to you is 3-4 time higher!!! Good luck"

The roads are undergoing some repair work, so the area is rather dusty and dirty (as of February 2017), but the shops are bright and colourful and very affordable. Shopkeepers have a rude way of calling in customers, but the jewellery sold is excellent. Do NOT buy mehendi (henna) from here, as it's more dye than actual natural henna, and can cause problems on your skin. I had an allergic reaction. If you would like to buy typical Hyderabadi jewellery, this is the place to go!"

The driving skills required to cross streets and dodge other vehicles was very impressive.The market itself was dissappointing mainly because of the quality of what was being sold. The fruit and veggie section was lovely to see but the goods were mainly very synthetic and too bling for my liking.

Bangles, pearls, chains, sarees, clothing , shoes, and so much more including a few food stands lined streets in all directions. The store owners and assistants called out for me and my friends to come into their shops. We did not feel pressured to do so although some shout outs were persistent. We did buy many items but only after much bartering. Prices were very reasonable and several good deals were had. The large crowds were well behaved and the local folks there just went about their way not being distracted by our large group of foreigners. [there were 20 of us]. It was a fun evening--we spent 2 hours plus there."

Laad_Bazaar,GeoffandLaura,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,This is a must if you want the true local experience,"We went to Charminar but only visited the Makkah Masjid as well. Big mistake, visit all 3 because you are there. We went back to buy from the Bazaar.  Don't expect high quality merchandise you are in the heart of the market rubbing shoulders with the locals and asking questions. They don't care if you are black white or brown they only want to sell.  Do be aware their math can leave a lot to be desired until you question them on it, you will get a polite apology. Take it and move on it is all part of the trade and they are good at it.  Small bills are best no argument give them the correct money.  Enjoy this experience, we did. Oh and don't forget you will need to dodge the traffic as well, very easy to learn just make sure you signal your moves and don't stand still."
