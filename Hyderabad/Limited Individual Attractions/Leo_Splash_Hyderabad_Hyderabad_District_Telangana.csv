Leo_Splash,sanjay v,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 â€¢ Family,Was best but turned to horrible,"This was the best resort with all amenities and water sports and pool. Management turned this all into a hell where now they just eat up money and never bother about guest's convenience. It was a favorite weekend gateway for corporate, family and other groups but because they are getting good numbers of incomers, services have gone worst now. Food which was really nice before 2013, has gone worst now. Nobody will tell you where to go and their outdoor games are always without gears. Overall this is once nice but now worst place. Management is still sleeping and they never care about you. The person you are dealing before visit may be switching his phone off when you visit. What the hell will you do then?????Visit on your risk"
Leo_Splash,chinna_79,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 â€¢ Friends,Not price worthy,"there will no to guide to tell where to go and what to do. charges 1300 bucks for no reason, we have to buy swim wear(no rental) for about 410+ bucks(extra), in order to get into the pool. if u really want swimming pool and water rides there are very good other places in hyderabad you can visit."
Leo_Splash,Rajni A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2013 â€¢ Friends,Best place to hang on on weekends,"I would be very proud to say that hyderabad is bestowed with so many places worth visit.From religious to historical , From fun to food.....I just love hyderabad. Leonia holistic destination is one of the resorts where one can enjoy a full weekend with their kids splashing in the basking waters.Exellent place.."
