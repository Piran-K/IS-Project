Lotus_Pond,Rajib Ghosh,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,Not A Tourist Destination,"Lotuses neither grow in this pond not it is shaped like one. Its a misnomer. Nestled in area between Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills, the Lotus pond is a water body surrounded by residential and commercial buildings.The pond itself is fenced with wire and does not allow stepping in and resting ones feet in the cold water. Being surrounded by political big-wigs and commercial offices, the narrow road around the lake is a traffic circus that is best avoided by one and all."

Well, not so deep that you would get lost finding it It is easily accessible. A good place when you would like spend some time beside a water body without much of travel.Beware, you make really close contact with the floral and fauna around  "
Lotus_Pond,outside o,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015,"Nice spot if you're in the area, to me it is not a destination.","Nice spot to relax and walk around the pond.  Security guards keeping food, drinks, cameras, and ballyhoo outside the gates.  This place is only open in the wee hours (It think) and between 4-6 pm.  I am constantly frustrated by the closed hours of public parks.  You can walk around the pond in about 15-20 minutes, we usually stretch it to about 45 by letting our toddler toddle, and stopping to check out the turtles/fish/crabs which are easily seen en mass from the path directly opposite the main gait.  There is also a small wooded section off to the left of the main path with several covered pavilions.  We wandered through once or twice and it was mostly teenage boys carving their names into tree trunks while taking turns looking out for the guides and a couple of couples getting frisky in the shadows.  Looked like the pavilions  would be good for some morning exercises or yoga.  We never felt the least bit threatened in this area, but it is somewhat removed from the main trail and most of the people.  Overall, I visit this park once or twice a week due to proximity, would visit it more if it were open during the day.  Also, any birders, there is usually anywhere from 4-10 species of wading and water birds visible in the pond.  "
Lotus_Pond,occlusion_vikas,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Solo,nothing much to talk about,"this place is not to standards of what the G.H.M.C talks about but much cleaner than other parks in the city . not very easily reached unless u have ur own transport , hardly find lotus there but a nice place to have a morning walk though. cannot totally blame the authorities but the park users too they lack basic civic sense ."

Lotus_Pond,hiteshgoldeneye,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 • Couples,Not well maintained - waste of time,"Went there one evening after reading some good reviews in TripAdvisor however was disappointed to find that the site is nothing but another wasted opportunity.

There is no fencing on the pond and can be risky if you go with a child."

Never knew that such place can even exist in the middle of city . The place is so beautiful that one can lost in the beauty of nature for a while , The pond is full of fishes and you can sit idle starring at them .
