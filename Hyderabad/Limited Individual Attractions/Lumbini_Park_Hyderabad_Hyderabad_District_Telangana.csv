Lumbini_Park,Sagar K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Poor Quality of Service ,The ticketing system at the park is a chaos and no proper information at the park. When we reached we paid just entry free at the park after standing in long queue for 30 mins. Then another long queue for Laser Show again 30 mins. And another long queue for Boat to Buddha Statue....Ufff.The management should issue all the tickets at the main counter as per visitors choice and preferences. This will save a lot of time .No organised Cloak Room to keeps bags. Please avoid keeping valuables in the bags. Bags are not allowed in the Laser Show and Boat to Buddha Statue.

Established in 1994 under Buddha Poornima project by the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority, it gets in name from the birthplace of Lord Buddha. The park showcases some really wonderful variety of seasonal flowering plants and numerous cactiAn attraction every tourist would love, irrespective of their preference in religious, cultural or historical places in Hyderabad, is undoubtedly the Lumbini Park, located along the shore of Hyderabad's famous Hussain Sagar Lake. Established in 1994 under Buddha Poornima project by the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority, it gets in name from the birthplace of Lord Buddha. The park showcases some really wonderful variety of seasonal flowering plants and numerous cacti.It works as an ideal place for people looking out to let their head down after a hard day’s work. Relaxation and amusement happen to be one of the key reasons behind a large number of people who throng the garden, especially in the evening. The 3-D laser show and musical fountain show that are conducted in the evening mesmerize one and all. An interesting feature at Lumbini Park of Hyderabad is the huge clock decorated with colorful flowers located at the entry point.Nearby attractions include Birla Mandir and Hussain Sagar Lake. A royal statue of standing Lord Buddha made of granite is installed in the middle of the lake and can well be called a true epitome of beauty. This lake has been widely acclaimed for being the largest artificial lake in Asia and draws a number of people for its beauty and boating activities."

Lumbini_Park,gpradeepshenoy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Just a small park,Took a Bus from Nampally to Lumbini Park(Nearest bus stop to Lumbini park is Secretariat ). A Walk from Secretariat bus stop to Lumbini park is of about 3 Minutes.               Entrance costs Rs 20 to this park. From this park boats goes to Buddha statue. The ferry rates are Rs 55(up and down charges). It is better to visit this park and budha statue in the late evening/ night . One can spend time at the buddha statue as per their liking and then return to Lumbini park. After sunset the budhha statue becomes lighted because of many lights directed on the statue and is good to watch.             Apart from boats which take tourists to Buddha statue there are speed boats also. These speed boats do not stop at the Buddha statue . Apart from this there is some evening/night cruise in a boat. This boat also does not stop in Buddha statue but the boat plays music for tourists to dance and have a good time.            There are few Kiosks inside Lumbini park selling snacks and beverages. We went for Laser show in the Lumbini park which costs Rs 60.00 The show was very average and the show starts at 7:15 Pm. If you are in a hurry then this laser show can be missed.                Average place to visit while at Hyderabad.

Lumbini_Park,jainms,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Entry to Buddha statue,"Lumbini park is the entrance to boating and buddha statue, Also laser show available in the park only on evening times."
Lumbini_Park,ShvRm_Traveller,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Overrated and commercialized,"The purpose visiting the park is to spend some peaceful time, which is defeated because of the amount of effort that is being taken to just enter the park. First, there was a long queue and heavy jostling to obtain the entry tickets. The ticket counter was absolutely unorganized. Then there was a very long queue to enter the park. Bags, even the backpack, were not allowed inside. There was a counter to deposit the bags, where again there was a heavy rush.Cameras are allowed inside the park on payment, however, the amount quoted for allowing a simple Digital camera was INR 1000/-. So we had to go and deposit the camera at the luggage counter.After all this when we entered the park, we found that, there was nothing extraordinary about the place, apart from being located on the bank of Hussain Sagar lake. Moreover, the place was heavily crowded.The boat service to the Buddha Statue starts from the park, on payment of additional charges for the boat.Overall, the park is a over hyped place, which is mostly frequented by the tourist, as it is sold to them as a tourist attraction. To be visited, only if there is nothing else better to do."

Lumbini_Park,Mahesh A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Nice laser show,"This park is located just next to the famous Hussain Sagar lake. From the park entrance, we can go to both the boating and laser/musical fountain shows.The park is well maintained. It looked neat even though it was too crowded when we went. The entrance fee for getting into the park is very nominal. But we need to pay extra for other facilities available inside the park - Ex., boating, laser show etc.,We went for the laser show first. It was a mix of laser show and musical fountain. A laser show followed by a musical fountain and it was repeated thrice. For the first timers, this would be a fabulous experience. It was of a great standard. The queue for the boating was huge, so couldn't take a trip to Buddha statue.Tips:1. It is not allowed to carry any bags inside the park (other than ladies handbag). They have a baggage counter, so unless you have any costly material, it shouldn't be a problem2. It was extremely crowded even on a Thursday (a non-holiday also). So you need to plan well if you want to cover both boating and laser/musical fountain show3. From there, if you take an auto to your place of stay, some drivers may recommend ""a good place to buy sarees etc.,"" DON'T go for that option. Your such buying cost may also include their commission."

The first is mainly a children’s park.It actually is an interesting monument to see in the center of the lake. The Buddha statue is towering in size and made from a single piece of stone so it is impressive. We took a speed boat to go around the statue and get a close look.The boats leave from a small park that has play cars that run on a track so fun for the children.  It is a good place for children to spend time.   I was happy that we had taken a speed boat and not a slow one for the lake was stinking. Yes, the lake is crying for maintenance."

Along with seasonal flowering plants, wide variety of cacti and rocks, the park also has many options to keep kids entertained. The Musical fountain and water cascades attract everyone. The sight of water shooting up to the sky, making a screen of water where the history of Hyderabad is being shown is something not many of us have seen before. It is an experience in itself. The best part of laser show is that just 3D. You will see a city created in 3D right at a park.Musical fountain and the laser show at the Lumbini Park is something not to be missed. The timing of the musical fountain is from 6.30 P.M. and 8 P.M.

Lumbini_Park,Tarun P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Nothing much to see,"The park adjacent to the Hussain sagar lake is a small assortment of coffee shops, some rides for kids and a couple of bridges, nothing special except the waterfall that has been constructed on the middle of the park but the stink from the lake makes it hard for you to enter the water."

Lumbini_Park,Fahim_Khan_13,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Lumbini Park !!!,"This Park is normal with 1 ride & normal swings, there is laser & light show too at around 8 pm, On weekend this place is over crowded, for tickets there is long queues. We visited it on weekend, but looking at the queue we dropped to go inside,  then on normal week day we again visited the Park, this time the queue was less, Hence we went inside, after entry to the park, if you take right turn, you will go to the Laser & light show, & if you take left turn you will go to the ride & the swing section & also there is the Ferry you can catch to go to the Buddha statue,Overall normal park, good for the kids."
Lumbini_Park,73prashantha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Not anything special.,Not anything special. This is just like a normal park. Except for the light show during the evening there is nothing exciting.
Lumbini_Park,GrandTour21627470896,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,don't spoil your eyes. stupidest laser arrangement ever!,"the laser show at Lumbini is 30 min with alternating 5 min slots between an areal laser show and fountain laser show.the fountain laser shine upward in the sky. The problem is the other slot where the lasermounted exactly opposite to audience fires the show at the audience.this is the dumbest thing to do. the permissible lasers are sub 5mW (the laser pointers). the ones used in the show seem very heavy wattage shining right into 1000+ audience eye balls on the opposite side.@ 50Rs per head, the park easily collects in excess of 15 Lakh per month just from laser show. if they could afford to consult/hire any engineer with common sense, it might be turned into pleasurable experience. recommend  not to go there unless you know this problem is solved."
Lumbini_Park,Arjun Menon,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Park is just avergae. Not a must see spot.,Park is just an average place which has a moderate entrance fee. You would need to enter the park if you wish to go the Budha statue which is there in another island. IT had some fountains and the maintenance is kind of fine considering the amount of crowd coming in.
Lumbini_Park,Prasun S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Fun and games,Lumbini park is situated just the opposite of Hussain Sagar lake. Here you must watch the laser show.  The show and the audience charm you . After watching the show you enjoy some ride in the park with your family.
Lumbini_Park,Daniel T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Solo,Good family entertainment option anyday,"Actually known as T.Anjaiah Lumbini Park, good place for low-cost family entertainment. Entry ticket to the park is approx INR 20. Separate ticket for boating. This needs to taken inside the park. There are options for different boats.  Huge rush during weekends and holidays.
