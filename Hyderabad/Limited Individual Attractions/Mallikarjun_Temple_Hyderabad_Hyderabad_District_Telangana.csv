Mallikarjun_Temple,G.GURU PILLAI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Must visit Temple,"I visited this temple with my wife  and we got good memories there.the temple is very neat and maintenance is very great.U can feel the vibration of lord Mallikarjuna.Srisailam is famous for Srisailam Dam & Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Temple which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The unique feature of this kshetram is the combination of Jyothirlingam and Mahasakthi (in the form of Bhramarambika) in one campus, which is very rare and only one of its kind. The great religious leader Aadi Sankara is said to have visited this shrine and composed his immortal Sivananda Lahiri here.Srisailam is a perfect combination of temples and scenic spots. Srisailam Dam built over River Krishna is one of the largest dams in South India. Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple, Bhramaramba Devi Temple, Akka Mahadevi Caves, Pathala Ganga, Shikaresvara Temple, Sakshi Ganapathi Temple and Mallela Theertham are the other attractions here."

Mallikarjun_Temple,Som00in,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Rudrabhishek ,I visited the holy place with my friends and guru Ji . There is a direct connecting flight from Lucknow to Hyderabad. We started for Sri Sailam in the morning by road. The route passes through jungle. The place has many good restaurants and hotels . We stayed in Mallikarjuna Sadan. It has all the facilities. You can get north and south Indian food. There are s shops to get the daily need. For rudrabhishek and darshan there is ticket system. This is the only place which has shaktipeeth also. The lingam feels live here. The area and vicinity is very quite and calm. There are stairs going down to patal ganga. One can take a dip there. Enroute you can have fresh fish cooked. The sight of the dam is also worth watching. A must visit place.

Mallikarjun_Temple,Rizu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Religious visit,Temple is beautiful. But management is not good at all. The place is really hot and the exit gate is away from the shoe counter. And will literally end up burning your feet. They have not even laid the carpets properly so that it is convenient for people to walk in the scorching heat. But darshan was really good. This was the only good thing that happened. Inspite of all these difficulties it is a must visit. Is one of the jyotirlinga. And also a shakti peeth.
