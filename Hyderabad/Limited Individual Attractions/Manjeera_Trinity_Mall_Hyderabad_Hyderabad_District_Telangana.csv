Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,Georgio Valentino Rayala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Nice Mall with a Decathlon Store,It is a small mall compared to the Forum Sujana Mall which is located close to this Mall [5 minutes walk] but what I liked about this mall is the existence of a Decathlon store in its ground floor. Also there is a Hypercity department store right next to the Decathlon store.I visited it along with a friend and we watched a movie at Cinepolis multiplex which was good. Next we had snacks at the McDonalds outlet on the first floor and after that we explored the mall. It has a Shoppers Stop outlet on two floors of the mall and a SVM gaming zone on the third floor.Also there is a Toni and Guy Saloon and various other retail brands but it doesn't have high quality restaurants like the Forum mall.
Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,KASI VENKOBA RAO,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Not Impressive,"Manjeera Trinity Mall, is located at KPHB Colony, Kukatpally, Hyderabad.  Manjeera mall is has 6 levels of shopping pleasure and 4 levels of parking space. Manjeera Mall is said to be from the house of Manjeera Group which is committed to providing world class infrastructure, retail and living spaces to its patrons.  The Mall has a mix of National & International Brands like  Shoppers Stop, Hyper City, Cinepolis, Canon, Nike, Pepe Jeans, Wrangler, Jash, Soch, Woodland, BIBA, AND, Global Desi, Mc Donalds, KFC, Subway, Casio, Titan, Celio etc. But I observed that many shops have since closed for the reasons now known. But It has a number of food courts and Cinepolis multiplex theatres. One can enjoy the food as multiple choices of food are available here. We were here at this mall to watch a movie and spent some time at this mall. However I an not impressed about the shops at the mall.  its just ok for window shoping and to spend some time here with family/friends."

Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,savvyuec,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,"Cinepolis, Hypercity, Shoppers Stop and Decathon","It is a very good option to watch movies at Cinepolis. The price is more reasonable than Forum and the parking is more accessible as it is less crowded than forum.Shopping options are rather limited compared to Forum, In-Orbit as quite a few shops have closed down for some reason but you have HyperCity, Shoppers Stop, Woodlands and Decathon is opening soon.Food options are decent, although slightly less than other larger malls but it is not a problem.You also have games arcade and bowling alley in the mall."
Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,Jikuza,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017,Decent shopping and food options,"This is typically a run of the mill mall with a few fast food outlets such as McDonalds, Jumbo King Vadapav, a few restaurants, shopping outlets and a movie multiplex by INOX.

Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,Ramm,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Poor facilities!,"Well, its a decent mall around Kukatpally and there is no doubt about it when it comes to proximity or positioning and also has few super stores like Shoppers stop and Hypermart along with few branded stores.Lets start from the parking: Poor direction signage's, parking to mall is entry is not at all welcoming.Important: If you plan to use the rest-room next to the lift lobby on Shoppers stop side, please carry a mask and enter, i suggest-avoid if you can. This was one of the point i want to stress on, value of a place is directly proportional to its cleanliness and this is lacking to the core.  Well, moving on to Cinepolis, you will have a bang during the intermission of the film, the food is over-priced, a piece of chocolate cake - INR 100+, Popcorn starts - 120+ etc. This pricing becomes value for money when the management provides the right amenities to the visitor.A place, has a lot of potential to improve in all means!"

Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,Rvmanyata,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Very good Mall,"The Mall is very good having various types of shoes for shopping. Good multiplexes for movies lovers. Weekends more fun games are conducted by various corporates for children and few times having occassions are conducted by like by FM radio city,  cine stars. Overall should have good time spending time in the Mall. But the Last not the least is the Mall is providing around 45 minutes of free wifi to enjoy on internet. "

Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,Rajat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Friends,Place to be on Weekends!,"Manjeera mall's biggest attraction is the cinepolis movies which are way better than pvr of sujana or inorbit. The place has all brands like pizza hut, mcdonalds and some local ones which makes you always keep occupied. Perfect for weekend to shop, dine and enjoy a movie."

Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,Nishant M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Not a good visit,"The mall is not so good as compared other better malls in the nearby such as Forum mall and Inorbit mall which is in Hitec area. I went there for a movie in cinepolis and had a very bad experience. The movie hall was not so good and the seating was also not so comfortable. On top of that the food served by them was also stale. Moreover, the food court does not provide with many choices and lacks some really good brands, which you can easily find at other places."

Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,shivaraikod,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,A low range mall,"Don't know why i find this mall less attractive, may be bcoz of forum mall at just a stone throw away distance. There aren't many option to show apart from shoppers stop. Needs improvement for the parking too."

Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,Pavan K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Couples,Not up to expectations ,I had been here for a movie. Parking places are not well organized. Every where you will find speed breakers. Even escalators in the mall have to be searched. Somehow i didn't find anythimg great.

Manjeera_Trinity_Mall,Krishna Prasad,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Crowded with acutely unplanned parking,"The car park is a night mare with improperly placed entry gates and boom bars that don't open or close according to the movement of the car, most irritating of all improperly placed speed bumpsThe mall is too crowded as it is crammed with shops and eateries Hypercity is crazy with closely spaced Isles and high shelvesOver all it is a disaster of a mall if they don't reduce the number of shops The only plus point is Cinepolis which as usual is of high standard with great screens and good movies playing"
