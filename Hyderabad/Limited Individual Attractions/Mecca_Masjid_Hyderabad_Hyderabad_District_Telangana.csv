It is used for prayer so, be sure to be prepared to take off your shoes when visiting. PLEASE be aware, you will be approached if you do not look Indian by ""guides"" that will tell you the history which you can get from Wikipedia. They will tour you around the place and then ask for a donation.  The same can be said for the man at watching over your shoes.  He wanted money so I gave him American Dollars since I did not have rupees but wanted $5 to get my shoes back.  Oh, be aware even though you have to take your shoes off, the floors are dirty in some areas covered in pigeon poop."

Mecca_Masjid,kcdebnath,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad,"It was 15th August, 19. We reached Hyderabad late from Vellore by Sabari Express. After checked in our hotel at Abids we decided to visit Charminar in the afternoon. Every body knows that Charminar is the iconic of Hyderabad City, the most beautiful monument in the heart of Hyderabad.  We reached in the evening. The place is very crowded as it was Independence Day. We spent some time there. Then we visited Mecca Masjid, one of the largest in the world, situated on the south west of Charminar. Here also we a lot of visitors assembled. All are in festive mood. we were interested to pay a visit there. First we faced a tight security. However we entered the masjid area. Why Mecca Masjid, the name given? Some say the founder, Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah commissioned the construction who asked for soil to be brought in from the holy Islamic site of Mecca. He laid the foundation stone of this mosque in 1641. Some say that a few bricks from holy shrine from Mecca were embedded in it .Another view that only one brick was brought from Mecca. However, the mosque was completed by Aurangzeb,in 1694,  the Mughal Emperor, after conquering Golkunda in 1687. It is so big that it can accommodate 10,000 worshippers in its prayer hall. The architecture is beautiful, one of a Heritage Building in Hyderabad. It is worth visiting along with the Charminar."

Mecca_Masjid,Sounak Poddar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Heritage Building,"Just next to Charminar, a heritage building in the town. Still Standing strong and a beautiful structure. Could have been maintained a bit more, but overall nice place to visit during Ramzan, then one will get the taste of the market in front of that area as well but make sure you don't have a vehicle with yourself because during that period all the roads are blocked."
Mecca_Masjid,Arun Karthik,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Heritage Place,"The aura and sanctity that one gets to feel near Mecca Masjid Hyderabad is simply incomparable. Founded by Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah, the fifth ruler of Qutub Shahi dynasty, it is one of the biggest and the oldest mosques in South India. It is said that he himself laid the foundation stone and the bricks used to construct the central arch of the mosque have been made from soil sourced from Mecca. This is the reason behind the mosque getting its name as Mecca Masjid.It has the capacity to accommodate 10,000 worshippers to offer prayers at a time. About 8000 workers were involved in the construction of this mosque that draws hundreds of tourists from all across the globe, not just for its historical or religious importance but also for its spectacular beauty.A few common sights at this sacred place include feeding of pigeons considered to be a virtue in the Muslim community and devotees sitting by the side of an artificial pond installed in the mosque. As per a legend, whoever sits on the two stones and slab benches beside the pond always comes back to sit on them again"

Mecca_Masjid,FaisalNM,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Worth visiting,"The Masjid lies in the very crowded Charminar area. Most area around the masjid was kept free from Hawkers during the Friday prayer time, which is great.Shoe keeping is done by local people at various places, they keep your shoes and give you a handmade token.The pond for ablution was disappointing. Full of bird feathers and dried leaves and dust floating on it, however, there is a separate place with taps for ablution too but not clearly visible, we had to ask if there was one.The prayer sermon or khudba was in Arabic instead of the widely spoken and understood Urdu which was surprising.The interior of the masjid is spellbinding, mainly because it's very high. Almost four to five storeys high ceiling.Chandelier were covered in cloth thought and fans kept things cool.Albeit run down and under maintenance, it still gave the old time flavour and one could feel they are back in time by say 40-50 years.Worth visiting and experiencing if in Hyderabad."

If you don't have it, they will lend you a scarf or shawl that you use as veil to cover your hair. A very unfortunate condition where there is a lot of bird droppings in the courtyard of the mosque so that it looks less maintained and slum.Caution with your belongings. "

Secondly, once they see a foreigner come in, even their employees come and first seem helpful to explain the history, etc., and then ask for SADAGA - donation to mosque - bluntly. And when you offer something that is not to their liking (too low), they complain to your face! These guys are not true Muslims - Muslims do not beg, and do not act anywhere like these guys.

Mecca_Masjid,RainedOnInRedmond,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Be on guard here - tourist trap,"Have visited many mosques and other religious monuments in many countries.  Not the best experience here.  I am white so I stand out as a tourist.  Came around lunchtime.  I came into the courtyard and you have to take off your shoes and socks and when you come back they will expect you to pay for their watching your shoes.  I came in and an old guy offered to show me something interesting (which should have been a red flag, my error) and he took me around the corner to show me some graves of the local rules.  Then him and another old Muslim guy started pressuring me to deposit some money on this grave and say a prayer, and I realized that I was now out of view of the crowd and alone with these two guys who are trying to extract money.  I politely walked away, back to where the shoes are.  By this time my feet have ample dirt on them.  I walked around in the courtyard toward the main mosque and it's impressive enough.  However the cobblestones were filthy on my bare feet and I decided to go look around other things in the Charminar area instead.It would probably be a better experience with a guide or local friend."

I mean, the main entrance had all kinds of checking and frisking. But if you happen to come by the back door, you can just enter without any Security Check! That's something that should be looked into."

Mecca_Masjid,Sam S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,One of the oldest mosques of Hyderabad.,"I prayed in this mosque along with my brother, uncle and several others on one Friday noon during the summer holidays in the year 1987. There is a sundial, few graves, a big houz to perform ablution. It reminds us of the love of our ancestors for all the new generations and our love towards the heritage. The legacy continues but the Govt. and NGOs' must do more to improvise its sanctity on an international standard. The Charminar bus station beside it must be added to the metro rail or at least tram to facilitate the commuters living nearby the monument."

Mecca_Masjid,annejang,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Strict Dress code ,A couple of my friends and I were exploring the area around charminar and went to visit Mecca Masjid which is located right next to Charminar. We were covered and wearing kurti/ tee shirt with jeans but weren't allowed inside. We decided to get some duppata ( sold outside for 100 rupees which is overpriced) to cover our heads. Despite that we weren't allowed to enter. We took few pictures in the courtyard and left.
