Moula_Ali_Dargaha,jyotipdeka,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Peaceful and Mesmerising Sunsets,"Located atop the Moula Ali Hill, it’s is not just the religious significance that attracts you but also the mesmerising view of the city and the sunset that you get from there - 400 steps climb to the hill is worth the effort.  During the evenings when the prayers start, the place feels all the more divine. The place lacks maintenance and it’s sad to see that we have not even spared religious places when it comes to spreading garbage. The authorities need to penalise such people who spoil the beauty of this place and also need to ensure sufficient garbage bins are in place that can be utilised for throwing waste inspect of degrading the beauty of this beautiful place."

Moula_Ali_Dargaha,CBVARMS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Maula Ali a pristine place of pilgrimage,Maula Ali Dargah is located on a hillock in Hyderabad / Secunderabad. There are  480 steps to reach up to the shrine. I have been to this place earlier too but this time we were surprised as we discovered a route which took us half way spot by car. The best part was there was enough parking as we had gone on a Saturday. The rest of the climb was very comfortable for my friends who went up. The serene breeze and a bird's eye view of the city of Hyderabad was mesmerizing.

Moula_Ali_Dargaha,Gowrish P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Peaceful spot and panoramic views,"Highest point in Secunderabad, Maula Ali offers panoramic view of all of Hyderabad all around. Good spot to watch the sun set over the city.Maula Ali Dargah has two access points. One starts at the base with stairs all the way. Another one (likely, newly redeveloped) accessible from the road up to mid point to the top. We chose the former, which has parking only in small bylanes. The latter point is recently developed with broad roads and sufficient parking.The walk up the 400+ stairs is pleasant, and not tiring.Dating back to Qutb Shahi times, the Dargah has strong following and is believed to fulfilling wishes. This Dargah is claimed to have a handprint of Hazrat Ali, son in law of The Prophet.The Dargah is open and accessible on all days from dawn to 10 pm.The best time to reach here is an hour before sunset. Walk up the stairs, visit the Dargah and them settle down on the ample space around the Dargah. This space is essentially the side of a rocky smooth hillock. All sides are accessible to walk and each side offers views not seen anywhere else. You can faintly spot buildings in the remote financial district. Faintly, and phantom like.It is interesting play to identify remote spots such as the Golconda fort directly to the West. The small size of the fort emphasizes the distance from Maula Ali.Watching the sun set and lights turning on slowly all around the city and silence settling down after the prayer hours is to be experienced here.All in all, this spot should be on your checklist if you live in the twin cities."

Moula_Ali_Dargaha,117abbas,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Huge  clone of Ayers rock, Australia, with beautiful dargah on top","Moula Ali dargah, which is said to have relics  relating to Hazrat Ali, son in law of Prophet Muhammad, is one of the many very holy sites for Shias, around Hyderabad.Though access is  little difficlut to discover, once you are at the huge dome of a rock sitting  in the midst of a residential area, you will see the arch through which you start th eclimb to the dargah.The rock is really huge, similar to the iconic Ayers rock in Northern Australia and visible from a long distance.The climb involves steps cut into the rock and is quite steep at places, but  railings have been provided at  certain points to help you keep your balance.As you climb, just keep stopping for breath and to admire the surrounding huge rocky hills with houses rising all around.You wlll pass through a couple of more large decorated arches before reaching the top where the main shrine is located.If you are planning to enter the shrine you have to be modestly dressed, covering your head, arms and legs and removing your shoes. A peep inside will astonish you. The glittering mirror filled walls and ceiling and decorations in silver with verses from the Quran liberally covering the walls, will keep you mesmerised. Anyone can enter and seek blessings from the priest who will brush you with  peacock feathers. On holy days when the Urs (religious festival dedicated to Hazat Ali is held), you can also view and touch the relics kept under a cloth covering.On the days of the urs, you wlll find huge throngs of men,women and children making the strenuous climb to seek the blessings of the 4th Caliph of Islam.Both a visually rewarding and uplifting spiritual experience!!"

Solid Rock Formations, which can be climbed and explored in the early morning or in the evening. Excellent view for admiring sun rise & sun set. Also a fascinating view of the night skyline. Parking of the vehicles is a problem, make sure you dont parking in front of any residence door or gate. Carry your water & fruits, if you wish to explore the hill with some time. Wear canvas / tennis shoes with rubber sole will give you grip during the climb, and walk the rock surface.One can also test their endurance by doing a climb sprint on the nearly 400 stairs. I managed 2 back to back stair climbs, before i started huffing & puffing.If you wish to visit the Dargah, them make sure you are attired in a presentable way, to attend a place of worship. Carrying a head scarf or large handkerchief is advised, and leaving your footwear at the designated place suggested.Camera & Mobile phone is permitted. But avoid carrying any other valuable gadgets & wearing jewelry while climbing & exploring.The place has elevation, hence expect wind.Down the hill are few restored places also of historic significance, which can also be explored and appreciated.Since this is are place of worship. Respect the place and avoid disturbing anyone.I have enjoyed few very beautiful full moon nights ( Upto 8pm) here."

Moula_Ali_Dargaha,Kiaditke,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Calm and peaceful spot,"Moula Ali hill is not among the sights you will need to tick off on a weekend's trip to Hyderabad. But if you are here longer, or on your second trip, it would be worthwhile to make your way to the north-east corner of the city. Moula Ali Gutta, the hill on which the dargah stands is a landmark in itself. Other nearby landmarks are the ECIL cross roads bus station (about a kilometer away) and the old gateway called Moula Ali Kaman a few hundred meters from the bottom of the hill.There is a bit of a climb involved in getting to the dargah, but the path is a broad and even stairway up which children can run, and adults of any age will have no trouble walking.

It is a lovely place in the evenings and mornings.The dargah, now on a protected heritage list, is about 450 years old. Unlike other dargahs, it does not contain the body of a saint. Moula Ali was the son-in-law of the prophet, and the dargah contains not his body bud a ""miraculous"" hand-print which is supposed to have been created by his spirit. It is a nice story to keep in mind as you climb the peaceful hill and look out at the vista of the city spread out before you.

Moula_Ali_Dargaha,Karthik Balasubramaniam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Friends,Moula Ali Dargah,This Dargah is situated on top of a tiny little hill also known by the same name Moula Ali Hill.The trek to the top of the hill is not really so tiring and enjoyble. Best time to climb the hill is during early morning or late evening. There is pretty much nothing much to do at the top except the Dargah. But the 360 degree view from the top of the hill of the surrounding area is something to look forward to after a decent trek(around 500+ steps) to the top of the hill.But what you are sure to be treated with is the peaceful and calm nature of this place which gives you a comforting soothing and relaxing sensation to your mind and body.

It is famous for Moula Ali hill on top of which a famous mosque (Moulali Darga) dedicated to Ali was built probably during era of Asif Jahi. The Moula Ali Dargah is one of the 11 heritage sites identified by “Heritage conservation committee” of HUDA. Maula-Ali is largely rocky with undulating terrain. However, presently it has become a major commercial hub. There is another hillock opposite the Moula Ali Hill, called ""Qadam -e- Rasul"" on which the sacred relices of the prophet were supposedly deposited by Mohammad Shakrullah Rahan a servant of Asaf Jahi. In addition to various mosques, Moula Ali also has lots of temples dedicated to Hindu Gods & Goddesses."
