Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,OMKAR PAGADALA,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Mount Opera,I have experienced an amazing climate and the place also very far away from city which helps a lot to keep our mind relax ..... One thing about this visit is that the ticket cost is too costly as far as my opinion is concerned.......

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,subbaraju m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Value for money,"For the amount they charge, its an excellent place. Water rides have wave pool, top down slides, rain dance. They have other machine rides like gaint wheel, columbus and many more. Our kids really enjoyed the kids park too. We have even gone for Zip line recently they have introduced on the hill top and its thrilling."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Ravula S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Worst place in hyderabad,"I don't even want to give one rating to this but it's not allowing me to write the review until and unless in gave rating. Written as ""Mount opera amusement park"" but it looks like a school play ground with one swimming pool. Chlorine water used in swimming and rain water. Restaurant looks like a jail where visitors should sit like a prisoners. Very poor maintenance. Don't visit the place and waste your money."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,dssrinivas2004,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,Overall Ok / Average Experience,"Visited it on 24th Dec and overall experience was good. To be honest the management have an staff especially their manager (Mr.Prasad) and executive manager (Mr.Prasad).+ve things as listed below:-----------------------------------1. Very friendly staff2. They go beyond their limits to make the customer happy3. Good food. Their lunch buffet and dinner buffet was great. At any cost, they don't compromise with the quality of the food.4. During the check-out time, even if u are late they will not push you (If they don't have any other waiting customer)5. Don't miss their camp fire. Nice experience in chilled weather. Just put a note to them well in advance that u want camp fire and rest of the things will be taken care by their staff.6. 100% secured and safe, which means family members can just walk-in with your kids.7. Kids will enjoy all their rides and water games-ve things are listed below:-----------------------------------1. The water pool games need lot of maintenance work.2. The rooms need lot of maintenance work.3. We are shocked to see a big lizard / frog in our room. Don't know how they happen to check-in out entry fee.. Just kidding... But the lizard and frog which we have seen are too scary.4. The water pools will be under maintenance activity during night hours and the sound is too much while pumping the water out. It will disturb you if u are a sensitive sleeper.Note:-.1 Last but not the least, I heard from the staff that they are under going with huge renovation during this coming summer. If it happens then it can be considered good.2. Keeping all the above mentioned -ve points, i am giving it as 3 rating"

The water rides are not that great and could be better maintained and improved. Back 4-5 years ago this use to be a good place for one day outing and also a tourist attraction.

The place which is known for its wave pool is now in a horrible condition. Maintenance is very bad. Not even worth a visit. A swimming pool near your home is far better than this.

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Krishna D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Short visit OK,Not a great place to enjoy the whole day but a half day during summer can be planned at this place.  Maintenance not really at par as they named it water world.  The cost of the entry is too high with less facilities.  Can be maintained well with better staff otherwise this will be no more attraction in the future time.  I'm sure It has no charisma to get back it's visitors second time.

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Shruti M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,,AVOID ,"     Not worth the money we spend on the tickets. 390/- entry+rides. Need to pay extra for the rides in the ""water park"". Poorly maintained park.     The water world is another story. None of us dared to enter the water.     The so called restaurants given in their website were nowhere in sight. Only one restaurant ""Dolphin"" was open. Unclean. No food available other than a non-veg biryani and it's vegetarian counterpart.      Toilets look bad enough from outside. The weather in Hyderabad and the poor quality of this park makes a horrible combination.      Though we intended to, there was no way could we spend a whole day there.       If you are expecting a world class theme park, you'll get disappointed. "

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Lyndonjohn P,1.0 of 5 bubbles,,Horrible place - badly maintained,"This is one of the worst place I've been to in hyderabad. I won't how they can even run a place like this. Do n't go by Internet pictures. Bad service,  DIRTY and total waste.Rides not safe or not working. Poor serviceBad foodDirty waterOverall bad idea to visit this place."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Mohammed R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,,Worst place , men and women have to share same locker facility and to add on for changing there is only a curtain which divides mens wash room and ladies changing room. No room freshers are used all you can smell is toilet and I was worried about the hygiene.  It's a really bad place to visit and you might end up in hospital for cheap maintenance of waves and slides.
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,DinakarKadali,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Family,Theme park with bad maintenance,"Most of the facilities in the theme park are not functional. few rides which are operational are giant wheel, and Mary go round.Food served in the restaurant is also not upto standard. the same menu is served for dinner and lunch."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Iknallev,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Family,Horrible Experience,"It was a family re-union after so many years and We just wanted a nice family time out for 8 of us (that include kids, grand parents) and my nephew suggested this place as he heard about it about two years back from a friend of his. It only took 15 min into the park for us to realise what a terrible choice we had made.As we bought tickets, they started explaining about mechanical rides and water rides and we were like ""dude, give us the map of the park"". And they don't have a map. And there were no directions/signs that suggest us where to go. I guess, I may be expecting out of this poorly maintained place (and they call this resort... What a crap?). Out of the four allowed mechanical rides, one is not working (tea cup ride, I guess) and the others are in very bad shape with rusted seats and handles and garbage all around. One ride we had a little fun was ""Columbus"" but there was not much safety as the operator does not care if everyone on the board is properly secured before he can start and even worse was that he was on cell phone through out the two min ride.It was only 30 min Into the park and we were like ""oh god, can you make our day any better?"". Then after asking the operator what to do next, we were hesitatingly on our way to the water rides. On our way we noticed ""Go Karts"" with only one working yet strangely looking car with an extra fee (fee for this junk?) to ride on it and the ride track was seriously a joke. Blaming our selves for seeing such a pathetic place, we entered into this ""Crocodile Tummy"", the entrance to the water rides. The inside of this tummy was totally in a mess with stones and garbage every where. Don't care if it was going through some repair but the visitors deserve a well maintained place or at the least some directions/signs indicating repairs.The first ride that greeted was the boat ride pond that was full of water weeds and dirty water. Not sure how anyone can dare to think of doing a boat ride on it. Then there were two water slides that were so aged and rusted clearly seen from far. And they were not running. Out of kids curiosity, when we asked the operator as why they were not running... we were told that they would open these rides half-an-hour later as the other water ride (wave pool) is open. And he suggested us to go and enjoy the wave pool ride. Really? We cannot even choose where to go first and have to go with the crowd as they suggest? The roof of the shade shed around these rides and the boat ride was torn apart and looked very ugly.And the wave pool... The statue of the man above and water running out of his mid-riff reminded the kids to visit the rest rooms :). To enter the wave pool, nylon costumes are a must... and well we didn't bring for any of the kids. Kids were like we didn't enjoy any ride so far, let's enjoy at least this one. Then were told we could rent the nylon clothes for Rs. 100. Not bad, we said ... And guess what, the guy inside has a black garbage bag I front of him and any size we ask, he had to bury his inside to dig a matching swim suit and if it does not match what we ask then he has to put it back in and dig again. ""Dumbo! Why cannot you arrange them on the hangers per size and that will your and our life easy?""... Crazy! Anyway, there were only about 10/15 suites and all of them are for teen to adult size... too big for our kids aged 8 & 10. Kids were disappointed for not able to make into this one at least. And that's it.... It was just about an hour into the park (please, don't call this a resort, that's insane to make people fall for this crap)... and we were out of here. Then we went to Lumbini Park, which was far far better than this dumb Mount Opera and the entrance fee was 20 times less. We should have read the reviews before we visited.Mount Opera is ridiculously ill-maintained place and it is a crude joke to call this a multi theme park and even a resort. It is such a shame on the management to collect high fees but ignore the basic maintenance, cleanliness and safety. Total waste of money and the time."

For a day outing in Hyderabad,"I liked the place a lot, but I would agree to others that it seriously needs a renovation. Many rides are rusted and looks risky. But, when you have a good group of friends to enjoy, you can surely visit this place. It should be one of the cheapest outing."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Usha K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Family,Stay away! avoid like plague,"Beware! Stay away from this place. I visited this place on Feb 24,2103. & We did not even to dare to get into water rides, the water was stinky & stagnant. The rides - you can get these at a local fair, nothing great. The rest/wash rooms are a nightmare. The go karting cars were so badly maintained, I felt as if I was driving an Auto. Ditto with bumping cars. There is NOTone single thing I liked about this place. It ruined the day for our family. Infact, we got out of that place in 3 hours and went to JalVihar from there(which was comparatively a great place). The management does not seem to care about the maintanence of this place. Avoid like plague!!"
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,PKrishnaV,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2013 • Friends,Excellent place to njoy with family/friends,"I went to this place with my team. It was very good place with lot of mechanical/water rides. There is a restaurant, rain dance and wave pool. wave pool is operated only in particular times for 30 mins. you can either take nylon pool dress or can rent one. The rent cost was ok. I didn't taste in the restaurant  but the prices look normal. Only thing is you have to walk a lot for rides and it can be exhausting to walk on a hot day. So make sure you go on a cloudy day nd u can njoy a lot :)"

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Srinivas Kintali,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,New year bash,"Five of our friends went to the resort on new year day.We went through Snap deal coupon which was quite beneficial(300 fee+ 39 snap deal)Food, mechanical rides, water rides, waves in water pool are part of this deal. Everything was quite amusing and entertaining.We enjoyed from 11.30 in the morning till 6.30 in the evening. The environment is quite good with lots of locations where you can take a lot of snaps. The mechanical rides with make sounds but you will still enjoy them overall.Go karting is not very economical(90 Rs for 3 small laps), other paid ride(dashing cars) has got only 3 cars (30 Rs for 3 mins) but you will enjoy it.There is a facility to avail swim clothes at a cost of 20 RS but you have an option to wear your own ones, provided they are nylon.Lockers are hardly available to store your valuable items, so take some small locks with you so that you  yourself can lock your cabinets there.Overall it was a great day for us. Hope this helps."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,anilkundra,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Business,"Mount Opera - Dirty, unclean and callous staff and unsafe","I had taken 300 students to Mount Opera and right from dealing with the ticketing staff it was just a callous behaviour with no one bothering. The entrance is dirty, the entrance roof falling and except the security staff, none appears to be doing his job well. Every ride is in bad shape and the operators so rude with children, its un-imaginable.Since most rides are included in the entry fee, the operators feel they are giving free rides. We had to force them to start rides and their language foul and abusive. I doubt if the safety is monitored regularly ever by any one.Every place is neglected and dirty including the so called restuarent.The water games are so dirty with the entrance to them never having being swept for ages.Flooring in wave pool is broken and the water very unclean n dirty. The changing rooms do not exist and the clothing never cleaned n torn.I think the GHMC and tourism department should check its unclean facility and with draw its licence."

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Dr.I.S.Prasad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2011 • Family,Serene,I visited this place many times and stayed there over night on two occasions. It is located away from the city on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada highway on a hillock on the other side of Ramoji Film City.View is scenic and one should opt for the east facing rooms to enjoy the sunrise on the vast open land scape with negligible vegetation/construction.The main attraction in the theme park is the pool with sea wave simulation.
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,ItzAlok,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2012 • Family,Good options but...,"Went to Mount Opera with family. The place offers large amount of entertaining options for kids and adults. The water section is also very nice. My only concern is the large number of people that share the wave section, makes it a bit ""unhygienic"".All in all, apart from the small factor mentioned above, I think its OK place to spend time with family."

The place was not maintained at all, and stinks like a dump yard. 70 to 80% of the rides did not work, and whatever was working, was in a very bad shape. Swimming pool was full of algae and water appeared to be very dirty. We did not dare venture into the water. The place was full of mosquitoes, and we had skin rashes due to mosquito bites. The staff and manager were very rude when we complained about the lack of maintenance, and they were threatening us with dire consequences. We could not stay for more than one hour and returned thoroughly disappointed not only about the wasteful expenditure and also about a spoilt holiday. Please do not visit this place. There are sevral other better places in Hyderabad.Mohan"

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,THEROAMINGSAM,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2012 • Family,The Cool Picnic,"The Place is away from the city, lying in a serene area. The Resort is located on top of a mountain giving an overview of the City of Hyderabad. Night time the view from the Top is beautiful with all the glittering lights of Hyderabad City. To enjoy there is a water park with all types of games. If you want to spend some quite time with your spouse, you can sit on the green grass on the top, and enjoy. A lovely romantic place."

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,krishnamentreddi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2012,Excellent place to relax,This is a excellent theme park. It has enough rides to fill a day. Summer is the best time to visit this place. Kids would enjoy it alot especially. I think they have added more rides and watersports from last year. I would recommend to visit at least once. They also have resorts for interested people.
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Hisandy,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2011,Pathetic maintenance,"I strongly advice people to avoid this water park.  The infrastructure is crumbling,  rusted iron everywhere.  Water is not at all hygenic.  Went with family and was disappointed to have chosen this place as weekend getaway."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Poornima M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2011,Mount Opera with Friends,"Mount Opera is good, but it is little difficult to climb up the hill, Once we are up, you will definitely enjoy the rides, Rain dance and Go Karting."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,digitalldreamzz,2.0 of 5 bubbles,,a dull theme park,"maintenance took a back stage at this resort. none of the rides are maintained properly. nothing new is added since starting of the resort, we can definitely not consider this as a visiting place."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,udaypilani,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Dont bother if you are looking for anything resembling a great park,People create some monstrosity and pass it off as a theme park. The very essence is missing most of the time
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Nipun T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,A theme park,"Mount Opera, a Multii theme park as the name prescribes its on a Mount I have never visited any there park on a steep mountain.The Giant wheels, columbous and other rides enlarges your breathes as you are above the ground level by virtue.Well engineered on the mountain the only USP...No new rides and special attraction. If you never have been to theme park consider visiting it..... 30 Kms of excess travel."

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,nagasathya2000,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,positives & negatives on Mount Opera,It s to be not just as good as I heard about it. too strict rules and regulations just to cash. and no interesting rides. good for only shootings but if u go with family need to have fun for what you pay. it is indian mentlaity.  they are not allowing kids to play more in water hardly giving only 1 hour and not changing the water frequently also. If they are concerned more about the health of the visitors they should frequently change the water.
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,satsuv,1.0 of 5 bubbles,,Ripped off,"The water park is horrendous. Algae growing in the paddle pool. Most of the fixtures were rusted and had paint peeling off. Smell of sewage prevalent in the water park. Won't be surprised if we get sick after our visit. Children's park had many of the rides not working and broken. Restaurant was horrible. Worst was the smell of sewage totally present everywhere. Wave pool was a joke. AC in the room was not working right, Staff tried to be helpful - there is only so much you can do when the environment sucks. Lockers were in bad shape. Stray dogs roaming in the resort. One of them was taking a nap by the swimming pool."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,skmathur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Good Hospitality,"It was a great experiance. Children had a fantastic time enjoyed the thrilling rides specially the bungy jumping, slambob and the merry cups. Water slides and the waves were exciting. Food was tasty and value for money. Overall experiance was Good."
Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,Vishal J,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2010,Waste of money,If you are fascinated with the pictures shown in web for mount opera then you are trapped. Mount Opera is worst place to visit. On the name of rides they will provide you only two or three rides. Inside the park buffet provided was taste less and unhygenic. Even there is no good sght seeing. So in conclusion to visit Mount Opera is total waste of money and time.

Mount_Opera_Multi_Theme_Park_Resort,idiot_kissu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Fabulous Hospitality and lots of fun,"This place is one of my favorite place in Hyderabad. We had lots of fun here when we went for the office outing. The place is kool and the day we went there was somewhat cloudy which made this place the coolest one.As soon as we reached there, we got welcome drink and light snacks and not only that we got sweat in the AC room after that bcoz we danced a lot as they arranged DJ there itself. Then we wanted to have some rest.. so we played Thambola there.. tickets and the game board was provided by them. That was really good however I lost 100 rs twice. After that we went for some Amusement rides which were small but good. Then we were tired and hungry. We had our lunch which was really tasty. After that we went for the water rides and enjoyed all the rides many times till evening. Now we were tired and wanted to have some rest. We had tea and some snacks near the pool and then we were rushed back to home as it was getting dark. Overall a very good fun we had that day. Regarding Entry tickets and other info, you can contact mount opera guys directly. The contact numbers can be found @http://www.mountopera.com/contact.htmlThe hospitality was very good and they arranged whatever we wanted according to our convenience. We had enough amusement rides and water rides."
