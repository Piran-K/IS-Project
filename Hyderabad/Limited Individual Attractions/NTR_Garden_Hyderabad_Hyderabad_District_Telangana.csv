This park is geographically situated in heart of the city, and in close vicinity of other tourist destinations of Twin cities as such Necklace road, Lumbini Park and Birla Mandir. This property is maintained by the Buddha Purnima Project authority an arm of State Government.In ester years it was well maintained with flora and fauna, but now due to heavy influx of public, the carpet lawns are not up to the mark. Precisely, this property is having number of rides which is spoiling the tranquility. Few rides may be discontinued though it is revenue generating to maintain the spirit of Garden to provide some peaceful environment in Garden.Because it is having vast area about 30 plus acres of land, there is every scope to develop much more better to attract more tourists than present  volume. And, few rides and shows are very poor in quality needs review of concern authorities as public certainly feel under value while comparing with the fee what they paid and quality of ride. "
