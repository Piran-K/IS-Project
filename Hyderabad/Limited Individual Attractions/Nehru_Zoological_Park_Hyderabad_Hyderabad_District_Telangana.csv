Nehru_Zoological_Park,Saurabh M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Hyderabad zoo......,"Exploring Telangana...... Hyderabad.....at Zoo....Located at a distance of 16 km from Hyderabad, Nehru Zoological Park was opened to the public in the year of 1963. It is situated near the historically important Mir Alam Tank, which is 200 year old and is the first multi-arch masonry dam in the world. Nehru Zoological Park is one of the largest zoos of India . Run by the Forest department, Government of Telangana, the zoo has been named after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country........What makes Hyderabad zoo an amiable place for both visitors and inhabitants are the open enclosures in which animals are kept. These open enclosures have been created to resemble the natural habitats. A wide variety of exotic animals have been successfully bred in this zoo park as well.There is electric car which is very helpful......"
Nehru_Zoological_Park,SPillai,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Quite similar to other zoos,A large area with a number of animal and bird varieties. But maintenance and upkeep leaves a lot to be desired. Visitor amenities can also be improved significantly.
Nehru_Zoological_Park,OctOriental,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Must visit these beautiful creatures,"The Nehru Zoological Park could be better organised. Outside the main gate it is a bit too chaotic and noisy and dusty with broken roads but that's Hyderabad. The zoo could have done with more logical signposts to different enclosures so that we don't miss a single creature. The safari rides last 15 minutes but give you a good look at lions, tigers, bisons. Lots of schoolkids on their school-organised visits lend to the nice feel of the place. Most commonly known wild animals are here. Must visit."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Global-Bhatakanti,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,Avoid weekend for zoo visit,"Suggested time: Min 2 hours to max 5 hours.You can buy some basic snack and food items inside zoo. There are battery vehicles with ₹100 per person charge, but not of much use as you have to get down at every halt whether or not you want to. Also on weekends there is long queue for ticket and battery vehicle."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Gurus49,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Largest Zoo in India,One cannot believe such a place can exist within a city. It is nicely laid out and the animals seem to be in their natural environment. 
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Mitalee2012,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Wonderful early morning winter experience,"Got to see the whole gamut of wild animals enjoying the winter sun. It's best to go early (at 8:30-9am) when the animals are up and about as they tend to retire for the afternoon.Specially enjoyed the nocturnal animal den and snake pits. TPro tip: if you want to enjoy the Safari, take the hop-on/hop-off tickets and get down at the Safari stop (3rd stop after the elephant stop), as it is a LONG walk and difficult to get back to, especially with children. The toy train was also pleasant and enjoyable."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Deepali G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2020,Very good place..,good zoo..well maintained..try to take food on your own..there are lots of varieties...cycling is also available..but try to go early ..
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Mainak_Choudhuri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,"Good zoo, but a little disappointing in Covid times","This was my second time visit to the zoo to show my kid. Found that the safaris as well as the Reptile House and Nocturnal Animal house are closed. Got disappointed a bit.They have a cheetah exhibit, a large deer and emu exhibit, and a large elephant exhibit. Other animals worth note are lion, tiger, white tiger, wolf, fox, jackal, gaur, hippo, rhino, ostrich, two types of bear, giraffe, sambar, blackbuck, white deer and crocodiles. There are some walk in aviaries, but entry now restricted due to Covid situation. Did not see any large apes, but seen a few small monkeys. All animals are kept in natural settings, though sometimes a little small.There are battery cars which are hop-on hop-off types, excellent to traverse the zoo, though still it takes much walking. The toy train starts only after a minimum number of passengers. It is possible to walk the entire length, there is a major circular path and small inner walkways.There is a refundable Rs. 10 per bottle  deposit to take plastic bottles inside."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Lesley,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,Good for 3-4 Hours with Children,"Entry ticket with 60Rs per head. You can find animals like white tiger, tiger, lion, elephants, hippopotamus, rhinoceros and many wild animals. There's a highly priced canteen inside selling chat items and briyani. Have 3-4 water bottles during your visit. By the time we visited, safari ride was not there, which would take you inside the forest with freely roaming animals. Worth to go if you are going as a family with children as they would enjoy the park and the animals. For a gang of friends, you would start feeling devastated by this visit."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Scarlet Fernandes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,"Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad","Spent a beautiful day at the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad. At first sight I spotted very few animals and was disappointed. But the safari visit inside the park was fantastic. Young and old, all will enjoy it. The deer enclosures, the birds and the butterfly park is amazing     Need to have some more well fed animals in the park. I admire the staff for their love and caring nature towards these animals."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Krishna Sandeep Siram,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Good Recreation place,This place is Good but too expensive and mostly you will see deers and some rare species of different animals.For Lion and Tiger you have to take another Safari ride in Bus.
Nehru_Zoological_Park,wjw2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,"Very spacious grounds, plenty of walking!","Once you get past the 'no plastics' security patrol, who will confiscate any plastic bags or make you get your water bottle stamped for a 10 Rs deposit, you're free to enter this zoo (tickets cost 50 Rs)...and WHAT a huge zoo it is! There are not a massive amount of animals but the ones that are there looked to be in a reasonable condition and had food and water, though the cages for the birds didn't have any greenery in them which was sad. For those who don't like walking too much, there are various transport options like a train and some small golf cart trailers who'll take you around  for a small charge. Also, halfway round the zoo there's a bus that you can board, for an extra 50 Rs, to take you on a mini 'safari' where you can see lions, a tiger and some bears. I was saddened to see them in cages though....the area of the safari would be big enough for them to roam free, but they've been contained in featureless enclosures which is sad. Outside of this, there's a lot of imagination shown, with tunnels and fossil parks and all sorts. It does make for a good day out, but there could be some improvement with more seating and some restaurants and water points. Overall, pretty good, though a bit more foliage in the bird cages would be kinder for them, plus more staff presence to stop people whistling and harassing the animals is definitely needed."

So that we can go around the zoo park easily. It's a lovely zoo park. There are many visitors come here in holidays from several parts of India. There are wide varieties of wild animals that include while tiger, white peacocks and very big size in macaws ( Similar to parrots but large in size). There is an exclusive fish aquarium too with a separate entrance ticket. You can also rent bicycles for an hour or so. The bicycles must be checked before taking for rent. Overall its a great experience with little kids."

It's clean I don't like the safari trip animal was always hiding.you need at least 3 to 4 hours to see all.

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Farook Uddin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,One of the biggest Zoo Park. A good outing with family and friends. which you will love.,"Spreads over 380 acres of land, the zoo is managed by the Forest Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Don't Carry polythene bags, bedsheets, knifes. They are not allowed. Reach early to buy tickets you won't get it online and especially on weekends there is huge crowd and long queues. I would suggest better visit on weekdays if you want peace. :-) "

Nehru_Zoological_Park,rggg,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,One of the best in India!! ,"I love going to Zoos. I have been to atleast 10 different zoos in India and abroad. I have seen high standards of zoos and safaris in Singapore, London and Bangkok and super pathetic standards of Indian zoos like jaipur, ahmedabad and crowning glory of patheticism.. Mumbai zoo where animals are caged in small iron boxes. Compared to all these... I found Hyderabad zoo much much better. It's spacious, animals looked fresh and relatively happy... They have been tried to be given their natural habitat. As with all Indian zoos... It's super cheap with ticket under 100 Rs. Golf cart tickets are extra but it's OK. It's a good service that they have provided. Please buy a ticket for golf cart if you don't want to walk too much as space is humongous. Frequency of golf carts were reasonable. I especially liked the enclosures for elephants.. They have been given huge space. I didn't try the safari bus so won't be able to comment on it but I have seen this facility only in Hyderabad zoo of all Indian zoos. Ice cream, cool drinks and some snacks are available inside the zoo but no proper restaurent. All in all i'd recommend going to this place if you like going to zoos and watching animals like Rhinos and Giraffe."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Debasis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Big zoo,This is a very big zoo. Actually we got surprised by the sheer hugeness of the zoo. Quite well maintained and lot of varities of animals are there.

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Madhu Kishore,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,Huge zoo but nothing great,"Its a huge zoo for sure but the count of animals is less. The elephant enclosure is huge with only 3-5 elephants and they are so far that you can hardly see them. There are different species of deer and bears.The people who went to the safari told that no animals are visible to we skipped that. The reptile section is good. There is a train which you can take which will leave you at drop points to explore the place. There are a lot of birds including hens.But overall we were disappointed with count of animals.Please carry food as the cafeteria has limited options such as pau bhaji , puffs , corn and cool drinks. And “No plastic”. Its more of a place to enjoy the greenery, sit and relax and have fun."

It may take you around 4 hours. The aquarium needs to be well maintained. The have a natural history museum, fossil park, safari. The safari is not a must-do thing since the tour is in a closed bus. Do take their battery operated vehicle for 70 rupees per person if you have an elder traveling with you. "

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Arun Karthik,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Many animals in one place,"Also called as Hyderabad Zoo, Nehru Zoological Park was established in the year 1959 but it was only in 1963 when it got opened for public. A must-visit for animal lovers, this zoo houses around 250 species of fauna. All the animals are kept in surroundings similar to their natural atmosphere. Spanning across an area of 300 acres, it has species of Indian rhino, Bengal tiger, Indian elephant, python, panther, Asiatic lion, gaur, antelopes, deer, Himalayan Black Bear and number of birds as its inmates. A number of animals from zoo across the country have been brought here showcasing the variety of wildlife it inhabitants.Few added attractions for children and visitors include Natural History Museum, Toy Train, Aquarium, Butterfly Park, Jurassic Park, and Children’s Park. It happens to be the first zoo that started off with the idea of Safari Park and successfully established the Lion Safari Park. This park has been extended to a Safari complex also including Bear Safari, Tiger Safari, and Bison Safari. Proper eating amenities are provided for visitors including a multi-cuisine food court, canteen,dairy parlour and bakery.Moreover, Mir Alam Tank that is situated next to this zoological park draws a number of people due to boating activity conducted by the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Department."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,beyondtravel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Vast and variant,"Went on coincidence on lions day, we're awed by the variety of animals, birds, sections such as carnivores, elephant, aves, reptiles, herbivore including rhino, giraffe and hippo , butterfly, nocturnal, bisons, deers etc. But saw 1 lion only. Overall it's a great place and takes 4-5 hours to cover on weekends, located close to city. The park is well maintained with toy train, battery operated hop on cars, and ample animals to see especially if you have kids with you or if you are first timer. However inadequate signages make you  walk a lot, stand in slow and unorganized ques etc. The safari is a total time waste considering tigers are caged. Food options are too limited, better to carry own food. Do visit as a tick in box if you stay at Hyderabad"

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Prashanth,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Avoid weekends if you have a choice,It was a good visit to the Zoo. My son loved and we could spot most of the animals. He had a great time. Now coming to the bad parts of the visit - We went on Sunday which is the most busy day for the park.So as expected it was very crowded. We wanted to rent a personal cart but after standing in the line for 1 hour I was told they dont have any available I have to do the sharing cart. But they gave a personal cart to the guy who did not even stand in the line as he had a connection with some hid ranked departments. The guys driving the carts had such an arrogant attitude that most of the people riding it could feel it and had lot of altercations with them.Other than that we had a great visit and could show so many animals to my son.

PATHETIC MAINTENANCE,"The zoo opens at 8:30am and the staff comes at 10am that means all the animals will be inside the night shelters and nothing to see,  they should either shift the opening timings to 10am or the staff should come to the zoo an hour earlier than the open timings clean the zoo, animals and open all the enclosures. Worst maintenance."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Ravindra V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Zoo,"It is one of the largest and top zoos in India. There are many exhibits inside the park. Some of the famous ones are reptiles, nocturnal animals, turtles etc. There is Lion Safari but it will be very crowded. Instead try the toy train. There is good variety of wild animals and birds. Plastic is not allowed but your own is allowed. Bring your food in steel containers so that you do not face any problem at the entrance. All those items which are not allowed can be kept in locker."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,krajeevc,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Must visit for families with kids,"This zoo is one of the best in India.You have buggy services to drop/hop you to 5 points each of which covers a significant portion of zoo.There is a seperate lion safari bus ride and a train  ride.The rest rooms are not up to the mark and need to be upgraded. Food / Canteen facilities are good and reasonably priced. One needs to spend 4-5 hrs at least to cover the entire zoo.If you do not want to explore on foot and get overly tiered, use the buggy service or rental cycles. Keep hydrated throughout. This Zoo is worth visiting."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,TravelEnthusiast,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Nehru Zoological Park - One of the best Zoo Parks in South India,"The trip to Nehru Zoological Park is amzing especially when you go with your friends, family and loved ones. You can reach out to here in public transport or Ola / Uber or any other cab. Its a nice zoo park perfectly maintained and organized. It has way boards, maps and directions. You can also take bycicles and buggies. You can take any of them based on your requirement. You can enjoy the trip with so much ease. This saves lot of time, effort and energy.You will find lot of people from Andhra, Telangana and many other states too. The best way I found is to take a ticket at the entrance for buggy. You will enjoy the trip. There are good canteens also in the zoo park. You can buy popcorn 🍿, Samosa and ice creams. There are many animals that you will find interesting and curios to know the facts if you carefully read about them.Overall its a nice place to enjoy the trip."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,NIL_MODI,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Explore Nature With Animals,"Superb Place. Must attend. Huge collections of animals birds, insect , reptiles etc...One should be ready to get tired if want to explore on feet. Big round enough to make you tired. keep drinking water and energy drink. Enough greenery to protect you from sunlight. They also provide electric car service on charge basis which will show the whole park. give enough intervals at fixed points to explore the life of animals. best option for who wants to round the park without getting tired."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Peter V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,Superb cultural experience,"I had a free Sunday in Hyderabad and decided to visit the Zoo. I was pleasantly surprised by the space the animals have: I saw some beautiful albino tigers, elephants, giraffes, tropical birds, etc... What I did not know is that I was going to be the only tourist (ie. white male) in the entire Zoo; so I became the attraction. Families with kids wanted to take pictures with me which was somewhat unexpected. Oh and the other funny thing about my visit is that the most popular animals in the Zoo were the deer! I was barely interested, but the locals were all lining up to see deer."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,sophiarnd,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Birding at the zoo,As there are lots of trees and the zoo holds a huge area we went for birding. Have to reach early but the zoo isn’t open then so have to just do with late morning birds high up in the big trees. Good place to visit
Nehru_Zoological_Park,GoWrong,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Best Zoo,"The thing which impresses you the most about this place is upkeep and maintenance.

Nehru_Zoological_Park,nik c,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Very pleasant way to spend a day,"Nehru Zoological Park is a very pleasant place to spend a day.   The park is well laid out with easy access to the exhibits.    The gardens are well maintained and there is a train ride for the kids (even the grown up kids).   There is a safari park ""tour"" and a ""Natural History Museum"" at the park, but I wouldn't bother with either of these as they were both VERY disappointing.   Overall it was a very nice visit and you could easily spend a day there."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Rakesh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Business,Can spend a whole day,"Dont Rush your day by planning half day zoo tour, I suggest anyone to allocate whole day here. if possible, one routine suggestion i would like to give here, Plan it on weekdays (except on closing day- Monday i guess), because when we went there on Sunday, its totally Crowd, and you may not like it, people bring mats and water cans then eat food on lawns.if you are a pack of 10 or so, then you can book a resting room or retiring room also, you can google for that info.Coming to imp part, never miss lions, tigers and lot of animals like giraffe, also white tigers.Most importantly follow the path guided by them, because you may end of moving in the zoo walking extra without watching all animals. Zoo is very very bigHave fun. Enjoy your trip"
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Ashish S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Business,Excellent Park,This park was Excellent and was very well maintained. This park was very organized and neat. It was also not very busy.

Nehru_Zoological_Park,Suresh1976,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Excellent place to visit with kids,"We had visited this place in Dec. we had a wonderful time in this zoo and my kids enjoyed a lot. This zoo is very big, has lot of animals and different types of birds, reptiles, small fish aquarium.Animals like Cheetah, leopard, tiger, wolf, jackal, hyena, elephants, giraffe, ostrich, we found lots of deer. They have kept different types of birds, peacocks etc. in reptiles we have seen some crocodiles and different types of snakes.It is nicely maintained and it is very clean. Before the entrance there is the proper checking where staff don’t allow anyone to carry plastic bags inside the zoo. After the entrance you will find a mini van service which is quite good if you have old age people with you or if your kids are very small who cannot walk long distance. Zoo is spread in the vast area where you need to walk a long distance to cover all the animals.After the entrance there is toy train also. Ticket is very reasonable. Rs 20 for adult and Rs.10 for child. I advise you to take this toy train, kids will enjoy a lot. It covers the complete zoo area in 25 mins.There is Safari service also but we skipped it because of lot of rush. So better go early so that you don’t miss this safari service.You will not find much eateries inside. You will find ample drinking water and public toilets inside the zoo at various places.You will require full day to enjoy complete zoo but we spent 4 hours and skipped some of the places.We had a wonderful time in this zoo."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Mandar Jetly,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Excellent zoo,Wide variety of animals - Safari took more time in queue - go for AC bus if you have money as there was no queue - Reach early - you can miss Aquarium - There should be more supervision in area of Nocturnal animal & snake encounters as Peaple make crowd and push each other.Overall worth visit if you like animals.If you are strong and young do not take battery operated vehicle.
Nehru_Zoological_Park,manikantaa,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Good,Very lot of people are there in this zoo park I very enjoyable in this so many of animals are there good tq
Nehru_Zoological_Park,vinodkhedkar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Excellent Zoo,"This is the perhaps best zoo in India. Situated in Hyderabad city, this is a must see place. We had a wonderful time especially my kid enjoyed this place. Spread across the acres of land this zoo inhibits various types of bird,reptiles and animals.This is a journey to the jungle.Staff is prompt and cleanliness in maintained. Lion safari is a highlight of this zoo. You need an entire day to see this place and enjoy it thoroughly. Definitely visiting this place again during next visit to Hyderabad."

Nehru_Zoological_Park,anonymous8808,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,ok ok,pro1. big zoo2. kid enjoy itcons:1. toilet very smelly can smell it from walkway2. animal is not that many. like for elephant only saw 3 and girraffe only 13. no baby room
Nehru_Zoological_Park,explorer india,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,A big but not the best zoo of India.,"Its a big zoo housing lot of Indian, Asian  and African species of animals in big enclosures including Indian Lions , African Lion , Indian tiger , White Tiger , Cheetah , Leopard, Hippo , Rhino , Elephant , Jirrafe , Crocodile etc... Its a huge trail walking , so one can hire bicycle inside or take a battery cart hop on hop off ride for extra cost. The zoo overall is not that hygenic and the animal enclsures often smell foul. So be sure to carry your hand sanitiser also. Overall the children enjoy seeing so many animals at one place but the place reaaly needs to be better maintained."
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Baburajnair,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Awesome ,Could find some rare animals here. Well maintained. Bit crowded during holidays. Better to visit during winter. Can spend a day easily here. Safari is also there. Galapagose tortoise is a main attraction. 
Nehru_Zoological_Park,Sandeep Bhojani,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,The Place is Good but can be planned better..,"The authorities are good in terms of maintaining things but we had been on a sunday that too in christmas vacation, so it was very crowded. It is difficult to find few locations of the animals although you can see them in them in the Map on the main road. As when you move inside from the main road there are very few guiding maps who would suggest you the way. Toilets are pay and use and there is additional fee for aquarium, noctrunal animals, fossil mueseum etc. A good place to visit but avoid on public holidays and summer hot days as need to walk a lot if u want to explore all the animals, as the electric car and the mini train would not offer you sights of important animals like lion, tiger etc"
