Next_Galleria_Mall,Vikas Singh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Poor food court. Many outlets still to open up,The only positive about this mall is that it is never too crowded even though it is next to the metro station.

For me, Delhi/NCR malls are so much larger, better in terms of International Brands and multi cuisine world class restaurants. The Galleria Mall is well located in the upmarket Banjara Hills. No problem about parking and no queues at the movie hall ans no waiting to get into a restaurant. The Big Bazar has facility for baggage drop for travellers who do not have to lug around with their bags. A nice experience overall."

Also it has all the major anchor stores like Shoppers Stop, Pantaloons, Big Baazar and a huge multiplex ""PVR Playhouse"". I also like their food court which is the best in terms of sheer variety of food outlets. Other than the food court they have a coffee shop on the ground floor ""Cafe Coffee Day"" and fast food outlets like Pizza hut, KFC, Mamu, Norfest dhaba on the 4 th floor next to the multiplex. There is also a Japanese store ""Miniso"" on the basement floor and a Korean outlet right next to the entrance from the metro.
