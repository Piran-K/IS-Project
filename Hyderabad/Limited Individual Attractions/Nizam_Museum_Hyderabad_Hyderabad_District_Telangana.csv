Nizam_Museum,Andrew D,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Subpar,"While there are many items on exhibit here, the only one that truly stands out to me is the long wardrobe as it is said the king would never wear the same clothes twice!There are some interesting diamonds, but the rest are more for nizam enthusiasts and historians."
Nizam_Museum,Hazzz M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Couples,Quirky and historic collection,"This small and unkempt old palace is 125 rupees for foreigners and consists of four rooms, full of bizarre and intimate memorabilia of the Nizams. Though there is only a couple of more grand  items, there are hundreds of treasures of this strange collision of local Royalty and the Colonial Raj. We found the collection fascinating, well labels and well worth a long slow look and read through, what is a unique historic collection. Well worth a look for its insight into Indian history"
Nizam_Museum,Ravindra V,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Some good collection but not many,Low stars primarily for a couple of reasons1. High ticket price2. Not well maintained. Atleast the building3. No food optionsThe good part is it has some good collections of the last Sultan of Nizams. Like the large wardrobe collection. The museum is located in Purani Haveli premises where most of it is used as a school. You cannot of course visit the school premises. Only photography is allowed with a ticket price of 150 rs but no videography.
Nizam_Museum,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,The first palace of the Nizams,"Photography is allowed on payment of Rs.150. Entrance ticket costs Rs.125. The museum is badly maintained are rarely visited by tourists. The exhibits are interesting and you can easily spend 3-4 hours here. Masarrat Mahal It was constructed for third Nizam Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III by his father Ali Khan Bahadur, Asaf Jah II. The main building resembles 18th-century European palaces. A unique feature of this palace is the world's longest wardrobe, built in two levels with a hand-cranked wooden elevator in place. This occupies the entire length of one wing of the palace.Sikander Jah lived here for some time and later shifted to Chowmahalla Palace. Due to this, these buildings were also called Purani Haveli. The sixth and seventh Nizams were born at this palace, and did spend a part of their life at this palace."
Nizam_Museum,Christopher F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2021 • Solo,Pleasantly Surprised,I gave this museum five stars only because I was lucky enough to get a one on one with one of the staff. The tour was unexpected but the staff saw that I was very interested in the articles being exhibited so they reached out and asked me if I would like a tour and of course I agreed. The museum was small and was in need of some TLC but it had some very interesting objects. What interested me the most we’re all the gifts that the local ruler received from both his subjects￼ and visiting dignitaries. They were so many objects made of both gold and silver I was truly amazed I had no idea that it such a small museum could hold so many precious objects. The Museum was part of a one time palace the palace has the worlds longest wardrobe/closet recognized by the Guinness book of world records. I found that interesting. It was a small museum that will take you no more than 3540 minutes to go through thoroughly but like I said I enjoyed it because I receive that one on one with a tour guide. I am not sure but if you ask you might be able to enjoy that too.
Nizam_Museum,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Rare collection but expensive tickets,"We had visited the Nizam Museum which is located within a km of the more popular Salar Jung Museum during our sightseeing in Hyderabad. Original residence of the Nizam's has been converted into a museum. This place is not well maintained but entrance tickets are very expensive being priced at 100 rupees per person and another 150 rupees for photography. Inside we saw 4 galleries showcasing artifacts made out of silver, gold, ivory, diamond etc. We also saw a room full of giant wooden cupboard. "
Nizam_Museum,Talent P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,a glimpse into the lives of Nizams,"Located in the Purani Haveli, Nizam's Museum is a place worth visiting. Boasting of a rich collection of memoirs, gifts, souvenirs from all over the world"
Nizam_Museum,Oneil,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Shabby & filthy,No clear signages for reaching this place. The area was full of filth & garbage. Free guide employed by them. However a tip was welcome !!! Glass cabinets were filthy & stained. These were sealed with a paper glued on the wooden frame. Purpose unclear.
Nizam_Museum,AbhiMone,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,It's a repetition,If you have visited salarjung musuem then you can avoid this . Most of it is duplication and can be completed in 1 hr
Nizam_Museum,jainms,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Ok,"Museum is not maintained well, however can find old monuments and ok to visit once to see what is there inside."
Nizam_Museum,TravelbuggIndia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Nizam Museum,Nizam Museum showcases the splendour of the time when Nawabs rules Hyderabad. This place is now neglected and has not been maintained properly.
Nizam_Museum,NIL_MODI,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,not worth to spend time,its ok. not worth to watch. just a collection of various gifts received by Nizam. not properly maintained. better to spend time somewhere else.
Nizam_Museum,Balakuntalam S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Do Not Waste Your Time!,"Visited the museum on January 20, 2020. The maintenance of the premises is moderately good.The exhibits are highly underwhelming. Most of them were gifts from various governmental departments to the Nizam during visits. Most of them have very little artistic or historical value. One walks through a hall lined with empty cabinets that were supposed to hold costumes and royal attire. Even lights are not switched on to illuminate the displays.The untold story is more interesting - of countless artifacts either stolen or sold off as contraband. What has remained in this museum is leftover of leftovers.Your time is better spent at Chowmahalla and Salar Jung Museum, just a short distance away. You get much better return for your money (lower admission fee) and time."
Nizam_Museum,SundarRam54,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Interesting Museum,"The museum show cases the Nizam Rulers’ times. There are beautiful silverware, wardrobe and so on.There is mechanical lift which can be manually operated. If you interested to know how the city grew during Nizam era there are maps showing city as it was at various periods of time. There is a decent Wash room and adequate parking in premises."
Nizam_Museum,namanpatel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Stunning is the word !!!,"Super awesome tour of the museum. the artifacts, sculptures, ivory articles and the most stunning was the beautiful marble structures especially the of the begum of whoever was it. longest wardrobe was unbelievable, also gold and silver ware gifted to nizam."
Nizam_Museum,Sounak Poddar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Royal,"As a child I have always loved roaming around the Museums, maybe because of the smell, which carries thousands of stories, or maybe because of the armoury division, which used to attract me a lot.  and now it is more of aa tour to the past. The past rich history of our country, evolution and everything that can be witnessed inside these walls, mesmerises me ."
Nizam_Museum,Bhuparyatak14,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Don't take the guides!,"For me, the place is OKAY to visit, not a must see. Most of the displays are the gifts received by the Nizam, Osman Ali Khan, on the silver jubilee of his coronation. Very few things are there which they actually used for their daily purposes. I hoped to find some of them there, but was disappointed. The wardrobe and the lift are interesting though. The one thing I would like to recommend that DON'T TAKE THOSE GUIDES. They are useless! They will only describe the things which are already written below the displays, they don't know any extra information and you will find you are spending Rs. 150 for nothing!"
Nizam_Museum,Ananta Gorai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Must visit to observe the golden glory of India,"Precious metals like gold, silver sculptures and precious stone are preserved well. Must see place. Bringing a camera will cost a 500/- . Much more for foreigners."
Nizam_Museum,ShelleyKulle,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Business,The Nizam's Wardrobe is a must see!,"Throughly enjoyed all the displays and seeing the Nizam's 124 almirah (closet) wardrobe!  It's a small museum, but an afternoon well spent.  If you're going to take pictures, even with a phone make sure you buy a ticket first.  The guards will ask you for it in every room and they'll yell at you if you try to take pics without buying the camera ticket.  "
Nizam_Museum,AdityaGhatage,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Not worth a visit ,A very showy place but not much substance or theme . Would not recommend if you have only two to three days to spend in the city . Chowmalla plus salarjung in that order would be sufficient 
Nizam_Museum,SRIKAKOLAPU,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,nice,This is one of the cultural heritage musuem to know about the kings of hyderabad.It displays many items of that time.Guides are available
Nizam_Museum,SSDNY,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Interesting Collection,Museum is all about life styles of Nizams which seems to very lavished. Ivory Museum was very interesting to see how even the chairs were made from Ivory. Nizams seems to have love for European culture. Must visit when in Hydrabad.
Nizam_Museum,hock c,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,DO visit,Very interesting even if it has most certainly seen much more glorious times ! The Nizam's walk- in wardrobe 'complex' is a must !
Nizam_Museum,Ordubadli,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Business,Ok Museum,"Showing the collections of Nizam Family. Showing how much money they had - and bought things without much attention, or taste - they seemed to buy just about everything that they could. I felt they just didn't know where and how to spend their money. Also, there are hundreds of pictures of the founder of the museum along the walls - towards the end I was getting nauseous just by seeing his picture"
Nizam_Museum,Suhail Siddqui,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Hyderabad Royal Wealth !!!,"Privately maintained and hence the ticket entry is 100 per head. Guide tour is extra 150 for group.Interesting facts to learn and see about this museum on Gold Throne, biggest wardrobe of nizams, silver miniature of monuments and host of other features.Do visit to know the facts."
Nizam_Museum,Fahim_Khan_13,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Nizam's One Day Gifts Collection Museum !!!,"Locating this place is bit hard, the google map it took us to the right building but the entrance gate is somewhere else, hence please remember there is this hospital (Durru Shehvar Hospital) Lane, use it for the landmark to reach to this place entry gate, Now coming to the Museum, it is small museum but good one, take a guide they are standing at the entrance, they give demonstration of each & every thing, in nominal fees. The guide explained to us all these things which were hundreds & thousands in number full of silver, gold, ruby & precious stones, they were one day gift items to the Nizam,All the things were fabulous & taking guide was a good decision, as he explained all the things properly, Also the big huge Nizam Closet was amazing."
Nizam_Museum,Shabd,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Wealth redefined here,"The Nizam's were known for their wealth and still are. This is one of the few properties which continues to be owned by their trust and is a must see. The amazing car collections, the rooms for the tax collectors, the small souvenir shop, the gardens, the durbar - each one of them makes it unique despite the loot & plunder it has undergone.  "
Nizam_Museum,73prashantha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Business,Nothing interesting,Not so interesting. If you have a good taste for Hyderabad's history there are many other places around to visit. 
Nizam_Museum,Pradeep A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Nizam’s articals,It is situated in very diplated  building. Nizam’s gold and silver gifted items are displayed here which are very precious and above all one long ward robe and manual lift is worth seeing
Nizam_Museum,anshu119,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Hidden Gem,"Though not as popular as the Salar Jung Museum, this one is definitely worth visiting. It houses a selection of finest gifts and artifacts either received or collected by the Nizam's family. It is very interesting to see small scaled models of dams, universities etc. in silver to commemorate the part played  by the Nizam's in their commissioning. It also includes a working model of a lift from some 200 years back as well as a huge wardrobe. It would be good if better care is taken of the entire museum and in particular the wardrobe which is very dimly illuminated."
Nizam_Museum,Sarika N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,A museum and a wardrobe,Nizam museum houses the gifts received by the Nizam during celebrations. Quite interesting. It also a very very large walk-in wardrobe. It is quite something!

Nizam_Museum,Laxmikant P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Nizam personnal museum,"Museum is nice museum with so many Nizams Gift exhibits. The Nizam Museum is located in the Purani Haveli complex near the Charminar and is a very short distance away from the more famous Salar Jung Museum. The Nizam Museum is suffering from lack of maintenance. Owned privately by the Nizam's family, unlike the government-owned Salar Jung museum."
Nizam_Museum,ArdentTraveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Great museum but heartbreaking how they have let this go to waste,"A great collection of gifts that the nizam received for his silver jubilee coronation. And the worlds biggest walk in closet is a MUST SEE. But the place is so badly maintained. It's such a crying shame, "
Nizam_Museum,J Chand,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Nice museum,Nizam's museum is nice museum with so many exhibits. Take nearly an hour at least for visit. If want to see in detail atleast 2 to 3 hours are required. 
Nizam_Museum,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"A gem, only if better maintained","The Nizam Museum is located in the Purani Haveli complex near the Charminar and is a very short distance away from the more famous Salar Jung Museum. However, though the distance is not much, the difference in terms of organization and maintenance of the museums is staggeringly large.The Nizam Museum is suffering from lack of maintenance. Owned privately by the Nizam's family, unlike the government-owned Salar Jung museum, this museum levies a much higher entrance charge. There are also separate higher charges for cameras (including mobile phones).The museum is spread across 4-5 rooms. Most of the first 3 rooms contain gifts given to the Nizams, while the 4th room is the Hyderabad city museum, which contains details about the city's evolution. Photography is not allowed in this part, even if one has purchased a photo ticket, which struck me as being quite strange.The last room is the Nizam's wardrobe, which actually has replicas of clothes worn during the Nizam's time. The most noteworthy thing is the old manually-operated lift. This place can be a major attraction, if maintained well. The staff seemed disinterested and at times, actively sought tips from visitors, so one needs to be cautious."
Nizam_Museum,Rajesh_in,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,"Average Museum , needs better maintenance","After Visiting Salar Jung Museum , we visited Nizam's Museum , which was a let down , as it is not maintained the way it should be. The surroundings and premises are not maintained well. Inside of the museum is not air conditioned and I am not sure what impact it does to the antique items being preserved & displayed there. The museum , I believe , is maintained privately by Nizam's family & not he government , hence the entrance ticket price is also much higher.I hope this museum is maintained well & promoted well."
Nizam_Museum,SoniJose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Great,"Really worth to visit. Well arranged and preserved artifacts and collections, basic amenities are good."
Nizam_Museum,Alka Varma,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Nizam Museum,"Nizam Museum or popularly known as Purani Haveli, houses the most precious and fabulous collection of art and artefacts of the last Nizam. Infact all the precious gifts received on his silver jubilee celebrations are displayed here. You cannot reach the museum easily because of the accessibility through narrow bylanes. One can see hundreds of kids on its ground as part of it has been converted into a school. Unfortunately not many tourists visit here and thus not crowded. The museum has the golden wooden throne used for the silver jubilee celebrations, a golden tiffin box inlaid with diamonds and very precious daggers studded with diamonds , rubies and emeralds- all lie here in the display- which is not well maintained . Some of the objects lie in dusty almirahs crying for better lighting and display. The most unique thing here is a wardrobe of the 6th Nizam which is known to be the longest in the world and can hang 730 attires. It is well known that Nizam was very fond of dressing up. Then not to miss is a 150 year old manually operated wooden lift. Wish the European style building of the museum was better maintained. "
Nizam_Museum,jmodi1981,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Nice Museum,Very good Museum maintained on the name of Nizam.  One can visit and enjoy the place here with the family and friends.
Nizam_Museum,Desi_Gal_10,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Highlights are fun,"We had a brief visit to this museum. On display are hordes of treasures of the rich Nizams. We focused on 3 things which would interest our kids. 1. A diamond studded painting of a Nizam, whose foot seems to move and point in whatever direction one is standing2. A elevator/lift which was manually-operated by a winding mechanism3. Nizam's huge walk-in closet. If I remember right, it's probably among the biggest in the world."
Nizam_Museum,cbk2911,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Historical Collections,The building of museum is quite old and does not look like well maintained. Museum has a lot of collection of Nizam's gifts & other items. However the organisation of all items is not in good order.
Nizam_Museum,bharadwaj8008,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,historical collections,"A nice historic collection of all the things used by Nizam kings in their rule. The place is very big and minimum 8 hrs are required to see all of them in the museum. From books, dress, knifes to every thing used by nizams are nicely displayed. The special attractions in the museum are central clock and natural paintings."

Nizam_Museum,Schuyler T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,It's good to be King,It's basically a collection of a bunch of silver artifacts given to an old king.  You pay 80rps to pretty much get a glimpse of how rich this dude was.  You also walk through his closet which is insane because he never wore the same clothes twice.  There are some facts written on the walls where you can learn about the founding of civilization in the region and just how much everyone liked the guy.  There was a guide who offered his services for a donation.
Nizam_Museum,sudeshrele,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,Must for Every Indian interested in History,"Its a museum located in Purani Havelli, a palace of Nizam. It showcases gifts that Last Nizam of Hyderabad received on various occasions."

Nizam_Museum,Rayomand P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Worth a visit,This place is certainly worth a visit for having a look at the great jewellery collection. It is located in a bylane of the old city and is a 10 minute drive from Salar Jung museum. The only negative being that the building is not in a good condition and looks a bit scary. However considering you would not spend more than 30 minutes you could ignore this negative point.
Nizam_Museum,TrravvelIndia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Hidden Gems of Hyderabad.... Also has lots of gems,Please take a guided tour of the Nizam Museum. It has more than 400 kgs of gold and lots of other precious gifts that the Nizam received as a gift in a single day.A must visit.
Nizam_Museum,Sam S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,See the vintage cars of Nizam.,I wrote my bachelor's degree exams at the Princess Durrushehvar College and was fortunate to witness the stable housing the famous Rolls Royce and other vintage cars collection of the Nizam. It was superb to know the love of cars by the erstwhile rulers. I would recommend every car lover to visit it to learn to preserve the automobile owned by him/her or ancestors.
Nizam_Museum,Lalita T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Business,Place to learn more of the Hyderabadi Heritage,"Majestic place to visit and reminisce the ancient heritage of Hyderabad and the Nizami kings. Feels very educative to learn of various happenings pre and post independence.  The souvenirs and silver artifacts received by Osman Ali Khan, the last nizam is a sight of splendour. The hisorical happenings well etched and kept for public display in all columns of the rooms is quite informative.  The wardrobe section is in utter neglect with dripping rain water onto the cupboards and the carpets. The trust needs definitely needs more support to sustain itself, this being a private entity and funds are obtained from the visitor  tickets purchased and supposedly from the the grants of the former Nizami princess visiting this place from abroad at regular intervals to inspect its upkeep."

The collection basically comprises mementoes and gifts which were given to the last Nizam to mark a celebration of the silver jubilee. It is great place to go.
Nizam_Museum,menonCGN,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Nizam era in miniature models,"The largest and most valuable private museum! A must visit place for people who are interested in the history of Hyderabad. The exquisitely made artifacts and miniature models reveals the skill of the craftsmen of the era. But I am unable to understand why they charge for taking photographs. In my view the photos taken by the visitors, some of which may be published, adds to the fame of the place which will attract more visitors. I have been to Vatican Museum in Rome, one of the famous museums in the world, where they allow to photograph anything a visitor wants to.Though the exhibit's historical value and importance is indisputable, the premises is an eyesore! The compound was filled with filth and wild growth. One couldn't go near a washroom there as it was broken and leaky. I left the place feeling sorry and wondering when this place will be made attractive!"

Nizam_Museum,Payal G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Must visit,"This museum is not as aggressively promoted as the Salar Jung museum but is a bigger treasure trove of Nizam's valuables. If not for the gold and silver and a set of the world's largest Basra pearls go for the most unique wardrobe in the world - it's the largest one ever and several flats can be easily fit into it. The museum also houses a rare elevator (though tourists can't get into it). It's located in an old palace. If going by cab/uber watch out for signs as the GPS is misleading. Locals were generally unaware of this place so best to remember that it's just behind the children's hospital. The museum rooms are quite basic and can do with some sprucing up. Remember to take tickets for cameras at the entrance itself. However, the lighting inside is not conducive for photos so it can be skipped. Some of the staff are great guides - which we took as without the stories most of the fun is gone. Our guide Hyder Hussain was from a family of one of the Nizam's old retainers and hence was quite knowledgeable about the exhibits without being pushy. We paid around ₹200 to him."
Nizam_Museum,PrabalDas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,Better than Salar Jung Museum,You would have a glimpse of the lifestyle of the Nizams. The museum offers original replica (made of silver) of almost all the structures the Nizams made in Hyderabad. you can find many golden scissors used by the Nizams to inaugurate the Buildings including the Bowels & Masonry Trowels made of gold used in Foundation stone Lying ceremony. There are many more. It's a hidden treasure. Don't forget to take a guide (Rs. 100) who would explain u in detail.

The museum exhibits the gifts and mementos presented to the last Nizam on the occasion of the silver jubilee celebrations in 1937. A 1930 Rolls Royce, Packard and a Mark V Jaguar are among the vintage cars displayed. There is an interesting collection of models made in silver of all the prominent buildings of the city and citations in Urdu about H.E.H. Mir Osman Ali Khan, gold burnished wooden throne used for the silver jubilee celebrations, gold tiffin box inlaid with diamonds, and a gold model of Jubilee Pavilion."
Nizam_Museum,PK Das,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Poorly managed museum,Nizams were famous for their lavious lifestyle full of gold & diamonds whereas when you reach at this place after first glimpse you will forced to rethink whether the story of Nizams which read in books were true? Nevertheless once you enter you will confirm yourself that the story read was true ONLY. LOT of things made of GOLD & DIAMONDS on display.

Nizam_Museum,A P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Business,Visit to Nizam Museum,A visit to the Nizam Museum will take you to the colonial era where Nizams ruled with utmost respect from the British and also by the people of Hyderabad.  A must place to see the majestic of Nizams.  Lot of things to see.
Nizam_Museum,Rashmi Gersappa,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Gives a glimpse of Nizamshahi,"If time permits, one should definitely visit this museum. Although it's not an official museum of Hyderabad and is situated in an old haveli of the grandson of the last Nizam, the artifacts are truly awe-inspiring. Although they all belong to one person, mostly garnered during one ocassion, the silver-jubilee celebration, it is definitely an impressive collection. For example the golden lunchbox carried by the Nizam during hunting or the vast corridor that acted as the Nizam's wardrobe housing a dress for each of the days of the year, never to be repeated again. Do hire a guide on the spot for a good explanation!"
Nizam_Museum,Venkat_Mumbai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Nizam's Museum,"The Nizam’s Museum is situated within Purani Haveli, A part of this beautiful place has been converted into a museum that showcases gifts and mementos presented to Nizam.  It is not crowded.  There are guides who charge Rs 100., and brief in details on the collection. The  museum is not as big as Salar Jung museum. The entire museum can be covered in 30 minutes. Felt that the ticket is steeply priced as well as for cameras.  Personally i feel that much can be done.  The place feels off.  Our ola driver as well as certain localities with whom we enquired, redirected us to SalarJung Museum.  The Google Maps too shows a wrong location.If you search as PURANI HAVELI, the location is correct however, route map takes you to the back of the same."

The entire museum can be covered in 30-40 minutes.The ticket is priced at Rs:80 per adult which I believe is a bit expensive considering there are not many art collections. It is not crowded and you do have guides who charge you Rs:100. 
Nizam_Museum,RCR1000,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,History of Hyderabad in Nizam rule,An unofficial guide took us around & gave us a good perspective of the Nizam's rule. A small part of the Nizam's treasure is displayed as the major part is in Delhi. The visit was interesting - you need 1- 1 1/2 hours to visit. The lavish life style of the Nizam is exemplified by the multiple closet changing room!!
Nizam_Museum,PavalikaV,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Well maintained,This is surprisingly a well maintained place with Nizams collection in well categorized areas...but government can do better in terms of overall maintenance of the Purani Haveli and also provide better directions to and from main spots such as Charminar

Nizam_Museum,Rajesh k,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Luxurious private collection of the NIzams,"Nizam Museum is located in Purani Haveli which is the palace where the Nizams resided. This palace is now converted into a museum.  The items on displays in this museum are mostly the gifts presented to the Nizams and some of the luxury items used by them.  We saw daggers, cups, throne, ward robes, jewel box etc used by Nizams which were studded with diamonds and other precious stones.  Other attractive displays included glass inlay paintings and wooden throne polished with gold.  This place provides a lot of information on the Nizams who ruled Hyderabad for a considerable time and also about their luxurious life style."

Nizam_Museum,SundarRam54,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016,Good Museum of Nizam Era of Hyderabad,"The museum is housed in one of the 3 wings of this U-shaped building, called Purani Haveli. It was used by the Early Nizams whose successors later shifted to a New Palace and hence the name Purani Haveli. The museum has an entry fee of Rs80. The museum has very interesting photos and objects of art relating to Nizam Era. The museum also has maps showing the evolution of Hyderabad city over centuries. Highlights are Nizam's wardrobe room, Semi mechanical lift used by Nizams etc. The Museum needs better maintenance, since exhibits are quite valuable."
Nizam_Museum,Eapen T,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,What a useless place?,Poorly maintained. Should be completely scrapped. The fees charged is exorbitant when compared to Salar Jung. Nothing much to see also. Total waste of time. Do not go there even if someone offers a free visit.
