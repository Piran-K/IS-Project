Ocean_Park_India,CuriousTraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Its an awesome water sports experience.,I had been to Ocean Park several times. Every time its a great experience. We palnned to go early in the morning. So that we have more time to enjoy water sports. Its a great experience and also its a very fun place with lot of physical exercise. Because to slide in the water sports we have to climb 2 stairs. So it was lot of exercise for our body to climb. We enjoyed entire day. It is also a great exercise for us and lot of fun. We also enjoyed the ropeway but Water sliding is the best of all.
Ocean_Park_India,Rohit Bandil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Good park and worth of Money.,"I have went with my family, my mom, dad, brother and aunt and her daughter. I was confused between Wondala and this park before going. I was thinking this park wont be good and we wont be having much fun there. I would like to say this park is worth for the money and as I went with family this park was sufficient for them.Even most of ride here my family member could not able to do it because they got tired and ride was a bit difficult. It has numerous of water rides and I hope it will like everyone.We have enjoyed alot and at the end I thought it was a good decision to go there in a budget.It has difficult and easy water ridesI and non water ride too.  would suggest you to carry you own nylon(Swimming cloth) because they will charge 100rs for each person.It would be good if you go on a weekend or any festival time because you will get more people there after all fun will only come if people are more. Charges: Adult 450/- Child(More than 2.6 Inc.) 350/-Overall I would like to say It is good park and you will enjoy with your family."

Good place to hang out with family2. Alcohol is also available (so many advertising flex)3. 350/adult and 230/child below 4 ft 6"" 4. Water rides are cool which are free with rickets5. Paid rides like super loop and sky cabs, breakdance, etc also cool6. Food is also average not much expensive7. Prefer wearing polyester or nylon T-shirt m 3/4 then u don't need any costume which is compulsory for wave pool n few water rides.8. Out side food is not allowed but seem many people having their tiffin at park lawn.9. Garden for kids is really nice10 even adults can take advantage of that n reincarnate their childhood ;)11. Make sure u eat only after u take water rides else u might suffer from omitting 12. City cabs like ola uber take much more charges since this place is outside city limit so they charge heavily. Make sure this before u take a cab.13. U can directly take bus from mehdipatnam n same while returning14. Locker and mobile deposit facility is available15. Drinking water (tap) available there is not trustworthy so get ur own or buy one such."

Ocean_Park_India,Ravi_Prithyani,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Average Experience!!,"Ocean Park is good for those who want to enjoy both water park and amusement park. However, if you are only looking for water park Jalvihar is better option. Ocean park is too messy when it comes to lockers and change room and most of the showers would not work. The food is average and not worth the price. The entry ticket only includes water park charges and for amusement park you have to pay for each ride, though the price is economic for these rides."

Ocean_Park_India,rkkoya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,Good Outing,Ocean Park is good for water sports lovers. It can be reached by all modes of transport. Has good parking space too.
Ocean_Park_India,Nishant Ujjwal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Average Park with average cleanliness and average rides. ,Don't expect too much from this water park. It got basic rides only and all are not working some are under maintenance always. Their are only two waterparks in hyderabad one is jalvihar and the second one is ocean Park. This is better than jalvihar. If you have been to some very good water parks than this will be disappointing for you.  cleanliness is not their.  Mainly school crowd will be their. Toilets  and changing rooms are in very pathetic and unhygienic condition. Some rides are also their you can also enjoy them. All over its an average water park if you don't have anything to do on weekend and you are waterpark freak than you can pay a visit otherwise I will not suggest. The ticket cost is 350 rupees per head excluding locker charges costume charges. You can take your own costumes but they should be of nylon only. Word of caution is that always  take sufficient cash over their with you as that place is in isolated location and no ATM is their within 5Km of area. Moreover the ocean Park authorities are not accepting any card only cash.  I didn't understood what is this stupidity. 
Ocean_Park_India,Harshith358,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Biggest Water Park of the City,This park is located in the outskirts of the city. This park is full of fun and water rides. Its a heaven for the children. Its one of the best parks in hyderabad

Though the maintenance is not at par excellence, the park is okay with a budget price :) This is a good place to spend a summer day - thanks to that water slides, rain dance floor and pools."
Ocean_Park_India,mahesh k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Solo,The best water park in HYD,"This place is little far from Hyderabad.

Ocean_Park_India,Kashyap Kocherlakota,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Family,Not so Great!,"This place, I shall say was once upon a time a sensation. every child's dream to enjoy those water sports and rides. But as time passed, they stop its maintenance and it lost all its charm. I'm disappointed."
Ocean_Park_India,vishal n,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,It kind of needs renovation.,I visited this place once but was disappointed when reached there. Not a single good ride and water rides were just ok. Not a good experience at all.
Ocean_Park_India,Juweria B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,Very nice place to play in water,It was very nice but some maintainence should also be there other than this every thing was very nice. Especially I like the rain dance which was very awsm I like that the most

Ocean_Park_India,madabushi,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,"IN bad shape:Good facility for kids and excellent water sports, but needs real total manitenance","Ocean park as we visited 10 years back was far better and clean Than now.   Now some of the rides are not working.   Overall There needs to be a good maintenance schedule, lest the whole park will be lost with no visitors or by the curse of the visitors.Water in the pool needs to be cleaned.   As at entry itself ticket cost is slightly more, many rides are free inside.  There are some more ride and shows with charges, But did not venture in to them.   Bumping car was ok, especially kids will enjoy very much.  Wave pool is  fine as it was before, and enjoyable.  Kids enjoyed well.   no food is permitted to carry  inside. Food and snacks and hot and cool drinks are available inside for purchase Some pf them are ok.Better to go on weekdays to avoid overcrowd."
Ocean_Park_India,urenig,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Very crowded,"Very very crowded during summer and not maintained well. The locker room n bathrooms are not that good, neither is the food canteen. Since it is away from the city not much option of eating anywhere else esp. when u are spending the entire day! The water games are kind of OK."
Ocean_Park_India,Purandhar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Friends,Good,Nice place but they need to work on there maintenance. The wave pool has a lot of dead flies in the water. The water slides are really fun. I recommend going on a weekday if you can as it is less crowded. The food is average. The last thing I say is if you are under 5 feet there are very few rides you can do.
Ocean_Park_India,Syed Ahmed Nizami,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,""" Hangout @ Ocean Park ""","Visited with Friends for an day outing due to hot temperature, it was an amazing experience  with cool water in the pool with waves and different water rides and dry rides. Charges are also moderate"
Ocean_Park_India,testingtest1,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Pathetic place. Please avoid,"Poor pathetic place. Do yourself a favor and avoid going here. Very basic park. Amenities are horrible. They call it as a water park but so little water. And its so dirty. Also the worst crowd I have ever seen. Rides are in a pathetic condition.,food available inside is ok. Would not risk taking children and getting some infections. Too many mosquitoes. Cannot even stand in a place for 10 second. Don't go. You have been clearly informed."
Ocean_Park_India,rajvchins,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Good outing for a weekend,"I went there on a Saturday afternoon about 3 - 3.30 pm ... Overall experience was very good. My expectation was not quite much other than hoping water will be clean. The slides 6-7 of them are amazing fun although you can do them only twice as much. Overall park is clean and water is also clean. Only not very good part of the ladies and kids pool only but fortunately it's a solo area so men cannot really complain about that. There was food around the area, kids naked and diapers around but that didn't throw the experience off since my wife only went there and immediately came back. They can do some more work on the changing area too.The best part is the rides are there are all free and easily you can get them on it without waiting which makes it worth after a day in the pool."
Ocean_Park_India,Robin A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Fun with some group,Good to visit in scoring sun to get relief in water rides.Can be good with group of families or for team outing.Nice hang out place. Music and food is good.
Ocean_Park_India,sanjay v,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,beat the heat for sure,"I know there are very few options near Hyderabad where you can actually beat the heat and Ocean park is still playing the same role. I firstly visited the place 6 years back and heard a lot of negative things since then so couldn't dare to go again but last weekend I somehow convinced my family to give it a try and can you imagine.....we were not able to cover all the facilities because we left pool very late. Wave pool was just amazing and they are still maintaining it so guys don't think much and give it a try and I'm sure you will be amazed. However don't expect much on food part but still there are lot of options to try like South Indian, packaged food. I personally suggest not to try Chinese as it tasted bad with lot of oil so try Dosas, Idli etc.Below point may help you more to decide1: Its just 12 KM from Gachibowly OOR circle so very near to visit and better to reach by 11 AM as you will get ample amount of time to enjoy the wave pool.2: Waves are active for 3 times a day and timings are displayed there so be there to enjoy the amazing waves. I call it best family day so kids also enjoy upto fullest3: Entry fee is 250 for adult and 230 for kid below 4 feet. I believe this is the least entry fee with almost all free water slides/rides. You may have to pay extra for bumping car.......yes you can enjoy bumping cars and more. We enjoyed a lot on colliding on bumping cars.4: Better to come out of the pool by 5:00 PM so you get extra time to roam there while sunset and capture some memories. Good greenery at entry gate and near cafeteria.5: Clean water to enjoy the pool and you can rent the arm bands and swimming rings. However balls are not allowed to play inside to protect others safetyHowever its very old water park of Hyderabad but still maintained. I could see just 1 ride not working which is possible anywhere. I still rate it higher because we have very less options like this.Hit like if I helped a bit in deciding a good weekend. Happy summers :)"
Ocean_Park_India,tricksee2,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,"Good for team outings, but not amazingly awesome","I didn't have as much fun with friends as I was expecting to, but I'd say worth a visit. Anything you buy inside is slightly on the expensive side, but it has some decent water sports.I'd say it's better to go with officemates and colleagues on team outings for a few hours, it is designed to be fun that way. I wouldn't visit again on my own budget, but it is worth a one time see."
Ocean_Park_India,Aditya_Banerjee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Decent amusement option for the family,Ocean Park is a decent place to hangout with your family. This park has a wide variety of water games. People of all age groups can enjoy the rides.

Ocean_Park_India,knrmak,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Family,Nice place to hang over for whole day with family & friends,"Good place to go as group with family and friends. Have both water rides and dry rides.Charges are also moderate. 350 for adults & 200 for kids. Charges are as per height.Food is also available and is OK (don't expect much).Swim costumes are available on rent and they charge Rs.100.There are some small shops outside the park who sell the swim wear for mens for Rs.80/-, so better to buy instead of renting in the park."

Ocean_Park_India,rkirans,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2013,Not so great place. But worth a visit.,The water rides are good and has variety. But the pool is not large like jalvihar. The food quality needs to be looked at. Given that location is far from city. Also some of non water rides r not working properly.
Ocean_Park_India,anushree lahoti,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 • Business,perfect for 4-5 hours of fun and frolic :),"I had taken my office staff for picnic to ocean park. The water rides were thrilling enough ... the water was maintained well (if u see ocean park from the outside, u wont have much expectations before stepping in :P ).. the land/dry rides do not function at all ! hence, one is limited to only water rides. it is fun if u go with a big group... :) the shower dance plays great music....and the dolby sound is also good.. the wave pool was fun! overall, this place is recommended.. do not expect high fi stuff (like wonderla).. hence costumes are given on rent. they are clean and nice.. the changing room is just basic. although the ocean park gives u a old world feel, it still works for people looking for some fun... the food is okayish!! carry extra money inside, since there are carnival games like, shoot the darts, bungee jump, ride the bull, cricket etc which is not included in the park entry."

Ocean_Park_India,Sree1972,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2012,Nice water rides but costly and horrible food,The water rides in ocean park are very good. The area meant only for women is absolutely fantastic. The water falling from the water bucket is a thrilling experience. We have visited many theme parks but this is special bcoz it is one of the earliest theme parks in Hyderabad. The circle ride is awesome as at one point of time we are upside down. The other rides are also good but now their condition needs to be revamped. The food within the premises is costly and horrible in taste. We had to survive on packed foods like chips etc.
Ocean_Park_India,RohitDassani,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2012 • Couples,Dont waste your money,The place is old and most of the rides are under maintenance. Most of the rides are for small kids and there is little for adults. The water rides are ok but the whole setup is shabby. Most of the staff are always on break or plug-in mode. There us very little on the foods menu. The worst part is the changing area. The bathroom are really bad and smells sick. Please do not go there and waste your precious money.
