There is a park at the destination, which has actually no view of the lake. Though there are lawns and trees and playgrounds for kids, but as the scenic beauty is completely confined within big nets, we didn't like the place much. After a short breakfast, we chose to move out and started walking beside the path of the lake. After few minutes we reached at another park and this time its better. We had lunch and played on the lawn. Kids enjoyed playing with ducks and hens. Had a beautiful view of sunset. As the day ends, we started to packup.Overall, had a nice day outing with friends. Recommend for one time visit."

There is a very nominal entry ticket and a pretty big building on the side. The lake looked ideal for boating but we couldn't see any boats around. Serene surroundings compared to the city bustle.

Osman_Sagar_Lake,85Mohan,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,Losing its sheen day by day,"Years ago, this used to be a picnic spot. Because of urbanization and less rains, the area has become dry. Finally, this is one of the two places from where Hyderabad receives water. So, I have high regards for this area. Today we see this place as spot for college students to bunk and enjoy."
