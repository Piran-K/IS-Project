Paigah_Tombs,Fernweh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Don't miss this beautiful art when in Hyderabad,"This place is very beautiful. The art in lime and mortar is sadly neglected and forgotten. The navigation to this place can be a bit difficult but once you reach the area near the tombs, locals will help you. Google Maps worked for me. Also, one can book uber or ola till here. The place is safe for solo visitors, the elderly, or couples. I visited this place alone and as a solo female visitor, I felt very safe. A family stays nearby and they willingly tell the place's history. Its high time that this place is protected and restored. A visit to Hyderabad is incomplete if this place is missed."
Paigah_Tombs,Christopher F,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Solo,Located in a dangerous neighborhood. I do not recommend for solo or couple’s.,"The first thing that I want to say is that this historical site is located in a very poor and what appeared to be a very dangerous neighborhood. The road leading to the site is a dirt road and not properly displayed on the Uber drives GPS. The Uber driver asked me if I wanted to walk the 100 additional meters to the site but the neighborhood looked dangerous enough that I requested he both drive me to the front and wait until I exited the site. I was hounded by young men as soon as I left the Uber for tours and for money and the young man what time to tell me the tourist we’re not safe in the neighborhood. Long story short I took a quick look at the site got back in the Uber and left immediately. I would not recommend the side to any of my friends nor family and if they decided to go I would recommend that they take as many people as possible as not to be alone. As most if not all historic sites in Hyderabad this one is poorly maintained too. The cobblestone sidewalks are all loose and uneven, the grass and greenery is overgrown and trash all over. All that being said the tombs were beautiful and intricately carved"
Paigah_Tombs,53Ruta_R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,difficult to find,"It is easy to get lost finding Paigah Tombs as they are located in a maze of alleys. Blink and you could miss the entrance as it is hidden behind a tree on a quiet street. Once found, and you enter, a different world is present. The lime and mortar tombs are over 200 years old."
Paigah_Tombs,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Don't come back without visiting this architectural jewel.,"The word Paigah, which means pomp and rank in Persian, was a title given by the second Nizam of Hyderabad to Nawab Abul Fateh Taig Jung Bahadur, founder of the Paigah family. Fiercely loyal to the Nizams, the powerful Paigah nobility maintained their own private army and the local police and courts had no jurisdiction over them or their property. Their necropolis in Hyderabad has intricate stucco work, reminiscent of the World heritage sites of Alhambra palace in Granada and Alcazar palace in Seville, SpainThe tombs are enclosed in carved screens and canopies of lime and mortar. The stucco reliefs closely resemble Byzantine art while the Moorish influences can be seen on arabesques details stucco reliefs and the domes. These tombs represent an eclectic mix of the Mughal, Persian, Moorish, Byzantine, Rajasthani and Deccani style of architecture which are unparalleled in India. Ornate trellises, beautifully carved pillars intricate lattice work and embellished domes surround the mini mausoleums. Some of the tombs are enclosed in Chaukhandis entered through ornate wooden doors made of mahogany, teak or rosewood. Entry is free and so is photography. Plan to spend at least two hours if you want to fully appreciate the architecture. Most tourists are not even aware of this gem and hence you may find yourself to be the only tourist here!"
Paigah_Tombs,Susmith S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Explore,Well worth a visit if you like archaeology and Islamic architecture and art. It's a little difficult to access as you would have to go into a residential area. Lot of locales have not been there so you can tell it's not too popular.

Paigah_Tombs,Dona E,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Worth a visit,"The site has been a little neglected, but definitely worth a visit.As soon as we arrived the caretaker came to greet us, showed us around the sites and explained the history. My recommendation is to make sure you're wearing long skirt/pants. We didn't know about this, so couldn't enter the cemetery - only ovserve from the entrance."

Paigah_Tombs,Ashok Kumar M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Story of Apathy and Neglect !!,"These beautifully and intricately carved monuments are a very sad story of neglect and apathy by the Archaeological Survey of India and the State Governments. No entrance fee. Scarcity of visitors. Situated in the dense residential area about 4 kms from Charminar they are difficult to locate in absence of proper sign boards. But the parking on the road in front of the gate is no problem. only the caretaker is there to tell something.The photos published on TA could be misleading as they do not indicate a bit the extent of deterioration and depletion in absence of maintenance and care they deserve. Felt very sad. However, the place is  worth visiting and should not be missed in Hyderabad. Suggest to read the review on TA by OneLifeFewClicks before visitng Paigah Tombs."
Paigah_Tombs,venkatakarthik,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,tough to find as most people dont know where it exists xpt for locals,this is the most toughest places to find in hyderabad as most hyderabadi's dont know how to get there xcept for local so grab a local guide to get to this beautifully crafted stone tombs
Paigah_Tombs,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"Surprising gem, not the easiest place to reach though","The Paigah Tombs are a place, that is really hard to reach and one can easily get lost trying to find them. Located in a crowded residential area, I missed it entirely the first time and stumbled on to it accidentally, the second time. There are hardly any signs to it and the entrance too is hardly conspicuous.Entrance to the complex is free. It contains tombs of the Paigah nobles, who were the Nizam's closest confidants and were the only ones, whi intermarried with members of the Nizam's family. Unlike the simple tombs of the Nizams, the Paigah tombs are architecturally vivid. A number of floral motifs and decorations adorn many of these tombs, which belong to the noblemen, their wives and children.Maintenance of the complex is a concern and lighting is another one. The tombs have, in many places, been left to the mercy of the elements and encroachment by the residents nearby is a threat. Charging a fee for its maintenance is the first step towards reviving this important piece of heritage, before it disappears."
Paigah_Tombs,blani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Just missed it,"Nobody at travel desk new about Paigah Tombs so we asked at Falaknuma Palace and they told the way the our driver. After we saw the sign he stopped at nearest mosque that was surrounded with old tombs saying this is it. But the tombs were not maintained, people living between, we were disappointed. It was late that we realised that we should still follow the road to get to the tombs. So next time..."
Paigah_Tombs,travelswithali,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,Afternoon visit,We hired a driver to take us to these tombs as I had read about them and thought they would be worth a look.  Its a very restricted entrance the driver had to ask for directions on how to enter.  We were the only three people visiting here.  Very quiet and peaceful.  Had a lovely tour by the 19yr old caretaker.  He said he was third generation of caretakers and seemed very proud of his position.  They are fascinating tombs very intricate in design.  I'm not sure how much longer these will last as they look very derelict in places with walls crumbling around us.  There was no entrance fee which seemed strange and also no box to put in any donation.  I did give the young boy something as it looked like he was living in squalor.  
Paigah_Tombs,James Du,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,Pleasant surprise for a photographer,"Unlike the other landmarks in Hyderbad, this place was not crowded at all and offers great tranquility to walk around. Try to go during time for sunset when the light cast great shadows through exquisitely detained screen stone panels."
Paigah_Tombs,chasteboy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,Good Tombs,I have been to this place twice. This place is very seclusive and many of us don't visit it. But these are very good and architecturally built tomb's built across large landscape.
Paigah_Tombs,Sameermd617,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Paigah tomb,It's a worth visiting place. Architects designs are amazing here. This tombs explains well about Islamic religion. Photographers would love this place. It's free to visit the place. One must visit and experience the beautiful designs.
Paigah_Tombs,Meera Rags,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Solo,Outstanding architecture ,What can I say ... absolutely brilliant architecture and history ... it's such a pity we don't do more about such place to maintain and upgrade for tourists 
Paigah_Tombs,OneLifeFewClicks,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Paigah Tombs – An Architectural Masterpiece,"Paigah Tombs or Maqhbara Shams al-Umara are one of the famous monuments of Hyderabad city which are known for their excellent architectural beauty.Paigah Tombs were constructed by the Paigah family, who were very close and extreme loyals of the Nizams of Hyderabad. Their loyality towards Nizams and later matrimonial alliances with them made Paigahs very influential during 18th century. 'Shams al-Umara’ was a title which was given to Paigahs by Nizams which means 'the sun amongst the masses'.Abdul Fateh Khan Tegh Jung was the first who was buried in 1786 at the place which later became the family Maqbara built as later generations of the members of their families were also burried there.There are 27 tombs in the main complex; rest of the tombs of the family is just outside it.Paigah and their love for Art & Architecture:The Paigahs were the great patrons of arts and have made several palaces including Falaknuma Palace. Their love for art is seen even in their exquisite tombs. The Paigah tombs are example of Indo-Islamic architecture, with a mix of both the Asaf Jahi and the Rajputana styles of architecture. The décor in fabulous stucco work, represents the Mughal, Persian and Deccan style too. The tombs are in the shape of “Chaukhandis” with latticed panels but open to sky. (Chaukhandi – A dome like structure on 4 pillars The crypts are made of lime and mortar and have intricate marble inlay work and stucco.The surrounding beautiful structure of walls has latticed panels with geometrical and floral design. The geometrical designs in the Paigah Tombs are unique and are perforated with screens with great craftsmanship. The Tomb of Asman Jah and Begum Khurshid Jah attract maximum number of tourists. The structures are made of marble and were once adorned with precious and semi-precious stones which changed colours with the change of seasons. The Tombs are enclosed by a wall which is ornamented with lattice work and exotic floral and geometric designs. Each wall is done up differently with fruits, drums, serpents, flowers, vases, etc.The mausoleums have exemplary craftsmanship, utilizing elaborate canopies and marble fences done in trellis-work that are made up of geometric and floral designs. Arches fringed by smaller semi-circular arches–a feature unique to India–are also employed. Another interesting point of the place is that all the tombs have unique designs carved on them differently.  Travelers Note:The architectural beauty of the place makes it a must-see place for tourists. This place is dazzling sight for someone who is visiting this place first time in case you are from Hyderabad. The serene and peaceful place will compel you to slow down, pause and reflect on the grandeur of the bygone times.The magnificent tombs and its intricate designs are a delight for photographers. Student and people involved in architecture may find this place very interesting in terms of design and one never know what inspirations this might give you.At first sight the place looks deserted and somewhat ignored. Although there is a family staying there and taking care of it but this architectural wonder is now more than 200 years old and demanding a better care and some restoration work from our side.You can visit these tombs on all days, except on Fridays. To visit Paigah tombs, the timings are from 10 am to 5 pm.There is no entry fee to this place, but the care taker is also a very warm person and guides you around and shares some info, in expectation of some ""fees"". This is open to your discretion. The pointer on the Google maps is accurate, so do not be confused by the unassuming entrance. There is a small signboard too, that should help identify the place.Footwear is to be left outside the elevated platform of the tombs, so if it’s mid-day when you reach a pair of socks should be useful in summers as the stones get quite warm.You would ideally need about 45 to 60 minutes to soak in this place, photographers and architecture students may need more based on their levels of interest."
Paigah_Tombs,JeddaCath,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Wow a MUST SEE,"Amazing architecture and details in these ancient tombs, as if centuries of mysteries are hidden in the symbols.  There are native Hyderabadis who have never been to this place.  The only reason I found out about this place and visited it was because of pictures I had seen on Instagram.  This is absolutely a must see place if you are interested in history and architecture.  Shame on local authorities for the neglect they have left this place in.  Only one caretaker who was not even there during my visit.  No guides no information.  Just letting it run in ruins. "
Paigah_Tombs,kenyansalsa,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Intricate and ornate work but in ruins,An incredible piece of history is slowly wasting away here as the buildings and tombs have fallen into disrepair due to neglect. Well worth visiting even still.
Paigah_Tombs,bamcdonald,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,Aristocrats' tombs in Hyderabad,"These are murderously difficult to find, even with LONELY PLANET'S excellent directions.  The aristocratic supporters of the Nizams of Hyderabad are buried here, and it's a quiet, nice place with some splendid architecture.  It's very near the Owassai Hospital.  Even my taxi driver had to ask for directions several times, but the tombs ARE worth a visit--very quiet after the mad noisy traffic a few hundred yards away!"
Paigah_Tombs,krishna p,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Business,7 tombs,This is the burial ground of king Nizam's family who ruled Hyderabad and this place is also known as 7 tombs and this is near to tolichowki and this only historical place and well known for hyderabad muslims 
Paigah_Tombs,Doblecapicua,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,One of my favorite places on the city,"We spent hours here. Taking pictures, it's a very old and photogenic city. It mixes together the old times with the new ones. Besides there's a house, so you can see the everyday life of locals along this memorial. It's an excellent example of Mughal and Moorish arquitectural style. "
Paigah_Tombs,adil983,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,A Hidden Gem,"This resting place of the erstwhile Paigah nobles of Hyderabad is a hidden gem.  It is a complex of a number of simple small tombs of the respective noble families intricately carved in marble and plaster.  While some of it has been damaged or maybe even vandalized through sheer neglect, there is enough even today to appreciate the artistry of the workers.  Anywhere else in the world it would be a major tourist attraction."
Paigah_Tombs,iyq.eda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Couples,A great surprise,"Difficult to find (even for a local taxi driver), the place is calm and not visited by tourist. Elaborate limestone geometry of the windows."
Paigah_Tombs,RachngG,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,must see for beautiful stucco and marble work....,"The tombs have been recently rediscovered as beautiful art works , and are  relatively unknown to most people. hence rather unspoilt too. That also means they are in need of restoration..!! Tombs of the Paigah nobles, who served the nizams for many generations besides being the only family the Nizams married into....these are a pleasant mix of rajasthani, Mughal and deccani architecture...Jaali work in marble, inlay work in marble, beautiful wooden carved doors, rajasthani arches, stucco work in all its delicate glory, pillar designs inspired by Grecian pillars.... a must see for those who appreciate art in stone ..even if yet unrestored !"

Paigah_Tombs,pc_bengaluru,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,"splendid architecture, hidden gem","This place is not on regular tourist circuit of Hyderabad; even cab drivers do not know about this place. However, it is worth a visit for anyone interested in architecture. Several different styles (Islam, Hindu and even Roman) can be seen in various structures here. Begging for maintenance and restoration, some of the structures seem to be fast crumbling. The caretaker of this monument (an old gentleman) would show around the place and explain the intricacies with much passion and interest."
Paigah_Tombs,KandyG8,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015,Monument not well maintained,History needs to be preserved properly. This is a good place but with poor maintenance. Renovation and a bit publicity can attract more customers.

Paigah_Tombs,plan41,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Couples,Paigah Royal Tombs,"Paigahs were very respected and close relatives of the Nizams - the Asaf Jahi Rulers of Hyderabad. They were noble men whose families got integrated with the Nizams' families through matrimony. The title of ""Paigah"" - signifying exclusivity and closeness in relationship with the Rulers - was first conferred by the Second Nizam of Hyderabad on these men of high integrity, discipline and commitment to peace, while also being good warriors. There are about 27 Royal Tombs in these premises which are located within an area of one acre, approachable closely from the main highway leading to the Shamshabad International Airport of Hyderabad City opposite a location known as Owaisi Hospital. The architecture of these tombs, their entrance doors and compound walls is unique and rare. There are several beautiful motifs latticed in marble and limestone imported from Rajasthan and are a delight to watch in close analytical observation with a discerning eye. No two designs are similar. Another noteworthy feature is the adoption of both Hindu and Islamic icons designed and merged in a very aesthetic and intelligent manner - perhaps signifying the absolute unity and integrity of the people belonging to the two religions in those days of Nizams' Rule. There is a beautiful Mosque at one end of the complex, where people pray with their voices sweeping across the tombs. The whole place is serene, calm and worthy of spending a few quiet moments by any tourist visiting the Paigah Tombs!"
Paigah_Tombs,plan41,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Couples,Paigah Tombs,"Amongst the nobility of Hyderabad, the Paigah Family was second only to that of the Nizams of Hyderabad to whom they were attached by matrimony. The term ""Paigah"" is of Persian origin which means ""Pomp and Rank"". This was an honorofic title conferred by the Second Nizam of the Asaf Jahi Dynasty (1724 to 1948 AD). The Paigah Nobles were staunch loyalists of the Asaf Jahis, magnanimous, well-versed in war and peace, supported scholarship and patronized Art and Culture. 27 members of the Paigah Family lie buried in these tombs., which are spread over an area of one acre. A beautiful mosque is alongside the elegantly carved and architectured tombs in white limestone and marble - imported from Rajasthan - that facilitates people to pray from the ""Mehrab"" (Pulpit) to echo over the ""Qabr"" (Tomb). The place is located in Santoshnagar off the main Highway leading to the present Shamshabad International Airport, in a rather narrow, obscure and not-so-prominent lane opposite to the Owaisi Hospital, but the site is very much worth visiting. Its architecture and the design of the complex are unique, rare and no two designs are similar or comparable. Of curiosity and interest are the rare inter-mingling of both Hindu and Muslim motifs in a most intelligent and appealing manner, integrating the same beautifully into the overall magnificence of these structures. The place within the complex is so serene and peaceful and is awe-inspiring!"
Paigah_Tombs,117abbas,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Friends,Inticate stucco tracery and fine marble carvings,"Way out of the normal tourist track and a little difficult to locate, are he Paigahh tombs which are the resting place of the Paigah nobles, second in hierarchy to the Nzams. They in fact competed with the Salar Jungs for top position at the court.They were in fact the Defence Ministers of the state over a long period, from late 18th century till Hyderabad becane a part of India in 1948.The first tomb built in 1789 is of pure marble with superb embellishments. The others following are similarly lavishly carved in marble, reminding a visitor of the Taj Mahal. In fact this complex ha been called the SuthernTaj Mahal though in size they are miniscule.The stuccio work on the walls is quite mind boggling, looks like someone has carved  in wax!!Unfortunately, the complex has not been maintained well, otherwise it would be a rival to any of the popular monuments of Hyderabad.Your entry to the tomb complex is quite complicated. From the Santoshnagar Bangalore road, you have to tske a right turn (left if you are coming from the airport/Bangalore side) into a narrow lane  and then ask for directions from any passersby.Once you drive a little into the lane, to you right you will see the board to the complex entry which is just a few metres in the side lane surrounded by houses"

The number of tombs here and the beauty of each individual tomb is mind blowing. The tombs are well maintained, the details and patterns are stunning and if you get a guide (there is an old man who looks after the tombs) who will also sing if you're nice, there's nothing like it. The whole complex is out of this world. It can get quite deserted in the evening so you should plan to leave the place as soon as the sun starts setting."

Paigah_Tombs,Micah W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Business,"Old world architecture, a must see for photographers","I was totally captured by the old world architecture and photog friendly access to the tombs. A classic India experience with old world architecture and modern day garbage strewn about. On a really positive note, I was there in August of 2014 and they are currently refinishing a few of the tombs. There were stone masons working in the court yards. Absolutely fascinating to watch. This is a must see with minimal tourist. A truly intimate experience. Do yourself a favor and tip the attendee at the main tomb. He will show the real tomb on the underground floor as well as do a ""Call to Prayer"" in the main tomb. An real thrill if you are running a video recorder. "

Paigah_Tombs,asmterrace,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Friends,Where the rulers of the paradise come to rest,"What strikes when you enter the Paigah tombs is the tranquility that welcomes you. Interned here are people who were served by battalions of soldiers and servants yet the melancholic solitude pierces through your heart and tel you that hard fact of life "" you may live among millions but you rest alone"".In a nonchalant bye lane where the residents are least concerned about the history around lies few people who lead once of the most glorious personal and social life which made even emperors jealous. What attracts a visitor is in intrinsic art work and caligraphy displayed in the building. To appreciate the place a little knowledge of the history of Hyderabad is required. PAIGAHs are the foremost aristocratic family in the social pyramid of Nizam era Hyderabad , rich more than several maharajas and were paramount palace builders. Their loyalty to the NIZAM was iron strong . An example : A Paigah noble is believed to have refused to bow before the might British Emperor during the Delhi Durbar because his own ruler NIZAM was around. His logic was he cannot serve two masters and he would stick his loyalty to his NIZAM. NIzams rewarded this loyaly with close marital relationships and huge tax collection rights. Standing next to the tomb of Vicar ul umra, one can only lower the head when once knows that the great FALAKNUMA, PAIAGAH palaces and Vicar manzil are made by him. HIs generosity and thirst for fine life has made quite a few unbelievable folklore which facts will vouch that are true. The garden around is neglected but the care taker by his personal interest is trying to garner funds from government through few public interest litigation filed before courts. One can only leave the place with a sigh that the where the rulers of the paradise come to rest may be taken cared slightly better and will retain its importance in the list of the archaeological department.

Paigah_Tombs,BlueFinTuna12,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Solo,Interesting Place to Visit,"The tombs are off the beaten track and difficult to find, but are very beautiful once you're there. I really enjoyed this set of tombs, and am very glad I went. It might be difficult to get to if you're crunched for time. Many of the auto drivers don't know this location, and we had to drive around a bit to find it. Make sure you're clear you want Paigah Tombs in Santosh Nagar and not Qutb Shahi Tombs, because the auto I was with thought I wanted to go to Qutb Shahi."

Beautiful carvings and exquisite detail. I would recommend going here to compare with the Qutub Shahi tombs as the style is different, but they are the equal to each other in magnificence. Go with a guide if you want to learn...What tessellation's! Wow, absolutely spell bound seeing them, each one different from the other. A must for all you architects and designers.This one of the best place for visit when you are in hyderabad and you love the history of India and relation with islam.The aristocratic Paigah family, purportedly descendents of the second Caliph of Islam, were fierce loyalists of the nizams, serving as statespeople, philanthropists and generals under and alongside them.These tombs of the former rulers of Hyderabad are spectacular. It is worth it to see them as well as the very different Qotb Shahi tombs. The architecture is unique with interesting ostrich egg and pineapple motifs in different places. The caretaker/guide is great and is excellent about pointing out the best ""photo opportunities"

From 1797, the two families began inter-marrying as well, solidifying their close bond. The Paigahs’ necropolis, tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood 4km southeast of Charminar, is a small compound of exquisite mausoleums made of marble and lime stucco. The main complex contains 27 tombs with intricate inlay work, surrounded by delicately carved walls and canopies, stunning filigree screens with geometric patterning and, overhead, tall, graceful turrets"
