Pala_Pitta_Cycling_Park,EkMusafir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Cycle To Your Heart's Content.,"“You don’t stop Bike Riding when you get old, you get old when you stop Bike Riding”. This is a quotation on one of the boards displayed as you go cycling around the well laid out cycling tracks in the Pala Pitta Cycling Park in the Kothaguda Reserve Forest in Hyderabad. It is located just opposite the Botanical Gardens in Kondapur.Here you can hire bicycles for ₹50 an hour. The track goes around a fenced in forest and is about 2.5 km in circumference. The track is a mixture of sand, gravel, and mud and is quite suitable for the sports bikes of which they have plenty available in their shed. They have ladies bikes, as well as smaller bikes for kids too. The park opens at 6 am and it is best to go early in the morning when it is cooler. It is only for cycling, and walking is not allowed on the cycle track. There are benches for sitting and there is a washroom.The terrain is flat but there are some small hillocks to challenge your pedal power, and the track curves around treacherously in some places, making your ride a bit challenging. If you are lucky you will get to see peacocks wandering around in the forest."
Pala_Pitta_Cycling_Park,Mega B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Very nicely managed cycling park,"This is one of its kind cycling park situated in Kondapur.. Best would be to visit in early morning hours, 6 AM. Since you get to choose your bike from a huge collection, and a serene and calm environment with very less number of people. Own cycles are allowed but still an entry fees of 25 is applicable. If you take cycle on rent it is 50. There are kids cycles as well. And no one is allowed to walk inside. It's only a cycling park. There is place to sit for people to wait. And washrooms are available."
