Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,AmodPune_India,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Pathetic,Housekeeping staff cleans the floor while people are eating. They don’t care to request travellers to wait or finish the meals. We were having dinner and the staff lady was rushing to clean the floor. The housekeeping team started putting chairs on the tables. This looked to be the end of day operations. The staff was eating the food kept for travellers. Most of the food items were cold and no heating was being maintained. My next flight was after 6 hours but I was told that the lounge can  be used only for 2 hours. This was new for me. It’s Pathetic and I couldn’t see any supervisor with whom I could chat. Plaza premium definitely needs to upgrade the quality.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Winnia,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Arrogant Receptionist,"I just came out of the lounge all furious on the receptionist who was a nutcase, didnt seem to understand simple English and above all spoke rudely.I told her to kindly contact the Indigo helpdesk to help me in taking my mother who is a senior citizen to the boarding gate.The wheelchair assistance guy had left us at the lounge since we had a 4 hours layover.Before leaving he said that I need to initimate lounge receptionist and she would connect with Indigo helpdesk and arrange for the assistance.When it was time ,I went and told this receptionist that my mother is seated on the wheelchair and that if she could connect with the Indigo helpdesk for continuing the assistance till the gate, she noded her like an idiot...After sometime when nobody came ,I went back and reminded her while she was fidgeting with her cellphone and she was like we dont provide this service; To which I said this is ridiculous because if you didn't,you should have told that to me the first time.She had the audacity to tell me ""How much has it been since you first came, I didn't tell you then, but I am telling you now"".I AM REALLY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS KIND OF ATTITUDE THAT TOO FOR REQUESTING FOR SERVICE FOR A SENIOR CITIZEN. SHOCKED TO SEE SUCH BEHAVIOUR FROM THE RECEPTIONIST.Requesting the Plaza lounge management to please take action against such arrogant staff.Winnia Furtado9833512787"
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,rajiv_thatsme,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Horrible,Pathetic lounge with rude staff. No wifi available. No proper bottled water for international passengers. And very basic amenities.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Keith,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Worst lounge,"This lounge is expected to cater for those travelling business internationally and domestically, but didn’t have any food, drinks or Wi-Fi. When asked why nothing was available “new owner arrives in a couple of days!”Floors filthy and staff sleeping on toilet floor.Worst lounge experience ever!"
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Deepankar Mitra,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Hyd airport lounge management to be change immediately. Worst in India.,"At 7.30 pm today , lounge personal at hyd airport lounge said it's closed because food is over ... I mean seriously... How can it be managed so bad... Can the management look into it plz. It's sooo waste.... Action should be taken related to this."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,drvivekx,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Business,Poorly being managed.,The lounge was closed when we arrived. We were told the lounge will open at 12:30 when lunch starts. When the lounge opened there was atleast a crowd of 40 people waiting for card to get swiped and getting unmanageable. And only one person to swipe . Later after 15 min 1 more arrived. The water dispenser did not have hot water . No soft drink- machine out of order. No tea in tea coffee dispenser.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Amit Rathour,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Good lounge,Good lounge but always crowded . Good sitting area for a longer wait time and comfortable seating . The menu is repetitive if you are traveling frequently might not enjoy the menu.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Rahul2604,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,Good lounge but crowded,"Only lounge at RGIA domestic departure,its big with respect to many other lounge in India still remains crowded during peak hours.As most lounge in India only allowed 3 hr before departure but if having more layover can swipe card multiple times and use.Food selection was good,there is a bar also with payment basic,only lounge in India having smoking zone inside."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,GLOBALSEAS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,refresshing,refreshing in the lounge when we have too much of time to connect a flight .... good food and we can rest and relax ...
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,DipuKV,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Crowded,"The Plaza Premium Lounge at Hyderabad, just like its counterpart in Delhi, gives you the same feel - crowded to the hilt. While the spread when I visited was good, limited seating options and long lines diluted the overall experience."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Akshay Sharma,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,An average lounge with a Premium mentioned in its name,This lounge though named Premium offers an average service compared to the ones at Delhi/ Mumbai airports. The seating arrangement is cramped and the check-in experience is very poor. They need to improve the seating arrangement which makes the whole area quite cramped.
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Ankur Borwankar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,"Excellent food, comfortable couches","Out of the dozen or so airport lounges I've been to in India, this one is by far the best. Comfortable seating, runway facing couches with plush footrests, delicious lunch, live food counter, and polite staff.Lunch included soup, salads & beans, daal & rice, a vegetarian starter, one vegetarian and one chicken main course, a live dosa counter, and a dessert. All of these were fresh and worthy of compliment on a pedestrian Tuesday afternoon. My only gripe is there were no rotis on the menu. It does get crowded around mealtime but I found a two-person dining table without having to wait.A small bar serves alcohol at a charge with separate seating, coffee machines dispense good cappuccino, and there's also a soda fountain with 4 or 5 varieties (PepsiCo, not Coke).A smoking room is inside the lounge, adjacent to the bar, so there's no need to lug your cappuccino across the airport. The room is small but clean and maintenance staff was sweeping it thrice every hour during peak rush.The staff is warm and all the travellers I encountered were friendly as well. Much more genial than the dour, reserved types one finds in Delhi.I was told there are two lounge areas, this review is for the domestic Plaza Premium lounge on level 2.- ANX SCORE CARD -Food: 5/5Service: 5/5Ambience: 5/5VFM: N/A - VERDICT -Definitely worthwhile stopping by. An even sweeter deal if you have complimentary lounge access."
Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,kc_dude,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Not at all impressive,"Dirty, crowded and very few food options. They need more people to clean general area or tables. International side is much nicer."

Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Sumit Singh Gandhi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Friends,Average Experience,I had high hopes for this place. The steak was under-seasoned.

Plaza_Premium_Lounge_Domestic_Departures,Gaurav V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Business,Positively surprised with the hospitality and food at the international lounge,"I visited the NEW plaza premium lounge during my first international trip for the year (of note, I am a frequent traveler and have been a frequent visitor of the lounge in the past). I was quite surprised (positively) with the overall ambience, hospitality, and especially the food. For those who have been visitors of plaza premium in the past would know that the food quality has been decent, but you don’t come with a lot of expectations. However, this time plaza has gone extra mile to ensure the food goes hand in hand with the new setup. It’s almost (authentic) restaurant quality food on the go! Further, the associates made sure that my stay was as comfortable as it could be. Kudos to the team (Sandip, Tirumal - the chef, and Anthony) for going extra mile and ensuring delightful experience. I look forward to my next trip and coming back to the lounge, with a hope to treat my taste buds again! #keepitup"
