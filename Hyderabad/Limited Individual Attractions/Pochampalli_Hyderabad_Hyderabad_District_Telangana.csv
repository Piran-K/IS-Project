Pochampalli,D P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Pacahmaplli trip,"The road from Hyderabad to Pochamplli is scenic , took less tha 1 hr to reach Pacahmaplli X road after which road quality deteroriates sharply. Another 11 km to Pochampally village/rural town. Many malls specialising in Inkatha/ Patola prints are there. However all have same kind of fare and little variety. All in all if you have spare half day and enjoy road trip ans as a bonus may like to browse through some sarees do the trip. Other than that it’s not on."
Pochampalli,Tarun,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Family,Cultural visit,"Bhoodan Pochampally is in Bhongir Division. It is 40 km from Hyderabad on Hyderabad Vijaywada Highway. It has a museum and silk saree park, which is managed by government. Here silk saree weaving process can be seen easily. Nice place to visit, stay and buy some silk garments."
Pochampalli,Daniel T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,One of its kind textile village in Telangana,"For most Indians, Pochampalli sarees is a household name. If you want to experience the saree prep in person, then this is the place to come. More suited for foreigners who'd like to know more about the saree making process.Otherwise you can visit this place to buy sarees directly from the handloom makers. Its a nice experience to watch the artisans weave magic."
Pochampalli,Dinesh_cbe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Textile Village,"Pochampalli is a village in Telangana which is on the list of World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Located just one hour travel from Hyderabad, this village is full of handloom business. Outlets exclusively for selling their own products at cheaper & resonable price - good value for money."
Pochampalli,Prakash,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Pochampalli - Land of the Ikkat Saree,"Pochampalli (officially called Bhoodan Pochampilli) is a small village located in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district of Telangana. It is world famous for its weaving of Ikkat Saris and other textiles. It is on the tentative list of UNESCO world heritage sites. Situated under 45 Kms from Hyderabad City (around 57.5 Kms for the RGI International Airport) it can be reached by taxi or bus. As most of the drive is on the 8-lane Nehru Outer Ring Road (ORR) expressway, the drive is generally smooth. The town is situated 11.5 Kms off the ORR. One needs to pay Toll while exiting the ORR for the distances covered. One can see bunches of cute little monkeys on the road leading from ORR to Pochampalli..In the village one can see weavers at work (they do not encourage photographs) and you can buy the textiles form the many shops in the village. I found that the best place to buy Saris, handkerchiefs, shawls and bed linen is the government run Pochampalli Weavers Coop retail outlet.Prices of saris bought in Pochampalli are generally atleast 40-50% cheaper than those found in Hyderabad or other cities or online."
Pochampalli,bhalchandra g,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Pochampalli Sarees,A place famous for Silk. I reached early there ( 11 AM ). I visited few shops to buy Silk Sarees but to my astonishment found that the sellers are least interested in any trade. There was a marked reluctance on part of every seller to show the Sarees that they offer.Ended up at the Weavers Cooperative Society. The sales girls were enthusiastic.Purchased 2 sarees
Pochampalli,Usha65,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Must visit,"This small village is close to Hyderabad, it is a textile paradise. The sarees and other cloths are priced reasonably and of good quality."
Pochampalli,madhu c,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017,Pochampally - the beautiful ikkat weaves,"Been visiting Pochampally since 1980s because of my love for Indian weaves. It was a pleasure as the whole village was literally involved in the job of weaving, you could walk into a house or on the road - it was brimming with activity.Lot of weavers and specially their children have left this job because the income is not enough. You hardly see people weaving there. The place to go to is Pochampally Hand loom Park which is about an hours drive from Pochampally. That's where you can see activity. It has been very close to my heart and I have done a documentary film on the weavers."
Pochampalli,Ranaari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,A fine collection of textiles,I dare anyone who has visited this location and came back empty handed. They offer you one of the finest cotton and that too at a very reasonable (I would say real cheap deal) rate. Best to go on a weekday as weekends are generally crowded
Pochampalli,Amartya1987,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Saree hub - Long drive from Hyderabad,"We can also call this the saree village. I have never seen so many saree shops in a small village.Just on a lazy Saturday afternoon, also the absence of good places to see around Hyderabad, I decided to use Google for some suggestions within 100kms. I got an answer which neither my wife nor my mom can reject. Yes, that's right, Pochampally.Post lunch we just quickly got ready as most of the reviews said that the working hours would be mostly 9 - 6. Filled up some petrol around Gachibowli HP petrol pump near Citibank and made our way towards ORR. As usual the ORR offered a great ride and we took an exit at Exit 11(Pedda Amberpet). Took the Vijayawada Highway, NH65 and continued for another dozen or more kilometres when the Google maps screamed to take a left in another 900 metres. Was looking for a major road when a big arch on the left side read, Pochampally-12 kms and I took a swift left and continued on the road. Even though the road was single lane and a big shift from the NH but it was mostly vacant and those 12kms was like a cakewalk.Once deep inside the village, saree shops started appearing on both sides of the road. There is a new market of brick and mortar coming up and all you can see are saree shops. Continued for a few more kilometres and hit M.G. ROAD, here we decided to take help from localites and came to a old and under renovation building where the signboard read Pochampally Co-op weavers society. We parked the vehicle on the backside of the building. There is old Muruga Swamy temple just next to the building which acts as a landmark.Here the ladies got into action and went on to explore the shop's collection, but they were outside the shop within 5 minutes, which made me wonder. On enquiring I found that the shop was quoting exorbitant prices. Another family from Hyderabad who were coming out the shop shared the same experience. Now it was turn to explore the surroundings as the only thing that you can notice everywhere are saree shops. There were a few good shops around like Nataraja, Chandana and many more which I can't recall right now with good collections.While I was waiting outside I decided to venture out and gather more info. With my very limited knowledge of local language I got to know that there is a place called Pochampally Handloom Park where you can see the actual making and also buy a few of them.Here I turned the engine on and asked my family to hop on and moved out towards the location with Google maps and asking passersby on the road. After a drive through village roads reached the Handloom Park, couldn't see the action of saree making as it was almost time for the craftsmen to go back home as it was almost 6pm but we managed to sneak into the store and catch a glimpse of the collection, it was okayish as I suppose the good ones go to cities for sale and just a few display units are kept here.Heartbroken, we thought of returning back as it was around 6:30 pm and drive back home would take another 1.5 hours.We took help from the security guys and they told me that you can avoid the Pochampally village and directly connect the Vijayawada Highway. We followed his instructions and made an exit near Yallagiri. Took an u turn in another 3-4kms and continued on the highway, joined the ORR where the signage read Hyderabad and reached back home around 8pm.Few notes to the fellow readers:1. It's a nice long drive no doubt but don't go with the intention of buying sarees at a throwaway price, it's a myth.2. Don't go in chic clothes and please don't appear to be tourists, u may be ripped with the prices.3. Language is not a barrier, local language is a good to know but the name of the game is bargaining. The better u do, the better are the prices.4. As its a small village, don't expect pizza and burgers but u get enough to survive and they are tasty.5. Locals are great here, strike a conversation and he might help you get to the best shop around.6. Lots of ATMs around, also most of the big shops have EDC, no need to carry piles of cash. Just carry enough as you might carry on any long drive."
Pochampalli,Krtdas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Day Outing and Shopping From Hyderabad,"We visited this place on a weekend. It is merely one and half hours drive from Hyderabad(Gachibowli) towards Ramoji Film City. There is a government run small industry where you can see how pochampally is design and fabric manufacturing is done. The industry is in interiors of the village and you may need to ask the locals for exact way upto the industry. There are direction marks but not very helpful.If possible ask someone to take you inside the industry and explain all the process and activities carried on. There is a small outlet outside the industry run by government for the fabrics and products manufactured there and are available for purchase. In the village area there were many small weaver shops who sell pochampally sarees, ikkat and kalamkari work dress material at negotiable rates. Quality wise products are awesome . Carry cash because atms and card machines were not working at weavers place due to network issues. There are no eating joints nearby - only coconut water and corns are available. Food is available only when u reach near ramoji which is around 30 -40 mins drive from the village."
Pochampalli,Vanitha108,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Weaver's Den,Visited Pochampalli about 54 kms from Hyderabad to see the weavers at work. Glad I went. The famed pochampalli sarees come at an exorbitant rate. Found my cotton ikat saree. Bought a few and towels are good. Small village with no great hotels or facilities. Can visit for a day. Serious shoppers don't take elderly people or kids.

Today this Silk City, which is more of a cottage industry, is home to more than 10,000 weaving families in 100 villages. The fabric is marketed through the cooperative society, many other linked organizations, the master weavers and the business houses in Pochampally.

Pochampalli,Rohit M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,Visit to Pochampalli,"I drove to Pochampalli with my family from Hyderabad. The route to this place is awesome. Starting with ORR for over 50 KMs which is a wonderful expressway and so well maintained that it could be counted in one of the best maintained roads in the country today. You need to take exit 11 from  ORR which takes to this nice loop leading to Ramoji Film City. Few kilometres after Ramoji, one has to take a left turn to Pochampalli. The way to the village is equally nice from there. Nice landscapes and beautiful roads.Finally we reached Pochampalli but the overall experience was a bit disappointing. We expected to see some Govt run set up of weavers where we could see actual weaving happening displaying this 'Ikkat' art which is what this place is famous for. However, apart from 10-12 shops on that stretch and an old small complex of cooperative society selling sarees, we couldn't see anyone really making it. We ventured into a few houses in village and could also see some small set ups of saree making but no one was working there. The shops have a limited variety and my wife and mom couldn't select much. Also, the rates are a bit inflated by the village standards and one needs to bargain hard.All in all still worth visiting but better use of time could be to combine Ramoji Film City with it where most part of the day should be spent."
Pochampalli,Aditya_Banerjee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Home to Ikkat saris,"If you are in Hyderabad with your family, you must travel to Pochampalli to see a few geniuses at work. Pochampalli home to some fine craftsmen who weave the famous Ikkat Saris. Even if you don't buy the saris, just go there and observe the talented weavers at work"
Pochampalli,TVREDDY02,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,MAKE IN INDIA---HYDERABAD,"Had been to the Pochampally and found that the Handloom Park(known as factory locally) is worth a place to see if want to see how sarees/cloths are wooven.  A place for the children to see also.  Timings are from 0900 Hrs to 1800 Hrs.  Sundays are holidays (it comes under Textile ministry).  Though there are locally house made cloth made too but then one does not really know the quality of the same as such, hence procurement of the same from the handloom manufacturer is worth. Though we had been there on sunday and since they were working hence requested for an entry, the persons there had been very courteous and welcomed us. Had meet Mr Nagarjuna, Nagesh,Ashok, Shravan and Miss Ujjwala...all had been so nice to show us the whole factory and did not close the factory till we had left at 1730 hrs.  Thankful to all of them to have ensured that we did not waste the day.  Cost of the manufacture is found reasonable when seen the work that is going on.  Its a place for the people to get the job too.  They conduct 3 months training and pay a stipend of Rs 2,000/- and then one can work there and make a living by doing the job there itself.  A silent place and not much publicized.  Once in Hyderabad a place one should not miss out especially for ladies and children (for knowledge atleast).Place to reach .. From Hyderabad go towards Rammoji film city and then after 4-5 kms have to turn left...keep checking on the way as if one misses will have to go a long way for turning back as is a NH."
Pochampalli,KrisfromSF,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,Enjoyable DayTrip from Hyderabad,"Nice excursion combining sightseeing and shopping. A village that specializes in hand-loom weaving of silk saris. We went to a couple of weavers' houses and to the ""factory"" to see all the stages of production, including the Ikat dyeing. Outlet store at the factory sells saris for 50% of what you will pay in Hyderabad. Bought two! And then ate our lunch (bring your own) in a field and drove back to Hyderabad.  Total time about 8 hours including commute."
Pochampalli,Kedarshukla,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2013 • Family,Saree shopping and weaver's workshop.,"Actually if you are in Hyderabad and you are not buying pochampalli sarees.. Then you are missing something..  So why not go to the place where these sarees are made and see the work of weavers first hand.This place is around 40 km from Hyderabad and can be reached by city bus or car drive. Search for bhudan pochampalli on google maps for correct place. Just be warned that there is no decent eatery in or around pochampalli so carry your food OR eat before you travel. When in the village you can visit any handloom factory located in almost every house, you can see the age old machines and traditional technology of making sarees.. .. I am not sure but they may give you a try on their machines.. If possible have a person with you who can speak English cause the weavers don't speak any language apart from Telugu. You can buy sarees from any shop their or better to go to the cooperative society shop. Everyone gives flat10% discount on every purchase.Tip: carry a fat purse because there is lot of to buy in small hidden heaven of sarees."
Pochampalli,captsameerkhan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Saree shopping,it's a smooth one and a half hour drive from hyderabad city and is the perfect place if you're looking to do some heavy duty shopping for silk and cotton sarees and suits of the famous ikat work. It's purely meant for shopaholic women who have a keen interest in sarees and suits of that type and men will get bored helping women out in choosing what to buy :(There are bedsheets and cushion covers and the like also available in the shops there
