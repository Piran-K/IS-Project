Public_Gardens_Bagh_e_aam,MilwDaniel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Calm and extensive gardens, free entry","This place was only a few minutes away from my hotel so I grabbed an auto in the morning to check it out. The main open garden is a field of grass surrounded by walkways with benches. They were watering the lawn when I was there and the place was full of dragonflies buzzing around. Several people were walking on the paths taking excersise. I found the old museum where there was a student art fair taking place, which was fun. The back gardens had a nice lake, a pavilion, big trees, benches, lawns and lots of areas to walk or sit. Several joggers went through and a few families were sitting and enjoying the afternoon."

Public_Gardens_Bagh_e_aam,Satyendra Garg,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,God Public Gardens in the vicinity of the Assembly and Government Offices.,It must have been very important public Gardens earlier but with coming of other attractions this gets lesser importance. Still quite beautiful but may be less resources. Nice place for people to come for evening and morning walks but it seems with less resources the lake has dried up and so must be the footfall of visitors.Had a look at the place and liked the place overall. Its location which is very central in the city continues to be a big advantage for the place.

That is not the case now, however. As the gardens contain the buildings housing the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Assembly and Legislative Council, along with certain other government departments, entry to a large portion of the complex is not allowed for security reasons.The gardens also house the AP state archeological museum and Health museum, but unless one is visiting them, there is nothing to see in the gardens themselves. There was a small artificial lake with boating facility, but with the current drought, the lake has dried up and the boating has been suspended."

Public_Gardens_Bagh_e_aam,murtuza_sb,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Nice place in the middle of the city bustle,"The public garden next to the AP Assembly is a nice place to spend a few hours lazing around. The upkeep is decent for a free park and there are nice lawns for kids to play. The lake is dirty but offers a rickety paddle boat ride, which is fun. There are a few small museums inside, but they don't keep regular hours, so its just your luck."
