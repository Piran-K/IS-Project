Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,OctOriental,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Graveyard?,This is described on the information boards as one of the world's few necropolises. You may want to go here if you understand that and are interested in exploring. But it's so deserted like any graveyard and you are left to wander around. There are quite a few tombs here but they are not any grand architectural structures like what you would see in Delhi. More like any typical contemporary old abandoned structures where no one goes.

The tombs are set in quiet peaceful gardens"

Go in the afternoon until they close at 17:00 ans you may have it almost to yourself. India is trying to get them listed as UNESCO, and so they are really special.

Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,JeffCarter,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Neat,I walked here from the Golconda fort. I had a great afternoon exploring the area there are many many tombs to check out and you can step inside most of them or walk underneath some of them. I did have a few locals want to be my guide and I kindly declined I would rather just walk around on my own. There was an entrance fee I think it was nominal. In January is not very crowded so I was able to wander around on my own even on a Saturday. Well worth a visit while in town.
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,scvrose,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Amazing buildings,"We stopped by here to see all the temples. There is a lot of construction going on as they are restoring many of the monuments. The walk ways a hard to maneuver, especially for someone in a wheelchair. Still well worth a visit."

Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Shashialabur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Beautiful but a sombre place of burials,"The Qutub Shahi Tombs, or the Seven Tombs as they are also known, are beautiful architectural structures, though they they house the tombs of the rulers of an era gone by & their families.Initially planned for only the rulers, there were seven of them but I believe the last one decided to include tombs for the family members too and hence you see many more of them, some small, some big, but all of them architecturally excellent, with a blend of Persian and Indian architectural styles.This place was getting a face lift, with proper walkways, gardens, etc. under various stages of construction when we visited this place. This place is a stark reminder of the impermanence of the human life & body, but at the same time one is forced to ponder on the wisdom of these rulers who built tombs for themselves when they were still alive !The largest of the tombs, of Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah tomb is nearly 60 meters tall, has a huge double terraced structure with a raised courtyard.A must visit place for its. architectural beauty. If you are not too keen on knowing all the details, then you can finish this within an hour, but may need a little more time if you are inclined historically or architecturally.Quite surprisingly, out driver did not know the Qutub Shahi Tombs - probably he knew of them as the Seven Tombs, may be !Beware of Google Maps though, as it took us through the narrow by-lanes on the outer periphery of this large area, without getting us anywhere near the entrance to it !"
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Tomb really surprised me,These Navabs got their tombs made when they were alive. It was very surprising to know that the rulers planned their own tombs even before their death. There are a many people who don't even know how to plan a day. Poor people. But we must appreciate these Kings for their planning of their own tombs.
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Medieval necropolis,"During the Qutb Shahi period, these tombs were held in great veneration. But after their reign, the tombs were neglected until Sir Salar Jung III ordered their restoration in the early 19th century. A garden was laid out, and a compound wall was built. Once again, the tomb-garden of the Qutb Shahi family became a place of serene beauty. All except the last of the Qutb Shahi sultans lie buried here."
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,16th century Necropolis,"Qutb Shahi Heritage park is one of the most significant historic medieval necropolises anywhere in the world comprising 40 mausoleums, 23 mosques, 7 step wells or baolis , a hammam, pavilions and garden structure all built during the reign of Qutb Shahi dynasty that ruled Hyderabad for 169 years in the 16th-17th centuries"

Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Amashnee S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Business,Monumental,Visited the Qutub Shahi Tombs during November 2019. The tombs to the royal family and their court are really beautiful. Some of the tombs were still under construction but the one that I had access to was very well maintained. A lot of history and it was wonderful to see that the family honored important members of their court with tombs as well i.e. physicians. I really enjoyed my tour and recommend visiting the Qutuab Shahi Tombs. As my guide described it ‘ these were the great men who built the city of Hyderabad as we know it’.
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,NITASH,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Hidden treasure,"I had never heard of these marvels before i visited it last month and it was my fifth visit to the city of Nizam's, Hyderabad.The place is well maintained and new ramps and walk paths are being put up for easy accessibility for all.It had a set of 7 tombs and for some the original tiles bought from Persia are still there.

Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Eileen108,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Beautiful Mausoleums and Photo Oppertunities,"Just after entering inside, you are surrounded by guides offering their services. We tried one but his accent was so thick that we had to dismiss him after a few minutes, then we just walked around on our own. It is a really big area and the mausoleums have fantastic architecture and photo opportunities, even with the extensive restoration. I consider it a must-do when sightseeing in Hyderabad!"
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,TheoP0001,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Impressive. Simple but elegant; the restoration work already shows the benefits and slowly reveals the old splrendour,"Walking distance (I am kidding, while it is only 800 meters away, this is India, you can't just walk, but it is very close) from the Golconda Fort are those seven tombs that are slowly being brought back to their old glamour. And as they are restored, through the generosity of the local government and the Aga Khan Foundation, they are becoming very accessible. Right now, they are also doing a nice landscaping work. Soon, the entire area will tell its story and the splendor of the Qutb dynasty that built the city of Hyderabad and brought out its treasures."
Qutb_Shahi_Tombs,Bulbul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Death is indeed the ultimate truth of life,"This is one of the must-see places in Hyderabad. Various kings of the Qutub Shahi dynasty built these tombs and mosques for each of themselves during their respective reigns. In fact, its the only place in the world where all the emperors are buried in one place. The architecture of the tombs is a mixture of Hindu, Pathan and Persian styles, and is breathtaking. It is said that Aurangzeb, with his army, seized the fort during the reign of the 7th king, Therefore, his tomb remains incomplete.These tombs convey, in a royal way that - 'Death is the ultimate truth of life'Highly recommended to hire a guide. I found the history here far more interesting than Golconda fort. The guide will charge around INR 200-300 for an hour.The best time to visit is in the evenings"

Royal family members are still buried there. Plan to do a lot of walking to see the series of tombs and learn about the history. There is really no reason to pay a tour guide unless you want to. There are plenty of site markings that teach you what you need to know. The buildings do not appear like they did hundreds of years ago, but they are nonetheless impressionable. Just without all the colors and decor. "

The restoration of this place, has started in the last few years. ASI, AGHA KHAN TRUST & TATA Trust are doing a very good work in restoring the world heritage. The entry fees is only Rs. 20 / person. Cameras/ Mobile are an additional each ( I do not mind paying of each Mobile we carry- The place is worth capturing). Car parking is also available inside, but it cannot accommodate many cars- Take your luck . The whole place is well maintained. No littering anywhere. Restoration work can be seen. But still lot of places people have scribbled there names on the wall. We should have strict rules to stop such misbehaving people . The lawns are well laid A very peaceful place, at any time of the day. Since I went there during the rainy season, I could continuously hear the beautiful scream of the Peacocks and sweet sound of other birds. You will feel very relaxed and peaceful coming to this place."
