The ground has had its share of controversy. The first came with the name, which the state government changed to honour a former Indian prime minister. The HCA had to pay out the contractors - Visaka Industries - after whom the stadium was originally named. Then, ten days before what would have been its first first-class match - between the Australians and Mumbai - the ground was deemed unfit to host a big match. But the stadium is now ready, a state-of-the-art facility, complete with floodlights installed in April 2008 in time for hosting the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League."

One has to walk a distance to reach the stadium after parking the car. During the Match days, terrific traffic jam occurs and often takes more than 2 to 3 hours to clear off.  At times, general public are affected during the match days.  People going to Secunderabad Railway Station from Uppal side are the most affected. People say this is not a lucky ground for the home team."

The crowd and the match both were exciting and had a great day. The stadium is well maintained and had no problem. But the long way to walk from parking to the stadium had the kids getting tired.

Make sure you take friends along, sit back, and enjoy an exciting match... good times!"

Seats about 55,000 people and is also home to IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad. Parking access and seating are good. However, since there are no shades, watching the game under the sun can be very taxing"

Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium,Atulmaharaj,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,"Good Stadium, average facilities","I was there to watch the CLT20 Opening game between Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders, last month. The stadium is situated very far from the heart of the city, takes about 2 hrs from Secunderabad.The stadium is built well and the seating capacities are pretty average. The washrooms are pathetic, and there aren't much offerings on the foody end. Dominos sell their 50Rs(pizza mania single pizza) for over 180 bucks ! Plus the DJ wasn't all that good :(But overall, the whole experience was electrifying ! Afterall it was a fight between the heavy weights of IPL !"
