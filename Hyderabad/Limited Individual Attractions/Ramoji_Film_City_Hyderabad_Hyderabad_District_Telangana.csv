Ramoji_Film_City,Dr.Saravanan Chandran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023,One day tour at Ramoji Film City,"One of the must see at Hyderabad, you need a day to see most of the places, reach at 9am stay up to 7pm, maintained up to the international standard. "
Ramoji_Film_City,Amit Bansal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,"Good experience, wish I had got some good food as well","A good experience going around the film city.I booked a package from Ramoji website. The first half was checking around sets via an A/C bus with guide followed by a lunch.The lunch at Superstar hotel was really not as per Ramoji's standard. Poor state of veg food, pathetically slow roti service. Not worth the price. Taste was just OK. If the restaurant can not handle volume, then they should not even entertain that much of volume.The stalls outside offered much better food.The shows were great as well, the package that I opted was too lengthy for my enthusiasm, at around 5 PM, I wish there were no more shows. I wanted a good tea with some snacks, that experience was not that great as well. Food & restaurants surely needs to improve for the prices that are offered for.There was a winter fest that made the place even beautiful with lights, perhaps, I had left with no energy & zeal to enjoy that.It was a good experience, wish I had got some good food."
Ramoji_Film_City,Kapil R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Bad experience of Transportation,"Very unprofessional peoples, i have booked transport for pickup from santosh dhaba, begum bazar nd pickup time was 7:15. But no one reached there nd when talk to customer care even they also don’t know about the pickup. After that they ( mohammed Yasir) are asking us to come to another point nd giving  excuses that by mistake santosh dhaba was printed on ticket.I don’t understand that how there could be misprinting.My parents are senior citizens those who are facing this problem."
Ramoji_Film_City,Rajesh Ramamurthy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,A mind blowing experience,"The sheer enormity of this place means travelers are bound to be left wondering about the logistics of moving around. Believe me, as a family of four including two children, we found the logistics was handled seamlessly. The guides were well informed and the trip moved in a sequential manner. Facilities such as rest rooms, restaurants etc. were also positioned to the advantage of all guests. Highly recommended"
Ramoji_Film_City,Mel12939,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,The Film City of India,"Massive, huge, mesmerizing, literally takes you one complete day to wander around each and every beautiful aspect of making a film, hospitable people, neatly maintained, good souvenirs, overall would definitely recommend.

Ramoji_Film_City,Avijit,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,"Ramoji film city visit with star experience is sheer wastage of time and money The carnival and parade is nothing to ta","Sheer waste of time and money as I said in title. If managementbthoughtbthat they can mix fast food and  heavy lunch together, then this can happen. One can neither see the things they mightbfeel interesting although there is nothing much to see, except some old film sets, nor one can get time to enjoy the rides available for kids. The other entertainments are what ones get to see in circus , like action stunts, dance show, etc. In the digital era, these does not entice people. They should make it clear whether they want to promote it as game and rides park or mere tour of some so called fancy sets"
Ramoji_Film_City,SREENIVASAREDDY M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,"An Indian Hollywood, a great & must see wonder!","Situated in the middle of green hills, away from city buzzing, with good stay & food arrangements, originally meant for fil. shootings of various locations like  various township locations, gardens, fountains, forts, tempkes, rly Station, bus station, busy areas, parks, zoo, birdirium and incl.of recent blockbuster like BAHUBALI sets also can seen alive.Two days tour actually required to enjoy the serene of this spot. There are various tariff hotels to stay, all sorts if food out let's, any point to any point free bus service etc privileges of this property."
Ramoji_Film_City,Raman G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,"When visiting Hyderabad,  you can come here for a day","It is a full day tour. About 40 km from Hyderabad.  The largest film city complex in the world. The owners of film city also organize tours for guests for the huge complex. Tours from around 9 am to 530 pm. We took a Star experience tour. Booked online in advance from their website. ( they have a toll free number as well for any enquiries) . It is a guided tour of the grounds, sets and the special shows. The advantage is that this tour   is communicating in a AC bus. Which was definitely a comfort for us. It includes a buffet  lunch- which was ok. If you need, the organizers also arrange a bus pick up and drop from various  points in Hyderabad. But depending on your pick up location. It can be a 2 hour ride in the bus to the film city. We hired a taxi for full day. ( abt Rs 3000 for the day). We reached a bit before 10 am. It is recommended to reach by 9 am as they ask to, as the tour definitely ends at 530pm. We did notice that for return to Hyderabad in the evening  there are stalls at film city for return transport , but do not know the charge? ( in case you only take a drop to film city by own transport). You can visit the film city without booking any of the tour package as well. It will be a walk in for the tickets. We noticed that these are quite crowded as a group. If you have visited any such film city  tours abroad, say in Singapore or San Francisco, these are very much of a very high standard and quality in thrills and excitement and experience as compared to Ramoji.But in India, it is surely one a kind. Tour includes, rides, walk through bird parks, gardens, visit film sets,  walk through film sets and shows. The latter include a dance and song show as well.Our tour was very well set up and organised."
Ramoji_Film_City,Praveen Anand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Excellent and fun place to go. Must visit place in Hyderabad,"Learn about the film making and visit many locations, which were part of many great films. Very well  clean and maintained place. You need full day to visit"

Ramoji_Film_City,reshma r,,,,"Waste of time.Not organised at all.Simply waste of time is queue.They asked all people to go to movie magic first and then  Doll store.. And so on. But instead they could have split the teams so we can avoid  waiting time.And also iits not worth waiting in queue and watching some dances. They are olden days strategy. But they are still following it.And not all the games are free, You have to pay for many games. And also 3D movie they charged 100 per person. All the things are not included in my Ticket.Ticket -- ₹1250 + 250 Dinner + tax its ₹ 1770/-  per head.Food is heavy costly 1biryany  500+Water small bottle 25.₹All eatables costly for common manNot worth at all"
Ramoji_Film_City,TamilAmerican,,,,"Ramoji Film City is a wonderful experience and a must visit. I'll list down some delighters and things that can be improved based on my experience.  Pros first1. Lots of things to do and experiences to have. 2. The shows are very impressive. Spirit of Ramoji, Wild West were in particular very nice. 3. There were a good amount of rides for children and adults to enjoy. 4. The eco park was very good, especially the bonsai collection was amazing to see. 5. Haunted house was a good experience for kids. Things that can be improved1. The brochure was very confusing. There is no way you can cover all the things in Ramoji in a day, so the brochure should give more detailed information which helps the people to choose based on their interest. 2. We took the star experience package which was the more expensive one. However they kept passing us from one person to other person without anyone explaining what is the plan for the day. Even on asking they were not interested to answer and just kept pointing to someone else. It felt we missed out on lots of things simply because no-body told us. Also the bus was so overcrowded that everyone did not even got a seat and lots of time was wasted in sorting that out. The star experience didn't feel worth the money and I felt I would have been better off with a regular ticket and planning the day myself, rather than leaving it to the star experience providers. 3.  Don't think this falls under the jurisdiction of Ramoji, but the travel to and from Ramoji was a big headache. We booked a ticket via BestBus which seemed to show on their site that they are the official partners with Ramoji. However it was a bad experience, as they kept asking us to change pickup point without realizing how difficult it would be for someone to reach different pickup point at short notice. Even while drooping off they didn't drop us at our designated dropping point. I would strongly suggest giving BESTBUS a skip and find another option to reach there."
,,,,,"Ramoji Film City is the thematic holiday destination and The World’s Largest Film Studio Complex. A 1, 600-acre land gifts the spectacular experience of exploring the wonderful attractions of the world at one destination. It is an awesome place to visit with family & friends."
,,,,,"I went there in May 2022 (during the carnival season) with my husband and nephews. Everybody loved that place. The place has so much to offer, including - learning about movie making process, adventure sports, food, music, DJ, dance performances, martial art performances, gifts for participants, beautiful movie sets, green gardens, butterfly garden, and so on. We spent over 12 hours and it was worth it. The ticket cost was approx. 1200 per person, but it's worth every penny. There is bus service inside, you can go from one point to another by bus (no additional cost). Bring your own water bottle as there is a drinking water tap at every point where you can refill your water bottle for free. I am planning to go there again with my parents in November.Only advice - go there when the weather is nice and keep in mind that you will spend at least 6-8 hours outdoors."
,,,,,"This family friendly huge entertainment zone was unique. Right from the entry, where we were given chocolates and sets to take interesting themed photos, the trip was amazing. A van took us to different points like Alauddin ride, shows about making the movie, sets where each entrance was a different building etc. The guide was charming and explained the significance of different spots along with the famous movies directed there. The gardens were spacious and well maintained. The best part of the trip was the Bahubali set. We loved the magnificent ensemble."
Ramoji_Film_City,Vaishnavi_g,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,SImply excellent,"Dont ask a local hyderabi about visiting this place. They say, what is there in it !!! But believe me it is really wonderful for an outsider. You will be taken through a guided tour, and you will get to see cine-settings, best of it is, Bahubali setting, Mahabharata, Ramyana... Then you will have a 4D show... Eco park where for the first time I saw the birds , geese etc left to freely fly around although inside a fenced area. You can just walk through them...Got to hold a maccaw in hand.... And adventure rides.... Worth giving an entire day for it.     Dont bother if a local says, dont waste your one day on it. Just go for it. It is worth going atleast once here. "
Ramoji_Film_City,Biswajit M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Time waste,"Its not worth visit as its very mundane and old school , its actually a studio being open for tourists who have nothing else to do and only have time to waste and spend money"
Ramoji_Film_City,Konganapally Laasya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,My experience on Ramoji Film City,Since I am an Indian Hindu my family has some traditions And since I am 10 years old i have to start wearing half sarees For that we need to throw a party as my first day wearing half sareeWe threw that party in Ramoji Film City hawa mahal and everything was great the food the atmosphere and everything we book hotel rooms in Tara hotel and we stayed for a night the next morning we did a photo shoot in Ramoji Film City The reason I gave four stars is because it was really expensive it nearly cost 3 lakhs and the next morning my rooms shower broke and the hair dryer was not working But still you should visit Ramoji Film City cause it’s the greatest experience I’ve ever had 
Ramoji_Film_City,Dattatray Bhat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,BIGGEST FLIM CITY IN WORLD,"I had visited ramoji, couple of years earlier.

Ramoji_Film_City,Suresh K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Worthy Place to Visit,Very much enjoyed with Family. Very large place to cover. Inside commuting is very good. You can spend the whole day is not enough to cover everything. Very much interesting to watch how they filming. 
Ramoji_Film_City,Mayank G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,One of the Must Visit Place in India,"This overall Ramoji Rao Film City tour experience like watching huge budget film on big screen . This tour is full of action, emotion, drama, music and dance . Just Amazing and unique place. But in my opinion this tour must be two days because only one whole day you can not cover this huge area . Nevertheless one day trip is also enjoyable. This is one trip where you can understand the process of film making . Lovely! Total Blockbuster Place."
Ramoji_Film_City,lkoraj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,"Good place, must see if you are in hydrabad.","A very good place, very much decorated shooting points and beautiful gardens, good for children entertainment, nice shows like adventure, dance, film making process, space yatra, filmi duniya, action etc, big film sets are a very good attraction of this place, overall a good place to see."
Ramoji_Film_City,Tubby,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Solo,Over hyped.. sangam restaurant NOT TO BE VISITED!,"Caves, wild west, birds show, and space yatra good showsBut Buses force you to go from one spot to anther and there is no option to go directly to the starting point I would specifically call out Sangam restaurant that forces one to pay rs350/head for unlimited food!! They need to learn from Chowki Dhani, Jaipur how unlimited food is served!! They go around the tables to serve people and people eating dont have to go again n again to get smthing! Worst is on reaching the buffet spot, you may not even find the dish you came for 🫤. Plus, Ramuji and family, when you source out to these caterers do you even chk what they are serving and how? Do you eat rasam in a thali at your home? My suggestion.. ramuji and family, plz come to this place as a tourist and then share your review as well!!!"
Ramoji_Film_City,Jalpesh Rojasara,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Must visit if get opportunity,"Must visit once in life time. Take standard tickets. No need to take star experience tickets. Well organized visit by film city staff, just follow their instructions u will not miss single  Location or live shows. Plenty of free drinking water stands with chilled and hygiene water. Plenty of food options with price on higher side. They provide guided tour in their vintage style red bus in film city. More than 2000 movie shooting done here. Bahubali set is ok. 3 hotels name tara, sitara and shantiniketan are within film city. Reach at 9 am so u can watch opening ceremony. 2 lines for tickets, 1 for direct ticket from ticket counter and onther who have online tickets. Evening parade is good. In evening whole film city is decorated by lights so u feel u are in another world. Must experience this. Most of rides are complementary free. At sahas adventure location u will enjoy adventure rides free of cost. One full day required for visit. Kids zone is also good and photogenic. Star experience tickets has ac bus, food coupon, welcome chocolate box not worth for its price. Local taxi from hyderabad city available at 1000 to 2000 fair rate. Plenty of free parking lots available at ticket counter. If u have hotel booking u can take u r private car upto hotel. So enjoy ur visit u will definitely remember it. "
Ramoji_Film_City,amol s,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Total Waste of Money & Time !!,"We visited this place with lot of expectations but were left very disappointed with overall experience!Total ticket cost for family of 2 adults and 2 kids was 5400 for absolutely nothing worth mentioning to see Horror starts right from beginning when u are asked to park car 5 kms away from main premise. From there all tourists are put in outdated buses like prisoners and taken to main film city area .So once you are in you just can not leave place without going through entire torture. Guided tour lasts only about 30 mins and after that you are left there from point to point to explore nothing. Adventure sports area sports like paintball , archery are all useless. For paintball just one person standing there asking u to shoot 3 shots on target . Archery session arch set looks like it is third class china toy bought at 100 from local market. That also only one ser is there. In short what is included in ticket is all useless stuff but advertised by Mr Ramoji as if its out of the world Sahaj adventure sports .For kids only space yatra which lasted for 5 mins and bird park was only area worth mentioning.In addition like prisoners you are not allowed to carry any food inside . Firstly with exorbitant ticket cost now they like are further allowed to take more money from your pocket.Restaurant called Jimmy is total useless with third grade food at five star prices .Worst is you cant leave place as you are stuck there !!Pls avoid avoid and donate money to some needy !!!"

Ramoji_Film_City,AjithBhaskaran,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Fun insight into movie making,"Worth a visit if you are on a trip to Hyderabad - it is around 1 1/2 hours drive from City Centre. Gives an idea as to how films are made and sets are constructed. Need to either reach by around 9 am or better still stay there in one of the hotels inside RFC the previous evening as you need a full day to see everything. Even a full day is a bit rushed. Best to pick up tickets ('Studio Tour' is good enough) online, go to the centre point (Eureka), attend the opening ceremony at 9.45 am, proceed to Studio Tour/Eco Tour (must do), have lunch, then go for the shows. Don't miss the Wild West Stunt Show! Lights, Camera, Action is interesting too. Rest of the shows are average, especially for someone who has been to other studios/sets elsewhere. Pick up a brochure and plan your day ahead. Food within RFC is average or even below average."

We loved the spots we saw and the carefully curated sets. The Japanese Gardens were a delight in particular and we loved the Bird Park. Had no idea they had such an amazing collection and the birds looked like they were vey well taken care of. The Moviemaking Part was amazing and the 'Director' was very funny.OUR GUIDE: Loved our guide Datta Ji. He was very patient and very courteous. He let us choose which spots we wished to disembark for and offered to take our pictures everywhere we went. He was very funny, jovial and amiable person.FOOD: The buffet at Sitara was sufficient so was the taste.OVERALL, it's truly a must visit spot if you come to Hyderabad"

Ramoji_Film_City,SuprabhatC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,Grand,"This is a massive film city and studio complex with open-air film sets, vast gardens, replicas of historical monuments, statues. Liked the Bahubali set. Though there are a number of restaurants and fast food options, it is inadequate keeping in mind the vastness of the complex. A pressing need for more drinking water stations as walking around the whole day can be very exhausting. Mist fans should be installed for respite from heat. The route options of buses lack clarity.One should budget an extra day, recommend night stay at the hotels in the complex for more leisurely experience."

Unfortunately they expected my mother to climb in to a bus to go and then climb out of that bus to climb in to another bus, from which she would have to climb in and out at every stop. I even offered to buy 4 premium tickets if they allowed our vehicle in with their guide. But to no avail. It is sad to see an establishment that portrays it self with such grandness to be so inconsiderate and non inclusive."

Here you will see see film sets used in multiple films. Star attraction is Bahubali fim set. To add icing on the cake, there are multiple shows. Pls do keep their timings in mind. You can reach the main entrance via own car, bus or local transport. From there,, you need to travel via their buses. Avoid visiting during public holidays, as it can get over crowded, and you might end up spending most of the time in queues. Overall a great place. "
Ramoji_Film_City,Rover_Girl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Couples,Awesome experience,"Ramoji Filmcity is a must visit if you are travelling to Hyd for business or leisure. Located in around 2000 acres, a well managed theme park. I was awestruck by looking at management of the premises; it’s nothing less than any international theme parks like Disneyland etc. only difference is that this place attracts all age groups & not only kids. It has got 4shows; bus tour; Sahas adventure land; opening & closing ceremony; kids rides & various dining experiences. All are worth it.Advice for management: Streamline the bus tour as the hop on & hop off should be at the discretion of visitor instead forceful. Also should have the red bus at all locations rather starting with red bus then normal buses & last leg with red bus. Too much hassle for visitor.Things I loved: beautiful capture of Mahabharata Sets; bird park was awesome;  Bahubali set & Mughal garden were grandeour; & shooting locations were interesting."

Ramoji_Film_City,Raviraj Rodrigues,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,Excellent place for a one time visit,"The property is built on the lines of Disneyworld, but at a much lower scale and finish quality. However for the entry price, I would say its worth a one time visit. We got to see many sets. both live and ready for shooting. Some of them are permanent like Mughal gardens, Rajput Palaces, Wild West, Indian Village scenes etc. Some others were created for one movie and left for tourists to enjoy like the sets of Bahubali. They have some lovely gardens, bird park and butterfly park too. However, one can truly enjoy the place only by staying inside the filmcity in one of their hotels for atleast 2 nights. There is too much to see and do and the guided tour of 2.5 hours will not do justice to the place. We could spend early mornings and late evening on the sets and gardens as we stayed in the resort and were permitted to move around. "
Ramoji_Film_City,Neha Banerjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,Would definitely come back with my toddler,We visited recently in Covid times. 1 excellent thing is it's closed for outside but open for people who are staying. So the crowd was minimal.We stayed in the Sitara hotel.We enjoyed hassle-free check-in. Then Ramoji tour and Bahubali tour. Hardly 10-15 ppl which was excellent as per the pandemic situation. Few parks were open and in lush greenery so it was just a close-to-nature trip.My toddler could run around freely and enjoyed it a lot.I will surely visit again.

Ramoji_Film_City,valivali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021,Wonderful Place,"I visited film city on 01-04-2021. It was excellent. Best Place to visit in Hyderabad. Best for Families, Friends, Couples, Children's and for every one. Best in hospitality. Best Cooperative Employees. Best Guides. Comfortable, Clean & Neat every place including washrooms. Foot-by-Foot water facilities with cool and disposable glass also. Infact one day was not enough to enjoy the entire film city, minimum 02 days. Guidance and Hospitality towards us was very much appreciable. We ate Veg-Food and it was good, but price was Rs.300/- comparing to outside of film city it cost just or below 100/-. So Price was pretty much higher. Except food all are reasonable rates. Unfortunately i forgot my bag at clock room and left HYD and reached my home town. After contacted them they were very helpful and responded in a cooperative nature. After some phone calls and messages, i got my bag via courier and all things were as same as left bag(No things were missed nor disturbed yet).Finally i give 05 stars for film city and 1 star for Food Rate."

This time it was my 8th visit to RFC. Wonderful experience as always. As this place is huge it take the entire day. Make sure to take rest the next day of the visit as it drains you. 
Ramoji_Film_City,Bhavesh Bariya,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Family,Bad experience,Terrible experience...Started the journey early morning...7.30..very far isolated from main city. They don't allow any kind of food item... selling their food items in their stalls at very high rates....20 rupees item available at the rate of 80 rupees. Also all the items are fast food...so small children and elderly may suffer from hypoglycemia...no healthy choices available...It's only money making business... ticket rates are already very high...the difference between adult and children rate only 200rupees...not in capacity to visit the tour by middle class...who have earned the money by hard work...No resting place with shadow at some points...can not visit again...After visiting the place you are the most tired person...Food must be available at reasonable price or visitors should be allowed food items to carry...

Ramoji_Film_City,Twinkle Sonar,,,,I went there with my wife & friends. It is situated nearby to Hyderabad Airport. I just loved the place. I saw so many sets of different films. It took complete one day to go through each and every part of Ramoji Film City. It's a complete one day picnic. I have enjoyed throughly. 
,,,,,"Ramoji Fiml City is the largest film city in the world and it is a good place to visit with family for a day of incursion. It has fun rides, film sets and the most popular Bahubali movie set."
,,,,,"ramoji is like a dream. I had not experienced anything like this before in one go. As it is spread in a huge area you need to board a bus to reach the first point from where your MAGICAL JOURNEY BEGINS. From there it is that super  sweet red bus to take you along.It is so interesting and intriguing and beautiful that you dont want it to end. Honestly you cannot see all in a day. Though I visited this place 2 years ago I m still in love with it. When this covid menace is over I would certainly go there again to regenerate myrself.  Its just lovely. I can bet that like me you too will be amazed. Go and visit if you are in hyderabad.  If you don't see ramoji you will regret it for sure. But a little piece of caution. The story goes that it is haunted, which is still a mystery for me."

Ramoji_Film_City,Kaushik G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Absolutely amazing experience,"We had visited Ramoji Film City on a day tour during our holiday in Hyderabad. We had booked tickets online through Makemytrip priced at 1150 rupees per person and collected physical tickets from the counter at Ramoji Film City. Once inside the gate, a bus took us to the actual amusement park area. There was a grand welcome show with song and dance at 9.45 am. Next we boarded their red bus for a grand tour which took us to different locations like Bahubali movie set, Japanese Gardens, London street, Butterfly park, Bird park, Kripalu caves and many more. In the 2nd half we attended different mind boggling shows out of which the best was the Spirit of Ramoji show. In between we squeezed time for burgers and fries. To sum it up, this was surely one of the great experience to cherish for a lifetime."

It is listed as the World's largest film studio, and indeed the tram tour dovers acres of land and a multitude of film sets. You can possible see ongoing filming and the attractions and occasional performers that you meet are entertaining.As an visiting American, I wasn't familiar with the films that had been made here, but nonetheless was impressed with the studio lots and the tram tour. Everything was professionally done and the staff was good about getting people back ontime after each stop. I note that the tour was not in English, but that didn't really affect my ability to enjoy and understand what we were seeing."

,,,,,Must to do while you are in Hyderabad. Plan one full day activity as so much things to see and activities to do. This place entertainers not only kids and teenagers but to all age groups. Well organized guided tour and memorable experience from the moment you step in until you leave the place. Whole property is very well maintained. Plenty of photo options for photography lovers.While we come across each sets it reminds of some movie of any Indian language. Highlight is Bahubaali set for our group. Lot of walking involved inside but great experience.Definitely with high standards and competitive comparison with other similar concept around the world. It was not really fully crowded probably because of school examinations time and week day as well. Great memorable experience. Descent food options available inside at decent price range. Definitely 5 stars and each penny worth spending.
