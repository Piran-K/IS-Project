Ratnalayam_Temple,Somaseshu Gutala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,A very beajutifuul temple with landscaped garden and sculptures nearer to the city,"On my Visit to Ratnalayam (Shamirpet, Hyderabad)For city people, ‚ÄúRatnalayam temple‚Äù is a nearby sacred place of Lord Venkateshwara where one can see a model temple construction with beautiful surroundings, serene atmosphere, clean ambiance and modern facilities. This temple was constructed by T.R.Venkatesh just for family worship, but gradually expanded into a big temple. This temple was inaugurated by Swami Jayendra Saraswati on 19th February, 2003 with blessings of Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji Just like Birla temple, this temple is a tourist attraction. Here many T.V. serials are shot showing the landscape and shady trees dotted with beautiful fountains and statues. This temple is located at Aliapur Cross Roads near Aliabad bus stop. From the temple arch, it is only 200 meters distant.  It is nearly 30 kms from Hyderabad. The famous Saraswati temple at Wargal is just 25 kms away from this place. So, one can plan to visit both places.People of all ages including kids find this place quite interesting and delightful. The architecture of this temple and landscaped gardens is quite attractive and impressive. There is wide parking space with a beautiful garden at the entrance with water fountain structures in the form of Lord‚Äôs sacred Namam flanked by Shanku and Chakram. At another place one can see a fountain with figures of Lord Vishnu reclining on Adisesha with Lakshmi near His feet. The statue of Krishna dancing on the hoods of Kaliya amidst waters is another eye-catching spectacle. As one ascends the steps towards the main temple one can see the shrine of Lord Ganesha near the entrance. The statue in the main temple resembles the idol of Lord Venkateshwara in Tirupati. Lotus carvings in attractive colors are seen on the ceiling of the central hall. Poojas are done here as per Pancharatra Agama of Vaishanavite tradition. On either side of the main sanctum there are sub-shrines for Goddess Padmavati and Goda Devi. The idols are made of black granite and look very beautiful decked with jewelry and floral decorations. These idols were sculptured by the famous sculptor Sri Ganapathy Sthapathy and were brought from Kanchipuram. Near the main hall or mukha mandapam, there is a counter for selling tickets for various poojas and for selling prasadam packets. While going down the stairs on the way, there is a shrine of Goddess Kanyaka Parameshwari. There is also another shrine for Lord Hanuman.  In this temple there is a hall for doing tonsuring (Kalyana katta), a lecure-hall, a hall for performing homams, a goshala(cattle-shed). Along with temple rituals one can also perform ceremonies like Aksharabhyasam, Anna Prashan, Namakaranam, Sayanarayana Vratam, Gopuja and Vahana Pooja. Special poojas and rituals are done on festive days like Vaikunta Ekadashi, Janmashtami, Dussehra, Diwali and Sankranti. There is a separate area with swings and slides for kids to play. There is a small canteen beside the garden.  It is really a visual treat for city people to spend their time along with their kids in this temple located in serene and scenic surroundings. The temple timings are from 6.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon and from 4.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m."
