Salar_Jung_Museum,Tripping With Praj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,A Unique Experience,"I had read a lot about the Salar Jung museum before visiting it as it is one of the top tourist attractions in Hyderabad. The best section of this museum is the Ivory artefacts on display which are simply amazing. The fine carving and craftwork is something you should not miss out on. Other than this, there is a small clock tower which is supposed to be the showstopper. Every hour, a miniature soldier comes out of the clock tower and rings the Gong. This was a big disappointment for me and feel it is overhyped. Other than these, the museum has a wide range of artefacts and collection that depicts the ancient history of the city."

Salar_Jung_Museum,Daniela R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,In desperate need of renovation,"Very interesting exhibits and artifacts, but this museum needs a major renovation. Even without the renovation, the exhibits should be kept clean: there was thick dust visible on most glass items, as well as on the shelves on which they were placed. Access to second floor should be marked as I spent 10 minutes looking for the stairs."

Salar_Jung_Museum,AjithBhaskaran,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Interesting collection,"Located near Charminar, this museum offers good experience. It is preferable to take a guide from inside the museum. Need to spend around 2 hours inside if you are a casual visitor and more, if you are into research/history. It appears that a few items are not displayed for public, possibly due to renovation. Taxis are not allowed inside and you need to get dropped outside the gate."

Salar_Jung_Museum,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021,Salr Jung Museum Part-1,"If there is one place that you must visit in Hyderabad, it is this place. You cannot see all the exhibits in one day. To fully enjoy the exhibits, you need to plan at least six visits, spending three to four hours every time. This is exactly what we did. We will be sharing with you the key highlights from each visit. There is an excellent cafeteria on ground floor where you can get lunch and snacks. A smaller cafeteria exists on first floor of Western Wing too.Cameras are allowed and photography fee is mere Rs. 50. Mobiles are allowed only on payment of Rs.50 and you can take pics with your mobile. There is also excellent locker service where for a token fee of Rs.10 you can deposit your stuff. Entrance tickets for domestic tourists is Rs.10.The highlight of museum is Bracket clock. There is huge crowd at 12 noon. So, avoid and go early to reach museum at 10.30 when it opens. Spend some time admiring the veiled Rebecca and marble sculptures in galler-7. Then come out of gallery and sit in the viewing gallery at 10.50 am to have a good view of the bracket clock. Enjoy the 11 am performance. After this you can visit Ivory gallery (Room 6), Walking sticks gallery (Room 8), Arms and Armor gallery (Room 9), Metal ware gallery (Room 10), Indian Modern paintings gallery (Room 11) and Miniature paintings gallery (Room-12).By now you will be completely exhausted. You can have tea/coffee in the cafeteria, lunch or light snacks and come back. Watch out for our next review of the museum!"
Salar_Jung_Museum,Chanchal K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2020 • Couples,Disappointed in this place.,"Disappointed, You should skip it you won’t regret.Nothing was really interesting, heavily crowded. Plus it’s really hot inside due to lack of proper ventilation."
Salar_Jung_Museum,Christopher F,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2021 • Solo,Very Disappointed,"Reading reviews and descriptions of this museum made it sound very interesting. This museum is made up of one man’s collection allegedly the largest collection making it up a single Museum.  I do realize that museums in India are not up to par with like museums in the western world but the descriptions I read made it sound as if this museum could stand with some of the best museums in the world, it does not. The items in the museum vary greatly from western art, Asian arts, two some interesting archaeological pieces from the Indus Valley. That being said there really are no exquisite pieces that you must see most of the collection was dated from The 18th and 19th centuries AD, not very old pieces. So all in all the collection was not very impressive, at least to me.￼ The actual museum building was also a let down. Some rooms were totally stripped of all the cabinets but were left open, everything needed to be painted, and there were big empty rooms with dirty furniture laid out in no special way.￼ Because this was the first day after reopening due to Covid I can understand why the food court was 90% empty but it look like the gift shop has been closed for a very long time so there was no place to buy souvenirs. I was very much let down by this museum nor would I recommend it to friends or family. But as most everywhere else in India the people, the staff are great￼ and I really appreciate their hospitality."
Salar_Jung_Museum,Prachet,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,Missing the Most Famous Exhibit at the Famed Salar Jung,"My experience shows it pays to do your homework.  By the time I realized the musical clock put up a neat display at the hour, I had breached the frontier by 14 minutes.  Other than that, the museum is a nice way to spend one-two hours exploring the city. "

Salar_Jung_Museum,nms01,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Impressive!,Neat and clean but in dire need of good signages as there is a lot to see in this museum. Loved the Ivory room and the Veiled Rebacca statue. There is a lot of history enclosed in this huge museum. Need a good 2-3 hours to give this place justice. Also The Musical clock demonstration draws a lot of crowd at noon. Some of the lifts were not working which impeded the elders in our family from visiting the upper floors!
Salar_Jung_Museum,Narendar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,best place but worst food court,do not eat at the food court inside the museum. They charged 15rs for a single samosa that you get for 5rs outside but still served a day before's stale samosa.

Salar_Jung_Museum,Oneil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Beautiful !!!,We were impressed by the collection in the museum. The only hitch like in most other museums in India is that the glass covers on all the artefacts are filthy & stained resulting blurred viewing & bad photographs with glares.

Salar_Jung_Museum,Jimmycontra,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Salarjang museum,"We had gone to see Salar Jang museum as we had so much about it. I had been to see it in my youth, when it was in its original palace. This time it was a big let down, whole sections were closed , the reason given was the museum was being renovated. But the inside story is that a lot of good items have been stolen or sold off. There is less than half of the original items collected over a lifetime. There is still a few items worth seeing. Some of the marble statues, especially the lady in a veil n the double sided statue, the best in the world. The mechanical clock which was kept along with several others is now kept in an auditorium like room n on the day we went the room was filled with school children all shouting n chatting loudly n fooling around so you could not see the clock or hear it well at midday. Overall if you have not seen it, it’s worth seeing. It’s value for money. But if this is your second visit you are likely to be disappointed."

Salar_Jung_Museum,JeffCarter,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Very large ,"I am not a big fan of museums and when I travel we rarely stop to visit them, but local people highly suggested I pay a visit to this museum so I did I was told to allocate about 90 minutes at least and that was probably just enough time there are endless rooms across two or three levels with massive amounts of art to view it was almost too much to take in some of the stuff was just amazing. You could wander from room to room for days. Very incredible and definitely worth see there’s a lot here and if something is an interesting you just skip that room or skip that level and they’ll be something else around the corner. There was a large film presentation going on but I missed it so I’m not sure what it was and there were lots of school kids attending as well. If you are into museums you might need even more than 90 minutes. Definitely worth a visit I would recommend it. There did not seem to be much air conditioning and I went in January a cool time of year I could imagine during the high summer it might be a little uncomfortable with the heat."

Salar_Jung_Museum,raghukdev,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Sad to see,"The private collection is clearly one of world’s best. The state in which art is kept and displayed in the museum is abhor-able. The miniature art has no lighting, many of the statutes have a films of dust on it. Despite these conditions the museum draws many visitors. On many occasions I saw visitors touch the art work and at one location (Western Block) I saw 2 guards eating inside the hall ! Go fast as I believe this fantastic collection will soon be destroyed."

Salar_Jung_Museum,Ratnesh M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Travelling in the past,"Visited this piece of history in December, 2019. Ticket for Indians was available for Rs. 20/- and for foreigners it was Rs. 500/-. Guides were there at your service but for a payment. Even photography was subject to charge. But despite all these things, it is a must see attraction in Hyderabad where one could know how Arab people could could come to India and establish an Empire. The museum throws light on the high standard of living maintained by the Salar Jung's and their interminglings with the British. Yes, they're highly englishied. The museum is situated in an imposing building and at the entrance is a fire fighter unit used at that time which is peculiar in design. Inside on the ground floor are the exhibition of high valued furnitures, embroidered clothes, utensils used by the Salar Jungs - Salar Jung is a title. Items made of ivory exhibited there is    worth seeing - from chairs, tables to ornaments to show pieces to walking sticks to knives, all are praise worthy. The most noteworthy is however is the marble statue of the veiled Rebecca made in Italy whose veil too is made of marble. The upper floor contains gigantic halls used for meetings etc. If one happens to visit Hyderabad and has some spare time, one must visit this attraction."

Salar_Jung_Museum,Ravindra A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A 'Disneyland' for history lovers,"If you visiting Hyderabad, keep aside 3 to 4 hours atleast to visit this place. At the onset you will be mildly disappointed by the lack of proper info on many impressive exhibits, swells of random visitors who show scant regard for pieces of rich history of our own land, below average display design & poor lighting that takes away a lot from the mind boggling collection. But you will gradually get sucked into the 'time machine', transporting you to an era when being royalty meant some other worldly wealth & influence. Marvel at the uncut diamond studded swords, rare miniature paintings, exquisitely detailed clay toys & cringe at the jaw dropping quantum of Ivory artifacts on display. The marble sculpture collection is amazing. There are even jade & crystal back-scratchers will make you wish you had an itch that expensive :)  Please dont waste your time waiting for that mechanical clock in the central courtyard on the ground floor to strike on the hour. Its just a human figure walk out & walk back into the clock at the strike of the hour. Nothing more. Get an audio-guide device for yourself which is available inside the building at the counter right after your tickets are checked & security. Camera phones need to have a separate ticket purchased incase you want to click photos of the exhibits. A love for history, strong legs & half a day is what you need to visit this. Its well worth the effort."
