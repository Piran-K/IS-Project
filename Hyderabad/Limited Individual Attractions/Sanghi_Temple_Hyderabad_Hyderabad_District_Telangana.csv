Sanghi_Temple,rkmanchi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Beware of the monkeys. A bit out the way unless you are visiting Film City,"Earlier there was a way to get to the temple through Film City. That’s been stopped now which probably tells you that the temple is gaining in popularity.Having said that, the temple needs better upkeep. The water in the taps at the entrance often runs dry. Can’t do much about the monkey menace too I guess. I firmly believe it’s the people who are causing it by the constant feeding and pampering. With some donation, you can get to go inside the sanctum sanctorum for a Darshan. The idol of Lord Venkateswara is well adorned and the Pooja is performed well.In summer the stone floor can get very hot to walk on so please be wary. Don’t carry any food and if you are carrying water please be wary of the monkeys. The temple is atop a hill but there is ample parking. "

Sanghi_Temple,funesc111,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,What can go wrong!,"1. If you are using Uber/ Ola etc., remember that you can face problems during return, especially in the evening after 7 pm.  The cabs that we were trying to book on return were always 10-12 km away and they had to come through the Ramoji Film City, which i guess was not allowed so easily.  So it took us lot of time to get a cab in the evening.  And if you don't have a cab, you will be just stuck at the top2. There is no lift/ elevator/ mini bus facility and for elders, it is almost impossible to climb-up or down some 200 stairs (approximate) 3. The toilets (which are down stairs) can surely give you a UTI (urinary tract infection).  They are filthy.  There is just no water.  Taps are broken.  We did not find drinking water/ toilet facility at the top, where the temple is located4. Flooring around the temple is uneven.  Not even cemented properlyWhat is good - Playful monkeys, may be little bit of scenery during monsoons, and of course a thought about the Lord!!"

Sanghi_Temple,rimjhim,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Not at all maintained!,"We went to Sanghi Temple yesterday as a part of a family outing. The timings on the internet were mentioned as 8:30 to 10:30 AM and 4 PM to 6 PM so we rushed to reach there on time in the evening. The road to the temple is quite nice. It doesnt feel as if you are in Hyderabad as there is greenery on both sides. The entrance hoarding to the temple showed different timings...Its open in the evenings from 4 PM TO 8 PM contrary to what is mentioned on the web and on Sundays it is open from 8AM to 8PM.The temple is not well maintained at all. The grass and greenery that was there a few years back is no longer there. There were muddy patches everywhere and very little of grass. No floral plants as seen a few years back. So the only so called beauty is in terms of the temple structure. The priests seemed highly reluctant to do any kind of ""free"" service like offering teertham , flowers etc. It was a major put off. We stayed there till 5:30pm and there was no light in the sanctum sanctorum which was dark inside and made it diffcult to see the idols. Very demotivated temple staff.The temple has quite some numbers of monkeys around which are a nuisance. They kept coming near us when we were seated on the benches , forcing us to leave the seats.Overall it was a disappointment. The only plus point was the weather. Theres no point driving to the outskirts of the city to see a barren temple land and priests who are highly demotivated!The citys Jagannath temple in Banjara hills seemed much better option !!"

Sanghi_Temple,Krishna_2111,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Serene Temple.,"Been to this temple as a kid and multiple times along with friends. The drive from the city in the 90's was itself a great experience for youngsters. The temple itself is on top of a hill and is maintained beautifully.  It is all built in a white marble that enhances the beauty of the temple. There is a lot of place to sit peacefully and meditate on the lawn inside the temple premises. Most of the telugu movies are shot here owning to its beauty and popularity. For anyone living in Hyderabad or visiting, this is a must go."
