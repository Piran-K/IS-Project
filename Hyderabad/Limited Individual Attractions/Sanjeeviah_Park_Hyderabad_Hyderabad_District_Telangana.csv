Sanjeeviah_Park,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Nicely maintained parks,"This is one of the few nicely maintained parks in Hyderabad. Though it tends to get crowded later in the day, it is best visited in the morning. The park opens at 5.30 am and till 8.30 morning walkers come. You can stroll around, sit on one of the benches or exercise with regulars... it is good fun. For some reason cameras are allowed on hefty payment of Rs.1000 but you are allowed to shoot with your mobile. So be prepared to pay this huge sum if you must carry your camera. Entry fee other wise is just Rs.5."

Sanjeeviah_Park,Janet S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Good by Hyderabad standards,"This became one of our favorite places to walk while staying in Hyderabad because there were a couple areas in the park that actually were lovely, by any international standards...a rare thing in Hyderabad!  Of note is the rose garden, at the entrance, and the rock & desert plant garden in the back corner behind the rose garden.  Both are off limits to normal visitors.  We were told each time we tried to enter ""no entry"" and a security/gardener lady would come over to usher us out.  Finally, we just pretended not to understand and went wandering through anyway.  The desert area is amazing, with some plants that I had never even seen before.  Well maintained and pristine, without trash!  After the first time, we just continued to not pay attention to the ""no entry"" and finally they would give up.  After a couple days, they stopped bothering us and we wandered alone through these areas.  The entire park is large and well utilized during the weekends, turning into a huge party place with the resulting trash.  The playground is in deplorable condition, but entrance fee is only Rs 15."

Time and Money are crucial factors here.The park makes it not a tourist point but a leisurely quiet activity.The park is a place far from the hustle bustle of the raging traffic of the city and a pleasant place to spend time.A tiny entry fee is charged.Parking space is available. Eatables, I did not notice."
Sanjeeviah_Park,Sanjeev_Sharma,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012,Okiee,nothing much to do or sayideal for a lazy time if your are looking for. from the hectic all around activities you can spent some time relaxing here by just lying on the green lawns spread accross
Sanjeeviah_Park,Debojitroy,1.0 of 5 bubbles,,The atmosphere of the place is worst.,"Its a challenge for them who can stand there for more then 30 min. Air and water is so polluted that its difficult to stand there. The park is beautiful,  but the atmosphere makes it worst. The another bad thing is u can't go with your camera. But now a days mobile has more  8 mp  camera. I don't know whats the logic behind this."
