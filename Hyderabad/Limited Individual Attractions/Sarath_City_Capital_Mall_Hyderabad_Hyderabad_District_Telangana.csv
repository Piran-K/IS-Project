Sarath_City_Capital_Mall,beyondtravel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Back in business,"The lockdown seems to have halted bustling city for almost 4 months, but it was great to be back at sarath city mall. Most of shops are open however the crowd is mostly on weekends. With amb cinemas still not functional, it may take some time to get back to new normal. Most of food court restro are back to normal with limited option"

Sarath_City_Capital_Mall,Lavanya S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Good experience terrible staff,"I took my kids to Sarath City Mall after hearing great things about it. This review is largely about our experience in the 4th floor gaming area. I am writing this review so that parents are cautious to look out themselves for their kids safety and to make management aware of how poorly trained the staff is. I work in customer service and it really baffled me why anyone would be paid money for such poor performance at work. This is what happened.We reached the 4th floor gaming area at around 2 pm on a weekday. It was not crowded at all except for a large group of college kids in some college t shirts. I assumed they were there on some kind of college sponsored visit and didn't think much. The games asked for a card and I couldn't see where I could swipe my debit card. I looked around for staff but only saw the aforementioned college group chatting and playing some of the games. For the water ride, there wasn't even any staff managing it. I told my kids to stay and went walking around to see who could help us. I was shocked to find out that these 'college kids in uniform' were the staff!!To me they had appeared like other customers. Two girls were sitting on some rides and even when we went and stood near them for our turn they did not get off. I asked one of them why aren't they helping us. I also asked to speak to a manager. The manager just apologized. After I expressed my disappointment and told him I would write a review was when a staff member came to help my kids. See second picture.In an age when customer staff is competing with each other to win customers, I found this attitude shocking. Why aren't these kids trained? What are they getting paid for? Except this experience, we really enjoyed the food in the food court and the exceptional service in all the other stores we went to. There is a good bouncy house too on the lower or first level that my kids liked. Advice to families: Go for the rides and watch out yourself for your kids safety. Ask questions. Ensure your kids are safely buckled in. Don't expect to get any help from staff."

Sarath_City_Capital_Mall,JYach,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Miserable!,"I am so sorry ..Usually my reviews are upbeat and pleasantHere is a rare exception...- poor welcome- poorer still security engagement- shabby smelly male bathrooms- poor internal signage to navigate a complicated and confusing mall- so many vacancies- in my view, a mall in search of a strategic letting plan!Sadly, a shadow of what it could be!"
Sarath_City_Capital_Mall,Dil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,SARATH CITY CAPITAL MALL,"The only mall in Hyderabad that's designed from a user's point of view. No parking hassles, no ticket meters with people who's only job is to push a button. Escalators going up and down are not spread out on the opposite sides of a floor. Well segmented shopping areas and the best of all? Two food courts. One at the top floor and one at the ground floor. Everything is super convenient. Easily the best mall in Hyderabad."
