Shilparamam_Cultural_Society,Bhaskar_10,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Promoting Indian Craft: good exposure to craftsman and customers,"Visited on 28th December 2022Entrance Fee is INR 60/- per adult and INR 20/- per childThere was a theme based exhibition going on in ShilpaRaman till 31-Dec'22 and the crafts on display included kalamkari, Orissa Ikat, Gujarat Patola, Macrame from Bengal, Wood Craft, Bhagalpuri, Indore/Maheshwars, Leather products amongs many others.The quality of products on display showcased the rich and vivid talent of the crafts of India and prices ranged from couple of thousand to more than hundred tousand depending of the products.The visitors included mostly families while some youngters (seemingly college students) also visited in groups and interacted with teh craft-people.Very well designated place with paid parking and is a must viist while in Hyderabad.The only challange is the exit gate of the parking being too far, the visitors have to walk into teh parking to get into their vehicle and many could be seen walking along the incoming vehicle which is dangerous. If the management can look into a viable solution it will be appreciated."

Shilparamam_Cultural_Society,Fairy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Family,Indian Ethnic Crafts Village,"Shilparamam is an Indian ethnic crafts village. A good place to spend a leisurely evening and fulfil your desire of shop till you drop, on Indian ethnic handicrafts. They have a large display and sale of handicrafts from artisans from across the country. One can find handmade pottery, metal craftwork, ethnic outfits, sarees from Banaras and other South Indian states, handbags from Gujarat, embroidered patchwork runners and cushions, crochet outfits and bags and lots more. The shopkeepers don’t have any fixed rates, and there is a lot of bargaining going around the shops, which makes one feel if they have actually paid a reasonable price. One thing one must keep in mind here while purchasing is that these artisans don’t earn much sitting here all year long. We must be reasonable while bargaining with them. Most times they do quote random exorbitant prices, which is not fair too. So it is ultimately at the customers’ discretion if they want to buy it or not. Just compare prices in other stall before making a purchase. The place is mostly well maintained, and one can move around leisurely shopping and enjoying the village themed ambience. There are lot of food stalls, but we have never tried any of those as the hygiene is questionable at the stalls. The food stalls in particular are not maintained very well. They are just filthy. You may choose to visit this place in the evening to avoid the sun and heat, as the place is sprawling and expansive and totally open to air. On Sundays they have some beautiful ethnic performances in their open air amphi theatre, which are a treat. It is truly refreshing to see these performances to actually enjoy the true milieu."

Shilparamam_Cultural_Society,ShaanRoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Expensive to shop around,its basically a market where businessmen from different states have set up their shops to sell their goods at a very expensive price.

Parking is available in the basement for 30/- for four wheelers and 20/- for two wheelers. Entry fee is 50/-. Its a big area and will take half a day to roam around. Visit during the evening to avoid heat.

Not sure if the wash rooms are clean.

Shilparamam_Cultural_Society,PGNJ10,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Nice outdoor place for the evening,"By Indian standards, this is a pretty nice place to visit., Highlights1. Can buy handicrafts directly from artisans. As other reviewers have mentioned, bargain well. You can get stuff at 50% of the first quote. It will be harder for non-Indians and north Indians to bargain. So go with someone local if you plan to purchase something expensive. 2. Cultural shows in the evening are interesting. You cannot expect Cirque Du Soleil in $1 ticket. There is a decent effort to manage mosquitoes. Expect few bites if you are not fully covered.3. Boating can be fun for someone who has never done boating. Frequent travellers to USA and Europe may find it childish though. Water can be smelly and again full of mosquitoes. 4. Provides some trees and green environment in the concrete jungle. So you can walk around if the weather is good. Negatives:]1. Street dogs roam around free. 2. Kids are plucking flowers despite warning signs.3. Mosquitoes"

Shilparamam_Cultural_Society,GreenCarpet11,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,Essence of India,"Lights up and the village industries come alive here, even the earth becomes fragrant with the culture of India.It brings up to your mind a myriad images from your past and a happiness that you can grasp no more.Yet, those beautifully crafted items that gleam around your eyes were crafted with hard working hands to earn a few pennies more to feed those who depend on them for a living. Mind you, when lights are out and when daylight streams in too there is a lot to see . The India still lives under the blazing sun or the winter cold , the hand made items, the subtly painted figures dance and prance about on the vases and urns.You run into very beautifully bent arches fitted with lights and flocks grazing all time by the riverside, an idyllic site from greeting cards, very old houses with thick walls which are disappearing today, handmade bags, Rajasthani arts and crafts, bangles and chains and trinkets, wrought iron stuff, jewel boxes, Kashmir carpets, pure cotton sarees, terra cota  and endless little things one would enjoy.It is open everyday. There are museums and parks where you can stroll about. A small theater for entertainment shows typically Indian.   Entry fee is minimal.Enjoy the evenings.Do not litter.  "
