Shilparamam,Andrew D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,A cultural orientation,"Shilparamam is suprisingly lovely. I thought it would be a tacky tourist trap, but it is actually quite insightful.When you enter, there is a bazaar where arts and crafts from all around India are sold. For me, the highlight is the Handicraft Museum where you can learn about the crafts from different parts of India. The Bird Park, while a small area, does surprisingly exhibits interesting bird species! The Sculpture Park is another must-visit, and there is also a nice Cultural Show at the amphitheatre in the evening."
Shilparamam,stevebintley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Great spot in an evening,"It might feel rather touristy at first but this is a great place to visit and is more than just stalls of mass produced goods. There’s entertainment on a large stage, some truly handmade crafts if you look close enough and plenty to admire with the statues and small museum in the centre. The colours are fantastic and none of the sellers were overly pushy, but remember to haggle if you do end up buying anything! A must visit when in the city!"
Shilparamam,aruna,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Thiefs at Shilparamam parking lot,"Parking lot has many thief, they will take your away if you leave handbags and money in cars. Don't keep hand bangs or any luggage in shilparamam parking lot, its not safe place to park vehicle, they will charge 30rs for parking but will not care about your car."
Shilparamam,Arvind Kumar Yerram,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Wonderful. Must visit,A beautiful ethnic crafts village. Crafts & artefacts are all available at very reasonable prices. Ample parking spaces. Paddle Boating available inside. Quite a good number of photo ops moments. Best place in Hyderabad for genuine and authentic crafts items for moments and gifts.  We can easily spend an entire evening here looking at the crafts are relaxing on the water side or in the greenery. Calm and serene. Must visit to carry some memories and memorabilia. Most of the crafts here are hand crafted.
Shilparamam,A N C NATARAJAN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Family,For Few Good Clicks and Handicrafts,"Recreation of Villages makes this place a must visit. They have tried to build all that you would remember if villages - bullock carts, mud houses, canals, lake, waterfalls etc  Sell a lot of handicraft articles. Better Bargain well. We grabbed a clay vessel out of the plethora of earthenware put for sale. Plenty of shops for home decor but we were more convinced with the door hangers sold at the entrance/exit. The best takeaway was the potrait of my 20 months old son, surprised that he cooperation for 2 minutes and went spellbound that the artist completed the picture within 5 mins.Covid restrictions not followed. No social distancing."
Shilparamam,Veer2468,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Must visit when in Hyderabad,This is definitely a must visit place in Hyderabad. The entry tickets are a little pricey. The stuffs are ethnic. However lot of bargaining needs to be done.

Shilparamam,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Must visit,"Plan to spend at least four-five hours at this place. There is so much to see. There are three museums inside the complex- Handicraft museum, Leather Puppet museum and Village museum. There is open air sculpture park. There are nice walkaways and a small lake inside the complex. And you have shops selling variety of handicraft items. But bargain hard. Most of the stuff you can get at 50% of the quoted rate. There is also a nice food court where you can get ethnic food. Entrance fee is Rs.60. Normal digital cameras are allowed but if you have one with adjustable or long lens then the fee is Rs.500. There is ample parking space."

Shilparamam,Neelam_Macwan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,Shopping,"The place was on a list for a while, so decided to go there on a Saturday. It's venture by the state government to promote art and culture not only of Telangana but alos of other states. The place has 2-3 galleries and many stalls where one can buy traditional clothes, jewellery and decor items mainly. Also, it accommodates an amphitheater where there was a Bharatnatyam performance going on. It is extremely clean and very well maintained. I feel it is a smaller version of Nampally Exhibition. A must visit place in Hyderabad."
Shilparamam,Jay Pradhan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Traditional Handicrafts Village,"Shilparamam is a traditional handicrafts village. The entry fee per adult is INR 50. I found a lot of traditional toys, sarees, ornaments & clothes here. They also have handmade purses, cup sets & stone idols. They organise a traditional dance in the evening, it was quite delightful to watch. All the prices will be high and one has to bargain to get a decent price. Overall a good place to venture into old traditional handicraft tour."

Definitely not as big as the one in Delhi & not as well represented by all states of our country. Bargaining -  20 to 30% is a must. A lady can easiy spend 2 to 3 hours here. Men & Kids may find it boring. A couple of small eateries catering for fast food is available inside. Just opposite across the road a good vegetarian restauran 'Chutneys ' is there if you want an elaborate meal. It is advisable to visit in the evening to avoid the Hyderabad Heat."

Shilparamam,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,Must visit this place if you love Art and Handicrafts,"I have been to this place several times before. Every time you visit here it feels so nice and your heart wakes your skills that were sleeping for a while internally. You feel like you must spend some time on your hobbies that improve your creativity.One more reason is you can buy lot of useful things that are hand made, starting from foot wear, hand printed clothes, decorative items, statues and what not everything under one roof. You can find the same things in exhibition also. But here there is some special reason I found only after I visited there.Go there when you have liesure time. Happy Shopping and enjoy the visit."

Hand crafted  and some creative items are exhibiting there so if we preferred to buy we can buy better price if you you know how to negotiate better 😉
Shilparamam,Venkataraman M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Not worth it!,"During the planning of our trip to Hyderabad, was told that this is one of the ""must see"" areas in the city. The closest comparision given was that of Dilli Haat, where I have been to and have enjoyed the experience there. I was therefore quite looking forward to the visit to this place. The place has an entry ticket of Rs. 50 for all adults (over the age of 10 years). The place was a complete disappointment and a waste of time. If you are coming here because you want to see the handicrafts and small scale/ cottage industry products, there are many other options available these days, where such exhibitions are held in nearly all the cities.There were very few traders there and the prices quoted by them were exorbitant. If you chose to walk away, you will get an immediate drop in price by as much as 33%. Clearly shows that the shopkeepers there have also become desperate.My recommendation is stay away and use your time more wisely in the city."

Shilparamam,Bruce M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Great shopping for souvenirs and gifts,"This is by far the best open air shopping area in Hyderabad. 50INR admission is worth it. Area is clean and well maintained. Shopping is from individually licensed shopkeepers with specific stalls assigned. Be prepared to bargain anywhere from 25-60% in the price of items. The amount to be bargained depends on the uniqueness of the item and amount of hand work required.  For instance, the pashmina comes in a wide array of quality and print and many shops have it, bargain at least 50%.  Hand painted terra-cotta is much less coin and hand painted. Recommend coming in the evening when it’s cooler. Uber might be difficult during the rush hour. "
