Shri_Ashtalakshmi_Temple,Manu,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Best Lakshmi Devi temple in Hyderabad,"I am a regular visitor to Ashta Lakshmi temple in Hyderabad. Its maintnance is admirable and we see all 8 avatars of Lakshmi Devi. But in 2019 it has raised ticket prices drastically. Last year(2018) I spent Rs.101 for Vahana Pooja(T/W) on Dussehra but in 2019 it is increased to Rs 251 and more over poojari who performed vahanapooja demanded Rs.101 and servents Rs. 50. Poojari shouted at a man who gave him Rs. 50 as he didnt give 101 and insulted him throwing that Rs. 50 to a Cleaner. My point is people go to temple with a peaceful mind to get the blessings of godess and the Priest. But if a priest behaves with devotees like this it hurt them a lot and creates negetive impression on it's commercial side. On top of it this Priest had pan masala also. I would ask management to look into it and protect people religious sentiments especially on special occations. Regards,Manohar"

Astalakshmi temple arch is located on the main road towards dilsukhnagar to L.B nagar besides more super market. The location of this temple is in vasavi colony. Opposit to the temple there is big open plot converted to free parking place by the temple authority. I parked my car in the place provided. We washed our legs and entered in the temple.When we entered the temple our hearts filled spiritual power and silence, thanks to Goddess Astalaxmi. Our children also very much enjoyed and meditated for half an hour. Photograpy inside the temple is prohibited, so we took the photographs on stairs. My children are really enjoyed. I surpriced to my childrens behaviour in the temple, generally they are very talkative at home and when we are shopping, but when we enter in the temple, there minds filled with spiritual power, they are completely silent, maybe the environment in the temple.We stayed there for two hours and went back to home with peace of mind heartfully and decided to come every weekend.Thanks n regardsSudheer.G8885559150"
