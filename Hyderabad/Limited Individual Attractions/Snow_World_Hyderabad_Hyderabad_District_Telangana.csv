Snow_World,AmitG17,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Not that much worth...!!,"We visited in afternoon time for slot of 5.30 PM. Ticket price was ₹600 for adult and ₹450 for kids over 2.5 years. You will get equipments like jacket, shoes, gloves , socks etc from the staff there, but sometimes they are very oversized.. They have kept it well with snow games, dance etc but considering ticket prices, it is not that worth really! It's overpriced place.. but if you've never been to any snow place in India, then it can be a good place to enjoy it"
Snow_World,Krishna Sandeep Siram,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Good But Over Priced,Best place for experiencing snow and ice in summer for fun But limited time is permitted. Litlle bit overpriced but good.
Snow_World,sivaprasadsahu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Weekend Visit to Snow World,"Just casually we were roaming around necklace road seeing the decorations of Republic Day when we came across Snow World. This was a place which she wanted to go long back but as we stay in Lingampally don't come this side often, so thought to give it a whirl. The snow world didn't dissapoint us, the inside was freezing and I guess it would be 2-3 degrees. The snow was quite clean on the floor. Not much to do inside apart from clicking pics and going on the snow slide. I would recommend to go in larger groups to enjoy as there is a mini volley ball area, and a DJ floor too. This place would be great for kids too. The jackets were good but the gloves were really thin and the gum boots were too large so the snow was going inside from the top. Should add more games or attractions inside.The other attractions that came with the packahe was the Living Dead (Scary House) which was a completely joke if u ask me but then again it costs 30/ head so mehhh... Then there is the Rain forest which is also below okayish.... Amd at last there is the Kaleddo which is essentially the Mirror Maze which was around average as the area was not so big that you would puzzle out, the mirrors were also a little dusty so one could figure out the way.Overall worth to go once. Package is 500/head if only Snow world and 600/  head for all the things that I mentioned above."

Its Mussorie in Hyderabad this summer . Explore it and have fun. I loved with my friends throwing snow at each other."
Snow_World,savvyuec,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Get your expectation right before visiting,"The actual venue is a large room with frozen snow on the ground and with a few large models (not made of snow) like the igloo, a snow man, yeti etc. There is slide ride that you can take. There is NO ARTIFICIAL SNOW FALL. For what they call a show is basically turning on the music and a large water sprayer. For all this they charge 500/- per head for Adults and 300/- for children. Photography: You are not allowed to carry your cell phones inside. You can however carry camera on payment of 50/-. There is photographer inside who charges Rs 100/- for every click and is in a rush to just click and get done with it. Also you need to wait for upto 30 mins assuming you get bored and leave out early as this guy can only give prints once the show slot ends.  Experience: If you have seen a snow fall or snow in your life YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE THIS PLACE a PASS. The place is a absolute waste of time and it may be a harassing experience because of the crowd for you and your family as you need to wait in a queue for up to 45 mins to get in after the ticket purchase. Total not worth the time or the money (except for a kid seeing frozen ice for the first time).Also in my opinion is it avoidable if you have a toddler. Kids in the age group of 3 to 9 years may enjoy playing in the ice and someone who is seeing snow for the first time.We got out of the place within 25 mins.Logistics: - Parking is free.- You can take off your shoes inside and deposit at a counter as family in a bag which they will give you.- They also give a pair of socks, snow boots, jacket and gloves. Smaller sized stuff is available for kids although they fit may not be good."

Snow_World,Indrajit R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Really Nice,"WE were at the place on December 25, 2017. My God, you have to see the crowd !!! We thought we will never be able to reach the door in time. But to my utter surprise, we reached the entrance door in just 13 minute - such a organised place - and above all the law abiding, docile people. There was no breaking of line, no tramping of foot - nothing. The place inside is amazing - they have 1 hour slot for each group - and in that 1 hour you will feel like freezing. They spread ice mechanically once in this 1 hour period and you will get a small feeling of snow blizzard. They have rides inside. Also, they serve hot soups inside - nice to have. Once you are out, they have nice outlets for snacks / soups / tea / coffee.Above all, I am amazed at what an effective infrastructure they have created - so much so in that crowd, they manage everything almost picture perfect - hats off to the management and mainly to local people"
Snow_World,Chandu C,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,Not so good ,As the snow world is good but the problem is that it's smelling too much and u cannot stay inside for long time so I recommend u not to go there better 
Snow_World,devbajaj,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,"Poorly maintained, very average place","We went to this place on Dec 27, 2017.4 adults and 3 children.This place has 4 sections and here's my rating for them-1. Rain Forest- AVOID, waste of money and time. They've tried to create a dingy and scary rain forest experience which is actually pathetic2. Living Dead- AVOID, waste of money3. Kalledo - AVOID, waste of money4. Snow world- 45 minutes of being in an overcrowded room with snow on the floor, and a couple of rides. Snow was dirty. Getting in the snow world room will have you experience a stampede like situation so beware if you have small kids with you.Ticket prices we paid for combo of all 4 sections-Adult- 600 per personChildren- 400 per childTotal = 3700Sorry! No pictures. Mobiles are not allowed inside."
Snow_World,smandal2858,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Snow World,"Visit snow world Dec'17. It is situated beside Hussain Sagar Lake Tank bund road. Experience is average.

Snow_World,claritalewis,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,First visit in Snow,It was an awesome place to experience. Enjoyed every moment throwing the snow around. We visit during Diwali vacation. They also have lot of other options
Snow_World,Vinay Y,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Fun place to experience snow!,"This is a fun place to experience snow in Hyderabad. As someone who grew up in the Northeast USA (who now lives in Los Angeles, California, USA), seeing snow wasn't a huge thrill for me, but my wife and son have never seen snow or played in snow (since it doesn't snow in Los Angeles). It was organized and they provided all the jackets, boots, mittens, etc. It's a nice place to play in the snow and experience what it's like to live in a winter place.Since I grew up in a place where it snows nearly 5 months of the year, I can expertly say this was a good representation of how it feels like to experience snow and snow like cold weather.They only let people into the snow chamber at certain time slots (presumably to keep the place cold) and you cannot take cell phones or cameras with you; they want to sell you their photos.Just be careful with young children as many of the people throw snowballs and play a little rough in the snow, so young kids can get hit with snow or knocked down."
Snow_World,hemang m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Good place but bit expensive & way way too over crowded,"Snow WorldAnother delayed review. Went here with my family in 1st week of November. My 82 yr old grandma wanted to come with us as well but everyone including ticket staff at the venue, the official agency from where we booked the online tickets said sadly, she won't be allowed inside. We really wanted her to come with us [fyi still does everything on her own without needing any assistance] but the staff told us god forbid if anything wrong happens it would be our responsibility as the temparature inside is -5 degees, hence to be on a safer side she decided to wait outsideShe happily agreed to sit in the common lobby, so we all went in. We went for the late evening batch. Every batch lasts around roughly an hour. The premises are big enough. They have rock climbing, snow rides, basketball games, snow dance etc. It's really freezing inside so make sure you put your gear properly. My 30 month old daughter got really scared after someone by mistake & in pure fun threw some ice on her, hence my wife and I took turns to look after her just outside the exit.Pros:1) Extremely helpful Staff [talking about the ones sitting at the gear counters]2) The gear provided is washed / cleaned in warm water & only then given to the forthcoming batch.3) Allotted time of approx 1 Hour is just enough to enjoy the place.Cons:1) Expensive Ticket prices. @ 500 Rs for Adults is definately steep.2) We had 2 school groups in our batch who were COMPLETE NUISANCE. [Wish I could have noted their details to report it to their management]. Constantly yelling, pushing everyone & anyone before entering inside [hey I know everyone goes there to enjoy but enjoying at the expense of pushing, shoving others makes NO SENSE]. Security staff controls no one outside the main area, they are just least bothered.3) Snow World Management just fills up people like anything, literally anything. There should definately be a limit of allowing the visitors inside.Overall, one can surely visit the place when in Hyd but make sure you check the timings and the crowd. PS: Just like other places, there is a 30-40 Rs Digi Cam fees."

I was a little worried about whether they will be clean or not but they were.There is a garbage unit right next to Snow World so if you have to spend time at the outside waiting area you will have to bear the unpleasant stench."

Snow_World,Rajani K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Artificial world of snow,"This is an artificial world of snow. Several sheets of ice and snow cover the area. Special warm clothes need to be rented to go there.   It's more than enough to spend 1 hour there. There are rein deers/jingle bells music being played occasionally. Also, there is  ice skating and also you can play by throwing snow on each other."

Snow_World,FoodieYogiKrishna,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Snow in city of Biryanis !,A few years back had visited this snow world and had come back disappointed. But this time around better experience and hence the review. The facility itself looks very very old and lack of maintenance shows. Learnt that  crowd is very low except on holidays. Kids really loved the sight and feel of snow. It will be very slippery and utmost care has to be taken to not trip and hurt one self. Worth only for the snow world entry and not all the others (scary house etc.. ). My samsung s6 crashed and all the pics are lost :( . i had pictured the ticket to keep track of the prices too !!
Snow_World,Ritesh J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,An experience to have while in Hyderabad,"We have been to this place with our family friends and kids. The place is just fun to go if you haven't been to any place with real snow. They give gloves, shoes and jacket to wear. They have a standard size and you just need to wear it before entering the main chamber. Don't expect the gloves to clean though. I didn't find them hygienic and washed hands thoroughly once out. Once inside you understand how it is to be in snow for even around 30 mins. The time passes quickly inside. You have a small shop inside selling tea, coffee and sweet corn. Apart from that they have a snow laden slide and many other activities. In case if someone feels too cold then they have an exist which opens every few minutes and one can go out for sometime. It is advisable to go in a group so that you can enjoy with your own group. You might want to take a package which gives you opportunity to visit mirror maze and haunted house. They are not that great but  it's fun."
Snow_World,avenkat2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,kids loved it,"more shaved ice than fluffy snow, but kids enjoyed it nonetheless. it is cold inside, and chaotic. avoid going during holidays, you will have a bunch of college kids in there too. they have a fun ramp to slide down on, kids love it , parents who accompany them, not so much."
Snow_World,Giri P,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Very poorly managed venue ,Snow world falls way short of fun experience.i went by the positive reviews only to find the theme park in a pathetic state. The living dead and the rain forest were a joke. Irritating sounds with no hint of adventure or fear. Waste of time and money.The snow drome was overcrowded. They make u wear the snow gear and wait for 30 min in an enclosed area. A small area where there shouldnt be more than 20 people..they cram it with 100+ . Crowd manners are pathetic in our country. There was scary stampede to enter the snow drome once the gate was opened. Interiors were discoloured and depressing.dirty snow and noisy snow generators. Food was costly and tasteless. The tomato soup worth 50 bucks inside the snow drome was served in flimsy paper cups which just tore off with weight of soup.Overall it was very poorly managed profit making venture.
Snow_World,Asish P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,A small place with snow,Its fun to be inside for about 45 minutes in snow. But the ticket price of Rs.500 per adult is on higher side
Snow_World,pjanil1968,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Superb expereince,It is a wonderful experience to climb down through the snow. Also we can play volleyball etc on the snow. Cover your body properly with the warm cloths which they give
Snow_World,Prasobh K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Experience snowy chill @ Snow world,"Snow world in Hyderabad is a unique experience for those wanting to see and play in snow at chilling temperatures !! The cost is quiet high @ Rs.500/- for a time period of one hour in the snow world. They provide all necessary clothing including jackets, shoes, socks, gloves, etc. You have to leave mobiles outside. The entry is timed at intervals of 90 minutes - so check the timings before you reach the place since you do not want to be waiting for long time. Once you are in the snow world it takes some time to get used to the -5 C temp. One can play in the snow, there are balls and otehr stuff. There is also a steep slide on ice and adults/ older kids can do it. They also do some snow fall and play music for dance. Go to snow world to enjoy the chill !!"

Snow_World,Thakkarmeister,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Unique experience for Children and maybe adults,"The kids love it!! As an adult, If you have not experienced snow often in your life then its a fun place. The entry is a little steep at Rs 500. The time limit is 45 minutes. Clean protective clothing is provided including socks, shoes and gloves. No phones or electronic equipment is allowed inside so be sure to keep it in the car. I am not so sure if lockers are available. There is snow slide inside which most seemed to enjoy. "
