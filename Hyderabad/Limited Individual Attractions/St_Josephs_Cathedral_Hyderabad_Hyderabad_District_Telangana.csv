St_Josephs_Cathedral,GreenCarpet11,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,You got to see the Bells,"St. Joseph's Cathedral standing tall , aloft a high standing area.A church that stands there telling a story of the treasures it holds within.The Bell fascinates me. Can you imagine the Ave Maria being played on these bells.You got to hear it ring.Visit at around 12 in the noon and hear your heart thud with the clanging of the bells in your ears.The clock high on the Cathedral has been ticking since 1852?! It really speaks a great story from the depth of the past.The doors, the pieta, chandelier, the painting from the Nizam, the relic of the Holy Cross, The relic of St. Antony and a lot more. Feel like a prayer and a song.See it and enjoy it. Pray and Sing. You love it."

St_Josephs_Cathedral,Manish K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,Very beautiful and peaceful church,"St. Josephs Cathedral is located near Basheerbagh and is well worth a visit. I visited this cathedral as well as got to attend the mass (it's closed at other times). Worth seeing are the bell tower and the relief of St. Joseph holding the infant Jesus. Do not miss the lovely statues of Jesus Christ and all the apostles outside the church, they deserve a few photographs. A place which provides one peace and satisfaction."
