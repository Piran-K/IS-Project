The place has a large collection of unique cars in variety of shapes and sizes. We saw cars shaped like large football, pencil, cricket bat, cake, Shiva lingam, insects and what not. We had not visited any such Museum before and it was an amazing experience. "
Sudha_Cars_Museum,Ankur R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Not worth it!,"The concept of a car museum is good but here they simply added wheels to any random shape. No mind applied if it is worth it or not. if you are a car enthusiast, definitely it's not the right place, but kids may enjoy it."

This place is covered with very eye catching colorful cars consisting of Cake Car, Shoe Car, Bag car, Bed Car, Insect car, Lotus car, Snooker car, eraser car etc. All these cars are operational and they are designed and built within short period of time. Kids will like this place very much and the one more advantage of this place is it is very near to Zoo park so if you happen to plan this place you can plan both this place as well as Zoo Park too. There are few bikes, scooters which are big in size and one can climb them and take some cool snaps. Ticket prices are also very nominal for Adults Rs. 60/- per head and kids above 3 years are charged too. Mobile and Camera ticket is must and they are charged at Rs. 60/-"

Sudha_Cars_Museum,menonCGN,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,A misnomer!,I went there expecting to see vintage cars and vehicles of historical significance; but what the 'museum' had was crudely built replicas and some vehicles like a 1950 model Fiat! It is not a museum at all. I felt it as just a junk yard. Hence the choice of title for this review. My advice to the enthusiasts of automobiles or vintage vehicles; please do not waste your time and money by visiting this place while you are in Hyderabad.

They are shown working in a car event which is conducted once in two years. Nothing much to see unless you are a car enthusiast but it is close to zoo hence both the visits can be clubbed. It will take you about 30-45 minutes to see the museum. It is open from 9.30 AM to 6.30 PM and the ticket is priced at Rs. 50 for everyone over 3 years. if you want to click pictures then that costs extra."

Sudha_Cars_Museum,BhautikVVaidya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,A very unique palace having beautiful art made with cars,"If you like automobiles you should see Sudha Cars Museum at Hyderabad. It has unique ways of exhibiting cars made in shapes of pencils, pens, erasers, cups and other funny objects and, believe it or not, they all work! They are shown working in a car event. But you cannot take pictures because taking cameras is charged extra (more than the ticket of a person), which is not worth. There is even the biggest tricycle in the world (noted in the Guinness book of world records). There is also a huge car that is over two stories tall! It only takes about one hour to complete."

All executives are unprofessional.You can't even touch the car and you can watch far from 10 feet ,even don't have much space to take good photographs. dust is all around and no proper cooling and space.
