Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,DrQuresh M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Friends,Very expensive - worth every Rupee; Superlative staff,We were 5 couples all between 60-70 years . It rained throughout but the rooms were comfortable and the staff went out of their way to make us comfortable . It would be helpful if the lighting was improved in the outdoor areas and the lobby. Also a well defined walking track would be an asset as they own property of 300 acres but the staff were clueless about where I could take my morning walk for an hour!
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,ljolsen12,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Wonderful place to visit!,The royal arrival with carriage and roses was such a great experience. The tour was amazing. The tour guide did a great job of telling the story of the palace!

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,anirban73,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,A Royal experience,"Built in 1893, owned by Nizam of Hyderabad and now the Taj group, a heritage hotel. Ypou walk down history, with a royal treatmengt the moment you walk in. Located on a hillock, 2000 feet above sea level, you can have a grand view of Hyderabad. The staff are extremely courteous. One must book in advance, with 50% advance payment for dining. There are 2 main restaurants, Ada (Indian) and Celeste (Italian). A one hour tour of the palace is conducted by the staff of the hotel, explaining the history of the palace and all the rooms in the palace. No doubt the dinner is expensive (almost Rs 7000 per person including taxes for a 4 course menu), but its worth it, along with the tour that you get. Its a memory that you will cherish forever. The staff in Ada, where we had dinner was excellent, courteous and helpful. They go out of the way to make sure you are comfortable. Hats off to the Tata group for reviving this unused palace since 2010."

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Kellia H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,My favorite place to visit,I come to the palace for dinner every time I come to Hyderabad. It is a must see. Always get the royal welcome and take the horse carriage up and get showered with rose petals as you ascend the stairs. Take private tour and dine over beautiful views of the city. 
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,anshu74,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 • Friends,Birthday party gone wrong,"Our experience at the restaurant we visited was absolutely something that came as somewhat of a shock to us...we were a group of 4 and had made an advance payment Rs.6000 per head for dinner.We ended up paying Rs.5200 per head because we complained about the food so were offered a 20% discount.To be fair ,the gentleman who was at the restaurant tried his best to salvage our meal...we were offered free mocktails(sugar laden coloured water) and free desserts...but the food was absolutely not TAJ standard or what we have come to expect of it.. food was tasteless..the vegetarians and the non vegetarians were equally disappointed...it was a forgettable evening...was there to celebrate a birthday but it will be a birthday we will remember for all the wrong reasons...there was no email ( we left our email id along with our comments  ) to explain this...not TAJ at all ..."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Anil S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Family holiday ,"Amazing hotel, palace restored to its full glory.Excellent service, staff treat the guests like royalty. Mr. Qayoom at reception, Mr. Nasir & Mr. Sudhakar at the restaurant looked after us really well. I would rate the service higher than any hotel I have ever stayed.

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Shagun S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,A really memorable day @ Taj Faluknuma - the High Tea was an experience par excellence,The drive to this place was torturous  - we were staying near Tank bund in the city - but once we were on the property it was a magical experience!! An absolute must do in Hyderabad!

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Neeraja V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020 • Friends,“Scintillating View of the City”,Enjoyed the most amazing view of Hyderabad from the ‘Jade Room’ with twinkling stars in the Sky touching the ground. Soulful music of live Sufi songs makes the place reminisce the days of Nizam. The historical tour of the palace is enlightening along with an sumptuous meal of  different courses.The staff are warm and helpful. The Grandeur and ambience of the palace is perfect for special occasions.

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Swarnangsu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Business,One of the most exclusive Hotel/Restaurant in Hyderabad,"We went to Taj Faluknama for lunch + palace tour. You definitely get the royal treatment from horse carriage rides to floral showers to impressive cutlery. We had lunch at Adda which was a set menu buffet. The kebabs were simply out of the world. The rest of the spread was also good, but kebabs were the highlights according to me. Post lunch we took the palace tour which was good but I dare say falls a bit short if you compare with similar palace tours in Rajasthan.Overall definitely a very good experience. If you are going on your own, be prepared to shell out a sizeable amount. It is one of the most expensive place to go in Hyderabad. Also remember to book in advance"
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,PargaonkarP,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Business,Good experience to have once.,"The palace tour is a good to do once. It is a beautiful palace. If you are lucky you might even get a glimpse of some movie shooting from distace. Food is definitely good. Chef took care of my request for pregnancy friendly food. The food did taste good. Will I pay Rs.5000 for the food there..... hmmm, I will explore Jewels of Nizam first and then decide. :)"

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Wilayat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Old luxurious walk ,"Taj Falaknuma Palace is one of the most important places to visit in Hyderabad, it is not open for general public. If interested in visiting you can book a day tour, Nizam Palaces Tour by Telangana Tourism. This Palace was taken over by Taj Group "
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,ShankarTravelores,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,The Royal Living & Dining,"Book for a dinner....months in advance.  It starts with a palace tour.  And choose the dining place as ""Gol Bunglow"".....ideal would be on the Diwali day.....with a pleasant evening weather....and Qawalli Singers on the go...takes you away out of this world.  You don't even feel that you are having a 5 or 7 course meal as it only melts the way the ears lilted with the music. And as you savour....just glance the dark sky that is fully lit up with the Diwali fire crackers colours.  Oooo.....what to say more.....you get to see a 120 degree view of the old city of the Nawabs.  It's a once in a life time experience for a common man like me....and a destination default for the who's who of the country."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Res0rtSeeker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Great Place,Great place to spend the weekend. Interesting residence that is full of history. Just as some of the staff and they will tell you whatever you want to know about the house.
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Vagish Dixit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,A Palace which retains its aura,Conceded that this is not a specially abled friendly place with no ramps and lifts in sight. But this is an old palace with the zillion steps from floor 0 to floor 1 and of course a horse carriage ride from main entrance to porch. Every room smells of history in its lush and princely aura. Service is genuinely reflective of the period and food is to die for. Overall this place is amazing and is a bucket list item for anyone visiting Hyderabad. 
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Indusman248,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,High Tea on Christmas Day with Spouse,Great arrival experience on a Royal Horse Cart (Bagi) from the Palace entrance gate to the main porch - this was coupled with Rose petal shower as a romantic welcome to the Palace. The palace tour takes about an hour and our Tour Guide was using plenty of Urdu couplets during the tour which made the entire experience interesting. There is a souvenir shop in the palace which needs an improvement from collection and its pricing perspective (collection is not that great and pricing is on the higher side).Recommended not to take lunch before the High Tea as the choice is huge and one does not need to eat dinner post the High Tea. Price does not justify the overall experience - needs correction as found on the higher side.This Palace is being managed by Taj Hotels and it was found that it is difficult to get connected with the associates of the Palace for booking. 
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Rahul G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Unique experience,"I visited this palace with my team during my official tour. I must say it’s an unique 5 STAR heritage experience. Dinning is on premium side with 8~9K per person, but it all about experience."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Avinash Reddy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Amazing....!!,Stunning historic Palace property. Parts of the palace are modeled on Windsor Castle and the billiards table is identical to the one at Buckingham palace. This was once the home of the richest man in the world. The hotel has retained all the original features of the palace. My only suggestion is that the Taj group address the issue of pigeons damaging the structure. Installing transparent fishing wire along the ledges is a simple trick that would stop the birds from landing.
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,scvrose,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Nice building and views,The Taj sits on top of a hill overlooking Hyderabad in the background on one side plus the old fort. There is an interesting collection of antiques from the previous owners.  Worth a visit.  Also had high tea in the restaurant.
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,tapas1966205,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,It's a travel to Nizami Era and back.,"It was off course a small trip. However, right from picking us from the main entrance in the Tah Group Buggy/Golf cart till the High Tea, it was amazing. It is worth to mention the palace guide with an excellent sense of Poetry ( shayeri) . Zade room was awesome, one will remember the bathtub fitted in the queen's ( Begum?) bathroom  and off course the 100 seater dining table. In fact description by words will be an injustice to the famed Falaknuma ( Like the Sky) Palace."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,blondeinbombay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Dreamy Palatial Getaway,"We've been to the Falaknuma several times, for overnights and work events. The Falaknuma never fails to impress and inspire. It's such an escape from the city, the staff are always so thoughtful, the spa is fabulous, we adore the breakfasts, and have always really enjoyed the dinners as well. "

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,LostMySelfTraveling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,It's a great palace turned in 5 star hotel,As soon as you enter the palace it will be a great royal treetment from the entrance. The interior is really beautiful. Especially the while climbing the Stair case you can see the history of the palace and Kings through wonderful arrangement of photographs. The rooms are superb wide. Facilities are awesome. In the evenings sitting in the balcony gives the most beautiful experience with your loved once.Overall its a Royal treat. The dining hall is also very huge with wide range of veg and non veg items. Overall its a Royal treat. You must experience once at least in your life time.
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,amitthecreator,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Taj Falaknuma Palace,"Taj Falaknuma Palace, the former palace of the Nizam of Hyderabad is now a Taj heritage hotel.

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,_karangehani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,A Must Stay Luxury Hotel,Superb Service... Outstanding Food... Suites are spacious.. The Common areas are ultra-luxurious... worth every resource spent. The level of care and personalized service at Gol Bungalow and the quality of food is many notches above and beyond the normal. (one example...Had Biryanis at almost all Hyderabad well-known joints and then had one as part of the specially curated Telangana Food Thali for us... and we all just wondered what was the need to step out... this was the best.Front Staff.... young energetic well versed with going beyond the expected. Every minute...Taj truly is a different kind of magic.. and Falak Numa right up there with the best of the best.
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,ravitaruna,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,The RoyalTreasure of Hyderabad - Taj Falaknuma,"This is one of the most sought after place and has deep attraction among the visitors especially who are visiting Hyderabad for the first time and willing to live royal king size stay at hyderabad.Location  is strategically mapped to attract all type of tourists but preferably more worth in case you are on pure tourist visit and not on official visit to enjoy the place in totality.It has enchanting spell of the mirror of the skies, the iconic Taj Falaknuma Palace. It make you feel in diffrent world altogether due to it's ambiance and quality of services and for every thing including food & I will simply say  a world where dreams are fulfilled, right from the moment you descend from your horse-drawn carriage. This magnificent mansion conceived by the Nizam of Hyderabad. We can have  an authentic treatment at  Jiva Grande Spa,over all I suggest this to enjoy for short visit.However,charges for food and services are good but need to be improved and re-looked.there are so many other places as well whether good quality food are available at comparatively cheaper rates and having Hyderabady flavor."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,tschitra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,A trip down memory lane,"If you want a glimpse of what the Royal India was like before 100 years a visit to this place is highly recommended. The Taj group has done a great job of maintaining the palace and grounds in a very discreet manner. It’s all about the Nawabi splendour and lifestyle. The staff is very polite and knowledgeable. The walking tour is well done and flows well as one ascends the beautiful stairs up to the library, the queens quarters, the dining hall, the jade room and so on. The grounds have a magical look in the evening and the scents of jasmine combine to enthral you. After the tour you can carry on to the restaurant for your dinner. Again a sumptuous spread. Especially recommend the pan ice cream!Book in advance when you plan to go."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Krishna Kanth P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Business,Royalty to the core,"Went for a dinner with business clients at The Falaknuma Palace.

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Emily M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Fantastic and relaxing stay,"This place is incredible and I cannot recommend it highly enough.We came here on a family trip with my husband and myself, our two parents, and our cousin and her daughter. They went absolutely out of their way to accommodate our every wish. From special-order butter chicken at every meal and a child-sized bathrobe for my little cousin, to remembering just how my father-in-law takes his tea and what kind of roti he prefers, they really aim to please.The accommodations themselves are luxurious- our room was palatial and comfortable with fast wi fi. The courtyard is tranquil and inviting, and the incredible palace speaks for itself.The entertainment is superb, from the very talented live music offered daily both in the morning and evening, to the high tea program, to the lovely pool, to the billiards hall for a nightcap. One of the attendants in the billiards hall even took the time to try to teach us to play (we were hopeless!).The spa is lovely. My husband and I both agreed it was one of the best massages we’ve had.And the food! The breakfast spread has everything from South Indian staples to European Continental and everything in between. Dinner was scrumptious each evening, and the service absolutely could not be beat (special shout out to Hema Santosh, who took excellent care of us).In all, the hotel is an absolutely lovely and peaceful retreat, and you will feel and be treated as royalty during your stay. Don’t think twice and just treat yourself! "
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,rkapurs,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Relaxed break,"My wife and I stayed here for the second time and had a great time,  Right from airport pick up to check in was perfect. Our suite was just what we wanted.  The staff was brilliant. We took a spa and Rima and Pizzo were outstanding. I have had a lot of treatments at various hotels and Rima was simply one of the best. They were so good that we had to take a massage the next day also. We had dinner at Gol Bungalow. The ambience and the food was very good. The Hyderabad cuisine was authentic.  I wish they would take care of their service. The staff was courteous when they came to you. No one came and asked if we want a second drink. We had to signal a waiter. Our second drink came in 35 minutes. The assistant restaurant manager was helpful and gave great suggestions. We asked for food in 15 minutes but it came in 35 minutes. It did not matter as my wife and I were enjoying ourselves. No one to fill water glass. When the bottle finished no one came to refill. We got the dessert before the finger bowl. To top it all in the end the waiter came and said sorry for the delayed service as he was busy with the other table.  My wife and I had decided to have a good time so these points did not really dampen my evening, but come on is this The Falaknuma Palace we are talking about. Overall a great trip and would be back again but would never have dinner here."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Shuddho G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,..a world apart,I had heard a lot about this experience but that was nothing compared to what you feel once you opt for this.Of course it is pricey but worth every penny.Must do if you can afford it.
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Garon_Susanne,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Sheer opulence and wonderful history,"A must if visiting Hyderabad. It’s an amazing insight into the life of the under touch of historic India. An amazing palace beautifully maintained. If you can afford it the lunch is worth doing, soaking up the amazing atmosphere and setting. If your budget is a little tighter then do the tour and high tea."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,futuregenie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,"Well maintained, excellent service, superb staff overall a pleasant experience.""","A good place to visit. Very royal. The lunch prie fix is quite pricey(a good $1000 for 8 people), but a fun experience if you're up for it, it is a good. The tour is fun. Relaxing environment. A nice place to visit to understand the Hyderabad culture."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Ekta R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Excellent,"The whole experience was very good. The tour, the food, the ambiance and the people. It is costly but everybody should experience once."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,TheoP0001,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Magnificent,"This palace once belonged to the richest man on earth, and it shows. Splendor, wealth, grand scale. And the Taj people have done a spectacular job renovating it. Apparently, it took twice as long to restore it than it took originally to build it. Of course, you could stay in one of the splendid rooms but they are priced for their splendor. alternatively, you can book a dinner and get a complementary tour of the main parts of the palace and the gardens. Starry evenings give you a great view of the entire city of Hyderabad below your feet and out in the distance. The dinner is not cheap, but it will fill you with wonder (the tour and the place, if not the meal); it is worth it. And the staff is exceptionally well trained and very proud of the unique palace they have been entrusted to serve. "
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Naveen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Soak your skin into the grandeur and aesthetics as the Royal Luxury come alive at Falaknuma Palace,"Taj Falaknuma Palace needs no definition. In fact, it is beyond the scope of definition.  It is a true blue royal tryst with grandeur and aesthetics. I spent two days here and it was an experience of lifetime, always to be reme6and cherished for. The early morning breakfasts at Gol Bungalow which has a breathtaking view of the entire Falaknuma and old city area of Hyderabad is stunning. We enjoyed our delicious breakfasts here and I loved the typical Fakaknuma style mutton Kheema. We were treated with evening Palace tours which gives an insight into the royal legacy and history behind the rich heritage. The evening Qawali was soulful and the yummy evening desserts in our rooms were aamazing. I also took the Attar/Ittar Bath, which is an in room bath had the fragrances from the Nizam era with rose petals. It was indeed a great thing.The hotel staff was great in hospitality. We were treated with utmost care and every aspect of service was amazing.  The best part was the royal grand welcome as we arrived and were showered with rose petals. In all, one must definitely experience the grandness of this great luxury hotel. We went back home with treasured moments in our hearts and amazing souvenirs from the hotel."

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,krishna292,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Great Tourist Attraction with HighTea But at an Unreasonable Cost Not Worth,"During recent visit of my grandson, a student of Harward we planned to visit a different, out of blue place and chose Taj Falaknuma, a Heritage hotel of Hyderabad. The booking was done online and the package consisted of a guided tour of Palace with HighTea at about 3500/- rupees per head (nearly $60.00) excluding 18% taxes. There are number of tours at different times, High Tea, dinner, lunch etc and even the State tourism department also arranges these tours almost at the same charges only on weekdays but ours was a weekend tour. We were four people, took a cab that dropped us at the main gate from where battery operated vehicles take the visitors to the palace entrance. The main attraction is a bird'd view of Hyderabad as the palace is situated on a hillock. It has a well manicured garden and an imposing structure through stairs to reach the main lobby. On the way to palace we saw several peacocks and other structures, all white painted, probably rooms for the guests. The guided tour started at about 3 PM and our guide explained history of palace, background of paintings adoring the walls and roof, galleries, furniture etc, We were also taken to the main dining hall which accommodates 100 persons, one of the biggest halls in the world. The whole place looks beautiful but one shudders to think that all that opulence and expenditure was at the cost of poor people. Why the money was not used to eradicate poverty and hunger by these kings and nawabs. After an hour tour we went to the restaurant, known as Gol Bunglaw, There were several types of cakes, cookies, pastries, choices of soft and hot drinks and snacks, all served in a royal fashion with excellent service. My total bill came to be nearly 16000/-rupess, which is equivalent to about 250 dollars. It is not worth. If one has visited Salarjung Museum and Chowmoholla Palace, where all these items are dispalyed, one need not waste money here. I do not recommend this tour to Indian visitors unless they have money to waste. Of course foreign visitors, if they are staying in a hotel, minimum charges are 600 dollars per day, they can very well see the whole palace."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,franckbart,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,An ok must do,I went there for the very expensive high tea and the visit. Me and my friends could not understand a single word of the first supposedly english speaking guide we had. The second guide could speak a very good english but was a sort of a robot ! No passion at all. A real pity in such a historical property. The high tea is far too expensive for what it is.

They also organized the amazing horse and coach ride to the palace reception area. Wow wow wow what an experience it was. The palace is amazing, being the home of Hyderabad Nizwan the history is truly remarkable and a must see. Lunch in the Indian restaurant was superb with gratitude to our waiters Santosh and Hema Santosh for their amazing efforts in making my birthday lunch and visit to the Palace so fantastic.

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Srisadhana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Royal experience ,Extra ordinary experience especially if you visit at evenings. Royalty is in every bit of the palace. But price is on higher side. Not a regular visit place.
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,padmavathy66,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Not worth the Hype,We went for evening High Tea.When we were ushered to the dining area I was for a shock.Such a tiny room and so much hype.our table was also very small .For 3 people they had to keep juggling the plates and the cake trays to accomodate all the items on the menu.Even the tour of the palace was  not satisfactory and lasted hardly 15 minutes as most of the area is used for commercial purpose .On that was there were few more private gatherings  so all that areas which are originally in the touring list were out of boundsWe paid a Bomb for this and came back with a let down feeling
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,LordAdvisor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Business,Experience Royalty,"We visited the Taj Falaknuma in June 2019. The palace by today's standards may not seem grand and royal, however, if you take yourself back in time when it was built and look at it from that era, you may be able to appreciate its grandeur. The stories that the guide tells you about this Nizam and the making of the palace gives you an idea of the money that was splurged in making of the palace and the lifestyle that they lived at that point in time.We had dinner at Adaa restaurant and my experience here was not good. The level of service was way lower than what I am used to at Taj properties. It was definitely below standard.I would yet like to try out the restaurant once more as I believe in Taj quality of service and my this experience could have been a one-offI recommend Taj Falaknuma especially to foreign tourist visiting India."

Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,neha_traveldiary,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Royalty!,"It is a beautiful small palace nestled in the heart of old city reminding you of the bygone era of Nizams. However, the palace is now star hotel with a tour of the property along with meal. I would recommend a high-tea as you get you can experience the property n sample the food as well. Don’t go with expectations of forts n palaces in Rajasthan. Also, make 2 days prior reservation as they don’t entertain walk-In! Enjoy whispering across the 100 seater dining table 😊"
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Bob A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Our Third Visit,Regret to say the standard of this hotel has slipped since the last two previous visits we rated 5 Star.The staff and opulence of this majestic palace have not changed (which is good) although the exterior of the palace is now looking tired and in need of renovation in many areas.Where we were let down was with the food and in particular the Indian restaurant that one night served totally unsatisfactory biriyani mutton - complete disappointment as it was dry lacked spices and was served with a peanut sauce!!! Really !!! Peanut sauce with biriyani rice - I don’t think soThe breakfast buffet was also ordinary and many dishes served luke warm - not good enough this time around
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Amit1965,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,FALAKNUMA PALACE-Hyderabad,"This is an Awesome Heritage Palace of Nizam Era , its so Royal , Grand and Opulent . The Falaknuma word is FALAK-NUMA which comes from Urdu Language which means- "" Like the Sky "" or "" Mirror of the Sky"".This was the Royal residence of Nizam Mehboob Ali Khan Bahadur . Actually it was a Dream Palace of Nawab Vikar-ul- Umra around 130 years ago, it took 9 years to get it completed as it's foundation was laid in 1884 and it was completed in 1893, it is spread over 32 acres and is on a 2000ft high hill top from where you have a spectacular view of the city.It was taken over and opened by TAJ HOTELS & PALACES in Nov. 2010 as it was in poor condition in 1950's.Its architecture is very intriguing as its not Mughal or Islamic one but it is Italian and Tudor style as Nawab Vikar had travelled around many countries, he wanted it to be something exotic and exquisite.Its a MUST Visit on anyone's itinerary for Hyderabad."
Taj_Falaknuma_Palace,Srinivas Yalamarthy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Absolute feeling of Grandeur... Truly Majestic,"Wow is the only word you will utter the moment you step in to the palace. Private vehicles are not allowed in to the palace and they will transport you on their buggy to the from the entrance to the main palace. They will only allow you provided you make prior reservation. Any amount of interiors in new hotels can compete with the luxury and decor of this palace. For a moment you would have a envy feeling that how grandly those nawabs would have lived in this palace. You get to see the Nawab's room and his attached bathroom with those vintage original fittings, which are nostalgic. The best part of the palace is the walk ways and the huge open air balcony with an amazing panaramic view is just stunning.. literally you can see the whole city as it is in a very elevated place. The food part is jus about to be ok nothing to rave about. The experience will be a life time. You must insist any of the staff to give a tour to the palace which was a great tourist  attraction long back with a dining table which can seat beyond 100 persons at a time. There is no end to explain the beauty and luxury of this place.. one has to visit to experience the same."

From the moment we got down at the entrance, to the golf-buggy ride/walk upto the palace, and to the amazing tour of the palace, the grandeur and history, it was an amazing experience.We have eaten at the Celeste as well as Adaa restaurants, and both times the experience was sublime. Try the jasmini martini at Adaa (hope they still have it). Don't forget to take in the view from the terraces, as the princely city twinkles in the distance. All in all, an amazing once in a life time experience. "
