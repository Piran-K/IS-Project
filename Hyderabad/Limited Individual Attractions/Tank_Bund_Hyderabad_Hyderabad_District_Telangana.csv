Tank_Bund,Sameena K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,LET US TRY AND KEEP OUR HUSSAIN SAGAR (TANK BUND) CLEAN.,"Friends, Hussain Sagar (Tank Bund) could have been rated 5 by all of us had it been kept clean.Tank bund could have been a beautiful sightseeing venue,had it been kept clean and well maintained As a teenager l used to do kayaking and rowing in Tank bund waters.l do have a lot of attachment for this water body, hence l feel saddened to see its water turned  into marshy green in colour with garbage litter thrown in the waters and  on the pedestrian's pavement.The beautifully carved statue's of our leaders and scholar's on one side of the Tank Bund road makes it more beautiful.The Buddha statue right in the middle of the waters and the erected lndian flag's beauty, waving it's tri colours to us adds on to its beauty but for the litter which makes me feel sad and dejected.IF WE AS INDIANS ALONG WITH THE AUTHORITIES TRY AND KEEP THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE CLEAN, THEN IT WILL TURN OUT TO BE THE BEST PLACE IN HYDERABAD FOR AN OUTING.POSTING A PICTURE OF THE GARBAGE DUMP  ON THE PAVEMENT MEANT FOR WALKING.THANK YOU!IF YOU AGREE WITH ME, PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO GIVE A THUMBS UP.THIS WILL BE MY INCENTIVE FOR CONTRIBUTING MY TIME IN WRITING GENUINE AND HONEST REVIEWS."
