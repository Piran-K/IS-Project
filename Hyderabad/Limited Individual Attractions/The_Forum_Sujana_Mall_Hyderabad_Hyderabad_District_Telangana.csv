The_Forum_Sujana_Mall,Loukya Gummadi,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,Central Store,"Forum Sujana mall is a really good place to visit with family or friends. But recently when I went to Central store, Sujana mall for shopping with my family, I had to wait for a really long time for the billing. At last I had to leave behind a pair of clothes as the casher said it would take them a lot of time to resolve the problem. The cost on the tags and the computer were also different (computer showing less cost then the tags). The casher claimed that the computer was not showing the MRP. I couldn't buy the shirt I really liked as they were unable to resolve the problem within time. I was late for my next tasks because of this. Altogether I didn't have a good experience in this shop at all. Hope you can resolve problems like this."

A good selection of shops over three floors and a movie theatre on the top.

,,,,,"The Forum is a fairly large property, unlike many other ""malls"" in Hyderabad. It is quite well-maintained as well. There's a good collection of brands/retail stores. The reason for the average rating - it has a pretty crappy food court payment solution. You need to buy a prepaid card loaded with cash and you can buy only with that card inside. No cash/credit cards. Worst part - if you are new to the mall, like I was, I had no idea on what the price charts looked like for each outlet. And there's queues for loading cash, and rushing back since you fell a few rupees short of what you calculated you expected to eat (seriously, singularly amongst the worst payment implementations for a mall setting). Management, if you are reading this, cash and credit cards work. You need to figure a better way of ensuring your tenants share sales data if you don't trust them! Not thrust a crappy solution on every visiting patron."
,,,,,"Dear Guest, 

We regret the inconvenience caused to you. There are other reasons and thought for the prepaid card system currently in place.However, we certainly take your feedback and shall explore initiatives for further simplification.
