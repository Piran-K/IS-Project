Wonderla_Amusement_Park,Aantharya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Good but needs lot of improvements.,"Quality is low compared to the price they are charging. The automated answering phone mentions ticket prices that are not accurate. On the phone the price mentioned was around 1000 rupees for adult and 800 rupees for kid, but there when we went it was higher. Locker facility is good they charge 300 rupees for that and 100 rupees out of that is refundable.  The swimming suits are available for reasonable price. I saw many roadside vendors selling swimming dresses just outside wonderla. I presume wonderla might have reduced their clothing price because of serious competition from them. Even then they did not have good collection of all sizes. You would end up buying what ever is available in your size. They also do not encourage exchange if the size does not fit.we reached there at 12 noon and by the time we got everything in place it was 1.30pm, so I feel it would be better idea to reach there by 10.30am itself so that you can get started soon and make the most of the time you get.Changing stations were good. But very small not comfortable for aged people or specially abled people. I guess it was just 2 feet by 2 feet with a curtain. The toilets looked clean but smelled very bad. Only one Indian type toilet was available. The lady at the dressing shop told me my dress is ok for pools as it was made of nylon. but there the guards did not allow me inside the pool as  it was long top.Even though they had marked right end as kids and ladies only, men were also there and none of the guards bothered. we went for lunch at 3pm and not all items were available.  But food was good.Not all the pools were open. The pirate theme pool was closed. So do not promise kids any particular ride before visiting. They usually keep half things operating. So overall we had fun and would visit again."
Wonderla_Amusement_Park,Mounika,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Very poor,Recoil and twinflip trex was not working. Very poor customer service. We tried to call the numbers provided in the website to check whether recoil is functioning are not. We came with family and all are very upset. They should mention that somewhere or atleast reduce the ticket price.
Wonderla_Amusement_Park,Raghu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Great experience and great Staff,"Had to wonderla on my Birthday on 16th Nov 2021. It was a pleasent day for us.. We really enjoyed the rides and shows (though we did not cover all).. After finshing the tour after coming back home we realized we forgot our mobile there. When i went next day to check the Security team and PR team were obideint to unerstand my concern and called few people to check if they got anything in found & lost.. Immediately got the confromation that the mobile was in there.. The Facilities staff identified and handed over to the respective team.. They really finished the formalitlies in less than 5 mins and handed over our mobile.. A bigh thanks to Facilites team, Security and PR team for the quick action.. As said it was really nice exeperience for us on my B'day."
Wonderla_Amusement_Park,krishnamani i,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Family,"Nice place with no covid rules ,","Neatly maintained.Signboards at important places to guide people.Good restrooms , areas to change, locker facilities etc.Lot of rides, water sports , reasonable cafeteria , all at a decent price .  The huge dissatisfaction was not adherence to covid appropriate behaviour. People were crammed up in a room for the short movie shows, no social distancing at all, people without masks were allowed to enter ( there were many such people ). On asking the security personnel , they said we can’t do anything.On weekends , with huge rush, and no protocols for preventing people who are not adhering to masks or social distancing , it’s the right place for rise in covid cases , considering lot of kids come there . Overall wouldn’t rate it high."
Wonderla_Amusement_Park,bobbili s,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Family,Worst experience twice,"I have a bad experience twice ..1st time when I visited no roller coaster and second time also same, and very poor service I visited on 16th April 2021 .. no games ..rain disco everytime same repeated bledy songs , and in waves and rain disco and few slidings they have allowed with cotton t shirt . But in few they are saying we will not allow anywhere with cotton ..then how come in waves they allowed and in rain dance also they allowed . Wasted our money not allowing and limited slides only ..and dashing cars also they have not allowed in cotton t shirt .. what is the problem .. iam suggesting you all don't go for wonderla and don't waste your money .. I will give zero ratings"

Wonderla_Amusement_Park,"Reddy, Chandhra",2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Sorry to write this review based my yesterday (24-01-2021) visit. This is weekend visit experience,"Sorry to write this review based my yesterday (24-01-2021) visit. This is weekend visit experience.I visited Wonderla Hyderabad first time with Family (4 people) based on the good reviews and mainly because of 699/- offer, but got a very very bad experience. I am not able to imagine how this reputed organization is leaving public to fight themselves.  Specifically at ROLLER COASTER  ride. I hope most of the people visit to enjoy this ride, the standard time was mentioned as 90minutes. for us it took around 2 hours. That's fine as crowd is huge and its acceptable.But how the people were at queue was unimaginable, I though its like we are in local Theaters, were people were fight for movie ticket and jump queue line. The same happened here and management / staff were just simple standing their and not controlling the crowd. All the security staff are living dead people, no one are active (May be management were not paying them write salary).I had a good learning, don't believe on brand name. I compared Wonderla with Jalvihar (found Jalvihar far better in managing crowd)"
Wonderla_Amusement_Park,Aijazzain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Friends,Support staff done brilliant job..,"The favourite part was their SUPPORT AND HELP in the time of need.. must be appreciated and admired..  at a time when it's overcrowded to 2-3 times of its capacity and crowd is making situation like chaos, they have understood the concern and responded very well to the situation and provided amazing support and help..  I RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO MUST VISIT WONDERLA PARK AND RESORTS.. 🥰🥰😘😘😘😊🤩🤩🤩👍👍👍🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳.."

Wonderla_Amusement_Park,Mahesh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Family,Wonderla Review,Theam park is great. All of the rides in theam park and water park anazing. The only development is required in online meal tokens. It feels that once you buy that you are stuck at no where. At point I felt that I am at some public gathering where food is offered free of cost. Do not by meal tokens and apart from that this is great place to visit in family or group.

The swings were not moved the way they should be. Not for a long time. Some swings were not made to move for a min also. Please ensure that people are coming from so far away to enjoy the rides and swings so you do it at ur best.Last time when I visited the response was so good, the swings were moved exactly the way it should be.

Wonderla_Amusement_Park,CuriousTraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,don't miss the Roller Coaster,It's an awesome experience to start as soon we went to wonderlaw. There are many other rides but we mostly enjoyed the water rides. It was lot of fun and exciting to climb lot of star cases and slide over the water sports. It was lot of fun. We really enjoyed the lazy pool. It takes a Bit longer time to finish but it is really fun and worth enjoying. Kids also enjoyed. Superb splash too.

Wonderla_Amusement_Park,Deepak garg,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Amazing amusement park.,"Nice and well organised... lot of rides and need your time and energy. Kids may got tired... they provide good options like lockers, hand RFID batch for any payment inside and premium entry for avoiding queues... overall nice experience. Try to avoid in holidays... crowd could be high but manageable... only thing they will allow school kids leads too crowded... must visit place "

Wonderla_Amusement_Park,Thevedaa,,,,Excellent fun at wonderla and have experienced amazing rides present there mainly recoil and mission interstellar. Wonderla Rides are using high standard safety measures that no one worry about thier safety. Hyderabad wonderla is some what small when compared to Bangalore visitor who've already visited Bangalore wonderla won't satisfy much. But at the end of the day it is a excellent place.
