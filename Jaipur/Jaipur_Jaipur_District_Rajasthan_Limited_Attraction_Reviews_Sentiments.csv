Amber_Palace-Amer,Arham Bajaj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023,True essence of Palace with the magical temples.,"If you are planning to visit Jaipur, plan 1 whole day trip where you can begin by watching early morning Sunrise from Jalmahal, then proceed to Amber fort. Inside Amber fort, you can feel the essence of Rajasthani tradition by riding over big elephants which will take you inside the fort, or you can also walk above the fort from parking place. Once you roam around the palace, do not forget to go to Jagat Shiromani temple as well. It is the only temple in the world with the statue of Lord Krishna and Meera bai. Also, you will find very rare temples where Lord Vishnu is kept alongside with Lord Krishna because Lord Krishna had all the 16 kala of Lord Vishnu. The temple is around 400 years old.",0.4149,4
Amber_Palace-Amer,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,A large and picturesque palace fortress in the old city of Amer.,"Amer was the original home of the rulers of the region, before they relocated to the city of Jaipur. Their palaces and fortresses can still be seen in Amer however, and the most famed of these is Amer Fort itself. The fort can be accessed by elephant or by jeep, although walking is also a possibility. There are some potential ethical concerns about the treatment of elephants in Jaipur, so be sure to research this and choose responsibly if you do want to take an elephant ride. The palace itself is beautiful, with painted walls and one palace of mirrors and silvered glass. The best thing about it is the views however and it is really very special. The best time to visit for the heat is during winter (from November to January), however this time also sees significant air pollution, which can diminish the views.",0.9773,5

Amber_Palace-Amer,FlavourSeeker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Mostly good, some bad parts","We had a great time visiting this fort. We had a knowledgeable guide who regaled various stories of the  Royals, and the grandeur of the fort was pretty cool. The hall of mirrors was also very nice. The whole place was a great example of a fusion between Hindu and Mughal architecture, reflective of the synergies between those communities of the time. There are several cool books and crannies to explore, and learn more about, which can take up a good chunk of time. There are some very unfortunate aspects of this fort, though. There is a severe lack of respect that the visitors have towards this fort - it is dirty, littered with trash, and the large majority of people who visit this place are only interested in taking selfies, while barging and pushing others around. The elephants look very weak and abused, and it's important not to support the continued exploitation of these majestic creatures, as they are not treated well. Very sad to see.In one of the small hallways we saw a used baby diaper (yes, very used and brown) shoved into the window - which was disgusting and so sad. The actual maintenance of the fort could be improved as well. But it's a really impressive fort.",0.7891,5

Contact him if you want a good guided tour of Amber Fort. 93510-08078.All the guides tell you not to shop at the stores within the fort and that they will take you to the wholesale shops to buy the same things, but I must tell you that the shops within the fort have some of the best products which you will not find outside in the many touristy shops that they take you to after the tour. The shops in the City Palace and in Amber Fort have beautiful jewellery, artifacts and block printed stuff which will interest the foreigners, and the quality is really good.

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,A Tale of Two Sites.,"MONEY can be life for a country's great archaeological sites....but lack of it can be death.Of all the places I visited during a fantastic holiday to India it was Jantar Mantar that brought home to me the fine margins between deciding what to preserve of a country's history and what to abandon to the elements and encroaching undergrowth.First I'll give you the good news because much money has been lavished on Jantar Mantar to ensure that this large site containing nineteen astronomical instruments is preserved for future generations to enjoy and appreciate.It was completed in 1734 and deserves its place as a UNESCO World Heritage site.Among the instruments I strolled round were the world's largest stone sundial.For those of you who don't know -- and that included me because I had to look it up -- Jantar Mantar literally means ""calculating machine"".This astronomical observatory  touches everything from star and zodiac signs to time, the sun and the location of the Pole star.To show you how good their calculations were, the best instrument can calculate the correct time accurate to within two seconds.Now we come to the bad news.A short time later in my holiday I climbed all the way up to the Sun Temple overlooking Jaipur.Along the way my guide pointed to the left where a farmer wearing only a loin cloth was stood near a big pile of cow manure feeding leaves to his animals.Very nice, I thought, and prepared to walk away, but my guide shook his head and pointed again. This time I saw what he meant.Beyond the pile of manure and almost swallowed up by trees and thick undergrowth was a smaller version of Jantar Mantar.We stumbled our way through thorny growth, grass and tree roots and the deeper we got the clearer our view of the astronomical instruments became.Many still had their original curved marble marked out in sections for calculations, but some had been damaged or looted, other had been destroyed altogether and it was clear that Nature and the passage of time had not been kind to the site.So why am I mentioning it? Because this site is older and, therefore, historically more important than Jantar Mantar.Its downfall lay in its size. It was built in the very early 1700s but was much smaller than Jantar Mantar, so when restoration money became available the authorities opted to spend it on the much larger site. To me it is a bit like renovating a football stadium while leaving the Colosseum to crumble into ruins.What anyone reading this review could do is pay their own visit to the Sun Temple and then stop off and view this astronomical site for themselves. If enough tourists mention it then perhaps the Indian authorities will spare a bit of money to preserve this site as well.Jantar Mantar is a wonderful and fascinating site to visit, but spare a thought for its smaller poorer brother on your way up to the Sun Temple.",0.9483,5

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Mukesh B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Auditorium session a must,"Royals are not for the luxurious life, their battles, the size of their state, their palaces and the wealth they amassed. Not too many Kings are known to be involved in science and scientific experiments. But Jai Singh of Jaipur was different. He understood the growing population of his state and shifted from his ancestral Kingdom Aamer by creating a complete new city called Jaipur in the early 17th century.The boundary walls were created with pink stones hence the name Pink City.The king had planned the city in colonies and the roads of each colony is cross crossed exactly in 90 degrees. You would never be lost in Jaipur city, ant street you are in will connect you to the main road exactly in 90 degrees.That's science used in planning the city.Coming to Jantar mantar. It is another masterpiece of science and understanding of heavenly bodies.In the days when watches and clocks were not available, Jain Singh with his men created the perfect Sun Dial. No one would have thought that sun and it's shade can be used to locate the currect time of the day minute by minute.There are other set ups created in Jantar, all to do with the study of heavenly bodies and their connection with human life like the zodiac signs.I strongly suggest one should visit the Auditorium in Jantar Mantar first. An half an hour audio video session gives you a clear understanding of each and every set up created inside the Jantar Mantar. Once you have known how each one of them functions, the way you look at it changes completely.It is no more a piece of ancient monuments to you but the science. You start analysing it in the same manner it was designed for.You tend to think like a scientist and not a mere spectator or visitor.Unlike the monument in other cities, this place is laced with green garden and trees. It gives you relief from the scorching heat from the Sun. The washroom is well maintained.All in all a great place to explore of our ancient science at a very affordable ticket price",0.9959,5

It is the largest observatory in India. We were expecting to see telescopes but the area is dedicated to shadows and movements of the sun and stars with shadows cast as the sun moves around at various times of the day indeed months and year. It is amazing how the early Indian scientists, going back 300 years, were able to document and predict times and locations based on the solar system. Horoscopes are catered for and all the astrological signs are there. To look at the park it appears more of an amusement or architectural centre until one has the explanations  about the geometry and lines of shadows and light. Quite amazing. A modest entry fee applies and we took a pre-booked tour which lasted around an hour.

After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan. He explained why the buildings are all painted pink in the old town.  The city was painted pink to welcome HRH Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VII, Emperor of India), in 1876.  Many of the avenues still remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.   Even the buses are pink.  We also noticed that there are no policemen or traffic lights guiding the traffic on the roads but it works well among the citizens.  There was much honkings but it was not due to impatient drivers. It is just a way of life for the drivers to greet each other.  He showed us beautiful pink roadside buildings where the shops are on the ground floor while the businessmen and their families live upstairs.  He also mentioned that ladies in Jaipur like to dressed in bright colours to make up for lack of colour in the desert part of Jaipur.Even the street lamp posts are lovely.  When we reached the majestic and gorgeous Hawa Mahal, he explained that the facade with lattice windows were for the royal ladies to view the street processions without being seen.  There are many windows as in the past the Maharajas had many wives.  The pink colour for buildings is mandatory for the common people.  Dilip kindly allowed us to take very good postcard shots of Hawa Mahal.  However this rule did not apply to the Maharaja as we noticed the entrance to his Palace is not painted in pink.He also pointed out the flowers market near the temples as the flowers are used as offerings to the God,  Popular colours are red (which symbolises energy) and yellow (knowledge and wisdom).",0.9941,5

Sat on the stool. Listen to the guy ramble on about pashminas and threading them through a string. Then lighting a thread and having to smell in. Then the hard sell. Buy this buy that. Buy something for your friend. This is the cheapest place in Jaipur. So out of curiosity asked how much the bed sheets were. As it turned out i had bought them much less in Udaipur in the local market. It was a tourist rip off. Came out the store annoyed. My guide was already getting the next customers. Came up asked for the 400. He left straight away off to do the next people. I looked at the time and saw i had not had anywhere near an hour. Went back to the main gate to complain.

The artifacts are interesting as well, and the large silver bowls are impressive. You are not allowed to take photos inside, which is a shame, as the court or ""Darbar"" is photo worthy, but has not been preserved effectively. You are allowed to see some museum pieces, such as outfits worn by the various Maharajas, but there isn't enough in there to be very compelling.

On top of that, everyone that works there was amazing. They even helped by talking to my driver and sending gps coordinates so we could be certain we were at the right place.Dont be thrown off when you drive to the area or enter the gates. Its definitely not a luxury area but the staff are very upfront about that. Once you are at the property, it is well kept and everyone is friendly. They were also super responsive on whatsapp.Bit of advice, be careful when you enter the main gate from the road.

At first I was scared to go near  the Elephant but after seeing how well behaved and well trained the giant jumbo elephant is when I started interacting with it and started playing with the giant lovely Elephant whose name was Tara. The elephant(Tara) was very well behaved and has been well trained by is care taker. I fed Tara sugarcane and a bunch of bananas which she happily ate with a smiling also fed some water and also had fun in the drawing task. The staff there is very kind and the my volunteer Mr Yunus was kind enough to tolerate my all nonsensical questions.At the end we took a ride on the elephant to enjoy the place.The elephants are well trained.I would highly recommend to all the people who are visiting Jaipur or India should add this in your itinerary.

EleSafari-Amer,AmandaZ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Just book without a second thought.. Amazing city tour with elesafari ,"Having only a single day in Jaipur and reading some amazing reviews of elesafari we decided to book the elephant interaction program along with the Jaipur city tour. At first we were in a doubt if we could finish the tour and the elephant experience in a single day but everything was planned so well that we visited almost all the popular monuments while also visiting the beautiful elephants at elesafari. An early morning pick up was arranged from our hotel. A clean SUV was sent with a super awesome driver who was an amazing combination of your guide and chauffeur. First he took us to a popular roadside shop where we had some mouth watering lassi before starting off exploring other monuments. We then visited the City Palace, the house of the Royal family of Jaipur along with Jantar Mantar observatory which was simply mind boggling. After driving through the Wind palace, we took a halt for lunch before visiting the magnificent Amber palace. It is a spectacular piece of architecture. Later on we visited the lovely elephants at elesafari where we were greeted by the owner ILU who was so welcoming. He gave us detailed information about the place and the lives of elephants in Jaipur. We started the experience by getting introduced to Tara and feeding off her bundles of sugarcane with pure love. This was followed by a brief painting using chemical free colors which turned out to be a very unique experience. We even gave her a little wash as it was winter and the entire body washing was closed. This was followed by a short bareback ride. In the end we gave her some sweet bananas as a treat for being so gentle.The overall time spent with the team of elesafari including the City tour and elephant experience was too special. I'm glad that we booked their services and got some amazing memories with the City tour and the giant elephants. Simply book without a second thought !",0.9986,5

The experience at elesafari with the elephants was also an amazing one where we interacted with them so closely. It was so heart warming to see that elephants are looked after very well and are treated with so much love and affection.We found plenty other companies bu are glad that we went on with elesafari which gave us tonnes of memories to cherish for life.P.S.

EleSafari-Amer,arif Badgujar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Unique experience ,Having a free day in Jaipur we decided to visit elesafari and meet the elephants there. Booked tje experience through WhatsApp which was pretty smooth. A private pick up was arranged from our hotel. On our way we requested our driver to stop at Water palace was a quick photo session which he politely agreed. Upon arrival we were served beverages and the owner ILU gave us a brief history about the lives of elephants at Jaipur. It was so satisfying to know that elephants are treated and very well taken care of. We started off by feeding our elephants Tara and Payal and even made bundles for them. It was followed by painting them using non toxic colors which was a fun part where we wished my cousin a happy birthday. Later we gave them some water to drink and gave them a scrub which they seemed to enjoy a lot. The last part was a bareback ride across the village which was so quiet and peaceful. All in all it was a marvelous experience where you can learn alot about these beautiful animals while doing fun activities with them. The fabulous team acts as the icing on te cake who take every small effort to make you time memorable.,0.9941,5

EleSafari-Amer,ILU_EleSafari,,,,My partner booked elephant experience and a day tour of Jaipur with elesafari and it turned out to be an amazing experience. The combined package of elephant experience along with the day tour is a truly favourable option for travellers and also pocket friendly. Excellent reviews from other travellers convinced us to take on their services. The day tour was just amazing where we visited some popular tourist attractions. After half  day of exploring Jaipur we visited the elephants. We were hungry and on request the owner ILU arranged some snacks for us. The next couple of hours were spent getting so personal and doing some fun activities with our elephant Tara. Plenty of beverages were served during the experience. The time that we spent at elesafari farm was something that we would cherish for lifetime. ,0.9889,5

Right from the beginning the experience has been excellent with smooth and prmopt response from ILU regarding the sightseeing tour to the experience with the elephants. Everything was so well planned. The tour itinerary covered almost all the popular monuments and forts with a nice driver. Jaipur is a beautiful city and we munched on some lip smacking indian cuisine. Also the time spent at the farm with Payal is something we would cherish for a lifetime. Learned a lot about the lives of the elephants of Jaipur and the amazing work these people are doing for their welfare. Commendable staff who were so courteous throughout our stay at the farm. We'll surely visit Jaipur again and would again love to visit elesafari farm ,0.9903,5

EleSafari-Amer,Andrew,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Adorable Tara and Payal,Some amazing reviews convinced us to visit elesafari elephant farm. We made a booking through WhatsApp and it was a smooth process where all our queries were cleared by ILU. A time slot was alloted to us and transportation was arranged from our hotel. Before visiting the farm we did a tour of Jaipur and visited some beautiful monuments. It was a peak season and the moments were packed with tourists still our driver Khan was so patient and made sure we visited all the popular sites. We were not forced for shopping traps and were given plenty of freedom during the tour.After witnessing the magnificent amer palace we went to elesafari to meet the cuties. Upon arrival we were greeted by by ILU and he gave us a detailed introduction about the place and the lives of elephants living there. Then he introduced us to Anu our new giant friend who was so calm. We truly enjoyed feeding her sugarcanes which she munched like a machine. We were surprised to see the quantity of food consumed by the elephants. Then we decorated them using chemical free colors for which we were hesitant but when we checked the colors which were really washable and not harmful for the elephants we decided to try painting. After this it was time for a little wash and scrub followed by a bare back elephant ride across the pond. The experience is so special where you directly contribute for the welfare of these elephants and their care takers. It is fun to be so close to these elephants in a natural environment along with a super friendly team.,0.9957,5

,,,,,My partner booked the elephant experience along with the Jaipur city tour and it was an amazing experience. We opted for a tuk tuk tour to get a more local experience and the driver provided was simply the best. Almost all the popular sites were included in the sightseeing tour and plenty of time was given to explore the monuments. Also our driver was very knowledgeable about the city and gave us many great stories about the pink city.After lunch we visited the elesafari farm where the elephants were waiting for us swinging their tails and munching on their meals. Upon arrival we were greeted by ILU the owner and he gave us a brief background about the place and the experience. Then we were introduced to our elephant Anu an asian female elephant who was very gentle and calm. We started by feeding her and were amazed by the quantity of food consumed by her.  Her caretaker even taught us to make bundles for her. After feeding her for sometime we started to paint her using non toxic colors and this was the most fun part. The next was washing her but due to cold weather the whole body wash was not allowed and we were completely okay with it. The last part was an option between elephant ride or a walk and we decided to take Anu for a walk along the pond which was so peaceful. The entire experience was soooo surreal and we are glad that we got to do it. The staff was so helpful and it was because of them that the experience became such an amazing one.  I would suggest you to directly contact ILU through email or whatsapp rather than booking through some agent or driver or guides. ,0.9943,5

,,,,,"Very nice experience! We read some awful reviews in other farms so we were hesitant to come. We don‚Äôt regret it! We started by feeding the elephant, so we became more at ease with her. Then we painted her a little with natural dye which was very nice. After one hour of interacting with her and speaking with her caregiver, we finally were ready to go for a ride. We did not take a box, we road on her back. It was more genuine. We learned that the guide lives with the elephants and his family at the village. Our guide had lived with her for 15 years! So they seem very well cared for. There are many farms in the same village. we were lucky to find this particular one, which was a great experience. Not cheap, but these animals are worth it, you can always ask for a discount ;) . There will be a photographer selling you printed fotos. You can always say no. The guide took really nice ones with our phone.",0.9424,5

Nahargarh_Fort,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,A large fortress overlooking the city of Jaipur.,"The Nahargarh Fort looms over the city of Jaipur on a nearby mountain, helping to protect the city. The views here are great, but sometimes obscured by the haze of pollution that sometimes descends over the city. The interior is painted in a uniform manner. The outer areas of the fort also hold restaurants and a host of other attractions. It is far less frequented than Amer or Jaigarh Fort and is good if you want to go to a tourist attraction that is less crowded.",0.9489,5
Nahargarh_Fort,Sarah R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Impressive Views but Sheesh Mahal is a rip-off.,"The views of Jaipur and the valley from this fort are impressive.  There‚Äôs also a step-well inside.Having paid to get into the fort, there is a second steep 700Rp fee to get into a privately-run complex inside (the Sheesh Mahal). This consists of a wax-work museum, a room decorated with mirrors, a moth-eaten stuffed tiger with a clockwork mechanism to move its head from side to side, and also has various side-shows (a magician, a puppet show, a potter, each of whom will want another 100-200Rp).  If you‚Äôre the kind of person who loves Disneyland or M&M world, go ahead.  But frankly, it‚Äôs a tacky rip-off designed to part tourists from their cash.",0.5647,5
Nahargarh_Fort,Trudy W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Worth the hike up the hill for city views.,I enjoyed walking up the winding hill. Don‚Äôt need to  take the tuk tuk. It is 20 minutes and quite steep but you get a great view looking over the city and in the distance the Aravalli mountain range. The palace in the fort is ok  from the outside. It‚Äôs completely empty inside but the view from the roof terrace is nice. The day I went the visibility was bad due to pollution but I still enjoyed the hike up and down. 200 rupee tourist entry.,0.9074,5
Nahargarh_Fort,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Lovely views.,"HIGH on a hillside lies this fort which formed part of the defences for Jaipur.It was mainly built in 1734 although it was later extended and a range of palaces built there.When I visited the fort it was easy to see the commanding views it had of the surrounding countryside and down to the city of Jaipur.The fort, which is also known as the Tiger Fort, was a welcome blustery experience on a hot day.I walked along the ramparts and it was possible to look down on fortifications below which were not open to the public.On the top level visitors could look down into little courtyards which formed part of the Royal apartments which were beautifully painted.Slightly distracting while I was there was a colossal fight among a group of monkeys with much deafening screaming and calling.Different sections of the palaces reflected the seasons with the one lived in during the winter having its own fireplace.Definitely worth a visit which can be combined with the nearby Jaigarh Fort which houses the world's biggest ever cannon.",0.1779,4

Moreover at all signages the fort is described to be open till 7pm, without mentioning that the baoli will be closed to visitors. Post dusk, the behaviour of the uncomfortably friendly locals could be better checked with appropriate security measures.  Likewise the local transport could be better utilised if only there were standard rates preventing the fleecing of tourists. The attitude of locals can attract or divert tourists and a State which advertises about ""Padharo mhare desh"" ought to have better policies to maintain their supremacy in tourism. ",0.9538,5

We purchased a composite ticket for INR 400 (INR 100 for students) which allows entry into 8 attractions managed by Government of Rajasthan. City palace, Jaigarh fort etc are managed privately by the Jaipur Royal Family and therefore not covered under the composite ticket.  It‚Äôs the highest of the three forts in Amer and located on the Aravalli hills. The fort offers scenic views of the Jaipur city. The other attraction within its premises is wax museum, sheesh mahal, puppet show etc which are managed by private operators with separate entry fees of INR 500. There are also Segway rides for INR 200.On the way you uphill, you will find a diversion towards Jaigarh fort as well and at the base Amber palace is located.Nahargarh fort is open from 10 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. This is a must visit attraction if you are in Jaipur and taking a guide is recommended.",0.8934,5

Appears to have undergone some maintenance and visitors are apparently increasing as it was previously neglected. Going up is an adventure as the road winds up the mountain. Walking is an option but I would not recommend as it is a long and steep hike up.So what do you get to see? The highlight is the Madhavendra Bhavan palace complex. It has nine spacious self-contained apartments, where the king's women lived, set around three sides of a courtyard. The king's quarters are on the remaining side. They're connected to the apartments by a corridor that enabled the king to secretly visit his ladies and frolic in privacy. There is a Sculpture Park where the collections on show change every so often. Finally, there is the wax museum. The museum is divided into three sections‚Äîa Hall of Icons with statues of celebrities including cricket players and Bollywood actors, a Royal Darbar with paintings and wax statues of Rajasthan royalty in traditional costumes and a stunning modern-day Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace) crafted out of glass pieces.Finally check out the view of the pink city from the top.

Luckily we only paid SAARC rates to enter this site or I would have been quite disappointed. The Step well is quite interesting to see, but again the Abhaneri Step well is far more impressive if you've seen that. Would probably recommend to skip this unless you have extra time to kill.

Nahargarh_Fort,bhavnabkumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Entertaining and Mesmerizing,"Nahargarh Fort is located a little outside the Jaipur city. Within the fort there are different attractions. Let me warn you it can be quite a walk with steep staircases. My mother is a senior citizen and has issues with walking long distances; however she did not face that much difficulty. Ask your car driver to drop you at the car park. That is very close to the gate, reduces the walk. Inside the fort, there is a wax museum and sheesh mahal (must see). The ticket is on the expensive side however if your budget permits, don't miss the Sheesh Mahal. It is very beautiful and the do listen to its audio carefully. It is very interesting. The wax museum is fun. You are not allowed to click pictures inside. However, you can request for a photographer. Soft copies of the photos are provided at an extra cost.There are some artists displaying their skills like pottery, traditional folk music and a magician. These are just to pass your time till your turn comes to visit the Sheesh Mahal. Limited people are permitted inside at a time. Next, there is a step well, and a water storage tank. Just gives you information on how rain water was harvested in olden days. The views from this fort are breath-taking. Please don't visit the fort on a Sunday, we did that mistake. It was very crowded. Finally, there is Madhavendra Bhawan. We hired a guide and it was helpful to understand the history of the palace, the queens' rooms, toilets, bathing areas, summer residence, winter residence, chimney, how the king entered and none of the queens knew in whose chamber he would spend his time.... was all very interesting. If your budget permits, do hire a guide. We were charged INR 200/-. The tour took us a lot of time because of the crowd and the fact that I had senior citizens with me who walked very slowly. There are steep, narrow staircases to climb inside Madhavendra Bhawan, not too many though. 2 - 3 hours are sufficient here. There are restaurants inside the fort including a fine dining restaurant. I recommend don't eat from here if you are on a budget. Moreover, the taste is not too great either. There is a small eatery outside the fort which is cheaper.

The attachment the care takers and elephants have with eachother is obvious from the moment you arrive. We had a great experience painting and feeding the elephants. We learned that applying paint is a therapeutic experience for the elephant which is a fun activity as you get to watch the elephants show affection to you and the care takers. I highly recommend anyone visiting India to visit the sanctuary and take part in this remarkable experience. ,0.988,5

After looking at a number of elephant experience websites, we selected elefun based on excellent reviews about them. We were not disappointed. Mr. Aftab and his team were very helpful - from sending his team member to help us reach the place to making us comfortable, we were assisted all through the time we spent there.

We were skeptical but made believers as we saw how much the workers loved and cared for them. Her caretaker is dedicated to her and sleeps next to her in a small apartment. He has known her since he was a young boy and clearly loves her. They do not use sticks or hooks but train by love and respect instead of fear or Punishment. We opted to walk alongside our elephant instead of ride her with just a blanket and I suggest that for a more deep connection with your elephant. We fed her after and boy did she love bananas and sugarcane! We had a great time and will be back to visit Shapu which means beautiful in Hindi.,0.9934,5

Elefun-Amer,Abbas,,,,"Have you heard of Haati-Gaon before?Yes, there is a place called ‚ÄúHaathi-Gaon‚Äù near Amber fort in Jaipur. I was planning for such an activity since years but this year finally decided to give it a shot. We were in Jaipur and googled about Haathi-Gaon. Luckily we got in a touch with Mr. Aftab, a very polite man who guided us to reach the place. It was such a nice, beautifully maintained green space where we got the chance to meet two lovely female elephants Tara and Payal. The mahouht gave us sugarcanes to make friends with these two elephants. I was initially scared as my 5 years old daughter wanted to get close to these huge elephants but soon the team and the elephants themselves they made us so comfortable and the fear of getting closer, touching them faded away.I would strongly recommend a 2-3 hours trip at Haathi-Gaon in case you are planning to visit Jaipur with your kids where only adults enjoy to shop. This calm space will not only give your little once a chance to get closer to nature, interact, touch and paint the elephants but you will also enjoy doing all this, if you haven‚Äôt done it before.By the end of our trip, we were hugging Tara and Payal and my little once didn‚Äôt want to leave at all.We are definitely meeting Tara and Payal in our next visit to Jaipur.I can say this in bold, italics and underline ‚ÄúMONEY WORTH SPENT‚Äù.A big thanks to Mr. Aftab and his lovely team.

,,,,,"Everyone has a dream.  My dream came true at the Jaipur Elephant Farm.  The farm houses almost 200 elephants, which are housed in dedicated buildings and cared for by different families.  Each elephant has a handler who is with him 19 hours a day (it turns out that they sleep 5 hours a night).  I met one of the elephants at the farm and spent two days with her.  We went for a walk in the reserve, I fed her sandwiches with bananas, sugar cane and more.  These are elephants that were saved from difficult living situations and living conditions in which they suffered for long periods.  Today, they cannot manage in nature alone, and it is necessary to take care of their well-being.  The team I met was a dedicated team, and the knowledge I received about the elephants was extremely interesting.  The only thing I didn't connect with was the drawing on the elephants and riding them.  I will definitely try to visit the place again for a longer period to help this wonderful team and hug Luxmi again.",0.9813,5

Elefun-Amer,Tina,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Will never forget laddu,"My family and I (7 of us) went to Elefun on October 6, 2022. We contacted Mr. Aftab (77370 91222) who was so helpful and gentle. He's the caretaker of Elefun. From the time he received us till we left the Elefun, he was helpful and polite. We were very apprehensive about entering Elephant Village since we read many bad reviews about how tourists are exploited by some of the elephant parks inside the elephant village. But we met the perfect person Mr. Aftab who was fair to inform the prices to spend time with the elephants in the beginning itself when I messaged him over WhatsApp while booking in advance.Our 3 hours' experience at Elefun was fantastic. We spent time with a 31 year old elephant called Laddu. We gave food to it. Then we drew on the elephant. Then we gave a shower to Laddu and vice versa by sitting on it :) Then we went on a 45 minutes' ride. We could have spent more time. Mr. Aftab was kind enough to give us ample time to spend with the gentle beast, Laddu. We loved Laddu so much that it will be in our memory for very long time. The mahout, Faizal was also a wonderful boy. We understood how he cares for his elephants like his family members. He helped us in conversing with Laddu in the words it could understood and explained a lot of things about elephants. Another wonderful person was Mr. Aslam who is fondly called Mr. Bean for his similarity in looks with Rowan Atkinson. He served us with good masala tea and gave us couple of water bottles whenever it was hot. If you are looking for a perfect place at a reasonable price to have a lifetime experience with elephants at Jaipur, then it has to be Elefun taken care by Mr. Aftab.",0.9972,5

The introduction was done slowly and carefully, the elephants and the humans (us) were given plenty of time to get used to each other.The care of the elephants, the running of the facility, and the future of the entire project was discussed at length during a lovely teatime outdoors. We were able go for a very long walk riding the elephants, after which the kids painted them with washable paint using bamboo sticks - apparently they tickle theanimal, then washed them and fed them a bucket of bananas. The biggest thrill for the kids was sitting on the elephant's neck being sprayed with water coming out of her trunk. There was a photographer available that was taking very professional pictures, but the handlers and the guide also took our videos and pictures with our own cameras. The entire facility is very clean and we saw several other elephants with other groups of people being treated exactly the same kind way.

,,,,,"This was, by far, one of the best experiences of our lives. I went to Elefun with my husband and 2 little daughters. We were excited to see elephants, but we didn¬¥t expected to be as magical as it was. We went for them but ended having the time of our lives! The people from Elefun was extremely nice, specially Aftab, the owner, who started this Elephant oasis with care and love, to protect them and to create a space of meaningful interaction between humans and this amazing animals. The experience blowed our minds, it was PURE MAGIC! Definitively a MUST if you go to Jaipur.... Been able to wash, feed, paint, massage and ride a beautiful elephant, was absolutely stunning. Best experience ever!",0.9949,5

The guards seem to all be in the game, as I have never been to another museum where they‚Äôve checked the ticket so carefully. This was probably the most interesting ‚Äúexhibit‚Äù in the museum.Rather stupidly, there are no toilets inside, so if you need a toilet you have to go through all the remaining rooms and the exit and go some distance further. (Don‚Äôt mention disabled access). The exit turnstile does not allow re-entry; the entry is on the other side of the building to the exit; the ticket is of course one use only. Luckily, there is not much inside worth seeing anyway.  In a country where 250 rupees buys you 45 GB of 4G data, 300 rupees apparently gets you access to a few glass cabinets with old carpets inside and a mummy.Two stars for the gorgeous exterior and some interesting cultural incidentals: a school group was performing on the front steps, a couple were taking pre-wedding photos with the building as a backdrop.",0.8379,5

Albert_Hall_Museum,Brun066,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Museum that doesn't fear comparison with the major art museums of the greatest Indian cities,"This museum dates from the late nineteenth century. It's therefore following the era that saw the foundation of the great European museums, undoubtedly the model for that product of modernity: ie the practice of ‚Äã‚Äãgathering in a building and opening to the public the highest evidences of culture, coming from near or far territories .However the second half of the nineteenth century is also the period (in the wake of the Universal exhibition in London, 1851) in which space is also given in museums to the phenomenon of the so-called ""Industrial Arts"" (German ""Kunstgewerbe"", French ""Arts d√©coratifs"", Italian ""Arti applicate""), that is, the arts producing artifacts not only for contemplation but also for everyday use.This museum in Jaipur reflects this cultural atmosphere. Alongside sublime and traditional works of art (I mention only the gallery of ancient Indian sculptures, or the famous ""carpet of the Persian garden""), there are ample collections of objects of practical - or ""even practical"" - use: like music instruments, jewels, furniture, weapons, etc.If the collection can appear ""chaotic"" to an inexperienced eye, keep in mind the idea underlying this museum, I mentioned above; and you will find (as I found) that this museum doesn't fear confrontation with the major art museums of the greatest Indian cities (in this trip we have seen those in Delhi and Kolkata).",0.9561,5

The passage was meant to evacuate the royal family in case of an attack on Amber Palace. The 18th-century tunnel was thrown open to the public and has been made motorable. To facilitate the trip to Jaigarh, golf carts operate from Ganesh Pol to Awani Gate, the fort‚Äôs entry. The ride is very nominally priced at rupees 70 for a one way trip and rupees 100 for two way and operates from 9am to 4pm. Jaigarh fort can also be approached from the Amer Fort over a short climb along a steep hill track. The fort is named after Jai Singh II, who got it built to protect the Amer fort. Hence, it was actually a defensive structure rather than a palace itself. What really makes it famous is a celebrated cannon named Jaivana, which was then the world's largest cannon on wheels.  The fort never witnessed any major resistance, and therefore, despite the cannon‚Äôs exceptional record, it was test-fired only once. The fort museum is a testimony of this fort being used as a major center of artillery depository. Used weapons and other war utilities are preserved and displayed at the museum.

Jaigarh_Fort,nosourgrapes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Jaigar gets my vote,This huge rambling fort is one of the most impressive in Rajasthan. might equals right and this fort was built to protect. the small holes to pour boiling water in the enemy are still notably there as are the slits for firing bows and arrows. any marauder who could break into this citadel would be tough and wily indeed. Jaigar is less busy than the other nearby but it is infinitely interesting. allow an hour or two to wander about and take in the atmosphere oh and dont forget to check the worlds biggest cannon that can hurl the 22 lb cannon balls an incredible 30-40 km!,0.8288,5

Jaigarh_Fort,Aveek B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Though its not spledid as Amer fort but its a must visit after Amer fort,Forts in Rajasthan should be covered either in early morning (Jaigarh opens at 9.30 AM) or in late evening to avoid the sun. In Jaigarh fort one needs to walk long distance in order to explore the full fort. It was mainly the cannon making factory and soldiers used to stay in Jaigarh fort. The bhulbhulaiya inside is another notable place along with the largest cannon inside the fort. It is near to Amer fort and both are interlinked by a road for pedestrian though few take the road.

Rajasthan_Small_Scale_Cottage_Industry-Amer,Inspire782517,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,SCAM ALERT,"A consummate scam that starts with your driver and tour guide. You are told that this is a government run fixed price cooperative directly benefiting village craftsmen and weavers whenit‚Äôs nothing but a private store with no labels or price tags attached to any product. It‚Äôs supposedly a fixed price shop but variable prices are obviously quoted to different customers.You‚Äôve let your guard down thinking that this is a state cooperative enterprise. The store is full of overpriced quilts, jewellery, carpets, textiles, handicrafts and various other items. They show you a set of items, you select something and then you are quickly taken to some other counter to be shown some other products. They then replace the selected products with defective/ inferior duplicates, cover and pack them and send them directly to the payment counter. They also quoted a lower price when we were selecting the item and inflated the price when putting it on the final bill. You are charged GST but given a handwritten bill, the reverse of which has terms and conditions saying that no exchange or refunds are given.Then comes the biggest scam. A so called renowned astrologer, whose only purpose in the shop is to play on your emotions (read gullibility) to convince you to go and buy a precious stone that is supposedly the cure for all the problems that you or your family members might be facing in their lives. In our case, it was supposedly an emerald worth Rs. one lakh. At the last minute some good sense prevailed on us and we refused to buy the gemstone.We had in any case by now,  run up a bill of close to Rs 50000 for products that you could buy elsewhere for half the price. A lesson learnt the hard way unfortunately for us. It was only on arriving back at our hotel that we opened the  packed items and realised that we had been sold very poor quality stuff. Go in with your eyes wide open if you do choose to shop here and be aware of the organised scam that‚Äôs being run by the drivers, guides and shops offering all Rajasthani/Indian souvenirs under one roof and adopting names similar to government run enterprises.",-0.9761,1

The bill that you would be handled at the last monent and that too folded, will mention that the goods won't be exchanged(even if damaged?) You wouldn't have the time to exchange anyway! Also read, that there is no guarantee on the colours of the garments, but they were confident that their vegetable dye would never bleed!

While we were conversant with printing techniques like Sanghaneri and Bhagru this place had a lot more to offer. It is set in an old bunglow and has rooms dedicated to each of the printing techniques. There is a master ji who taught  us how to do a block print. My younger daughter thoroughly enjoyed it. There is an artisan who showed us how to carve a block. The entry fee is just Rs.40 for an adult and there is a donation box in case one wants to donate. The most striking thing about this museum is the peace and quiet of this place. It has several rooms, niches and stairs which make the place intriguing. Its a must vist for anyone visiting Amer which is about 16 kms from the airport. This area is avoidable during the 26th of Dec to 7th of Jan due to the huge influx of tourists from Delhi. There is a small anokhi store which sells some garments and gifting ideas in block print. One  can buy a bag or a tshirt in white and try printing the same in block prints.

But I didn't know anything about it.I too was impressed by the skill with which the ancient ""haveli"" that houses the museum has been restored, and by the care with which it's maintained.The exhibition of the craft of hand printing by wooden blocks is also interesting for those who are not fond of fabrics: he / she will learn the essentials of both the different characteristics of fabrics and the ways of printing them.At the end of the visit, a craftsman printed a cotton handkerchief in different colors and patterns in a few minutes, and gave it to my wife, who still keeps it.After my visit to this museum, I learned that the name ""Anokhi"" is that of a local company that has a factory in Jaipur and employs many hundreds of workers in the production of fabrics printed by this traditional technique. And I also understood that this technique, which risked disappearing at the end of the last century, derives from a secular Indian tradition, in which Rajastan, and in particular the town of Bagru, west of Jaipur, excels.In short, I really learned about entities I didn't know; as it's obvious, traveling to a country like India, which for its size and the antiquity of its civilization has a ""reservoir"" of cultural accumulation among the very first in the world.",0.9625,5

You can pay to block print your own scarf, bag or t shirt (not advertised on their website oddly but a wonderful activity for children) but we opted to buy some block prints in the shop to make our own t shirts at home. The shop was a little more limited than I expected but there is a large Anokhi shop in Jaipur anyway. The shop does provide quiz sheets and colouring for  children which is a nice touch since sights in India do not always think of children.

Good prices considering where you are.The museum doesn't open until 10.30 am and we arrived too early - hence a side visit to the step well and a temple, both of which were lovely. If you are driving up to the Fort (rather then walking or riding an elephant from the main entrance) you will drive right past the museum.

It's great that the museum is laid out to educate guests prior to the live-workshops so it's well worth following and engaging with the exhibits prior to this.Lovely museum shop too and there is a cafe at the front where you can buy drinks at a reasonable price.

There are no signs or whatsoever that indicates where the temple is. We had to ask for directions to the people there and then being ask for money in return. When we finally got to the place we found out that apart from the entrance ticket (100 rupees) you have to pay a camera fee even if you plan to take pics with your cellphone that was more expensive than the actual ticket (150 rupees). That‚Äôs a total rip-off! So you end up paying 250 per persons. As we found that ridiculous we decided not to pay for the camera and just enjoy the visit. The staff at the counter was threatening us about taking pics without the permit and pushing us to put away the cellphone (that I was carrying it in my hand all the way down the mountain) as if they were security personal. They were close to be aggressive and they were blocking our entry with their bodies until we put the phone away. It was a horrible experience! Moreover, The temple is not worthy at all!! Not the walk up and down, not the entry fee (you can do a lot in India with 250 rupees per person), not the unsafe feeling.

We expected to pay a small entrance fee to get in but we didn't expect to pay to use our camera as well.Since we didn't know when we would have this experience ever again, we bit the bullet, paid the required fees and went inside. Monkeys greeted us as soon as we stepped foot into this temple.They were climbingand jumping on each other, looking for food in the water and leaping from place to place.As we climbed the steep set of steps to the top level, monkeys of all types and colors walked along side of us.There were light brown-faced ones,red faced-ones and at the very top of the steps were black-faced ones.As long as you kept your cool, they went pass you and went on there way.However,if you showed you were scared of them, they sensed it and climbed on your shoulder.Once that happens,stay calm and in a little while they'll jump off of you.Also,be careful about bringing food here since they'll either grab it out of your hand or leap on you to get it.The view from the top of the temple will give you a nice view of Jaipur but it's not the cleanest place to visit.An interesting point I learned from some of the other visitors who come here regularly is that people bring bananas for the monkeys every Tuesday and Friday,They aren't afraid of the monkeys which the monkeys sense and they simply take the bananas out of their hands and run off. I debated between giving this site a 3 or a 4 rating.As a unique experience which you may never have again, I decided to give this temple a 4 rating.It was truly a unique experience for my wife and I.Noel Mouldovan",0.9856,5

The infant was quickly dragged by the neck by the monkeys teeth. I thought perhaps bitten but the mother quickly ran after the child nonchalantly laughing it off. I never went to the top platform only made it up to the first stairs as we were highly watched and outnumbered by the monkeys. Stay with a group. I found a group but we were being circled. I found no garbage nor sick monkeys unlike the other reviews. This is a real review. Please be careful and don‚Äôt carry any food with you AND make sure you have return transportation cause Ola won‚Äôt come and get you. Drivers kept cancelling on me and the signal was very weak. 50 rupees to take pictures which is ridiculous. Monkeys climb up your legs and swing off your bag. I would recommend the monkey man.

Monkey_Temple,Katy T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Worth the Visit, but Use Common Sense","Many reviewers have stated they felt very unsafe and threatened by both the monkeys and the workers wandering around. If you have a tour guide or a friend who is Indian, you'll be perfectly safe and are not bothered by the locals at all. Not sure how it would be without a guide in relation to the locals bothering you.The monkeys were adorable and friendly...if you interact with the young ones. Avoid the adults, both the moms and the adult males. They are more defensive and not as friendly. I never felt like I was going to be attacked though. You can still throw them peanuts or crackers, but only hand them to the younger ones. As you can see in the picture, my husband had a young one climb right on his shoulder after he gave the monkey a cracker. Almost stole his sunglasses though haha. It was not at all a taxing walk, not sure why other reviewers thought it was, even going to the top. If you want to go into a temple, expect someone to ask you to pay a tip. I didn't feel like I was forced to do so though, so we didn't.Watching the Hindu people cleanse themselves in the water from the Ganges was a very peaceful experience. It is not polite to take photos of them. All in all I think it's worth a trip, especially if you have a guide.",0.8547,5

In my opinion this is a required visit if you're in the Jaipur area.  What I love is the rawness of this place.  It's not the cleanest area to visit but you see everything here in its raw form - pigs, cows, pigeons, etc.  You see monkeys swimming in the concrete bathing area alongside the people.  You see amazing architecture of palaces literally connected to the mountain.  You climb concrete stairways that seem to go on forever from one bathing area to the next.  You see sights and hear sounds and smell the rawness of the area which gives you a full sensory overload.  This place is a long drive outside of town, but well worth it in my opinion.",0.9031,5

IE we arrived at the bottom of a road and could see a temple at the summit. We were greeted by people selling peanuts to feed to the monkeys. Get  a bag apiece. You will need them. Then we were asked if we wanted a ‚Äúmonkey protection guide‚Äù. I know monkeys can be dangerous but I don‚Äôt like to use untrained and unregistered guides. I opted for safety and took the guide. That was a very good choice. We began our climb and were quickly met by a large group of monkeys. With our guide we fed them and they climbed on us. This is where the guide is super helpful. The monkeys can bite and scratch which means a rabies concern. So a guide is recommended. We met a lady coming down who had been scratched. Our team of 3 enjoyed the monkey interaction. We continued the hike up. Once at the top, the guide asked if we wanted to go further to the temple in the valley. Others were doing it, so we did. After some downhill hiking, the valley opened up to a series of structures and temples and a bunch more monkeys. Wow it was breathtaking. We went to the valley floor and explored and had more monkey interaction. We hiked back up and went to the summit temple. The guide asked for his money on the way down and was requesting way too much. However, we settled on a good price which was overly generous because we had enjoyed it so much. I had to be very firm with the guide that he wasn‚Äôt getting any more. Final tips- get the peanuts- get a monkey protection guide- you must be in good hiking/ walking shape- don‚Äôt overpay the guide. No more than $20 USD. I paid more than that and found out I should have gave less. He asked for $100. I laughed. - go to the valley - understand the monkeys can bite and scratch- also, the hills are full of leopards. They don‚Äôt bother the humans. Stay with guide and others. ",0.9958,5

Monkey_Temple,Scott H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Be careful,"I've been travelling in Asia for the past 3 months and spent around 5 weeks in India. During that time I think this monkey temple was one of the most stressful experiences we had.My wife and I initially got dropped off by a tuk tuk driver and were immediately mobbed by people insisting on selling us peanuts to feed the monkeys. It was a bit intimdating tbh. The next thing we know we are being instructed by our driver to walk up the hill with a 10 year old kid who would show us around and 'protect us' from the monkeys!A couple of observations:There are a lot of monkeys up there, they are very wild and some are quite big/aggressive. I've encountered monkeys on many occasions before on my travels, but this experience was not a fun one tbh. They follow you closely and are not afraid of you at all. I was glad to be protected tbh, even if it was by a kid.On the way up we were joined by a man who the boy claimed would show us round. He kept trying to put a monkey on my wife for a pic despite us continually saying no. Many of them do not look like the healthiest monkeys you'll see tbh, so we were a bit worried. Two eventually jumped on my wifes head and another tried to steal my bag.There's lots of dodgy looking groups of men hanging about on the way to the temple. We were followed a few times. There is also quite a lot of trash about. I wouldn't say it's a very sanitary place and it's certainly not well looked after.The temple itself isn't really all that special and we didn't feel all that comfortable being there tbh. Several guys asked us for money and one even told me to be careful with our 'guide' as he was not to be trusted and would try and rob/take all my stuff. This 'guide' later on insisted on me giving him a 'gift' despite the fact he hadn't been invited to join us and hadn't really shown us anything in the 10 minutes or so he was there.The kid that walked with us was lovely and was from a very poor family. I'd have happily given him some decent money, but I suspect (and he implied as much) that much of it would get taken from him by the men that 'organise' these tours and who sit all day drinking chai at the entrance. I made sure to give him money before we were in eyeshot of them. Had he not been with us it would have been a pretty terrifying experience in all honesty.Our tuk tuk driver feigned some outrage at our experience, but it's all for show really. I suspect there is a pretty long running and established scam here. Be mindful.Ultimately this trip was way more hassle than its worth. I've at times felt a bit unsafe at places in India, but this was the absolute worst. My recommendation for Jaipur more broadly would be to book trips via your hotel. It might be more expensive, but there is accountability and your time won't be spent visiting places such as this where it feels unsafe and you're likely to get scammed. It's an amazing city, but there are many tuk tuk drivers that will offer you cheap personal tours which aren't always what they seem. Ours gave us no warning or heads up about the temple whatsoever, he merely sat with his feet up talking to his mates at the bottom.If you must go here please be very careful. I just don't think it's worth it at all.",0.4645,4

Monkey_Temple,Lucy,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Avoid avoid avoid.,"I don't usually write reviews but feel I need to warn others. We went as part of a day tour, this was one of 5 or 6 places we were going. I assumed it was just some ruins and the monkeys would be playing or doing their own thing on the ruins and that we would just watch them. I WAS WRONG. I can see now that I was naive and made 2 mistakes:1) I didn‚Äôt buy any of the money food the beggars were selling. In retrospect having some food in my hand would have made it easier to get the moneys off me as I could have thrown it and they would have chased it, leaving me alone. 2) The children of the beggars run round you and harass you as soon as they see you, they try and sell you things or offer to come with you to ‚Äúprotect you from the monkeys‚Äù - I should have taken one of the children up on this as no doubt they‚Äôd have been much braver than me when the monkeys surrounded us. Anyway, we started walking up the hill and there was a row of little tents, there are some extremely poor people living on the side of monkey temple, not very nice to see. They had a pig and a cow mid way through giving birth with them so to someone from the UK this was a bizarre enough start to the visit. As we got up the hill and saw more monkeys, I unzipped my bag and got my phone out. I think the monkeys thought I was getting food out of my bag and they jumped towards us. Some of the bigger ones are quite scary, I saw one grabbing the nuts out of another tourists hand, they aren‚Äôt cute like you‚Äôd imagine. I was surrounded by about 5 monkeys and more were running towards me, one jumped onto the back of my skirt and was swinging on it. I ended up throwing my water bottle which they all chased and we promptly turned around and walked away as fast as we could. They aren‚Äôt intimidated by humans (which they are in the other parts of India I‚Äôve been to) as they‚Äôre so used to seeing them and grabbing food off them.

Monkey_Temple,Liv Mari S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Amazing views,"The monkey temple is located in a small valley that you can reach by walking through the gate by the main road, then up the hill and down on the other side. On the way you will be able to see a great view, several other temples (the sun temple is at the top of the hill), and a lot of monkeys (hold on to your belongings). Once we walked through the gate a boy started walking with us, presenting himself, asking us questions and explaining things about the area to us. He was very polite and friendly, and we saw several other boys his age following other people around. We allowed him to show us around the area because he was so nice, but he also expected to be payed at the end, so if you want to avoid that you should let them know in the beginning. It is also good to know that if you enter any of the temples, the people there expect you to give a donation. We did not bring that much cash, so in one of the temples we only gave a few coins, and they were clearly angry with us for not giving more money, which was rather unpleasant. People also came up to us to make us hold one of the monkeys on our shoulders, and got quite angry when we refused to do it. A woman also walked right up to me to give me a red dot on my forehead, and when i tried to stop her she pushed my hand to the side, and demanded money from me before i could walk on. So the people there can be quite intense, and be mindful of who you want to give our money to.

Monkey_Temple,SeattleNomad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,One of my favorite stops in Jaipur!,"I'd first learned of Galta Ji from the Wild India documentary and wanted to see cannon-balling monkeys. However, I was hesitant since I've been around aggressive monkeys before and didn't want to get bitten. My friend and I visited in the late afternoon and we were one of a handful of people. This was one of the highlights of our trip and we spent about 3 hours there being entertained by all the monkeys (and even had to hike out after the sun had set). If you stay past sundown, the paths are dimly lit (but are lit enough for you to watch your step). If you're solo, it's a lonely path, but we had a local walk with us half the way and he insisted it was perfectly safe for us (two women) to traverse alone. First off, if you're planning to rickshaw/Uber/Ola, make sure to hire the driver for the duration of your stay at Galta Ji or be prepared to hike up and out to the Surajpol Bazar Road & Route 248 intersection to find a ride (save your water as the hike out is steep!). There is minimal cell phone reception at the Hanuman Ji (eastern) entrance so calling for a ride is difficult to impossible and there weren't any rickshaws or drivers for hire. I'd recommend entering from the Hanuman Ji side and if you want to walk out, go up the stairs through the temples and then out to the west past the Sun Temple. We didn't mind paying the camera fee since it was a negligible amount compared to other sites around the city and it was nice it was a flat fee/no higher foreigner fees. We never ran into any aggressive touts and thought the monkeys were tamer than most we've seen elsewhere in the world and within India. Yes, they're dirty and some are unhealthy because they are WILD--they may be tamer and used to human interaction, but they are not zoo animals and are not anyone's personal pets. We weren't pestered for donations as other reviewers complain of, but we also live in Mumbai, so may have grown used to beggars and scams. The temples are run down, but it's India and I can only imagine the cost to maintain or repair the structures. If visitors want to help restore the temples, I'm sure they'd be grateful for donations. If you're a photographer, you'll love the monkeys...they were tame and used to human interaction and I got some amazing shots. However, you do have to worry about some of the more playful younger monkeys wanting to crawl up your leg while you're staring into your viewfinder. I only had one I had to dodge, but it made for a funny experience. I definitely recommend making a stop at Galta Ji if you're in Jaipur...it's probably the most unique attraction we visited and I'll definitely be back to take more photos.",0.9924,5

Once at the Monkey Temple (also very dirty), our 10 year old guide (literally), Ravi, was feeding a tomato to a smaller monkey when my friend was attacked and bitten by a bigger monkey.  We have, so far, visited three hospitals (scary indeed!) to get her the requisite series of rabies shots.

But beware of the trap,"I'll start by saying Monkey / Sun Temple  is a must, and was arguably our favourite visit in Jaipur‚Ä¶ though visitors beware of potential scam. I'll jump to the chase, a smooth talking young man in his early twenties operates by offering you the chance to go with him to areas off the touristic map to buy some of Jaipur's finest fabrics. To put it simply, it's an outlet type shop that after our second visit was full of lured tourists with the same puzzled faces ‚Ä¶ Other notable offerings of the young man may include being invited to the wedding of an unknown person from 'the neighborhood‚Äô (of course an overpriced sarii for the occasion is highly encouraged), being on taken on a ride on the back of a moped through Jaipur's hectic streets (the most fun and dangerous part of the night), flooting the bill for petrol for a tour of Jaipur which will of course include another visit to the outlet shop and lastly a meal in a very very local restaurant where you will politely pick up the bill (including your hosts comission, note; he will most likely go back inside while you wait in the car to ‚Äòquestion the bill‚Äô aka collect his commission) There you have it. Research has shown he and young men alike operate as a gang and with the help of some police (note his 'father‚Äô is a policeman). I write this review / literary piece in awe at the smoothness of the operation, it's impressive. Luckily, we only paid over the odds for a few things, but I hope this message saves readers / potential victims millions of rupees in the futurePS.

Follow temple timings from the website. Timings differ during summer and winter and special darshan timings are during Janmasthami.2. Lots of florist and puja item shops outside the temple. So no need to bring anything from home.3. Systematic entry and exit. Place to keep shoes in return for token. Do not keep shoes randomly anywhere as dogs and monkeys are in plenty here.4. For best darshan try to squeeze yourself for the front row. Camera is allowed!5. If you want to go inside the temple near the radha krishna, then talk to the pujari. Remember to dress in suit/saree if you want to go inside.6. Try to get tulsi and chandan offered to govind devjji. 7. If you want to conduct any special puja/darshan, talk to the puruhit and go in off season (not during bhadoo month/near janmasthami) due to crowd.8. Before the temple is a place where you can feed grass to cows. Also, you can feed pigeons. Considered pious deed to do so. All grains and grass available there itself.9. Separate counter for collecting prasad. 10. Near to the temple is City Palace and Jantar Mantar which are also good to visit. Just check timings, whicha re usually before 4pm. So plan trip accordingly. 11. Also, Hawa Mahal is walkable and so it JOhri Bazaar which are famous for shopping. 12. Just a few kms before is LMB Restaurant which is perhaps the oldest and safest place to relish traditional rajasthani food, jhewar, ladoo, phini and churma. Note: Parking is problematic.

Eleday-Amer,Pushpendra,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,VERY DISAPPOINTING AND  A BAD EXPERIENCE!,"Me and my family and gone for the eleday programme one year back and thoroughly enjoyed. Infact you might find my review somewhere here below.This time I arranged my parents to enjoy the festival of Holi here arranged by the organisers as ‚ÄúEleholi Festival 2020‚Äù. But It was a disgusting experience for them. (1)We were not informed about cancellation of the event due to Coronavirus (2)Infact when we called for confirmation of pick & drop , we were again not informed about the cancellation (3)We were obliged to get the pick up and drop but that was the only good service BUT even the pick up guy didn‚Äôt inform that such event was cancelled (4)On reaching there my parents were informed about the cancellation and about them sending emails to all participants which I disagree of getting (5)I had selected the highest placed ticket but no one bothered to call us informing about the cancellation (6)These kind of organisations are the best examples for us Indians going complacent with their product and service when they start getting a good name. (7)Very poor behaviour of the staff as well for giving out lies to my parents about the whole situation",-0.2031,3
Eleday-Amer,orchid,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Elephant ride,"Dear Guest 

Due to COVID we didn't organize holi with colors but insist that we organized holi with flowers. 
I would like to give some of the answers to your question. 
1. We mentioned it that there will be no colors at the festival but there will be flowers insist of colors. 
2. We called your parents one day before and explain all situations and also told them everything but they still told us they wanted to come and experience the holi with flowers and elephants.
3.  The driver was hired, and we already talked with your parents then why would the driver speak about it again. 
4. on reaching the Holi festival we again told them that if you want you can have a look and go back we will refund you, but they said"" we understand you cant organize a festival with colors, and we are more interested with the elephant so we would like to join.
5. This I already answered you previously we called a day before holi festival to know where they are staying or interested to visit or not. 
6. Don't mind you are a good example of a person who just wants to enjoy everything and at end of the day want your money back. As you can write anything does don't know what happens exactly.
7. I feel disappointed when you wrote this cause I was here most of the time with your parents and I did my best to make them feel good. I still remember that they needed tissue paper and water bottles. Even there was a counter and self-service but I run and get a water bottle for them. It's so easy to write that the behavior of the staff was not good. 

I even spoked with you over on phone but you weren't ready to listen to the situation after all you will listen to your parents. you should be.
Maybe now you could understand. The only cause of COVID we couldn't organize festival with colors.

Eleday-Amer,Pushpendra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Best Experience,"Visited ELEDAY with family in January 2020 . The fee was quite expensive. The area didn't seem suitable for elephants to live. No water for the elephants to splash in (which I know elephants love to do ). The area was very dry, very limited food for them. They just stood still and lonely. (The elephants were the ones they use for tourists to ride up to Amer Fort and Palace), such a shame! The elephants looked sad and unhappy. The one we had to paint and interact with was blind in one eye. I noticed she had a very big cataract in her left eye. When i questioned one of the fellows there, as to why they haven't done anything to remove it, the reply was ""but she can still see!"". 'and she may not go through the operation'.  I said, 'that's not the point and she should  have been attended to and not left like that"" I don't know why the owners have kept her in that condition , (the cataract didn't happen overnight) it must have been growing for quite a while and never checked in time. It doesn't seem to me that the owners care for these beautiful animals properly and SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN . That was so sad to see. I think they will lose money if they  lose an elephant. That's cruel I think!, They are only looking how much money they can make out of these poor unfortunate lovely animals and lose the tourists at the same time!  i ADVISE NO ONE TO ENCOURAGE THE OWNERS TO CONTINUE RUNNING THIS PLACE BY VISITING OR WRITING GLOWING ACCOUNTS OF THEIR VISIT! They don't deserve to be operating.",-0.9636,1

We appreciate your concern and feedback, but we want to tell you that you went to another place there are so many touts that misguide tourists and use our organization's name

Our elephants are fit and in very good condition There are some rescued elephants as well.  There is plenty of food for the elephant and the only industry is elephants that feed the everyday fruits.

However, the animals still work part of the day doing the standard fort runs on the road and then just transport us tourists round a 200m route in the field. They don't look badly treated, but each of our 2 animals did have a couple of cuts/sores. We got to meet, ride, paint, wash and feed them and the kids loved it, but my wife was a little upset. It's a very expensive visit and the handlers will ask for extra money in tips.",0.8704,5

Thanks for your feedback. We have some rescued elephants you might have seen time they rubbed with the trees so they have some cut marks. We give special treatment in that case.
With money, we charge 3500 INR, which we never pressure to spend. many other organizations ask for 5000 as well. Tips are gratitude which is not included in the package it all depends on you if you want to give or not.

,,,,,After spending some time with the elephants and their caretakers I noticed the use of the word LE so many times. LE in Hindi means Have iT. Why they use iT so much? Because elephants need to eat 16 hours a day! Every elephant has his own caretaker and feeds the elephant for hours and hours every day. I was happy to see these beautiful animals are well taken care of. The people working there are very Nice and welcoming and the boss is a very special excentric person who you Should definately meet.

I could not get enough from all the cuddles and gave her a little neck massage. I definitely recommend everyone to do this. The people at the elephant garden are very friendly and helpful and shared our enthusiasm. Khan took loads of pictures and videos for us while doing the activities.

We learned about how difficult it is for elephants to bear the weight of passengers (Amer Fort) and how the family at Dera Amer were trying to help the elephants.

I would like to jealously guard this amazing place to ensure we can get in on our inevitable return to Rajasthan but sometimes a place is so special you have to share it and this is such a place.  We stayed for two nights at Dera Amer and whilst you can visit for a day (it‚Äôs a short distance outside of Jaipur) I really recommend that you stay at least one night in their beautifully appointed and luxurious tented camps. The levels of service and attention to detail are unparalleled.  We were greeted by Ripudaman who looked after us for the duration of our stay and made sure our every wish was catered for. He took us on a tour of the local area and gave us a real understanding of life and the history of the rural hamlet.  We were assigned our own personal elephant - the beautiful Rangmala - for the duration of our stay.  She joined us every morning for breakfast and we took her for walks, bathed and  fed her.  We felt very bonded to her by the end of our stay and were so sad to say goodbye.  All the elephants are very well looked after and obviously happy, having been rescued from a life of hard work as tourist attractions in Jaipur - they are the lucky ones! We were the only people staying in our camp with four amazing staff looking after us -  this is something they try to ensure for all guests so the experience is very personalised.  The food was delicious - honestly the best we‚Äôve had in India to date.  Locally grown on the owners farm, organic, beautifully prepared and lots to choose from.  The whole enterprise is very ecological - no plastic to be found anywhere.  Our stay at Dera Amer has been the highlight of our trip.  We are already planning a return visit with our children.

If you are not nature lovers or outdoor people one night however would be sufficient. From the moment we arrived we were looked after and waited on hand and foot. The tents are beautifully appointed with piping hot water. Each camp area comes with what I can only describe as your private 'tent butler'! There are only two camp areas with four tents in each however if one tent is booked they will not let out the rest so you have total privacy. Although a bit on the pricey side this place is worth it. All drinks and food and snacks are included in the price including alcohol. Beautiful chilled wine was served at our camp area when we arrived. Dinner starts with sundowner drinks, then a fire pit and then onto dinner either at your private camp area or another location. The buffet dinner was excellent with the best naan fresh and hot from the tandoor sandlots of choice. They also offered 'western food' if we wanted it but we declined.The animals were great entertainment for the kids who could go and visit the elephants any time they wished. Elephant came the first breakfast time and had a good bath (be careful of the side spray when she shoots it out of her trunk!).

","We did not want to go to one of the elephant places which uses their elephants at the Amber Fort for the controversial rides so asked at our hotel - the Royal Heritage Haveli - for a recommendation for a place where the elephants were properly looked after.  So far as we could judge this was such a place.  It only has two elephants at the moment, females in their thirties rescued from circus life.  However in addition to looking after these elephants, and a camel, the place tries to educate local elephant owners about  feeding, medical treatment and other care. They were fully appreciative of the fact that we did not want to paint or ride the elephants.  They told us they did not really approve of the painting but many visitors expected to be able to do it and it did not harm the elephants. They are careful about when they wash the elephants or let them bathe and although they can be ridden, it is only in howdahs which are much lighter than normal and which only accommodate two people at a time. I note what has been said about the riding and painting in some reviews but suggest that it is easy to criticise when you are not having to make hard choices about how to raise funds for good work - if you are too purist you will fail altogether; some compromise which does not undermine your main objectives may be necessary.",0.8531,5

India was hot, humid, and the days could be tough outside for too many hours. But the evenings were lovely and for sure the best evening our 15 day trip was spent at Dera Amer.  We are a family of 3 with a 14 yr old daughter.  We were the only guests and were treated like royalty!  My daughter had the experience of a lifetime painting the trunks and feeding these beautiful animals.  The ride was so peaceful and meditative.  We loved seeing the peacocks in the trees, listening to nature, ambling along the road. The champagne would have been a lot easier to drink through a straw, but having the glass was an added nicety.  And the food for dinner - AMAZING!!  Some of the best we had anywhere!  We absolutely loved this part of trip and were so impressed with the staff and everything about the experience.",0.9975,5
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Jerrold L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017,Every visitor to Jaipur should visit Dera Amer,"Our travel agent arranged the evening at Dera Amer for us so off we went (we never asked the price of the evening, but it didn't really matter because the experience should not be missed at any cost. About 30-40 minutes out of Jaipur, we bumped along this unpaved road until a clearing with a small open gate. Waiting for us was Mara the 27 year old elephant and Mahoot, her caretaker and driver. We were greeted by staff for a quick welcome drink and then joined more staff inside the compound where we were introduced to Mara and told about her history. The team was led by a most personable manager who was superb. Since it was quite hot, they asked if we would join them and wash down Mara's legs and feet with water and a scrub brush which we both did. Then came the chance to give Mara a drink. Holding the largest garden hose I have ever seen, we poured water into the end of Mara's trunk, and poured, and poured and poured. Finally, she lifted her head and directed her trunk into her mouth, squirting her entire reserve of water in her trunk into her mouth. She quickly placed her trunk in the trough once again and repeated the filling it and emptying it into her mouth. Then came the facepainting. One of the caregivers helped us by outlining a lotus leaf on Mara's snout and let us color it in and add other features to the design. Of course this was watercolor pain that was harmless to Mara. Nothing at this camp is incompatible with the elephants' best care. We washed up now, and then climbed a short staircase to mount Mara's back while she meandered along a trail on the property for 45 minutes. That was a lot of fun, and were surprised to pass a herd of black face monkeys and peacocks as we meandered around the property. We stopped part way and enjoyed a delicious glass of wine, although drinking the wine without spilling while Mara bumped along was quite the feat! We learned that Mahout's family lives 750 km away and returns home infrequently. He has been an elephant caregiver and driver for more than 2 decades and he certainly treats his elephant as if it were his child. With the ride over, we sat down for appetizers, drinks and quiet company. A toothsome dinner followed. We had our choices of vegetarian or meat meal, an excellent bbq buffet with a huge selection of grilled foods. We watched a naan bread making demonstration in the red hot barbecue, which was fascinating. This was definitely not a rushed dinner or evening but as the hour got late, we organized our driver to take us back to the Rambaugh Palace. Before we left, we thanked everyone for this wonderfully loving experience, tipped the whole team, and left a special tip for Mahout, Mara's elephant whisperer.The goal of this camp is to rescue elephants, mostly from the city and give them a place to enjoy life and mature. There are currently 3 elephants at the camp but we understand their goal is to acquire 7 in total. These Asian elephants, smaller than their African cousins, are pampered and well-looked cared for at the camp. As our evening at the camp drew to an end, we were quite heartened that both the camp owners and their employees had a love for the elephants that was measured in everyone's actions, with goals to keep the elephants happy and healthy, working only in the cooler part of the day. Mara was retired for the evening as we wrapped up our dinner with delicious ice cream and so did we, having rekindled our love of elephants and their majestic beauty. Respect and love between the elephants and their caregivers makes for a most healthy relationship in which anyone, man or beast, would be happy to indulge. We urge everyone who reaches Jaipur with an evening to spare, to call and book an evening at Dera Amer. You will definitely be impressed with the experience you have with nature's largest animal, the elephant and the dedicated caregivers who take wonderful care of the elephants. .",0.9995,5

Dera Amer is home to a handful of working Asian Elephants. My friend for the day was a beautiful, kind lady elephant named Ramballa. I got to scrub her trunk to her pure delight, painted her and then rode on her through a part of the gardens. She was such a peaceful creature to hug and cuddle with. Not many people will believe that I've cuddled a massive elephant, but I did and she made me love every bit of it.Dera Amer has very welcoming soft green grass and a cooling dining area where you can spend some time at. They are very proud of how to treat and use these gentle giants. I would recommend it over and over again. Pre-booking is essential!

Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,hobart_10,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Lovely experience,"This was included in our itinerary on our tour with Enchanting Travels (see separate review on them - really excellent) and we didn't know anything about Dera Amer except that we would have an elephant ride which is what we had requested. We arrived at about 5pm for the elephant ride plus dinner.  We had such a great time.  The elephant ride was so much fun, through fairly barren landscape but just to be on top of a beautiful elephant was all we wanted.  About a half hour into the ride we approached a raised platform and we were curious to see what was coming up next.  To our delight we were handed a glass of wine and off we went again on the elephant ride.  It was quite hilarious trying to get the wine into our mouths rather than down our shirts with the lumbering elephant seriously swaying as he walked.  It was great fun and we got quite a laugh from the whole wonderful experience.  Then we were treated to an absolutely beautiful Indian meal under a large colourful tent on the property.  The food was some of the loveliest we had on our 2 weeks in India and apparently most of the ingredients are organically grown on site.  The staff were very kind, attentive and friendly.  The location of Dera Amer is about half way between Jaipur and the little village of Samode, where we stayed at gorgeous Samode Palace.  In our opinion it is easier to go from Jaipur rather than Samode because the road is better and the time a bit shorter. We would heartily recommend this experience at Dera Amer both for the elephants and the food.",0.9977,5

Most importantly we felt the animals were well cared for and we were recommended Dera Almer by our Tour Company Abercrombie and Kent for this very reason.  We arrived with our car and driver and were greeted nicely.  We fed the elephants whole bananas. We spent a bit of time with the elephants and also the camels. We were then given an Elephant Safari which we enjoyed tremendously, was just so funny, and which created memories we will never forget.  The area is a dry, arid region,  Sandy with some scrub-like trees.  We saw birds on our Safari including peacocks.  They asked us if we would like a long or short safari and we opted for the longer one.  It was such a novelty to be riding the elephant with the Mahoot sitting in front of us with his bright orange turban driving the elephant for us.  We stopped at a clearing and were provided with a lovely Indian lunch under an awning all on our own with the Indian gentlemen to serve us.  Again, so special enjoyable and memorable.  We saw the tandoor oven and the chapattis being made.  All the traditional cooking pots were lined up from which we could choose lovely food.  Afterwards we had some Earl Grey Tea!  We seemed to be given as much time as we wanted.  The owner's nephew showed as all around in a jeep as we had heard they have Glamping here.  He showed us the tents which were set up and equipped like hotel bedrooms.  It must be a very special place to spend the night and would rather appeal to us.  We liked when we stroked the camels...they have such woolley, densely textured, curly hair on their necks!  Awwww all so sweet charming and memorable!

The owners of this preserve are really trying to do good by the elephants and the environment.  It is located out of town on a bumpy road and it does make you feel like you are in the country.  There is initial time with the elephants, then a 45 minute ride, then, for us, lunch outside.  The ride was a real highlight and at no point did we feel we were exploiting these wonderful animals.

To our surprise when our group of 18 arrived we were told there were only 3 elephants. We were given bananas to feed them, then two at a time were given at most a five minute ride around the yard.  Next we were told it was too cold to wash the elephants, but they poured water on the trunk of one elephant and we could take turns with a brush to pretend to wash the elephant and get a picture taken. As this was taking too long a second elephant and brush were found. Finally we were given one set of paints and two paint brushes and could again take turns posing for pictures while we ""painted"" our elephant. Our visit ended with sugar cane being brought out to feed the two available elephants. No meal was provided and after about 40 minutes we were sent back to our bus.

We were told that they do only a few rides a day and do not wish to turn this into a ride factory but rather keep it as a family owned farm. We were the only people there during our tour which made it even more enjoyable. We did a 45 minute ride through the desert jungle with a ""driver"" which was 3000 rupees each (we did it with 2 people so I'm not sure how the price would change for a different size group). This included time with the elephants before, a 45 minute ride, painting the elephants after, and lots of pictures. We booked this the day before.

Seeing the poor elephants taking people up to the fort in Jaipur was quite upsetting and I would urge people to NOT USE THESE RIDES as they are cruel to the animals. The Dera Amer safari has a small number of rescued elephants. They only do one or two walks a day on sort sandy ground with one or two people on board maximum? They aren't poked with spikes to make them walk faster and respond to vocal commands and squeezes from the handler. We had a brief amble around the countryside for half an hour then had a drink and a supper by a brazier which was very nice. They grow the food themselves where possible and the cooking was v good.I'd recommend it as an evening out of Jaipur.,0.3612,4

The day we visited we fed the wrong elephant by mistake before mounting another, and no one bothered to give us another banana for ours. It sounds trivial but our ride was quite upset about it the whole time, which should not be underestimated. Those are wild animals and accidents do happen. We felt our guide was a bit tense because of it as well, trying to constantly comfort the elephant while we were already on the tour, which didn't help.

On arrival we had our first meet with Laxmi and fed her bananas . We were then taken to the house for drinks ( all soft drinks , beer and wine are included in price ) and too cool down as this was a hot day . When Laxmi was ready for bath time we handed water and scrubbing brushes and this allowed us to interact more and gain the trust of Laxmi . Yes we got a bit wet but that's part of the fun !!! When Laxmi had dried off we painted our own design , with natural colourings . The staff were all so friendly and nothing was too much trouble . They were on hand with information , photo taking and drinks when required . We were not rushed and spent as much time as was wanted with Laxmi . When Laxmi was due for a break from the heat we also took a welcome break . The safari ride was good with the mahout checking we were comfy and pointing out any other animals on out travels . Again , drinks were offered half way round which we thought was a great added touch . We said our goodbyes to Laxmi after the ride and arrived at our private dining area which was just beautiful . Lit with candles , cold drinks and staff on hand for literally anything. Starters , the buffet and dessert were amazing , we even watched our bread being made . All the food is fresh produce .

Whatever you do, do not go on a Sunday.Akshardham is where ""tour groups"" go to see something textbook ""Indian"". In that way the Akshardham does for Indian Temples what Remix/Mashups do for Old Songs... It's like the phrase you say when someone asks you ""Say something in Indian"" (yes - that happens here in the USA and yes I have instantly judged them - lol!)Imagine if Disney decided to create mini versions of the Great Pyramids... You could eat, buy your souvenirs and never have to go to the real thing... That's what these guys have done with the is modernized reboot of ancient India. It's nice but there's not journey involved just a metro token!This is not ORIGINAL art. It is a cornucopia of Indian architecture  in a theme park-ish setting with light shows, exhibition and food court! So while it is a way to kill boredom in Delhi (why would anyone be bored in Delhi is beyond me) - and even better way for tour groups to get an instant WOW from the tourist... is is not as ""rich"" at the original.The originals were create in the 16th century in all white marble - they are best examples are found in the Jain temple of Rankhpur (1.5 hrs outside of Udaipur).

I have found most tourist places have a much inflated official price for foreign visitors. You should spend at least 5 hours in this place (including watching their movies) to give justice for its creation. The food in their food hall is also amazingly good and cheap. ,0.9168,5

The elephants were rescued from circuses from the south of India and are therefore not able to adjust to life in the wild. All the elephants were very affectionate and sweet.Faran picked me up from Amer Fort and on the way back we stopped off for some chai and he introduced me to his friends who were practicing for the kite festival that is happening in a couple of days.

It's the only mall in Jaipur that looks good and gives you a pleasant vibe. You may find rush on weekends but you wouldn't find this as difficulty. Mall is too large in width than any other mall in Jaipur. You can find multiple shops there to fit your shopping needs. However, this is not a grocery shop. So don't expect D-Mart alike shops. There are good clothing shops, food shops (like pizza, kebab, KFC, etc.) at food court. There is good capacity of parking with complete security at most of the entrance. Mall is equipped with automatic doors, security cameras, detectors, clean public restrooms, clean floors, lifts, elevator, Cinema Hall, Food Court, Toy shops, Gaming mania, Luxury electronic devices showroom, Branded Wears, Cafe, Restaurant, Book shop, Artificial Jewellry, etc. However, near WTP you can find other malls such as GT, Central GT, etc. But you may find too much rush there on weekends. Also, parking is not free. What might be annoying are beggers trying to sell Rose. You can also hire cabs, rikshaws, bikes,etc. to visit this place.",0.9768,5

We love the experience of sitting and visiting with people of the area, sharing a meal, visiting the ancient Hindu ruins and also seeing the sights on the way to the village. We made a stop at a Hindu holy site built around baths and also in the middle of a little village for chai tea on our way to Rusi Rani. Our group of 10 traveled in two jeeps, one open air and one closed. I will say that the roads are awfully bumpy and it is an all-day trip from Jaipur. Giri, who we met on our previous trip, was also our guide for this trip and he is so knowledgeable and speaks excellent English. We were pleased to notice improvements in the village infrastructure -- restrooms with running water and solar panels -- that had been added since our last trip. Giri said that the money received from the tours (usually one a week) was being used for girls' education and village infrastructure. The villagers were very friendly, especially the children. You might want to think about bringing some bubbles, markers & paper or other small activities to play with the kids -- they enjoyed my pathetic attempts at drawing animals!

Rusirani_Village,danielabedandview,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,The real Rajasthan. Off the beaten track: wonderful experience Rusirani Village,"Rusirani is a traditional village, more than 2000 years old.  A place situated around 130 km. from Jaipur, so put it in your itinerary if you are travelling from Jaipur to Agra and you will have a different, more real experience over this incledible country. Rusirani is simplicity, there is no use of money in the village, there is no proper supply of electricity , network connection and transportation. I was really looking for a place like this, when I was building my itinerary in Rajasthan, Agra and Delhi and now that I have been there for a day with my husband and our 10 years old daughter, I feel that this experience has been the most fullfilling of the entire trip. Our wonderful guide, Mr. Girdhari (Giri), that I contacted at rusirani.village@gmail.com, had told me: this is not a touristy experience, so I don't promise anything, nobody is going to do anything special or fake for you. It was true, nothing was done to sell us a carpet or a juwel, but the people that we met had a lot to give, they warmed our hearts with their pure smiles and our communication went beyond the difficulty of understanding each other!We paid some money, yes, but this money is for the jeep transportation, for the guided tour of the ancient temple and ruins and..the beautiful thing is that most of this money is for a great cause: for the solar panels that they are installing and for the family of a young girl of the village, so she can go to school. In Rusirani children can only study until 14 years old and most of the times girls would quit school instead of going to study in the cities around, unless supported by people like us. The family (that changes every time) prepares your lunch and together with the rest of the village, offers you what they have: simplicity and love. Our 10 years old daughter loved the experience too!

We met Girdhari at Abhaneri step-well and went via jeep to the Village where we received a friendly welcome from Raju and the group of families living in her area. We had 4 meals during our stay, all were local recipes, filling and delicious. Our itinerary was nicely filled, allowing us to spend time with the community in the beautiful quiet countryside, soaking it all in. We watched the sunset from the fort walls with three of the local girls and that evening talked with the locals around the fire pit. Dancing and playing with the children is a memory I cherish. The next day was lovely as we had gotten to know the family more and they kindly showed me the views from the rooftops before picking berries and coriander in the fields. After a hearty breakfast we walked the local landscape, exploring few of the 352 beautiful heritage sites of Rusirani Village with Girdhari before lunch then a drop off in Jaipur. It was the hospitality of Raju and her family and Girdhari and the company of Chandni and the villagers that made our experience so happy and special. Plus the quiet nature of the village and clean rooms meant that it was the best night sleep we had our whole trip! Arrangements were easy as we got quick replies and Girdhari‚Äôs easy going nature filled us with confidence. It was clear to see that the money was going to a good place.

The village is literally on a hilltop and it is best to take a jeep / other vehicles ( if you plan to go on your own) that have good ground clearance.I have been personally wanting to visit the place since the last 2 years. I first heard about them 2 years ago on Tripadvisor and every time I used to mention their name to anyone, no one knew about them yet there was a village somewhere in Rajasthan that everyone warmly talked about on Tripadvisor. This last weekend, the 8th and 9th July, I decided to visit it (Full Moon). I called up the number I had with me of Mr. Girdari ji ( Giri) and he told me that of course, he remembers talking to me earlier ( many months ago). I had already spoken to him a couple of times now and he had already me an email with all the details of the visit. Giri has an excellent attitude of accommodating visitors' needs. Like in my case, I wished to go on those dates and he managed those days for me. Rusirani village folks are very nice, sweet, welcoming, caring and they will do everything to make you comfortable. I remember mentioning about lemon when I was feeling not so good, and next day one of the village bhaiya got desi lemons... :) I halted their overnight and talked with the ladies until midnight, enjoyed biddi ( very light ones because of the company of them) and slept in a charpai under the sky. I danced with the kids, took a shower under the hand pump, saw the real village life and eat the delicious humble food. Rusirani village is a complete experience in itself. I haven't yet even started talking about its history, temples, forts, and architectural places around the village. There is Neelkhant Mahadev Mandir ( temple), fort ( about 8-9 KM from the village), and other structures worth exploring.Rusirani village started being called as Rusi rani because once a queen ( Rani) got upset with her husband and she came to this village. After spending two months, the raja ( king) asked her to come back but she decided to stay in the village itself. Her husband made the palace for her in the village, made the village gate that you would see upon entering the village and other structures too. If you like to visit Rusirani village, I would suggest ( as a group or solo), to speak with Giri ( 097845 41515 | 09829900120) and tell him about your date of visit. To ensure right sustainability and proper experience of every visitor, they plan the visits. If you are looking for an Indian paid companion during your India travel, then Giri is one of the best persons too. He listens well and he is a decent person so ask him and he would be more than happy to translate conversions, details, add value to your India visit.",0.9938,5

We had seen the bustle of the cities and wanted to see how many of the India people live. We were not disappointed. The village is in a fairly remote location so life there is still surprisingly simple.  We traveled over bumpy terrain to a small village on the side of a hill. We were greeted by beaming faces and shy children peering around their mother's leg to see us. We felt so welcomed. We were invited to sit in a raised mud sleeping area and offered fresh tea. The villagers don't speak English but our guide translated back and forth for us. The village is home to an extended family of about 100, but when we first arrived only the young children, women and an elderly man were home. The children were fascinated by our digital camera and delighted in seeing their image on the screen. We enjoyed a traditional lunch and given gifts from the village. We also explored the village with its school and temples. Very little money is used in the village, only for petrol for a tractor and for clothing. Everything else is bartered for.By visiting Rusirani village some of the cost goes to the families. In exchange the families must send their girls to school and support them.Without this type of program most rural girls would not attend school.Our visit to the village has left an amazing impression on all of us.

You can talk with them and just as you are curious about their traditions they are curious about yours. Thus a real exchange. Only one smalll group is accepted each day and each group visits a different fanily  so there is no possibility of Rusi rani becoming a tourist trap. As the vast majority of Indians still live in the  vllages I found it really insightful to learn about their daily life. Giri our guide is Universty educated and speaks English very well. He facilitates rhe echanges with the villagersAs a bonus the village is located on the grounds of an ancient civilization possibly over 2000 years old with a still funtioning Hindu temple ( great carvings), a ruined Jain temple and the remnants of an old fort built about 600 years ago.

Russirani village is located on a hilltop surrounded by Aravali mountains. It is roughly 100km from Jaipur which comes before Alwar. It is popularly known for its Abhaneri step well (8th century marvel) and 10th century Harshat Mata Temple. The village was named after the queen of Alwar. I found this place here. I was quite surprised to see mostly 5 star reviews for any organisation. I was quite curious and read the reviews. I instantly liked it because of two reasons: 1) The money they collected from the guests was used to sponsor a girl child‚Äôs education in the village 2) I was quite curious how they were conducting village tourism.The road to the village is easily located in the map but the road isn‚Äôt that great. The road from Jaipur to Dausa (NH11) is really nice after that the state highway is quite bumpy for 30km. The hospitality of the villagers was really nice. We had some interesting debates about tattoos, child marriage, village life, education etc. After an awesome lunch we went to an dilapidated fort. An awesome adventure: hiking to the fort and jumping across the fort walls to enter it. The fort seems to be of the historical importance. Strange that it has been left in ruins.

Rusirani is an eyeopening trip back in time to a few centuries ago. There is no running water, no electricity, no modern amenities. Sheltered from the modern world, most people have lived here their entire lives. It's amazing to watch them interact, go about their daily tasks, tend to their animals, cook, hang out etc. We were invited to lunch that was cooked over a fire, basically the same way our grandparent's grandparents did ages ago. The villagers were very warm and welcoming. They showed a lot of interest in us as we did in them. Our guide (born and raised in the village) was one of the very few with a college education, and did an incredible job explaining and translating everything.I highly recommend a visit - one of the highlights of our trip to India. It's also for a good cause. They use the proceeds as a community to help children get an educationPut this on your itinerary. You will not regret it.

They said that the don't have many families, so especially appreciated seeing us with our 11 and 13 year old sons. Part of the tour fee sponsors girls continuing their schooling past 8th grade, a no-brainer for this US teacher. The 30 min jeep ride from the junction point is where the adventure begins (and helps explain why the villagers don't easily/frequently leave). Guests' arrival is always a surprise to a particular community within the larger village bc the organizer, who grew up there, wants it to be a normal day, with whatever happens to be going on. We had some time to chat, asking one another about our daily lives (mostly with the men and kids bc the women were cooking a meal for us). Then we got to watch the chapati-making (and attempt to roll out some ourselves -- we failed and laughed a lot in the process). Our sons connected first with the five year old local kids by sharing names, goofy faces and playing hand clapping games. It broke the timidity we were all experiencing. I highly recommend this trip as a way to connect with people outside of the cities. ",0.9211,5

Rusirani_Village,SandraRodriguesBR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,The Best of Jaipur,"Tired of busy Jaipur with the horns, the traffic jams, the pushing sellers and old forts? Treat yourself with a day to a rural visit and experience the true hospitality of the people of Rusirani village. Yes you can go by yourself and save a couple of bucks, but no, it will by far not be as rich as it can be. I strongly suggest you contact two social entrepreneurs from the region and let them take you by the hand and help the process of interaction in the local tribal language and their good English. While these youngsters make a living out of it, they do have this commitment of seeing to it the community benefit. One visit a day, with maximum people, to preserve the authenticity and  avoid disturbing the daily life too much. Their focal point is girls education, one of the selection criteria of your host family.They will take you for a full day (or more) and will give you that kind of memory that every time you think about it provokes this peaceful inward smile for the rest of your life. See this beautiful valley with an ancient temple and archaeological sites, irrigated wheat, mustard, or maize. Smell it, listen to the sounds. Feel the genuine and unconditional joy of the children, the diminishing shyness of the women and hesitant curiosity of the village elders. Do bring some photos on your phone or tablet so you can share about your family and your land if asked by the villagers. Special care is taken to assure food is safe so no Delhi Belly to be expected. Treat yourself to this experience after visiting city after city. You will love it, your teenage children will love it. And bring some additional money as in the end it will be hard to resist to donate something extra to this community.

Rusirani_Village,Hilda A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2014 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A must! - Warm welcome with real village hospitality,"I read about the village on Tripadvisor and decided to check it out by myself, since I wanted to have a more authentic experience watching life in the countryside of India.  I can say that I am very grateful I did!  Being a lone woman traveler, I was always worried about my safety, but as soon as I got picked up at my guest house in Jaipur, I could see that I was in good hands.  The driver/guide, Ghirdari was extremely courteous, respectful and friendly, and had a lot of information to share.  We had a nice chat during the 2-3 hour drive up in the hills, and he kindly stopped at interesting places, which allowed me to take wonderful pictures.  The village itself was sparsely populated and very basic, yet refreshing to see after all the hustle and bustle in Jaipur, and the villagers were quite interested to talk and socialize with their new visitor.  Communication was a little difficult at times, but Ghirdari helped out translating, and even without his help, it was not very hard to get a point across.  He showed me around one family's household and surrounding areas of the village, including a temple and some ruins.  Some hired workers with heavy machinery were trying to bore a new well for the village when I arrived, unfortunately without success that day.  After a good home-made meal at one of the families' homes with THE BEST sweet mawa (milk solids) I have ever tasted, I went for a walk with the village women through the fields, and ended up at a larger gathering at the local school. Even though these people had just met me and we were not able to speak a common language, they were quick to invite me to sit down and share their food once again. I found their hospitality quite warm and pleasant.  After the visit, Ghirdari was ready to drop me back in Jaipur late that afternoon, and went out of his way to drive me to the local market when I told him I was looking forward to see it (unfortunately, it was already closed, but I appreciated his efforts), and to help me buy a replacement for my broken cell phone.  I arrived safely in Jaipur that evening.  All in all, I would say if you are looking to see something different and REAL, how other people live day by day in a remote place, go ahead and visit this village.  Do not go if you are looking to have a touristy experience or expect the people to do something special for you (dance, presentation, etc.).  This is just for you to get a glimpse of rural life in this part of the world.  I was particularly glad to see that the organizers (who are members of the village themselves) did not seek to commercialize the village experience, and tried to keep it as authentic as it gets, the goal being to collect all the earnings towards a local fund to improve education of the village's young girls. A good cause indeed!Tips: Wear a hat and sunscreen if you visit during spring/summer. Bring your own toilet paper/hand sanitizer as well, as there are no western toilet facilities. If you wish to bring something for the villagers, do not give clothes or toys, or the like, as the organizers do not wish to create material expectations in the villagers/families from every visitor they have (which I found to be great).  If you must, take school supplies or books that can go to the school and be shared by all the children.",0.9981,5
Rusirani_Village,WorldWidePlayer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Interesting Village Life,"I've traveled to several villages in my life, but I found this Village to be very organized! By my experiences, this means it is becoming commercialized. By all means, as of now, this is still a meaningful Village to experience. A few things that I found out: (1) I thought it was no communication in the mountains (Found Mr. Bhagirath using his phone frequently) (2) The guide (Bhagirath) is a well educated young man, but he is lying about being from this Village. He has his Business Degree and is making money from these tours... Don't get me wrong, he has it well organized, but why lie? Mr. Bhagirath suggests to not leave money in the Village, however, we did! We gave it to the family that cooked for us, it's only right. We gave them the food and they had no idea what it was (US Money), then I quickly let them know the Rupree currency amount. I spoke with Mr. Bhagirath about why not telling visitors that he isn't from there, but declined comment. Enough about Mr. Bhagirath, the Village is a must if you are looking for a Village that is kind of cut off from the conventional Indian Societies. The whole has a lot of Peacocks and Black Faced Monkeys to see along with historical monuments! The kids and families are fantastic! Very nice and inquisitive. If you can, bring a few books for the kids or things that the Village can use as a whole. It is a young lady that is one of the Universities that is in the Village. (Congrats to her).

Rusirani_Village,Jackie C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"A wonderful ""must do"" experience of village life","One of the highlights of my trip to India was spending time at Rusirani. I was not sure to go, but I'm really glad I did. The village is around 2.5 hours from Jaipur on the way to Agra, and has a challenging road up and over the hills. My guide, Giri, picked me up in Jaipur in a jeep. He and some colleagues have started a NGO to facilitate local kids going to school, which is where the money raised from village visits goes. We went to have chai with a family who were warm, welcoming and curious about me, as I was about them. We looked around the village, which is more like small family groups spaced around the fields. There was a lovely old temple and some other fascinating ruins and lots of wild peacocks. I had a delicious lunch with the family, and we had great fun taking photos of each other. I was staying overnight, I saw where people usually stay, in large tents next to a wetland. There were toilet facilities there. Permits are needed for foreigners to stay there, but the people needed to write them couldn't be found so rather than stay there without a permit, we drove to another family in a different village, who had been asking Giri to have visitors come to stay. It was the first time a guest had spent the night with a family. It may be a challenge for some - no toilets, the light is on in the room all night (!! In case the children get up apparently), and I was woken at 6.00am to get up with the family routine. I didn't get a lot of sleep, but it really didn't matter. The children of the house were very surprised to see a foreigner in their bedroom (we all shared a room) as I had arrived after they had already gone to bed. In the morning we huddled around a fire outside to keep warm, and the mother of the house made lots of chai for all the visitors who came to meet me. Breakfast was millet chapattis with homemade buffalo yogurt with a mix of chilli and garlic in it, absolutely delicious and something I'll try to make at home. Afterwards I visited a couple of other homes, and looked at the site where they want to build a school, walking around with lots of villagers. It really was a special, unique time with lovely warm people, and a chance to cross the cultural barriers. If you have time, do stay overnight. I did some other village visits during my stay in Rajasthan, but these were short and lacked the element of a warm cultural exchange experience that my visit to Rusirani was. Give it a go, you wont be disappointed.",0.997,5
Rusirani_Village,EmmaGrew83,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A life changing day,"I can't put into words how incredible the day spent at Rusirani village was. The drive from Jaipur took just under 3 hours but half way there we changed from an AC taxi to an SUV. On route, we stopped at local baths and temple. The journey was bumpy towards the end as you climb through the hills but the views were incredible.Upon arrival at the village we were welcomed with traditional offerings and a lovely, refreshing drink. The villagers ask questions and are so welcoming. The children and adults were fascinated by my iPad and taking photos and videos of themselves. Whilst they don't speak English, you will be amazed at how much you can communicate with body language. Gidhari, the tour operator translates questions and answers as well as keeps you in the mix of the political discussions going on (we visited during election time!). We were well looked after, enjoying a delicious lunch and dinner and mineral water is provided (food is also prepared for guests using mineral water). Lack of toilet facilities are not a problem- there is plenty of space behind bushes to relieve yourself!!We were fortunate to visit the village temple, an extremely old temple and ruins. We also took a 30 minute drive the ought he village to a magnificent fort. The views on this cliff top, abandoned fort were breathtaking (as long as you have a head for heights!)Gidhari told us that he hopes to develop the opportunities for visitors to spend longer at Rusirani, volunteering their services, so this might be worth considering.This truly was a highlight of our travels in India. I view my materialistic life somewhat differently now and thank the people of Rusirani for reminding me what happiness is.",0.9975,5
Rusirani_Village,ibay8103,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 ‚Ä¢ Family,Hidden Gem,"Rusirani village is not well marked in the map but I think it is located at north east of Jaipur, Rajasthan where we (me and wife) stayed in.  It takes ~3 hour driving each way, but stops at few interesting places like old temple, local market, etc. which make trip feel a lot shorter than it actually takes.Rusirani village is not that far from near bigger villages as I thought but still there is no running water, electricity nor bathrooms.  Few families are grouped together to form sub-villages.  Village people are from infants to old men like any other societies, even though women are more easily seen.They share kitchen, cattle shed, and the court yard as a main gathering place.  Basically they work together, eat together, share happiness and sorrow together.  When you see them through their eyes, you would feel that they have never seen outside of world before.  They are very curious of you as you are to them.  As I find them very fascinated in their lives, they also have many questions to ask about us.  I can not forget their face expressions about curiosities.  I can even feel the pureness through their eyes.You may have to prepare to spend long hours on the road and just few hours in the village.  Activities are quite limited though, which include sightseeing on nearby ruins (awesome!), dancing with local if you wish and having a lunch.  Nothing much, however, you will have interactions with their people.  They do not speak English, nor we speak their language, but we spent hours of communicating with our bodies and souls.  We gave them something we had as a gift, in return I received the beautiful turban and thread bracelets, which signify friendship.  I respected the way they live and they did the same way to us.  This was a truly amazing experience.I also have to note that this is not just typical business oriented tour as you may find all over the India.  Girdhari, the tour operator, is actually from Rusirani village himself and also a member of NGO.  He is thriving to help and improve educations for the village, specially for the children.  If you would like to seek Disneyland like amusement, then forget this experiences.  If your heart is set on appreciating their cultures and helping to preserve their thousands old heritage, then you are right on.I appreciate Gerdhari for his dedication to the village in heart.",0.9977,5

Back in India again this year, I decided to stay in the village for a few days. This time I travelled there directly from Agra, rather than via the Pink City as I had seen enough forts etc. on my previous trip and was anxious to get back to village life.IBhagirath picked me up in the jeep and it was great to see him again. He is an excellent guide and goes out of his way to build a communication and rapport between the guests and the villagers. We had lunch with a family whilst Bhagirath explained various options and experiences open to me during my stay. I decided to make myself useful by painting a classroom in the only primary school in the village (great fun) and to spend time making door to door visits interacting with the villagers. I also learned to make and cook rotis over an open fire. The village is self governing and I found it  a really wonderful and educational experience to be able to converse (through Bhagirath) with such friendly and welcoming people whose lives are so different to mine. I highly recommend Rusirani to anyone who wants to see and be in the middle of real Indian village life, which I feel must be pretty much the same today as it was hundreds of years ago.   I loved the food and whilst the facilities are basic, I found them to be totally adequate. If you haven't guessed by now, I absolutely had the best time and highly recommend a visit!!",0.9917,5

The village community is almost entirely self sufficient, growing all their crops and looking after their livestock. It is beautifully situated deep in the Rajasthani countryside.

The village children were extremely friendly and playful and we ended up singing and dancing with them in the fields! We had such a great day and I would recommend this trip to anyone who wants a unique cultural experience while in Rajasthan.

They were so quiet and bereft of people, that I felt a bit scared because we were two women, with a child, wandering through the Tumbas. The buildings are so beautiful, that one forgets that these were the places where the royals of Jaipur were cremated. The tombs marking the death of children was quite poignant. One can hear the calls of peacocks from the surrounding hills and see the walls of the fort. It is well worth a visit, but I recommend going with a tour operator, rather than on your own. There is an entry fee, but you don't get any ticket- so you know who is pocketing the money! Also there is Shiv temple inside, and we were asked to visit by an old person, who was also shooing away donkeys that had strayed inside. We didn't and given the interest of this person and a younger one in us (probably for tips or donations), we chose not to go deeper into the Gaitor Tumbas either.But still, I regard it as an enriching visit.",0.9098,5

Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Brun066,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,"Evocative place of the ""soul"" of Jaipur and its territory, like other, much more visited, attractions.","This place, which in my opinion has an extraordinary charm, can be read as a site of concentration of funerary architectural practices also widespread outside Rajasthan, but which find here one of their highlights, thanks also to the pleasantness and relative loneliness of the place.The key to the complex is the architectural element, widespread in early modern Indian architecture, called ""chatri"" or ""chhatri"", basically a circular, square or polygonal canopy, supported by columns, which in turn are present in different numbers (starting from from a minimum of four) and shape. Here it is presented in particularly elaborate and sumptuous forms.The chatri are also present without reference to funeral memories: those who visit the Mughal monuments of Agra or Fatehpur Sikri will remember them standing at the corners of large buildings, which is intended to further ennoble by this decoration.How were the chatri interpreted in Rajasthan? Melia Belli Bose, a scholar of the University of Victoria (BC, Canada), in her book ""Royal Umbrellas of Stone: Memory, Politics, and Public Identity in Rajput Funerary Art"" (2015), states among other things that gradually ""Rajput rulers came into contact with the Indo-Islamic courts and understood the legitimizing messages their tombs conveyed"", so they adapted the pre-existing element of the ""chatri"" for the purpose.This practice, extended not only to the dead rajahs, but to all noble persons, causes Rajasthan to be dotted with funeral chatri. But I doubt that such a large set of equally ornate chatri exists elsewhere; and therefore there is another ensemble so scenic that it can be compared to this.These chatri are designated as ""cenotaphs"", that is, empty tombs, due to the fact that funeral practices provided for cremation, so there is no corpse to be stored. This would not in principle prevent the ashes of the deceased from being stored under or near the chatri; but I don't know if this happened in the case of the Royal Gaitor.Overall, this seems to me an evocative place of the personality of Jaipur and its territory, in the same way as other, much more visited, attractions.",0.5798,5

For each royal family member cremated here, there is a Chhatri or Cenotaph constructed as a commemoration, spread out in a garden. The complex is a little away from the main city, in a peaceful area, and it is neat, clean and well maintained, unlike some of the other monuments we have visited in Rajasthan.

Our driver studied the Google map location but still insisted on asking a couple of times from passerby to be sure. A series of small empty temples set amongst steep hills. They are slowly being renovated so have a nostalgic feel of bygone days. Up above is another temple to Ganesh. It took me well over half an hour to walk up the vertiginous flight of stairs and a good quarter of an hour to come back down. The reward was the great view of the Gaitor temples below and out across the town of Amer. The temple building at the top (it was closed when I was there) is quite unprepossessing. It could have been a small car park building from the stairs.,0.9734,5

It seemed like the site was also being well maintained since we saw one of the areas being worked on while we were there.We were asked by the guard if we wanted a tour, but with little convincing we managed to make it clear we didn't, and we weren't asked again for our entire visit. For the most part this site doesn't feel like a tourist destination as it does a site to explore.  While we were there we only ran into one other pair of tourists.

One party installed coloured lights at a pool and fountain area.....and another party took them away!Elsewhere I saw a striped squirrel chase a large rat away trying to join it at a feeding point and there was also a lovely elephant fountain. This was dry, part of the Indian government's attempts to combat covid, but it must be quite a sight when the water is flowing. Hopefully it will be restored soon.All in all, these were lovely gardens with a world class entry gate, the best I have ever seen. Don't miss a chance to see it yourself.",0.9975,5

There is a separate place for cremation of maharanis (Queens). This place is on foothills of Aravalli. Special structures have been erected in their honour. Although tombs are characteristic of mughal or islamic architecture but in case of Rajput rulers chhatris are made. Chhatris are somewhat open structure where a canopy is supported on several pillars. Canopy is not a 'tomb like' or circular dome in chhatris but has geometrically shaped or has ribbed circular structure.Here, at Gaitore, there are 2 clusters of Cenotaphs. The back cluster (Northern) or the one away from entrance has more intricately carved pillars and panels. The rulers of Jaipur were devotees of Lord Krushna so the inner walls of canopy depict various scenes from life of Krushna such as Kalia mardan (killing of giant serpent), holding of goverdhan parvat, maha-Ras. Apart from that mythological scenes such as churning of ocean (samudra manthan) have also been carved here. Some of the marble carvings of these cenotaphs match Delwara or Ranakpur carvings in their finesse. You need to pass through narrow roads and crowded city to reach this place. However, once you reach here you will find that this place does not attract much crowd and is calm and desolate. There is an entrance fee of Rs 20 for Indian citizens. Parking is free. I could see no toilets inside the monument. There are some shops near parking where you can get tea, cold drinks, biscuits etc but no restaurant is there. The starting point for uphill climb for Garh Ganesh Temple is near parking. On your way to Garh Ganesh you can get bird's eye view of cenotaphs which appear like a miniature model from above.",0.613,5

The first of these cenotaphs was that of Sawai Maharaja Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur and the latest is that of Sawai Raja Man Singh, the father of Maharaja Bhawani Singh, the last king of Jaipur. These cenotaphs present not just an important part of history, but also an excellent example of Rajput architect and craftsmanship.What really pinches a tourist is that there is absolutely no information about these cenotaphs.

The maharaja needed them to carry water from the Ganges River to drink during a trip to England in 1901 because, for religious reasons, he did not want to drink foreign water. As a history buff, I found these vessels to be extremely fascinating.Both steps and ramps access the pavilion, which only had a few visitors on a late afternoon in December.

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,drgizmo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Mix of cool and creepy,"We came late (almost 5 pm) on a Friday and monkeys were everywhere (I believe there may be a regular feeding event around 4 most days, which would explain that). Pretty neat to see so many all around, and they were not aggressive, probably because many had either just eaten or were still hanging around finishing their chapati and looking rather satisfied, so no need to harass the visitors. :) We were surprised by the guy who chased us down at the entrance to pay 50 rupees per camera (but that aligned with the signs we had missed at the entrance so we did not protest too much). Then made the mistake of following another young man into the first white temple on the right in the complex. After telling him we were not paying he said he was not a guide and of course would not stop talking to us while we tried to look around in peace. Before we knew it he was saying prayers to us and tying the sacred strings on our wrist and then finally the demand for 100 rupees per person as a donation. I knew that was coming and it's always awkward to get out of it. My husband folded up one 100 rupee note and offered it just to get out and then we were hounded about paying more, but refused and left feeling annoyed. (I've been working in India for 20 years so it's not like this situation is new to me...) We then were careful not to enter any more temples and just wandered through the complex heading up to the top gradually. There were lots of flies everywhere and discarded bits of food on the ground from the monkeys, so kind of a mess at various points but there are some really interesting viewpoints as well and you feel like you are off the main tourist trail. When we descended and left, the guy at the first temple and his friend came running out to accost us and complain that the 100 rupee note my husband had left for him was ""broken"" (it had a bit of a rip on it). I had no more patience at that time and told him we did not have any more so he could either keep that one or give it back to us and we'd be on our way. He kept it and we left.",-0.8191,1

The Galta Temple and Khole ke Hanuman Temple are two different locations, kilometers apart from each other. A Jaipurite keeps on visiting this temple as now a days alot of people organize 'Goths' occasion such as  birthday, superannuation, returning from a pilgrimage etc. You need not spend energy in organizing since everything is managed by the mandir or parties or family get-together at this place. Such parties were known as 'goths' when done for pleasure and spending leisure time during pleasant weather of monsoon. Goth may or may not have a religious purpose attached to it. Such parties are also known as 'prasadi' when done to some auspicious or religious or social management. You need to pay only. Charges are not as exorbitant as they are of other event managers or caterers. Added advantage is that religious people of Jaipur who are critical about how much one spent, how much one saved, how great was the show, how was the food etc, do not dare to comment regarding anything since it is no longer a party but a 'prasadi' i.e. thanks to lord or God who has blessed the family with auspicious day.  There are 24 such kitchens (rasoi) or 'dining halls'. All 24 may be busy on holidays. The place is surrounded by Aravalli hills. There is sufficient parking and the place is not far from city of Jaipur. In addition you get to have darshan of Hanuman ji. What more one could ask for?

It's well worth sitting near the bottom pool to watch the monkeys diving In and out of the water. I recommend you avoid going inside the temple as they want money for your visit and show no gratitude to donations, big or small! Not the friendliest and the temples themselves are not much to look at. Much better to view the monkeys hanging out of the windows etc. Be sure to walk through the centre and up the path that winds up a small hill. You will be rewarded with beautiful views of Jaipur and you will meet some quirky locals on your way up and down.

You will pay a small 'camera' fee at the entrance- i think it was about 50r each, and the guy actually wrote us a receipt, so it's probably not a scam. we did not enter any of the buildings at the bottom of the hill- at this point in our trip, we had learned that pretty much any time you are invited inside a building or engaged in conversation, you will be expected to pay or tip at the end, and we were pretty weary of it. however, we did climb the hill and explored all the open air areas, and the temple is pretty cool. there a few small pools and monkeys everywhere. we also saw about a million pigeons and a couple peacocks on the ride there.we went in the late afternoon, so it was fairly shaded and quiet, only a few other couples walking around with guides, and almost no touts or beggars.",0.9456,5

Galtaji_Temple,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,A mixed bag of memories,"GALTAJI is an ancient Hindu pilgrimage about six miles from Jaipur.It consists of several temples built into a narrow cleft in the ring of hills surrounding the city.The site is famous for its natural springs which collect in tanks. The holiest of these is Galta Kund which never goes dry.It is considered auspicious to bathe in the waters of Galtaji and thousands come to do so every year. Therein lies a problem.Firstly when you put people and their food together in a natural setting it attracts the local monkeys and they do things in the waters that you don't want to know about.For that matter, the impact on the purity of the waters from scores and scores of people using it to bathe every day is also something you probably don't want to dwell on.Add to that wandering cattle and their droppings, great heaps of rubbish lying about in the undergrowth, monkeys being fed plastic packets of milk with the stench later from that and you rightly get the impression that religious purity has become, to say the least, a little tarnished.I should stress at this point that those visiting this cleft of temples should expect to be tested physically since I estimated the steep climb to the Sun Temple at the top and back down at close to two miles over frequently uneven and stony ground. Take care.My way began up past one temple and up several sections of stone steps with a fence of razor wire on my left. Monkeys treated that barrier with contempt.The human bathing area -- one for men and one for women -- was packed at one tank with people stripping off and plunging in while another tank I passed had several dozen monkeys individually and collectively swimming in its waters.The path-passage took a sharp left and climbed past what seemed to be a popular monkey feeding point before the rough path climbed steeply up into the hills.When I arrived at the Sun Temple it offered majestic views over Jaipur and a chance to get my breath back. It was a hot day and I needed the bottled water I had brought with me. Make sure you bring some too.On the way down my guide pointed out a wonderful archaeological site of early 1700s astronomical instruments choked in trees and undergrowth near a huge pile of cow dung.Apparently a much larger similar astronomical observatory site, Jantar Mantar, down in Jaipur got all the restoration money despite the fact that this overgrown site near the Sun Temple is actually older and, therefore, historically more important.I am highlighting the situation in this and other related reviews in the hope Indian authorities spare a little money to restore this site too. It certainly deserves it because even neglect couldn't hide the lovely curved marble instruments, structures and scientific markings.Coming on down we passed a holy man sat cross-legged on the pavement watching the world go by. I wonder what he thought of the changes to this religious site?Back down towards the entrance we eased our way past the bathing bedlam, discarded drifts of monkey food and a few less savoury deposits to eventually drive away with very mixed memories.The site itself should have been lovely with its tanks of water, historic temples, gorge-like setting and wonderful views, but mankind's grubby fingerprints had been left all over it from piles of discarded rubbish and food to wear and tear on the monuments and pathway.It is still worth a visit but be prepared to see history clash with modernity.",0.7415,5

Galtaji_Temple,Sharon C,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Don't waste your time or money,"It took us 40 odd minutes to get here: somewhere we thought was a must see. Whilst the entrance fee is small, they charge you extra for even daring to use a camera and for using the toilets. I was approached by a man after using the toilets who told me they were not free. There were no signs anywhere alluding to this and when I asked how much, he said "" whatever I thought"". On payment, this went straight into his pocket. The site itself has the air of an open farm at the start. But the place has obviously been given over to the monkeys in every sense. They are everywhere. The place is filthy and litter strewn with razor wire along certain steps and there are begging bowls all over. Whilst we had experienced the litter of India, if this place is so special, then they have an odd way of showing it. The tanks had filthy, rancid water in them and I actually did not feel safe here.

It also seems that come the end of the day the Monkeys congregate at the way out: thank the Lord for a walking stick, when waved about the little blighters, took notice of us and stayed away!!! Yes, it is not much to get in, but they find all and every way to sting you for a bit more and it is a way out so needs a concerted effort to get here. It feels as if they think a few more Monkeys will add to the ambiance and people are flocking to see them, however, the monkeys are ruining the place, taking over and running amok.",-0.834,1
Galtaji_Temple,Kil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Attacked by monkey,"Galtaji is unlike anything you will ever experience. Before heading there you must be sure that you are ready, both physically and mentally. I had done enough reading beforehand to understand what to vaguely expect, but even then, I could not be fully prepared for what was in store.As myself and my trusted companions uber‚Äôd up, our driver informed us that tourists rarely frequented there and that getting a taxi back would be difficult as it is so isolated. Our options were to pay the man extra to wait, or risk being extorted by the rickshaw drivers that operate there. We chose the former for a guaranteed escape route.On arrival we had to pay 200 rupees each for entry, with further charges to be able to use cameras. You could risk not paying the charge and sneaking a few pics, but I don‚Äôt think the local mafiosos who run the place would be pleased if they caught you. A man who called himself the ‚Äòmonkey master‚Äô then offered his services as a guide for the price of 150 rupees per person. While somewhat extortionate, this is a key decision - take the guide to guarantee your safe passage. Refuse him at your peril.Following the monkey master inside the enclosure, we tried to take in the beauty of the temple and surrounding buildings. This was difficult due to the general sense of unease that had crept in among us, heightened by the lack of visible tourists/general people at the temple, as well as the incessant chanting coming out of the speakers that was almost straight out of a horror film. We felt heavily out of place. On the plus side there were many monkeys, and the place was quite pretty and picturesque, although poorly maintained in parts.We had heard rumours of a monkey king who offered blessings in exchange for generous donations. To avoid being extorted any further and getting tangled up in any more local mafioso schemes we steered clear however.As we made our way to the top of the temple, we received a warning by the guard that one of the monkeys had gone rogue and was biting people. Simultaneously, we spotted a large, bounding monkey with black skin and white fur at the peak of the mountain that stood out from the rest. He was thrashing about uncontrollably, and by the sound of his war cries was clearly the alpha/king kong that the guard was referring to. People were fleeing from the top of the mountain in terror, and within seconds king kong flew from nearly 100m away to about 15m from us. My unsuspecting companion, who was unaware of the situation, stood within dangerous distance. While his life flashed before his eyes, he called out in desperation, tears streaming down his face. Suddenly, a fearless hero armed with a brush began swatting at king kong - it was the monkey master! King kong fled overhead in response, and while we didn‚Äôt see him again, the possibility of his remaining presence kept us on edge. Near death crisis averted - the monkey master had earned his keep.It was fairly peaceful from this point onwards. We fed the monkeys with the help of the monkey master, took some pics and admired the beauty of the temple. There was one last test to come however, as the monkey master informed us that as it was approaching a certain time only recognised people of the holy class could remain in the temple, so we had to flee before that became an issue. We escaped, adrenaline pumping, paid the man and were on our way. Not the experience I‚Äôd expected from this ancient holy temple, but the one I needed.",0.5756,5

I don't mind paying entry fees but it is clear from the up-keep that the entry fee does not go back into the maintenance of the temple. There was a 'holy man' that beckoned us over to perform a blessing and then asked where we were from so he knew where to pitch his price at the end of it. Please note there was no mention of a fee for the blessing beforehand and he was very insistant that we had one! Unhappy with the fee we gave he requested more, similar to another 'holy man' in this temple that sat with a tin requesting donations.

But as some of the reviews pointed there is a rather weird payment system. They charge you for a camera but yet they do not charge you for the phone. Many of the latest models of phones have much better camera than mine. Anyways, the guys taking payments don't look anything like authorities. Totally contrary they just casually sit and ask you for money. On the ""receipt"" that they give you they handwrite the price so there are no ""rules"" for how much you pay. We were there with friendly local and he did warn us about those practices. So there are weird mafia-like practices going on and everyone knows about it. Local not paying it is quite normal in India the prices for locals are usually around 10% of foreign prices or non. Which is fair taking into account economy of the country. On the second thought I just remember that on my way back there were 3 young guys that were rather aggressive towards me and tried really hard to get their hands on my camera.

Galtaji_Temple,jdulisse,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Mixed Emotions,"Prior to our visit to Jaipur, I decided I wanted to visit Galtaji simply based on some of the photos I had seen. I didn't do any research on the site which I regretted after being there - I think my experience would have been more enjoyable with some previously acquired knowledge. The reviews here on TripAdvisor are very mixed and I happen to agree with most of them. The temple complex itself was very unique, with a different look and vibe from anything else we saw in Rajasthan. It was relatively deserted when we went but after a week's worth of crowded tourist attractions, the general lack of people made us feel more like we didn't belong there instead of being a welcomed change of pace. We were charged entrance fees as well as the camera fee - our first mistake. We explored the first temple at the base of the hill (the one on the right as you're walking up). There, we were greeted by a priest who led us to a chained door that looked as ancient as he did. He unlocked the door and tried to usher us into a tiny chamber. This sent red flags up to my distrustful brain but after some coaxing from my boyfriend and the priest, I decided to go inside. The priest chanted what I assume was a blessing while he gently hit my boyfriend and I over the head with some peacock feathers and tied a string to both of our wrists. Then, of course, he demanded a donation. Our cash was already running low for the day and he was obviously displeased that we only gave him 100 rupees. We made our way out of the temple and continued on to the first water tank. We wanted to continue on to the other tanks and see the view from the top but we noticed a small collection of priests standing by the pathway up and just didn't have the money or the wherewithal to provide yet another tip we assumed would be asked of us. Looking back, I regret not seeing the entirety of the complex but at the time was frustrated at how easily my money was consistently being parted from me.As to the monkeys, they are plentiful but ignored us since we ignored them. If you're so inclined, it didn't seem difficult to engage them with the help of some food or a local's assistance.",0.7685,5

Galtaji_Temple,sue j,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Horrible experience,"I researched this place before we went and was mentally prepared for the monkeys, and the scams or so I thought. Our driver took us up there and dropped us at the bottom gate.  We were already aware that there was no fee to go up to the temple, but that there was a 50 rupee camera charge. There is a sign to this effect at the bottom and I took a picture just as  a marker in order to identify  my photos at a later date. As we passed through the gate there was no place to pay the camera charge so I assumed it would be at the temple. A young couple, tourists, came over and asked us if we had paid anything and seemed a bit perplexed about the procedure so we decided to walk up with them. As we began walking up a man came over....he was very aggressive and accused us of not paying the entry fee. We protested that there wasn't one but he became quite heated, demanding 150 each, then adding that he wanted a further 200 each for the camera fee. We were sure he was not legit and refused payment to him for either. He then tried to send us out of the compound and insisted that we took our cameras back and left them in the car. We refused but the young couple were quite distressed by its agression and began walking back, but then had second thoughts decided to join us again. The aggressive man shouted a lot and we said we were perfectly happy to pay for the camera, but only to the right person. And that we would be asking for a receipt. At this point he bobbed into a temple and came out with a bit of paper, which was not a receipt book, all the time shouting at my husband who was refusing to give him these fees. At this point I took out my iPad and showed him the picture of the 50 rupees fees I had taken and told him I was now filming him and would take the video to the police....strangely he suddenly disappeared.By now so much time was wasted that the young couple said they no longer had the time to go up to the top as they were on a coach trip, so they returned. We carried on to the top. The place is filthy with rubbish and a valley walk that could so easily be beautiful is squalid. We felt like almost everyone was there to try to part us from cash, from the beggars, the overly dressed women and old men wanting to pose  for shots, but most of all from the temple people on the way up. The temple at the top has nothing to commend it other than a good view of .Jaipur. The monkeys by the way, were actually pretty well behaved and we saw them swimming in the filthy water that is supposed to be the ladies bathing pool. There was one highlight though, and that was a group of wild peacocks who were wandering about and who flew aver out heads and across the valley.",0.9527,5

The place has a great architecture with excellent reflections in the pond l, which is very dirty and really needs to be cleaned.. something not good about the Hindu worship is the mess it creates around the place. That said the temple can be approached from two sides, one the bazaar and second the transport Nagar side. I would recommend you take the transport Nagar route (especially if you on a two wheeler) because the road is good and not steep unlike the other way which is steep and not a good road.Needless to say that the place is fested with monkeys as it's also known as the monkey temple.

Jaipur_Wax_Museum,Venkataraman U,,,,"The ticket price is pretty steep at Rs 500 per person, and it is for both Wax Museum and the adjoining Sheesh Mahal.Wax museum is divided into two parts: first part containing wax statues of Indian and International celebrities and the second containing statues of distinguished personalities in Rajasthan's history. In total, there are about 30 wax statues.The statues are pretty good and done well. However, I don't really understand the fuss about it. True, for kids, it is exciting and knowledgeable but for adults, come on, they are just statues.Now, a word about the racket going on there. You can get your photos clicked, but not from your own camera. With your express permission, the museum people tag a photographer along with you and he keeps clicking your snaps with all the statues. At the end, there is a camera room where you can select which photos you want and they will transfer the soft copy to your phone. Each soft copy costs your Rs 25, with a minimum of 8 copies. Bloody scammers won't miss an opportunity to loot the tourists. It was seriously off-putting.Now, a word about the Sheesh Mahal. It's a total wastage of time. All you have is a single hall with mirrors, big and large, all around. They tell you the place consists of 3 million mirrors, with the floor also made up of mirrors. A lousy presentation, a completely disinterested host, and stupid mirrors all around without really anything magical make it such a damp squib. The place was recently made, and there is no history associated with it even though it is located right there within the Nahargarh fort premises. But the cunning people have clubbed the tickets with Wax Museum, so you don't have an option to opt out of visiting this lousy Sheesh Mahal. Instead, go see the original Sheesh Mahal in Amer Fort....you'll be blown over.All in all, nothing terribly exciting and can be avoided. The kids, however, will most likely enjoy it.",-0.4987,2

Around 15 Indian wax statues and 9 international artists including Michael Jackson as well as the Spider Man are on display with imagined setting. The organisers are providing disposable foot covers to ensure neatness of the place. On payment,  the tourists can collect specific number of pics (soft copy) by the photographers arranged by the organisers. The actual artist who has done the wax statues deserve explicit attribution. The adjacent Sheesh Mahal, made of several lakhs of pieces of glass, is another attraction. The glass pieces are well collaged from floor to ceiling to make an excellent mirror palace.

As with many city parks, one would expect locals of plenty and the usual format. However, as with most of India, there was a fantastic air and ""vibe"" here. A feeling of both Hippy-Like and regular activity was in flow. It was dark by this time so i could not take in all the activity but the relaxing and spiritual aspect was very much happening for me. Locals couples walked holding hands while others sat or lay on their own attaining peace or reflection.There was life, energy and sound all about but of a kind that one can easily elope into - a mild relaxing atmosphere. It is a great place to go to find a contrast to the general fast moving activity of the city streets and the usual activities. I met some locals here and chatted a while as well as finding a spot to myself simply to wind down in. A good place to take the heat off during the evening.  Well worth a stroll through here if you want to find a laid back spot to chill out in. I did not visit early morning, but will do so next visit.",0.9927,5

It opened in January 2016 and has quickly proven itself one of Jaipur's most remarkable destinations. Located in the official jewelry manufacturing district, it's very strictly open by-appointment-only and should be on the top of every visitor's must-do list. Designed by the renowned French furniture designer Paul Mathieu, the Gyan Gallery houses the private art collection of the Gem Plaza family. Assembled by the current owner's father, the collection features a jaw dropping array of art, textiles, jewelry, coins, furniture and myriad objet d'art on a scale that boggles the mind in its beauty, and quality. The interiors are a vision of cool white and gray spaces, minimal and spare, permitting the objects on offer to shine. Indian museums should take note of the respect given the priceless items on display, especially the manner in which the miniature paintings are displayed.

Gyan_Museum,Carolina Palerm... S,,,,"Visiting Gyan Gallery is the most unexpected experience. The location, though not hard to get to makes visiting this gallery a ""destination"" attraction. But once there - one is transformed into a world of luxury where every single millimetre and artefact is carefully thought about and curated. The selection of artefacts exhibited spans a wide period of time and product and is part of a vast privately collected lifelong collection of indian objects. The display cabinets highlight the beauty of the products and the space itself is magical, luxurious and tranquil. Though the displays are themed - there is no single overriding theme which is perfect for anyone wanting to get a glimpse of the diverse Indian art history.This small gem of a gallery is of world class and a true ""must see"" while in Jaipur. Visiting the gallery is in a single word - mermerising.",0.9609,5

The setting is in a dark space that adds to the pleasure that the collection brings to the soul being uplifting and inspiring, the museum deserves contemplation and quiet to truly experience the treasures. The architecture of the museum is magical and in the mood of a dark and surprising Aladin's treasure cave.  The entrance to the inner sanctum is a by way of a majestic white hall watched over by a 2 meter tall carved malachite Ganesh. A spiraling white, smooth surfaced stair case leads to the main room of the collection.  The door opens to  pools of light on selected pieces of artistic treasures in textiles, precious metals, gem stones and finely painted miniatures  that span centuries of Indian history. This intimate architectural space best displays an important collection of jewelry, swords, ceremonial textiles, board games, spectacles and gem carved sculptures.  Not to be missed.

They genuinely love and care for elephants and we had the opportunity to learn about them and feed them. We also took an elephant for a small walk with his guardian of course.

We were also assured that cradles and sears were not used but once we were in and had paid our money they most definitely were being used. I felt betrayed and I felt I had let these poor animals down. They deserve to be treated with more respect and not like an amateur circus apparatus. Disappointed just doesn‚Äôt cover it. I believed the line they sold us to get us in the door but the reality was very different. Please don‚Äôt encourage the exploitation of these wonderful creatures.",0.8788,5
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,June Jenkins,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Something's not right here,"I came away from this place feeling very uncomfortable about the whole situation.  I asked several times if the elephants were ridden & was assured they definitely weren't, but later after reading their business card it clearly states that riding is an activity.The ""volunteer"" clearly  said that the elephants were allowed to roam free on acres of surrounding bushland, but when I went for a walk with Lakshmi along some laneways  surrounding the area  the bushland was cropped with only a small strip of bushland visible at the back of the reception area.  There was also an area out the back where some guys were sitting close to 3 or 4 other elephants, one with a cradle attached for riding.  One attendant gave an elephant several sharp slaps on it's head. I watched them for several seconds recieving glares from the group of guys, then I asked the ""volunteer"" from My Elephant Trip if those elephants were part of the 11 others located somewhere on the property.  He was very uncomfortable & quickly moved me on after telling me they were a seperate group not connected with them.This appears to be one very well oiled operation.  The pressured smooth talk is consistent with all other comments that believe this is a scam.  They appear to be well fed, but one has to ask exactly what's going on there .   I feel ashamed of myself for being part of this & I can only hope that the 8500 rupees I paid will go to the elephant's food & care.  There's some pretty smooth tactics in play here to part you with your money.",0.9628,5

So, you would ride him/her on a blanket, the way the villagers have been doing it for ages.

My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Kate M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples, This may be a con?,"Really bad experience. That is not a sanctuary! My bad I have not checked before going there! Anyway, when I arrived I was asked to sit at a table. There were other tourists at other tables and someone from the staff talking to them. I immediately knew it‚Äôs a scam because the tables were far away so you could not hear what the are saying to others. Than some guy came to me and started the lies: it is a sanctuary, you give donations, talking very spiritual, the painting is natural and helps the elefant to heal if he gets scratches in the wood (what!?), showing me pictures of the sanctuary from I can‚Äôt remember where with his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù which were foregners telling me they did voluntary work for him (to gain my trust), bla bla bla bla. Why paint an elefant on the head if he has scratches somewhere else? I lost my patience quickly and asked the prices. He thought he got me and immediately prepared an offer in writing: 8500 for riding, taking elefant for walk, paint him, wash him, interaction, feeding. I told him straight that no way I‚Äôm paying that amount and no way I‚Äôm riding elefants or paint them! He than started to reduce coming down to 2800. I again told him that there is no way he sees that money from me. I told him directly that I will pay 1000 to simply feed and pet the elefant or I will walk out. Of course he agreed. I fed the elefant, gave him a hug and a kiss and left in max 5 minutes. I could see the unhappiness in his eyes and quickly got frustrated that I cannot do more for the poor animal. These are simply the elefants too old or sick to climb to Amer as they did. So they exploit them here. Just avoid the place, don‚Äôt be that fool that believes their stories.",-0.9773,1
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,stumpymac,,,,"This place is not a sanctuary, but a money making scheme using 2 elephants. Proper sanctuaries should LIMIT human contact, and observations should be from afar (research it yourself on the Internet). They are asking for extortionate amounts of money (especially for Indian prices) using these 2 elephants. If there were 11 roaming free (as they claim) don't you think they'd all be where they get fed? We were told the colours used for you to paint on these majestic creatures was 'medicinal'... Really?! These poor 2 creatures are being 'used' all day to make money, it doesn't feel quite right because it isn't! (they say they are fitted with GPS on the elephants, but none seen) , and they couldn't quite answer how they stop ""all"" the elephants wandering off/away (GPS was their answer, but that does not stop them doing things and the mahout isn't with each elephant 24/7 if they are free to roam) They would not even tell us the name of the place when we asked, until we were leaving (not surprising judging by some of the reviewers who have figured their con out) . Do not take part in this money making scam USING these poor beautiful animals, they are not a voluntary  organisation but a money making scheme, do you research first and donate to a proper cause eg WWF. ",-0.4577,2
,,,,,"Like many others in reviews, taken here by tuk tuk driver and then the hard sell begins, with the story of it being an elephant sanctuary for rescued elephants. They wanted 7,500 rupees for a full 'donation' package or 5,000 rupees for a smaller package, per person. Very pushy! I wasnt prepared to pay that and agreed on 2,000 for both of us to feed and spend time with the elephants. Only saw 2, although he claimed they had 11, the rest of which were out in the forest with their mahuts. I smelled a bit of a rat but was happy to spend some time with the elephant, which seemed well cared for and happy. I think though that all of this is a moneymaking con and that they may be exploiting the animals to make money as a tourist scam. If im right and i think i am, looking at other reviews and pics on the net of this place, all show the same 2 elephants, no others. If they are exploiting these animals, the indian government need to crack down and intervene. If this is exploitation? Then they are scamming scum! And you should not fall for their lies. The tuk tuk drivers are  in cahoots with them. There seems to be a lot of this tourist scamming in Jaipur!",-0.3998,2

My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Dr. Livingston,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Memorable encounter with a gentle giant,"We had read about the importance of not riding on elephants because of the harm it causes them and the abuse they experience in ""training"" them to give rides.  We were impressed with the introductory conversation we had with the owner of the sanctuary and how he viewed it as a way to educate people about the plight of elephants in Rajasthan.  He appeared to care deeply about their physical and emotional welfare.  We were then told what it would cost to do certain activities and chose to be introduced to and feed an elephant.  It was a memorable moment to touch and hug this animal I so admire and feel for.  We were told how to approach her and feed her and what kind of touch felt good to her.  It was magical for me!  The two elephants there were not tied up in any way and seemed comfortable with the volunteers who helped us touch and feed the one.  We viewed the fee we paid as a way to help feed these elephants and help spread the word that they should be treated with respect and kindness and that the people who work here are try to change the lot of the elephants in Rajasthan that are still subjected to a life they do not deserve.Thank you, elephant village, for caring about these magnificent animals and being their advocates.",0.9872,5

A visit to the temple just cannot be avoided specially if you plan to visit Amer Fort (and why would n't you go there if you are on leisure in Jaipur). Goddess - a form of 'Kali' is one of the nine incarnations of the supreme Mother.  My Guide ""Bunty"" told us that this temple still belongs to the Royal family of Jaipur - not sure whether that is true but temple inspires a myriad of feelings. He also shared that this is a temple where a goat is still sacrificed around 4:00 AM every morning after which goat meat is distributed amongst priests and some portion is sent out to the royal family. Again, I cannot vouch for the same; could just be myth. At the entrance, I confess, I noticed some foreign tourists, in a bit ""not sure whether to go in"" mood but believe me whether you are a local citizen or other wise, step-in to a wonderful view of the goddess who is claimed to have trampled upon the Lord Shiva in fury & rage. As soon as you sttep in, a lot of history and character of the place almost seizes you. Remember, photography may not be allowed. Preferably try to have your head, legs and arms covered. Goddess' statue is divine; temple complex has statues of other Hindu gods as well including Ganesha. It almost feels like a dip in Ganges in Haridwar or Varanasi; believe me or try out yourself.

The cannon has a barrel of 20.2 ft and weighs 50 tonne.  The cannon tears on a  a two-wheeled vehicle and the wheels are about 5ft in diameter. Apart from this, the vehicle also has two removable additional wheels for transport, their diameter is about 9 feet.The cannon has the capacity of being fed with 100 kg of gunpowder with 50 kg shell making it able to fire package load of 150kgs.The cannon was fired only once, with 100 kilograms of gunpowder, and when fired was claimed to have covered a distance of about 35 kilometres. It is said that the projectile fired from it made a small lake in Chaksu.As per the stories doing the rounds and being believed, the impact was so powerful that it actually lived to its words as Weapon of  Mass destruction. The loud noise created by the blow made people deaf and pregnant women suffered miscarriages. Seeing this destruction of large scale it was never used again.  But being a lethal weapon with immense power it was kept in the fort as a backbone. And the Royal family still gets it maintained every year and prays before it once a year by performing the Swastik Pooja. Must visit place as you explore Jaipur.

A whole new universe can be explored by simply sitting inside a round dome inside the planetarium, where projectors with audio visuals give you a deep insight into each and every functioning of the planets and the solar system. Anyone can visit the planetarium between 1200 hours to 1900 hours and experience the world of stars.There is an astronomical observatory which has the provision for Celestron C-14 telescope, including its accessories like the ST6 CCD camera, solar filters etc. An automation system was established after two years of rigorous work in the year 1993 in order to carry out special effects for the planetarium shows.

In the same complex there is a planetarium, exhibition halls, a science museum and a research center (apart from the auditorium). The halls/lawns/auditorium may be hired for scientific/academic/cultural events/exhibitions. I have observed that many reviewers have given their comments on planetarium and museum here though the property for reviews are expected is ""auditorium"". This is surely one of the best auditoriums of Jaipur. There was a time when govt. owned Ravindra Rang Manch/Ravindra Manch (named after Ravindra Nath Tagore and located in Ram Niwas Bag) was the only auditorium available in the city. Construction of this auditorium widened the choice for organizers. This was much clean and far more equipped then Ravindra Manch so became popular in a short time despite its high rates as compared to the other. It became a status symbol to hold event here. Good sound system, better chairs, enough leg space, clean carpets, soothing lights and ample space around auditorium are the reasons for its popularity. The entrance gate of Auditorium and museum complex itself is an attraction as it is huge and resembles Ganesh Pol of Amber Fort. Many tourists/visitors fondly get themselves photographed on stairs leading to this gate. The Science museum is not good, not at all close to the lesser known Science Museum of Shastri Nagar, Jaipur. It was perhaps built to justify the initial terms and conditions on which Birlas (the famous corporate house of India) got this land. The planetarium, was most modern one of its time as Mr. A.G. Kulkarni who was first Director of the Planetarium has told me.

There is not a great variety of plants. Mostly Cycas, Lantana, Thuja, Wild Date, Plumeria, a variety of Tabernemontana with small leaves (T. orientalis?) have been planted but the plants and lawn was in very good condition when we visited here. I believe the species of Cycas here is Cycas revoluta (King sago). I observed only female reproductive structures and seeds in many plants but male cone in none! Both species of Frangipani i.e. Plumeria rubra and P. obtusa can be seen here. There were fountains and light but were not operating when we visited here. The places is also rented for holding banquets. There are toilets available here but no facility of snacks or food available inside. There is a shop near entrance gate that sells basic eatables like biscuits. There is entry ticket of Rs 50 for Indians and 200 for foreigners which is slightly higher side. Thankfully there is no charge for camera. It is on way to Galta temple so you can visit this place by sparing 15 minutes. It is on route of Agra too but to touch this place while going to Agra you need to avoid the new long tunnel that has been built recently and take the old route of 'Ghat ki Guni' which in itself is a road worth seeing.",0.2318,4

EleJaipur,Oliver T,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Dangerous experience!!!,"Avoid at all cost!! This is not safe at all, I will explain what happened during my visit:First of all, we go there with our driver, and we sit down with the guy who explain everything from his cellphone, he explain the packages and to be honest, even for Europeans is very expensive (over ‚Ç¨60 for 1h) I told him I only wanted to ride the elephant, he said for half an hour it would cost me 2500 rupies (20-30‚Ç¨) I accepted that offer, and I sat on the elephants neck. First 10 minutes were amazing, first time being elephant it was an incredible moment, then the elephant started getting angry by breathing hard and harder, and later he started making sounds with his trump louder and louder and i said to the guy to calm him down (he did not speak English) he kept telling me it‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs ok, no problem, but then he started beating the elephant with his stick, and then it got a lot worse, the elephant was starting moving around, trying to get out of the situation, he got really upset and was making huge sounds with his trumpet. Scariest moment of my life, luckily for me, the elephant got close to an edge at the same level of my feet, and I jumped out of the animal to be safe. This animals are wild animals, it was 40 degrees to ride them, and if you look at YouTube videos of people killed by elephants you will see how dangerous it is, it literally can kill you.",-0.9806,1

Elephant_Activity_Planner,Paula H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Dream come true,"So didnt actually plan this as we were at the amber fort and our tuk tuk driver just said i want to show you something nice (i think part of the tuk tuk school training as well as the visit to my uncle/cousins textile factory) but..... so glad we did. We didnt even know where we were going, its not far from the fort and into what looked like a local village. We stopped at large gates and entered into a walled grass area. We were invited to sit down and offered tea. The grass had chickens running around and very friendly labrodour pups (5 months) . So by the size of the pool and yard we asumed we were here for the elephants. The main man started talking to us and then the elephant arrived. It was all very casual but nice after the hassle of hawkers all day. He said we could take photos and sent someone to buy bananas. We fed the elephant then they asked if we would like to sit on one. We said yes. The guide then took us a walk around the village which by now was after 7pm. I cant describe this experience in words. It took my breath away. The elephant (8 in the village) were so happy looking and looked really well cared for. I think we arrived quite late and perhaps took them by surprise but if this is how they normally do it then i would not complain. It was peaceful, beautiful and dare i say an almost spiritual experience we felt connected with the elephant and not commercial in anyway. I did see paints and things and knew you could help bathe the elephant but as i said we arrived unplanned. We paid equivalent of ¬£36 for an hour and a half of absolute beauty and worth every penny.

The destructive pollution of the 1990s combined with intensive farming demands significantly reduced the extent of aquatic wildlife and migratory birds found more suitable locations but things are being reversed. Today grey heron, wagtails and blue-tailed bee-eaters are all making a comeback while fish stocks are even increasing.Most visitors stop along the Amer-Jaipur road as this provides the best views over the Jal Mahal Palace.Lake Mansagar lies in a natural depression that would, without human interference, be annually filled by the monsoon rains. The natural shallow lake was enhanced by a dam stretching between the two hill ranges of Amer and Amagarh. This initial dam was constructed in the 16th century after a deadly famine in 1596 was caused by a failure of the monsoon rains.Maharaja Mansingh-I constructed the primitive dam in 1610 from soil and rock over the Darbhavati River so as to increase the levels of stored water and prevent another famine. The height of the dam was increased and strengthened in the 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh-II who also constructed the water Palace.

However, things were not all that since beginning. There was a time when this place was a happening place of Jaipur. The garden was really green with a lot of old trees. People used to spend evenings here in summer season and days during winters. The Union ground adjacent to garden was always packed with players. There was a cluster of fast food shops among which Kiran Cafe and Kiran Kulfi (local ice cream) shops were most popular. Middle class families used to call prospective brides and grooms to meet each other at this place. The place was also last resort to students and applicants who needed a passport size photograph in hurry as there were 4-5 box camera owners who would give a photograph in matter of hours. This was the fastest service in those days (prior to invention of digital cameras and printers). Then there was Ravindra manch (theatre) which was the only theatre for cultural programs and peopple had to plan their evens according to availability of this place. Later an open air thetre was also built. An art gallery in the basement was second home for local artists. The venue for all the circus and fairs in olden times was a ground on backside of Albert Hall. Things have changed a great deal. Now the place is visited only for Albert Hall Museum, Zoo and a parking. You must be a mad person to include this on your itinerary even if you dont intend visit to Zoo or Albert Hall.

For Trip 1 they asked me to call back 2 days back. After multiple calls/whatsapp the driver contacted me the previous day evening. For Trip 2, the driver called me 1 hour before and I was relying on this service to drop me at Delhi airport to catch a plane!- Cars that were assigned were bad. The cat assigned to the first trip was bad. The one assigned for the second trip was terrible. It has more than 250000 kms broken rearview mirrors and severely dented back. It was stinking of cigarette smoke. - Drivers weren't very professional. Issues included  sending whatsapp messages while driving, giving excuses to take the car inside busy parts (driver asked us to go by auto), etc. Summary: If you want something on the cheaper side Rajputana cabs is an option, but you may find other aggregators.

One the day of arrival they sent me a Toyota Etios (me and my mother were travelling). Our driver Roop Singh was very courteous. He showed us all the places and also guided us throughout the 4 days . He also advised us where to take guide and where not too as at some places tour guides were not required.

When we reached jaisalmer we were welcomed with 2 Dezires mentioning that their innova met with an accident , once we reached jaislamer town we were forced into one car , i was assured that from the next day innova will be ready. Come the second day there came a ETIOS that too late by more than an hour the driver had some excuses when i asked about innova a new story was given to me and i spoke with their representative via phone who was telling some other reason .The driver all through the journey mentioned that they will not be able to provide innova for the local tours and will provide one during our return to jopdhpur.The driver was mostly on phone and was mostly interested in commissions he gets and was asking for bills from where we shopped...etc...Come the third day a Dezire came that too late by 90 mins gave some lame reasons.Yes more thing i had to pay tolls and parking charges but these guys told that they rates are inclusive.Come the fourth day ETIOS came that too a bad vehicle and once again late by 120 mins.This impacted our program in jodhpur as we reached jodhpur late .Finally when it came to settlement he was asking 2k on top of what was asked for innova, i had to fight with the person and settled for a lesser amount.I was messaging and speaking to him multiple times all through the 4 days and everytime he was only telling lies.Very bad service , pathetic cars , unprofessional service and over priced.Better avoid this cab service as they seem to tell only lies and extremely unprofessional.",-0.9861,1
