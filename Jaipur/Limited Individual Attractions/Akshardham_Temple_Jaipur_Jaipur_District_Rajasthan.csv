Akshardham_Temple,Linda A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Delhi's best attraction,"The temple is beautiful, one of the best attractions of Delhi. Please do not visit on a weekend night, its too crowded and the queues for the cloak room and security are too long. Mobiles and cameras are not allowed so if you can do without your mobile leave it at home to avoid the cliak room queue. The fountain light and sound show is popular hence evenings are busier. The metro has a stop walking distance to the temple. Worth a visit."

Akshardham_Temple,Prathamesh Sawant,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Modern yet peaceful!!,The architecture is simply stunning. The popularity of this place is more due to its architecture than being a temple. Its a beautiful building and as soon as you are inside the gates you feel a sense of peace and calm.
Akshardham_Temple,bournemouthbabe87,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,One of the top 4 buildings in the world !,"Yes, it is modern. If you are looking for a 16th century temple, this is NOT it. But what it IS is truly incredible. How they built something on this scale with the beautiful carvings they did, defies belief. The cost of building this today in the West, would be tens of billions of US$ - it could NEVER happen. I had been to the Taj Mahal the week before, and I thought this was even better - not as pretty, but far more incredible. This was the highlight of my 6 week India tour. Entry to the temple itself is free. The sound and light show, (at barely over 1US$), was well worthwhile too, but get your ticket as soon as you get into the temple as it sells out."

Akshardham_Temple,gutteridge,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,OK if you like crowds,"Went here for the sound and light show. Literally hundreds of people queueing, the control was with ropes to hold back the crowd and lots of shouting. We missed the 7pm show and the 8opm was in Hindi, so we enjoyed the video which was impressive, but understood little of what was going on. I hated the experience, my husband thought it was great! Make your own mind up!"

Akshardham_Temple,P P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Hey! Let's create a Indian Temple Theme Park!,"Go on a Weekday - this theme park monument is closed on Mondays. Whatever you do, do not go on a Sunday.Akshardham is where ""tour groups"" go to see something textbook ""Indian"". In that way the Akshardham does for Indian Temples what Remix/Mashups do for Old Songs... It's like the phrase you say when someone asks you ""Say something in Indian"" (yes - that happens here in the USA and yes I have instantly judged them - lol!)Imagine if Disney decided to create mini versions of the Great Pyramids... You could eat, buy your souvenirs and never have to go to the real thing... That's what these guys have done with the is modernized reboot of ancient India. It's nice but there's not journey involved just a metro token!This is not ORIGINAL art. It is a cornucopia of Indian architecture  in a theme park-ish setting with light shows, exhibition and food court! So while it is a way to kill boredom in Delhi (why would anyone be bored in Delhi is beyond me) - and even better way for tour groups to get an instant WOW from the tourist... is is not as ""rich"" at the original.The originals were create in the 16th century in all white marble - they are best examples are found in the Jain temple of Rankhpur (1.5 hrs outside of Udaipur). Go there and be amazed...Anyone can recreate the Great Pyramids or Taj Mahal  and theme park the hell out of it - but they can never replicate the energies that are still there to this day..."
Akshardham_Temple,Sandy_JSR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Attractive Architecture & Crowded,"Visited on a Sunday evening travelling good distance from our hotel at Amer Road with high expectation, but that didn’t fulfil. The temple is comparatively small and situated in a small ground surrounded by residential / commercial buildings. The architecture of temple is attractive and under illumination the temple looks delightful. When we visited, the place was crowded; hawkers were selling pop-corn, ice cream, etc. inside the campus, it was more a fair like atmosphere. To me, it is good to see but not must see in Jaipur for tourists."

Akshardham_Temple,ddevarshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,Far more human friendly than Birla temple,"At this temple you will not feel that you are unwanted. There are temples for wich land was procured from Government on throw away prices in name of creating facilities for public but later on tourists were treated as unwanted intruders. At Birla temple, Jaipur one gets mistreated right from parking lots, At Birla Temple, Jaipur one is not allowed to walk on lawns, one is not allowed to sit in garden, etc. The shoe locker facility is available on payment at Birla temple whereas at Akshardham it is free.  Here at Akshardham one can sit or stand almost at any place of your liking- in temple, open area near temple, garden etc. There is no restriction on photography. Here you dont feel that you have come to house of a dictator where you are unwanted. I will stop going to this place when they the management imposes restriction and no longer maintains it as house of God. There are ice cream and juice stalls just facing temple and no one creates any fuss if anyone enjoys a cup of icecream while appreciating beauty of temple."

Akshardham_Temple,Yun L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,Truly worth,This is the best place I have visited in India. It has lots of stone carvings and carved buildings depicting ancient deities etc. Their prices are NOT inflated and they sell the same product to locals as they sell to tourists. I have found most tourist places have a much inflated official price for foreign visitors. You should spend at least 5 hours in this place (including watching their movies) to give justice for its creation. The food in their food hall is also amazingly good and cheap.

Don't miss the light water show at 7pm.,"Sad that they don't allow camera and phone inside, it's just magnificient ! I would advise you to go around 4pm to be able to do most of the attractions inside. The light show is great but it's better with people being able to translate for you !Some of the stories  sound a bit like brain washing. I would advise to skip the 50 min movie (number 2) for this reason. But vibe is great all in all :)"

Akshardham_Temple,Seema C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016,Beautiful Temple!,We visiting the Ashardam Temple complex in October. It was absolutely beautiful. There was an exhibition on the life of Swami Narayan which had an English or Hindi option. It is beautifully done. Following that we watched an informative movie and then watched the laser light show which was definitely the highlight of our visit. The boat ride was also fun. Kids had a great time. Highly recommended.

Akshardham_Temple,pradeep_parhi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,Gorgeous Temple - Not to be missed while in Jaipur,"I along with my family had visited Akshyardham temple at Jaipur on 12th Nov 2016 during our holiday trip to Rajasthan. This is located at Vaishali Nagar. The temple is gorgeous with modern architecture. This temple has idols of Swaminarayan along with Radha/Krishna, Ram/Sita and lord Shiva/Parvati/Ganesh. The garden in front of the temple is superb and amazing. The ambience is neat & clean and the floor is made up of marble.The exhibition hall was also good. Entry fee for the exhibition hall is Rs. 20/- per person. This hall depicts the life of Swaminarayan through audio and display of the exhibits. It will take around 1-2 hours for visiting the temple and taking photographs. This is a very peaceful place where one can sit for around one hour. This is a must visit place and not to be missed during Jaipur visit."

But, if you wish to see modern day structures with jaw dropping architecture, it is the best place in Jaipur. This temple is dedicated to Swami Narayan Ji and is the only temple of BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha in Jaipur. The temple is known for its beautiful architecture, adorable idols, wonderful sculptures, and carvings.The temple is made up of sand stone. The carvings on sand stones used in the temple is spectacular. Further, idols of deities in the sanctum sanctorum are so beautiful that you will just keep on adoring them.Also, there is a very beautiful garden and a restaurant in the temple complex. ""Prem Rasoi"", the restaurant in the temple complex offers very delicious delicacies, specially the ""Daal Khichri"".In short, this place is one of the must visit places in Jaipur.You may use this link for the exact location of temple - https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/BAPS+Shri+Swaminarayan+Mandir/@26.9021076,75.7060039,13z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sakshardham+jaipur!3m4!1s0x396db4979bfaaaab:0xf327bf3573201a4e!8m2!3d26.9021076!4d75.7410228"
