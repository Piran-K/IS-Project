Albert_Hall_Museum,JSarna,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,Dusty Treasures,"A rich legacy of art & treasure - neglected underneath a thick coating of dust - is the only way to describe the Albert Hall Museum, Jaipur. A fairly good, eclectic collection - including an unexpected Egyptian mummy - the museum boasts of a sprinkling of antiques from around the world but is unfortunately being left to rot under dust & zero housekeeping. The only saving grace is the air conditioning. Highly recommend a spring cleaning of the exhibits"

Of all the sight seeing places, this is the best in Jaipur at a very minimal entry fee of Rs50 pp. Go for it !"

Albert_Hall_Museum,DisplayName,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Couples,"Great Museum, Horrible Mask Enforcement","Admittedly I should have known better going to an indoor museum, but have to point out for others that very few guests were wearing masks, and despite signs posted staff were not enforcing and often not wearing masks themselves.

The architecture looked fascinating from the outside so we visited it.  Mid-February was a great time to visit Jaipur because it's near the end of the tourist season but hasn't really warmed up.  The museum has artifacts of all sorts.  From clay models of people at work (really fascinating) to clothes and manuscripts and paintings.  Without having to deal with jostling crowd we spent a pleasant two hours at the museum.

But my recommendation would be not to loose yourself in the details which can easily happen as they are believing that repetition is the mother of all learning."
Albert_Hall_Museum,Rodkoi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Museum Visit,"A lovely museum in the centre of Jaipur with a wide variety of Indian and other objects to see. You have to follow a specific route, but lots to see and well worth visiting."
Albert_Hall_Museum,mrinalinibatra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Looks majestic at night,We landed at the site accidentally - our driver took us to the Coffee Day on the premises as we were craving our morning fix. Did not go inside the museum as it had not been on our agenda but drove by there a couple of time. It looks majestic at night - all lit up!

Albert_Hall_Museum,Vijayaraghavan S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,One of the best,This was a pleasant surprise quickly qualified into a must do in JaipurOne of the best museums I visited so far. The collections are really good and the place is maintained spotlessDo visit in the evening. They close at 5:00 and reopen again with fancy lighting at 6:30 pm. The tickets are slightly expensive in the evening (100 rupees per head compared to 40 in the morning) but they place had few visitors in the evening and much more peaceful
Albert_Hall_Museum,bhavnabkumar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,An average experience,"Albert Hall Museum is a very regular museum with weapons, pottery, ceramics, crystal ware, daily use items from olden days, statues, textile, paintings, coins from different eras. It has an Egyptian mummy too. The entire visit took about 1-2 hours. There was nothing spectacular about this museum. However, the museum lights up very beautifully after sunset. That pretty sight is a must see from Bapu Bazaar. It is visible from one of the gates there."
Albert_Hall_Museum,SibsagarVish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,The Museum with the egyptian mummy,"The museum has many nice collections of pottery, ceramics, textiles, weapons and many more of this region. The museum at night in varied colours is a treat to watch.

Albert_Hall_Museum,Shobha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Not so good,It needs some maintenance. It is not clean . The only thing that I liked was mummies except that it is waste of time .
Albert_Hall_Museum,Pintya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Needs better maintenance,"The museum is based in an old building located in the heart of city. Historical weapons, crockery, clothing, art is on display. Main attraction is Mummy. Photography is not prohibited. "
Albert_Hall_Museum,David O,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,A comical museum experience,"The man at the ticket counter handed me a student ticket instead of a standard ticket. It was by pure chance that I noticed the discrepancy between the amount he charged and the receipt he handed over. The guards seem to all be in the game, as I have never been to another museum where they’ve checked the ticket so carefully. This was probably the most interesting “exhibit” in the museum.Rather stupidly, there are no toilets inside, so if you need a toilet you have to go through all the remaining rooms and the exit and go some distance further. (Don’t mention disabled access). The exit turnstile does not allow re-entry; the entry is on the other side of the building to the exit; the ticket is of course one use only. Luckily, there is not much inside worth seeing anyway.  In a country where 250 rupees buys you 45 GB of 4G data, 300 rupees apparently gets you access to a few glass cabinets with old carpets inside and a mummy.Two stars for the gorgeous exterior and some interesting cultural incidentals: a school group was performing on the front steps, a couple were taking pre-wedding photos with the building as a backdrop."
Albert_Hall_Museum,rbs02,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Lively museum ,"Located in heart of city , in an old building with excellent architecture. The exhibits are weapons, crockery, currency, paintings, Egyptian Mummy, brass handicrafts, marble carvings .. a unique antique collection .. "

Albert_Hall_Museum,rogerl044,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Excellent Museum in a grand building,We left our visit a little late and had to rush a bit. There was so much to see - we like museums - and we had to miss out on several sections that would have been interesting.Not quite sure why the Egypt section was there but I suppose it demonstrates the Victorian fascination.I found it very illuminating on all the periods of Indian history and well worth the visit

Albert_Hall_Museum,Chetan Shroff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Albert hall museum….Egyptian mummy in Jaipur,"We visited this museum as normal museum but it had a surprise for us. It is housed in a nice building with your usual museum stuff like clothes, arms, carpets, jewellery, books, coins etc. But the surprise was Egyptian mummy. In basement of building, there was Egyptian artifacts and we could see Egyptian mummy. I guess it was the only museum in India which has Egyptian mummy. So I and my son were delighted since wanted to see Egyptian mummy.Outside this museum there is yummy street food at Masala Chowk"

The architecture of the building is also very impressive. "
Albert_Hall_Museum,staledale,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Don't go when you're tired,"Family of four, arrived after a long morning of seeing other sites. Being tired, it was difficult to pay 700 rupees (about $9.75USD) each to enter. Then, we found out that it would be an additional 10 Euros (about $11USD) each to go further inside where the King's area was. Pretty expensive for India. Don't go when you're tired, and you'll probably have a great experience."
Albert_Hall_Museum,Brun066,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Museum that doesn't fear comparison with the major art museums of the greatest Indian cities,"This museum dates from the late nineteenth century. It's therefore following the era that saw the foundation of the great European museums, undoubtedly the model for that product of modernity: ie the practice of ​​gathering in a building and opening to the public the highest evidences of culture, coming from near or far territories .However the second half of the nineteenth century is also the period (in the wake of the Universal exhibition in London, 1851) in which space is also given in museums to the phenomenon of the so-called ""Industrial Arts"" (German ""Kunstgewerbe"", French ""Arts décoratifs"", Italian ""Arti applicate""), that is, the arts producing artifacts not only for contemplation but also for everyday use.This museum in Jaipur reflects this cultural atmosphere. Alongside sublime and traditional works of art (I mention only the gallery of ancient Indian sculptures, or the famous ""carpet of the Persian garden""), there are ample collections of objects of practical - or ""even practical"" - use: like music instruments, jewels, furniture, weapons, etc.If the collection can appear ""chaotic"" to an inexperienced eye, keep in mind the idea underlying this museum, I mentioned above; and you will find (as I found) that this museum doesn't fear confrontation with the major art museums of the greatest Indian cities (in this trip we have seen those in Delhi and Kolkata)."

Also, I was equally impressed with the architecture of the museum itself which displayed an impressive style reminiscent of the Moor architecture of Spain and Northern Africa.  Museums are really my thing unless I have a tour guide which we decided not to do.  However, despite the large crowds visiting we felt we got a good taste of the items displayed and the history of the time period in only 90 mins."

The museum is well maintained and it’s AC. The items kept inside are worth seeing. Overall a clean place and a must visit. The mummy kept inside is too exciting.

Albert_Hall_Museum,Nutan G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,A place full of the old artefacts of the kings of Jaipur,The museum seems to be a forgotten relic gathering dust. It has a lot of artefacts but could do with some good anecdotes and historical facts to make them interesting. At night the place is lit up like a bride but in the daytime you can see that it could do with a coat of paint.

Albert_Hall_Museum,Quinonostante,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,It’s just ok,"Evenings mean you get to see the building facade lit up, and it’s quite spectacular.Inside guards are surley, rude.  Signage is limited and for some totally obscure reason you may take photos on a cellphone/mobile phone but not on a camera, the explanation given being “you can’t talk through a camera”?!?Some good pottery, lots of copies of items from other cultures. Coin room was interesting, and some of the pottery figurines are very good.Weapon display is quite extensive. Cheap entry but as usual be aware that as a white tourist you will find people taking your photo quite blatantly and without your permission, and it gets a bit tiresome. "
Albert_Hall_Museum,Shonil_B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Nice Museum to visit in evening / after dark,I visited this Museum in the evening after it was dark. It was well lit with colorful lights. This is worth watching. The inside of the museum is also open in the evening. If you go here in the evening it is less crowded and you can watch it peacefully. Photography thru mobile phone camera is allowed. Rest of the things to watch here is written by most other people in their review...no point in writing the same thing again.
