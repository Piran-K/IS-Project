Amber_Palace-Amer,Arham Bajaj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023,True essence of Palace with the magical temples.,"If you are planning to visit Jaipur, plan 1 whole day trip where you can begin by watching early morning Sunrise from Jalmahal, then proceed to Amber fort. Inside Amber fort, you can feel the essence of Rajasthani tradition by riding over big elephants which will take you inside the fort, or you can also walk above the fort from parking place. Once you roam around the palace, do not forget to go to Jagat Shiromani temple as well. It is the only temple in the world with the statue of Lord Krishna and Meera bai. Also, you will find very rare temples where Lord Vishnu is kept alongside with Lord Krishna because Lord Krishna had all the 16 kala of Lord Vishnu. The temple is around 400 years old."
Amber_Palace-Amer,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,A large and picturesque palace fortress in the old city of Amer.,"Amer was the original home of the rulers of the region, before they relocated to the city of Jaipur. Their palaces and fortresses can still be seen in Amer however, and the most famed of these is Amer Fort itself. The fort can be accessed by elephant or by jeep, although walking is also a possibility. There are some potential ethical concerns about the treatment of elephants in Jaipur, so be sure to research this and choose responsibly if you do want to take an elephant ride. The palace itself is beautiful, with painted walls and one palace of mirrors and silvered glass. The best thing about it is the views however and it is really very special. The best time to visit for the heat is during winter (from November to January), however this time also sees significant air pollution, which can diminish the views."

Amber_Palace-Amer,exploredaunexplored,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Grand,Amer fort is huge. There's lot of walking and climbing steps involved. Pls go with a good guide. The history is mind blowing. Such intricate details. I went via airbnb experience. It was totally worth it. On the entrance there's someone playing traditional instruments. The magnificent gates. Everything is brilliant. The best part is the view from the top sections 
Amber_Palace-Amer,sanjay das,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family,Excellent,Awesome experience quite busy.Guudes are 400rs. They may take you to a rip off tourist shop after tour. Also if you are nri or OCI or can speak hindi just get your tickets direct and queue with everyone else Guudes will take you to foreigner line and try to get you to pay more. No where recognising OCI as Indian ID apart from Taj Mahal.
Amber_Palace-Amer,Woodstag,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Must see historical palace whilst in Jaipur,"We had an excellent guide for the days tour of Jaipur to provide the historical knowledge and context. It requires a long car journey to and up the steep hill to see this historical and impressive Amber Palace Fort. Much of this Palace and Fort is open to admire the architecture, craftsmanship involved and explore the buildings and courtyards. Great views across the valleys."
Amber_Palace-Amer,Unnikrishnan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Historical,"The two most prominent places to visit in Jaipur are the Amber fort and the Jal Mahal apart from other places like the Hawa Mahal and City Palace, Jantar Mantar, etc."
Amber_Palace-Amer,Apolonia70,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,My equal favourite fort in India,"This is a large complex with many levels and offerings - artifacts, paintings, decor - the architecture is amazing - a good few hours with great photographic opportunities. Also a good workout walking around."
Amber_Palace-Amer,Wansbrough2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,A bucket list item ticked off,"We visited as part of our Uniworld Golden Triangle itinerary and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  We had the benefit of a guide who passed on a lot of information and details of the history and I would urge you if you visit, to arrange one. There is some fantastic architecture and the views out at the top and incredible. Great experience. üëçüèº"
Amber_Palace-Amer,Gustavo A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Amazing views all around!,"This place is beautiful, huge and with plenty of things to see. No need to go by truck, the walk up to the palace is not even that steep. Easily doable even if you're not in shape. Ignore the truck/jeep guys. Up there you get amazing views of jaipur and the area surrounding the palace. Plus, there are monkeys all around which is pretty cool (careful, they scream and sometimes steal your stuff). The architecture is very distinct and the place is in good conditions to visit. It did seem to me that it should be getting more security and staff around to prevent people form deteriorating it further. Still, a must visit in Jaipur, and super cheap for what you get to see!"
Amber_Palace-Amer,Detlef Volke,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Fascinating big fort,Go up on an elephant and enjoy the Slow Ride ;-)Do not Look at hookers who Want to sell some stuff but trat the fotographer.

When we departed there was a queue of cars of at least one hour just to get close, let alone into, the palace. This was the main reason, I liked Jaipur. It's worth 2 hours of your time "
Amber_Palace-Amer,Rishi S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good,Good...would have been nice if the elephant ride was on the way down the fort as well.The insane traffic during peak season makes it difficult to get some good pictures on the fort.

Amber_Palace-Amer,theSeeker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Majestic structure,"Amber palace is a must see in Jaipur. Make sure to visit it during day time to enjoy it completely. Though entry is available till 9pm, the lighting is not enough. The majestic fort has been part of many movies like Jodha Akbar. It's good to avail the service of a guide at a price of 400 for a group of 4 people. Me and my family had an affable gentleman named Mukesh Sharma explaining the history and other details of the palace. Great too hear how the Sheesh Mahal uses technique of mirror reflection to keep the rooms warm during winter"
Amber_Palace-Amer,gira p,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Worth the visit,I recommend reading about the history of the Palace before your visit. Very well preserved. Wear comfortable shoes and keep your camera handy.

Amber_Palace-Amer,Prasanna,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Must in Jaipur tour.,A must visit in your Jaipur tour. The brilliance of the architectural structure and design with all the logic makes you want to live in that era. Take a guide. Nominal charge- Rs.400/- add a tip of Rs.100/- it's worth it.Beware of the shops who try to sell(force-sell)  goods to you in the name of Amer made indigenous items. No harm in buying though.

Amber_Palace-Amer,Mumtaazrs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Simply stunning. No more words.,A must visit place. The aura of the palace brings alive the times when these places were inhabited by the royals.
Amber_Palace-Amer,FlavourSeeker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Mostly good, some bad parts","We had a great time visiting this fort. We had a knowledgeable guide who regaled various stories of the  Royals, and the grandeur of the fort was pretty cool. The hall of mirrors was also very nice. The whole place was a great example of a fusion between Hindu and Mughal architecture, reflective of the synergies between those communities of the time. There are several cool books and crannies to explore, and learn more about, which can take up a good chunk of time. There are some very unfortunate aspects of this fort, though. There is a severe lack of respect that the visitors have towards this fort - it is dirty, littered with trash, and the large majority of people who visit this place are only interested in taking selfies, while barging and pushing others around. The elephants look very weak and abused, and it's important not to support the continued exploitation of these majestic creatures, as they are not treated well. Very sad to see.In one of the small hallways we saw a used baby diaper (yes, very used and brown) shoved into the window - which was disgusting and so sad. The actual maintenance of the fort could be improved as well. But it's a really impressive fort."
Amber_Palace-Amer,Bhaskar_10,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Grandeur display of Indian History and Culture,"Visited on 8th November 2022This place can be approaced on foot, on elephant or on jeep apart form your own private vehicle. Jeep fare is INR 100 for going and coming back with 6-8 passenger per jeep which was our choice of travel.Entry fee is INR 100/- per adulty and INR 20/- for students with id card. This rate is for Indian nationals. Not sure if this is seperate for other nationalities.The fort itself depicts the grandeur of teh Rajputana both with the magnificence and magnitude of the architecture and size.Conducted tours will help the visitor with more understanding of teh history and lifestyle of teh kings and its pupils, thus I will recommend all to take a guide who can cost INR 200-300/- for 1 hour tour.On a hot day ot will be tourture thus plab early morning or post 4pm . THis place is always crowded.Must visit for all coming to Jaipur"
Amber_Palace-Amer,Wafa B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Amber Fort, Jaipur.",What a beautiful piece of India‚Äôs history. A must do visit in Jaipur. A beautiful mix between the Hindi and Mughal architecture where the Islam and Hinduism religion met and built a wonderful fort.
Amber_Palace-Amer,maria machi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Hidden treasures,"Very beautiful palace, amazing walled fortress, short distance from the city. It took us 3 hours to look around and we did not feel them. No signals to show the way so you risk missing some areas. We knew there was more since we had a map from an audio tour you can purchase at the entrance for 200 rupees, cheaper than the guides and more entertaining. You use your own phone. We didn‚Äôt use the elephants to go up, we visited them later. I bought a cute umbrella for the sun, for 400 rupees, it can be found in the city for 250, but it was worth it."
Amber_Palace-Amer,GLRoberts99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Brilliant but do not use the elephants,"This is a stunning fort / palace. It has been restored (and still needs some work doing to it), but it is fantastic. We had a very knowledgeable guide who appreciated what we wanted to see and took us through the very large property. The detail and the delicacy of some of the decoration in rooms, around doors, and on ceilings is exquisite. The history and myths that surround it, lead to wonderful stories, and make it a ""Must See"" location.The only downside was the use and abuse of elephants which are used to ferry idle tourists to the fort from the carpark."
Amber_Palace-Amer,995dwightd,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Must see portion of Golden Triangle Tour,"High on a hill, isolated.  Take an elephant or a car ride to the top.  Normal museum artifacts, buildings and the like inside the fort.  This entire area (Jaipur) is shades of brown and amber from lack of rainfall.  A different kind of beauty.  "

Amber_Palace-Amer,Petra W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Best tourist attraction in Jaipur,"Of all the forts and landmarks in Jaipur, this was the best one. It's huge and would have been magnificent in it's day. I suggest you skip the others and only do Amber Fort."
Amber_Palace-Amer,Anita K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Beautiful Visit,"This is a beautiful fort, worth visiting. But my suggestion is visit it in the early morning. It gets crowded by mid morning and there is no place to park or to walk. Get a guide to take you, Salim Khan did an amazing job to showing us the fort as well as take the most amazing photos as he is a photographer. Contact him if you want a good guided tour of Amber Fort. 93510-08078.All the guides tell you not to shop at the stores within the fort and that they will take you to the wholesale shops to buy the same things, but I must tell you that the shops within the fort have some of the best products which you will not find outside in the many touristy shops that they take you to after the tour. The shops in the City Palace and in Amber Fort have beautiful jewellery, artifacts and block printed stuff which will interest the foreigners, and the quality is really good. Pricing is a little high, but it is to be expected.The drivers will also tell you that they will take you to the best places for shopping, but my suggestion is to buy what you like when you see it since there is no guarantee you will find it elsewhere."
Amber_Palace-Amer,StorkRN1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Definitely the best fort I saw in India,"Had a guide w our group and it was worth it to hear about all the details of this gorgeous fort. Great views on a hill, great gardens, I loved the mirrored hall."

Amber_Palace-Amer,SurenKaushik,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Worth a visit,This is an imposing fort with its huge precincts. A Guide would be of great help here. The place is huge and truly magnificent.  Seniors may well do with a walking stick. The Sound and Light show in the evening is well worth the effort and money. 
Amber_Palace-Amer,Bilal K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 ‚Ä¢ Business,Best place ,Rahul is a great person. He loves his elephants. We loved the entire experience.Each and every single moment was just awesome.
Amber_Palace-Amer,ian m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Worth a visit.,Probably best to have a guide to get the best out of this attraction - as with most such palaces in Rajasthan it's a cross between a fort and a palace.
Amber_Palace-Amer,jsthouston,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Large and imposing ,I found this fort more impressive from a distance than up close. The fact that it was hot and crowded probably did not help. It is massive and imposing but you get that impression driving up while going inside added little at least for myself. 
Amber_Palace-Amer,Federico,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A must-see in Rajasthan!,"One of the most symbolic and well-known forts in Rajasthan.

Amber_Palace-Amer,duttash,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Amber Palace - a royal visit,Amber Palace is a must see in Jaipur.  A short drive from the city center - it is majestic and imposing.

Great view of the plains from the hilltop.  It is a must see.

Amber_Palace-Amer,FLnurseER,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Stunning architecture, well maintained fort","A definite must see in Jaipur. We were taken to the closest entrance in a jeep then walked up the sloping paths and many steps, where comfortable footwear is a must. The fort was not crowded and we enjoyed a couple of hours with our Pink City guide Jai, who had expertly guided us through the many rooms and courtyards, pointing out the beautiful detailed decor of mirrored mosaics and colored glass patterns, intricate marble inlays and amazing fine architecture. Without his guidance, we would have missed many points of interest as the area to see is so vast. There were many specific photo ops along the way and our guide took memorable pictures of our family. We bought good quality souvenirs in a wonderful gift store with large selection of beautiful items. This fort is not to be missed, but please do not use the elephants to ride up. For a wonderful kind interaction with these animals we visited the  Elefun Sanctuary."

I just met the tour guide at the gate and simply go with him with a reasonable price. The ticket is a bit high is Rs.500. The architect was blend between Muslim and Hindu. The used nature color to paint at the walls and the ceilings which is incredible. And you should take more 15 minutes to visit the museum nearby
Amber_Palace-Amer,Arpit Agarwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Beauty at its best,"It's so beautiful and magnificent. You can spend 2-3 hours there. The architecture of this fort Is amazing.

Amber_Palace-Amer,Anup Kumar G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Must see when visiting Jaipur,"Amazing place to see the grandeur of Rajasthan. Since there is a lot of walking in the open area, try to find a day with good weather. On the way back, there is nice shopping area set up by, Rajasthan Small Scale Cottage Industry (RSSCI). This is a must visit as well. Budget around 4-5 hours for the entire trip, excluding the drive to/from Jaipur.We engaged Tulsi N. Gupta (+91-98295-99376, tngupta376@gmail.com) as the tourist guide. He was brilliant. Reach out to him if you visiting this place.The elephant ride is highly recommended as well. Do plan to arrive early as the rides run till 12.00PM only."
