Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Rajiv N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Excellent place to visit to discover the art of Fabric Block printings of Rajasthan,"Set in Amer just next to the Kheri Gate on the way to the Amer Fort, this place is a treat for anyone interested in the Rich Rajasthani art of Block printing. While we were conversant with printing techniques like Sanghaneri and Bhagru this place had a lot more to offer. It is set in an old bunglow and has rooms dedicated to each of the printing techniques. There is a master ji who taught  us how to do a block print. My younger daughter thoroughly enjoyed it. There is an artisan who showed us how to carve a block. The entry fee is just Rs.40 for an adult and there is a donation box in case one wants to donate. The most striking thing about this museum is the peace and quiet of this place. It has several rooms, niches and stairs which make the place intriguing. Its a must vist for anyone visiting Amer which is about 16 kms from the airport. This area is avoidable during the 26th of Dec to 7th of Jan due to the huge influx of tourists from Delhi. There is a small anokhi store which sells some garments and gifting ideas in block print. One  can buy a bag or a tshirt in white and try printing the same in block prints. The evolution of a grey fabric through the indigo dyeing process with a print are one of the many exhibits that one can see. The overall experience is enriching "

Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,praew,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,10 out of 10 l a must visit,"IMPRESSIVE. Exceed expectations in every way. Highly recommend A lot of museums have tons of things to display but don't know how to tell stories. That's not the case with Anokhi museum. They know what they're doing.***Easy access by public transportation. A short flat walk from Amer fort.They combined the gorgeous space with beautiful examples and good storytelling. History of old days, visualized and detailed methods and material, importance, examples, reimagining and surviving in modern-day, comparison, demonstration, workshop... you name it. Here you have it all. Plus proper info signage Some areas can use a little more light, stairs - not elderly/wheelchair friendly but overall is nice. User friendly, Better (by far the best) than most museums here. Whoever work for this deserve a raise and a big clapThe Museum shop is also very nice. I got some great books and textiles from them"
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Wizziwoo803,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,"Excellent experience and very warm, welcoming staff","We went to the Anokhi Museum having seen a flyer for it in the Anokhi Cafe. We didn’t realise it is closed from 15th May - 15th July and arrived anyway. Despite it being closed the staff there were so incredibly welcoming and friendly. We were not lucky enough to see all of the exhibition because it was closed for cleaning, fixing etc but the very kind gentleman showed us what he could and we still had a very interesting and memorable time.We really appreciated the efforts that the staff went to to accommodate us despite our mistake and are looking forward to visit next time when the museum is fully functional. A big thank you to the three gentleman there, I wish I could remember their names :("
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Film G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Couples,Way Better than Expected,"Set in a fabulously renovated building — itself worth the trip — the exhibits are well laid out and have good explanations. Clean toilet. There are also artisans there showing how to make the wooden blocks used in the fabric printing, and doing the actual printing itself. You can join in, and get a souvenir. The museum store is also great, full of beautiful handmade stuff at a modest price, given the workmanship. Not to be missed. You might think ‘Fabric Museum. Ugh’ You’d be very wrong. Even kids would like the artisans."

Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,itchyfeetArizona,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,EXCELLENT MUSEUM,"An outstanding little museum in a beautifully restored Haveli. Exhibitions are well laid out, displayed and explained. There's not too little to bore you, not too much to overwhelm, just perfect for you to gain a good understanding about hand printing and grow to appreciate, if not love it! The quality of the works are astounding. Mr. Pavan gave us a tour and he explained everything really well. The museum shop is delightful as well. The live demonstrations are fascinating. We love the dignity of this museum. Such a beautiful example of how to preserve tradition and culture without blatant commercialization. Very refreshing after the ugly commercialized Amber Fort. This museum is well worth a couple hours of your time!"
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Brun066,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Here I really learned about entities I didn't know about before,"I asked our taxi driver to visit this museum, as my guidebook recommended it as an outstanding sight near Amber Fort. But I didn't know anything about it.I too was impressed by the skill with which the ancient ""haveli"" that houses the museum has been restored, and by the care with which it's maintained.The exhibition of the craft of hand printing by wooden blocks is also interesting for those who are not fond of fabrics: he / she will learn the essentials of both the different characteristics of fabrics and the ways of printing them.At the end of the visit, a craftsman printed a cotton handkerchief in different colors and patterns in a few minutes, and gave it to my wife, who still keeps it.After my visit to this museum, I learned that the name ""Anokhi"" is that of a local company that has a factory in Jaipur and employs many hundreds of workers in the production of fabrics printed by this traditional technique. And I also understood that this technique, which risked disappearing at the end of the last century, derives from a secular Indian tradition, in which Rajastan, and in particular the town of Bagru, west of Jaipur, excels.In short, I really learned about entities I didn't know; as it's obvious, traveling to a country like India, which for its size and the antiquity of its civilization has a ""reservoir"" of cultural accumulation among the very first in the world."
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,aishwarya m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"Textiles, History &  Architecture","A well maintained museum dedicated to textiles. The way to the museum amidst the lanes of Amber is equally enjoyable, especially if you are a lover of art and architecture!"

If you are interested in textile history, the museum has fascinating exhibits of hand block printing from ancient to modern times – but if you aren’t so interested in the history, then go straight to the top floor where real artisans demonstrate making the wooden printing blocks and making real block printed fabrics. You can even have a go at making your own block printed handkerchief under their expert and amused supervision! Entrance is amazingly good value at 80 rupees (less than £1) and then you can support this good cause by buying a small handmade item from the shop.

Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Naomi W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,A quiet gem amid the bustle of Amer and surprisingly family friendly,"We took our girls aged 4 and 7 here after going to Amber Fort. The museum is situated in a 400 year old building which is beautiful in itself. The museum was very quiet and incredibly cheap with no one hassling us or with any expectation that we would buy anything.The man at the front desk showed us around- it isn't a huge collection but as we'd seen and bought block print clothing it was interesting looking at the different styles. We spent quite a bit of time watching the demonstrations of block carving and printing in the cool of the upper courtyards- our girls were given the small flower block prints we saw carved and 2 block printed hankerchiefs they helped to print. You can pay to block print your own scarf, bag or t shirt (not advertised on their website oddly but a wonderful activity for children) but we opted to buy some block prints in the shop to make our own t shirts at home. The shop was a little more limited than I expected but there is a large Anokhi shop in Jaipur anyway. The shop does provide quiz sheets and colouring for  children which is a nice touch since sights in India do not always think of children. There is a cafe kiosk outside and picnic tables where it would be pleasant to sit. A definite for art lovers or to escape the hoardes! We wish we'd spent more time there."

It was a very enjoyable experience! The cool airy building has been renovated very well and the exhibitions were very informative with live demonstrations of carving and printing techniques. You can even join in! There is a nice shop and a cafe in a pleasant courtyard. We felt that someone had finally made a decent tourist-oriented experience. 
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Ema Datshi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Absolutely fantastic - if you're interested in block printing,"The Anokhi museum was the absolute highlight of our trip to Jaipur and I loved both the building and its contents. I love textiles in general and block printing in particular so I knew I'd find it fascinating. My husband had no idea why I loved BP but after going to the museum, he totally 'got' it.Inside you'll find lots of historic textiles, information about the beautiful haveli building in which it's situated, and craftsmen on the top floor carving print blocks and printing fabrics.The shop is also well worth a visit. Good prices considering where you are.The museum doesn't open until 10.30 am and we arrived too early - hence a side visit to the step well and a temple, both of which were lovely. If you are driving up to the Fort (rather then walking or riding an elephant from the main entrance) you will drive right past the museum. If you go to the museum first, you will not get to the Fort until noon or later. If you want to go after, your risk is that your driver will be reluctant or you'll be exhausted. If you are hiring a driver for a set time or paying by the hour and you want to go to the museum first, make sure you don't go out too early.The cafe in the courtyard does a stunning lime and ginger soda! Well worth trying."

Seeing the building was just as good as visiting its museum.  The renovations was awesome.  we also like the printing demonstration.   the gift shop was also very good.   well worth the slight detour to see this museum
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Einon_E_Mouse,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Nag your driver to take you here!,"It’s not popular with the guides because they don’t give backhanders to them for visiting. There is a small (100 rupee) entrance fee, and there’s a tiny but nice courtyard cafe for a cool drink. The museum is literally five minutes by car from the Amber Fort car park - make sure your guide stops at the step well that is half way there - another great photo opportunity. The museum was lovely - they didn’t take tips, so you aren’t hassled, you can have a go at block printing yourself, the people are friendly and interesting, and the shop has some lovely, reasonably priced hand printed items to buy. Children are made very welcome and entertained with a bit of printing on paper.  Give it a go - you won’t be sorry. Don’t forget the step well. "

It was very informative of the various styles of hand block printing that has been done and in some cases is continued throughout the various regions in India. The museum was broken up into the different styles and I really enjoyed reading about them all. The museum shop is cute and very reasonably priced. It had a nice small booklet that gave a synopsis of all the different types of hand printing. If you call ahead or arrange it when you enter, you can even try your hand at creating your own print. All in all, I count this as a must see, if you like small museum working to preserve history of craftsmen and women."
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,26mariannev,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Beautiful and informative,"We have always loved Anokhi and block-printed fabrics, and now we also know how fabrics are printed.

Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Kasia K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Highlight of Jaipur,"This quiet place only minutes from Amber Fort was the best attraction of Jaipur. Away from the tourist crowds we entered this beautiful restored haveli. The entrance fee is very small and everything is so quiet and serene. It is a small museum but nevertheless we spent a long time exploring all the small hidden corners with beautiful examples and stories of hand printing. There were also workers on-cite who showed us how they do block-printing, which was an amazing experience. The museum hosts a little gift shop that stocks different things to the regular Anokhi shops, well worth to buy some gifts here! Wonderful place worth supporting to get a different experience."
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Elizabeth R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,A Must for Fabric Lovers,"Housed in a renovated building that is just beautiful to see, the Museum of Hand Printing is a wonderful place to see both traditional and contemporary clothing made from hand printed fabrics.  Seriously, I don't know if the old clothes or the modern designed garments were more lovely.  What they shared, however, was the beauty of hand printing...flawless hand printing.  If you see this Museum, it should be paired with one of the workshops that creates the fabric for today's market.  The process is virtually unchanged.  At the end of the Museum tour we found a master carver sitting one of the porches using his tools.  People, both commercial dealers as well as individuals, bring designs for him to carve into the wood to be used as patterns in the fabric designs.  Moving from one tiny tool to the next, with meticulous care, he carved a small flower for both my husband and for myself.  A treasure!"

Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,bubbleg3,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,A calm quiet beautiful museum,"I visited the Anokhi museum separate from touring the Amber Fort, but I can see why visitors choose to go the museum after the fort. Once you finish the fort, you need a quiet moment. Anokhi offers peace as you meander through a restored mansion and learn about the complexities of hand block printing and dying of fabrics. I'm really glad I visited Anokhi, watched the demonstrations and picked up a small souvenir. "

A museum  set in an old mansion building houses a great collection of hand blocked fabrics and exhibits by craftsmen who are charming and very skilled. Sit and watch enthralled and then join in! Do not miss the opportunity to buy some of this fantastic fabric in the small but well stocked museum shop. There is no pressure selling, they let the fabric speak for itself, and it is very reasonably priced for the quality! "

Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Texas Traveler,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Great but not in warm weather or if you can't do steep steps,"I honestly love this place and it's got a great display of block printing.  But there is no AC and if the weather is warm beware, you are required to go up and down several sets of steep steps.  It's in a lovely old Haveli and there is a small Anokhi shop on site.  Go through the arch as you pull out of the drive on the right and you can take a walk up to the lake you see from Amber Fort."
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Neil H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,A hidden gem of a museum,"A great little museum in a nicely restored building. The museum was lovely and quiet and a nice place to visit after Amber fort. I'm not a big textiles fan, so the main exhibit only had a passing interest for me.The real highlight was watching craftsmen at work on the top floor, who demonstrated a lifetime of skill. A nice gift shop, friendly staff and great value for money at 80 rupees. Worth taking a look at the step well on the way there."

Its a joy to watch the two craftsman at work, for block making and for block printing on fabric.The best takeaway is you get two presents: one small print block and one printed handkerchief, where even you can try printing some blocks."
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,kea12_12,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,See craftsmen at work,Surprising high level museum in award winning restored haveli in quiet corner of Amer. Change of pace from fort visits to give some background to what is on offer at the bazaars. Craftsmen give interactive displays of carving blocks and printing and good insights into the meaning of different fabrics and designs. Also a small outdoor cafe -welcome after the trek through the village to arrive. Interesting to see quite a low ticket price and central donation system (no tipping) in place.

Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Michael H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Great place on many levels,The restored haveli mansion that the museum is housed in is about  worth a visit on its own. On a 110 degree day outside it was remarkable how cool the interior of the haveli was due to the think cement walls and strategically placed windows. The textiles and apparel throughout the museum is impressive as is seeing the blocks being carved and then used to print textiles. Definitely worth a visit.

Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,XenaWP1999,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,Short visit after the Amer Fort is worth it!,"I love textiles, especially floral prints and paisleys. A daytrip to Saganer to see the block print artisans would have been thrilling for me but not for my son or parents. The Anokhi Museum, housed in a heritage building near the Amer Fort, was a pleasant stop for everyone. While my father and Sanjay sat in the café, my mother perused the small gift shop and we went upstairs to the museum. It’s a good place to try your hand at block printing. It gave me a new appreciation for the art form. After the 2nd or 3rd colour application, I was ready to call it quits."
Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,frostygb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Educational and Enthralling,Loved our visit here and spent over an hour exploring all this heritage haveli has to offer. The haveli itself is beautiful and has been restored with traditional methods which are explained within the museum. It is remarkably cool in comparison to the outdoor heat.The exhibitions are well curated and incredibly educational - providing interesting background to the crafts and history of the museum. Watching the craftsmen at work is a real highlight and incredible to watch their precision with such a relaxed approach. It's great that the museum is laid out to educate guests prior to the live-workshops so it's well worth following and engaging with the exhibits prior to this.Lovely museum shop too and there is a cafe at the front where you can buy drinks at a reasonable price. Entry fee in April 2017 was 80rs for an adult foreigner. Great value for the educational experience - a highlight from our time in Jaipur.

Anokhi_Museum_of_Hand_Printing,Tracy E,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,hand block printing,"neat museum and the building is interesting as well. be prepared for a lot of stairs, though. i don't know much about textiles or printing processes, and i though the explanatory texts and layouts were very well-done and informative. there were also a  few artisans working inside, we watched a man carve the printing blocks, and two others as they actually printed on cloth- one even let us press the block! gift shop had a nice range of items, reasonably priced with no haggling. good stop if you are visiting amber fort- less than a 20 minute walk away, and there is a beautiful step-well nearby, too. be careful though, several people we met on the street offered us tours, and were persistent even when we said no."
