Birla science & technology center” located in the heart of PinkCity, near the famous landmark Statue Circle. The Birla Planetarium was formally inaugurated by the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 2nd July 1963. Prior to that, Birla planetarium was functioning only as an educational, scientific and research body. The planetarium, spread across 9.8 acres of land, houses a science museum, information processing and dissemination cell, auditorium, research centers and a planetarium. Everyday planetarium offers a special audio-visual show on the scientific researches and celestial bodies, which attracts number of students.Birla Planetarium welcomes everyone to the lesser known world of galaxy and stars. It introduces the mother earth in such a fascinating method, which leaves one awestruck at the beauty and depth of the universe. A whole new universe can be explored by simply sitting inside a round dome inside the planetarium, where projectors with audio visuals give you a deep insight into each and every functioning of the planets and the solar system. Anyone can visit the planetarium between 1200 hours to 1900 hours and experience the world of stars.There is an astronomical observatory which has the provision for Celestron C-14 telescope, including its accessories like the ST6 CCD camera, solar filters etc. An automation system was established after two years of rigorous work in the year 1993 in order to carry out special effects for the planetarium shows. Though anyone is welcome here, but students are given a special concession to watch the shows.Show Timings 11.00 a. m.

The first day we completed all the major attractions such as the Nahargarh Fort, Jaigarh Fort, Amber Palace, City Palace etc. As we have completed the major attractions, the second day we decided to visit some of the nearby places, Birla Auditorium being one. Its a very nice place, not highly technical or scientific working models you can find, but lots of information and models ideal for taking kids between the age of 5-10 years you can find here. There was an astronaut suit also kept there. It was a back to school nostalgia for us. There is also a show conducted here which is approximately of 30-45 minutes. The show was about human evolution, but we kind of got bored at the end. But still it was a good experience as you feel like school students again."

B_M_Birla_Auditorium,AR R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014,Outer space and astronomy.,Outre space views brings one to the nether world. Real experience and knowledge with special sound effects. All youngsters should take advantage of such facility.
B_M_Birla_Auditorium,ddevarshi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Business,Perhaps still the best centrally located auditorium of the town,"This auditorium is located close to Sawai Jai Singh Statue Circle (popularly known as Statue Circle) monument. In the same complex there is a planetarium, exhibition halls, a science museum and a research center (apart from the auditorium). The halls/lawns/auditorium may be hired for scientific/academic/cultural events/exhibitions. I have observed that many reviewers have given their comments on planetarium and museum here though the property for reviews are expected is ""auditorium"". This is surely one of the best auditoriums of Jaipur. There was a time when govt. owned Ravindra Rang Manch/Ravindra Manch (named after Ravindra Nath Tagore and located in Ram Niwas Bag) was the only auditorium available in the city. Construction of this auditorium widened the choice for organizers. This was much clean and far more equipped then Ravindra Manch so became popular in a short time despite its high rates as compared to the other. It became a status symbol to hold event here. Good sound system, better chairs, enough leg space, clean carpets, soothing lights and ample space around auditorium are the reasons for its popularity. The entrance gate of Auditorium and museum complex itself is an attraction as it is huge and resembles Ganesh Pol of Amber Fort. Many tourists/visitors fondly get themselves photographed on stairs leading to this gate. The Science museum is not good, not at all close to the lesser known Science Museum of Shastri Nagar, Jaipur. It was perhaps built to justify the initial terms and conditions on which Birlas (the famous corporate house of India) got this land. The planetarium, was most modern one of its time as Mr. A.G. Kulkarni who was first Director of the Planetarium has told me. It had automated slide projectors which could project colourful images of clouds and horizon, a feature that was not available in other planetarium then."

Small children really enjoy learning about the glaxy in a fun way and it is a must watch. Hats of to the Birla's - only they can do such things in India.   "

It's worth visiting for a short 30 minute movie."

B_M_Birla_Auditorium,aroranuj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Family,Planetorium a must for kids,Birla Planetorium is an excellent way to brush up your knowledge of our solar system. I had been to Delhi planetorium long ago in 1987 when Pluto was a planet. We were reminded that now it has lost its exalted position in the celestial sphere. After the show at planetorium you take a round of the auditorium where interesting facts about space and man's bid to conquer it are displayed.

B_M_Birla_Auditorium,BrandieBee,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2012 • Family,Don't waste your time,"I checked the official website of the planetarium to verify that there was an English showing. The site indicated one English showing, however, when I arrived this was not the case. The price was also different, which is not that surprising from my experience thus far in India. Since I had paid 80 rps for the auto i decided to stay and enjoy the view of the solar system without the benefit of the narration. Unfortunately there was a school group entering at this time and it was myself and 75 very loud and rude children who were all staring at me. I would never recommend anyone to waste their time at this location when there are so many other wonderful ways to spend your time in Jaipur."
