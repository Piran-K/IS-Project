Central_Park,ddevarshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,A garden with 4 km track,"Most of the Indian cities may be competing to become smart cities (whatever it means) but good gardens are hard to find. The Gardens serve different purpose in different cities. Some have good collection of roses, crotons, cactus, flowering plants. However, a good garden must serve different functions- providing green patch to city or colony, track for walking or jogging, space for yoga, space for sitting leisurely even on a sunny day, having a good collection of local and exotic plants etc. Most of the gardens lack many of the desirable features. This garden can serve many purposes and thus is better than other Gardens of Jaipur. It is certainly not an attraction that a tourist must visit. The recent addition is that walking track of 4 km has been laid afresh. The garden is located in a square block of 1 by 1 kilometer and there are many other buildings and facilities located close to garden such as Rajasthan Polo ground, Taj Ram Bagh Palace Hotel, B.M. Birla Auditorium, Lakshmi Vilas Hotel, Bhattarak Ji ki Nasia, Harishchandra Totuka Marriage hall, Golf facility, Horse riding facility. There are gates and parking facilities on all four sides but the main park area is on either side of  Planetarium on Prithvi Raj Road and Bhagwan Das Road. There is a facility of paid toilets near AG office Gate and water filters at least on two locations."

There are toilets located at one entrance while also, there are vendors selling ice cream at the gates of most entrances. Gate 3 leads to a main road when i have seen a wedding procession with dazzling lights and music performed live. From here it is only a simple walk to Statue Circle which is another great spot for local families and architecture surrounding.Jump in a Tuk Tuk and ask for central park and check it out. "

Central_Park,hsdigital,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Solo,Morning or Night-time visits or strolls .,"I passed by Central Park a few times during my sight seeing tour and decided i would look in at some point. My guide informed me that early in the mornings, there are meditation and yoga sessions amongst other such things. This reminded me of the fact that i had seen this on TV and i decided to go in one evening while on my own for a stroll. As with many city parks, one would expect locals of plenty and the usual format. However, as with most of India, there was a fantastic air and ""vibe"" here. A feeling of both Hippy-Like and regular activity was in flow. It was dark by this time so i could not take in all the activity but the relaxing and spiritual aspect was very much happening for me. Locals couples walked holding hands while others sat or lay on their own attaining peace or reflection.There was life, energy and sound all about but of a kind that one can easily elope into - a mild relaxing atmosphere. It is a great place to go to find a contrast to the general fast moving activity of the city streets and the usual activities. I met some locals here and chatted a while as well as finding a spot to myself simply to wind down in. A good place to take the heat off during the evening.  Well worth a stroll through here if you want to find a laid back spot to chill out in. I did not visit early morning, but will do so next visit."

Central_Park,himangshub0,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Friends,A Haven,"Central Park in the heart of Jaipur is one of the most attractive open spaces available to the people of the city. It is well maintained with lush greenery and excellent walk ways and lawns, Central Park is an ideal place to walk, relax or just sit and watch children playing there or a large variety of birds that can be seen in the countless trees there. It is also the venue for Music in the Park that attracts music lovers in large numbers.Visited April 2016"

Central_Park,Shailesh09,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Friends,Morning Walk,"The park created by the Raj Govt initially was great and I have visited since. But now the upkeep is very poor. Repair maintenance of certain areas is very poor. Walkways are not maintained properly, new plantation is not done and worst of all there are no flowering plants. Still being in a green area with golf course next to it the place is ideal for morning / evening walks. "
Central_Park,ddevarshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,A good place for amateur birders too,"If you have been bitten by birding bug recently then you may find this place rewarding to some extent. I found all commonly occurring species of myna- common myna, black-headed myna (Brahminy), rosy pastor, bank myna.& pied myna here. Other birds like Red-vented, Hoopoe, doves, peafowl, tailor bird, black drongo etc are also common. Park is adjacent to Ram Bagh hotel/polo  ground and gold course which together make a rather large patch with scarce building which allows some bird life in area where it is going scarce. Earlier, in C-scheme/Ashok Nagar  locality, where this park is located, Golden oriole & Little minivet could be occasionally seen but now seen very rarely. Even sandpipers could be seen daily at statue circle earlier but now have vanished. The place has parking facilities near all gates and has reasonably well maintained toilets towards west end of park. There are no cafe inside the park which is good in a way. "
Central_Park,RajeshBhardwaj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Central Park lush green woodland in City center.,"I love to call this big garden Lungs of Jaipur, It located right in middle of the town. More than 6 KM jogging track. Beautiful maintained. I enjoyed the early morning hours in this garden. comfortable parking, Long walk but no repetition of sight. I feel pride when i saw the mighty Indian try color flag it is one the biggest flag in India. Give a feeling of countries strength & power. Now i am waiting for the next music concert organised in the park.  It is a famous evening activity in this park. If you just enjoy the big view of the central garden you can visit near by Tapri restaurant, from roof of the tapri restaurant you will find the long view of the central Park."

Central_Park,ddevarshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Couples,Come here to keep with Joneses (of Jaipur),"This place is not a tourist attraction exactly though there is no harm if a tourist includes in its itinerary. People from distant corners gather here in the morning to show their faces to others and to keep with Joneses.  There may be good walking tracks in their localities but it is a park to meet Who's Who of Jaipur. After being health conscious these people ride their cars of two-wheelers to cover small distance, wait for several minutes for elevators or lifts in their office to climb one or two floors and employ servants to do petty physical works. Pretending to be health conscious and being health conscious and integrating physical work for health consciousness are different ball games and majority of visitors of Central Park seems to have mastered the former."
