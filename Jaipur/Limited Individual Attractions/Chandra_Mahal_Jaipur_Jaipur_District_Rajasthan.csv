Chandra_Mahal,annehA4231CL,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,the palace,We queued for tickets to gain entry and definitely worth it. It is part of the City Palace complex and as you climbed to each level and turned a corner another interesting view appeared. Looking out onto the hurly burly of life in the streets below made it feel all the more special and some beautiful stained glass simmering in the sunshine.
Chandra_Mahal,SalimM,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Maharajas palace,"Another of the attractions in City Palace. There is fantastic inner courtyard where you can see four different gates that represent four different seasons: the Peacock Gate associated with autumn, the Green Gate – with summer, the Leheriya gate with spring and finally the Rose Gate with winter. Each gate is decorated with different kinds of flowers. Apparently, Chandra Mahal is the place where the present Raja of the Jaipur resides therefore you can only visit the ground floor. All other floors are out of bounds."
Chandra_Mahal,Ipek T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Must- seen,This one of the must-seen places in Caipur. Especially the inner doors with the season context were very beautiful 
Chandra_Mahal,Alex Walker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Chandra Mahal,"Situated inside the leviathan City Palace, the Chandra Mahal was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II. The magnificent palace is a seven storied citadel that is home to verdant gardens, marvelous paintings and ornately decorated ceilings. Luxury, beauty and architectural brilliance, Chnadra Mahal is a must visit place for anyone in Jaipur. The ground and the first floor of the palace form the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II museum. Chandra Mahal, at present, is the residence of the current Maharaja of Jaipur."
Chandra_Mahal,John Connell,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,I don’t want to seem mean but...........,"We visited The City Palace Museum paying 700 rupees each . On entering the complex We were surprised to learn that the 700 rupee fee did not get entrance to the Chandra Mahal. This was an additional 3500 for full access or in excess of 50 usd, almost three times the cost of entrance to the stunning Taj Mahal.  So for a family of three it would have cost us more to view this one attraction than the cost of our train journey from Delhi to Agra plus a car journey from Agra to Jaipur. Hard to see how the cost is justifiable."
Chandra_Mahal,divsi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Must visit for Architecture lovers,"Honestly, I thought 3000INR was way too much at the entrance of the City Palace for Chandra Mahal, but once I entered the rooms of this wing, I was stunned. One room is drenched in blue frescos, the other is covered with mirror work, a third comes alive with lamps and their reflections. A must must visit for those who love architecture, Truly worth the price as you have lesser crowds to deal with and have a guide with you through out. The tour is not rushed and you can take you own time.Loved every bit of the tour! "

Chandra_Mahal,Popsicle8,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,City palace was the reason why I went to Jaipur,"Having seen photos from many people going to Jaipur, I thought I had to see this place. I really like this city palace. Willing to pay 2500 INR for entering the palace to see the rooms with guide and I learnt a lot from the guide. The blue room is really nice. Those four gates are beautiful. I didn't disappoint at all. I personally like this place more than Versailles. I went there on mid-April and it's a low season for this place as it's very hot but it's bearable for me. Spent nearly 2 hours inside and the crowd at the gates was almost empty which allowed me to enjoy the place more."
Chandra_Mahal,FLworldwanderer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,Beautiful surroundings ...,"If you are traveling to Jaipur, then you must come to the City Palace, and visit the Chandra Mahal.

Chandra_Mahal,donsaunderson,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Disappointment Plus,"We were presented with options to visit the museum or the private quarters.  The price was very steep 5,000 rupees ($100) for a couple - it was about the same price as tickets to Versailles so thought it would be spectacular - we got to visit just a just a few rooms and yes they were great but some restricted photographs - definitely nothing to compare to a visit to Versailles and a total rip off!    We were expecting much more for the price and left feeling very disappointed."

City palace has got an entry fee which comes with a reduction to students with identity card. Chandra mahal is the official living area of the royal descendants and it is closed to the public. It's a seven storeyed building with lots of architectural excellence in each and everything over there. The entry is allowed to tourists who pay 2500 per person from morning to evening on special permission. We can have nice photographs of this even from outside. Altogether it's a good place to have a visit during your trip to Jaipur

Chandra_Mahal,AnnieAries,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Chandra Mahal is most beautifully and extravagantly decorated,This is an amazing palace - it is huge and so much to see you need to allow plenty of time to visit all of it!  It is beautifully decorated and one of my favourite places is a gate (one of four at Pritam Chowk inside the City Palace) which is exquisitely decorated with several peacocks - it is truly beautiful and shimmers in the sunshine.Take your time to walk around the areas which are open to tourists.  The only part which is closed to the public are the Royal quarters.  There is plenty to see and do.  Make sure you take plenty of water with you when the weather is exceptionally hot.

Chandra_Mahal,ddevarshi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Couples,Out of bounds! Can see it from outside only,"This Palace is still being used by decedents of Royal family of Jaipur as their residence so a visitor cannot see it from inside. One can get to see this palace from many locations of Jaipur such as Jantar Mantar, Hawa Mahal Swargasuli or Isar Lat.  However, best and closest view can be had from City Palace or Maharaja Sawai Mansingh Museum II and Pritam Niwas Chowk of City Palace in particular. It is a 7 storeyed building. Each floor has different names such as Pritam-Niwas, Sukh-Niwas, Ranga-Mandir, Chabi-Niwas, Shri-Niwas and Mukut-Mandir. I have seen pictures of interior of this palace in a coffee table book, which shows that it is extremely beautiful."

Chandra_Mahal,Anujamouli,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015,So grand!,ChandraMahal boasts of some seriously spectacular architecture and for that alone it is totally worth a visit. The sprawling grounds are well maintained and the guides do a good job of keeping you plied with interesting info.This is probably irrelevant but the vendors outside offer some seriously yummy kulfi which goes very well with the overall experience. But then good kulfi works with practically everything!

Chandra_Mahal,KLE2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Residence of the Maharaja of Jaipur,"Part of the City Palace Museum, the Chandra Mahal is the residence of the Maharaja of Jaipur and closed to the public.  The views of this seven storied palace are stunning as each floor is extravagantly decorated.  A blend of Rajput and Mughal styles, the colonnaded base and intricate facade resemble a wedding cake. Walk outside the City Palace and from the north side of the complex one can catch glimpses of a marvelous garden with peacocks roaming the royal grounds."
Chandra_Mahal,farooqguide,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Business,Chandra mahal city palace.,"This beautiful mahal is a part of city palace museum where jaipur royal family members are residing, this mahal is beautifully decorated with the painting from inside, all the wall and ceiling are full of paintings and this part of the palace was built in 1728."

Chandra_Mahal,artmanintoronto,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 • Couples,The Most Expensive Bottle of Pepsi Ever,"$90 for two adults and you get a long walk up an unlit ramp, see three rooms and have a Pepsi. Most of the palace was off limits to tourists, something we found out about half way through the tour. If what you like on your vacation is the feeling of having been ripped off, this is the place for you."
Chandra_Mahal,Jolyon67,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Impressive but private,Chandra Mahal is the largest and most private part of Jaipur's City Palace. Most of it remains off limits to tourists because it is still home to Jaipur's royal family. The towering seven storey building dominates the palace grounds and a flag flying whenever the Maharaja is home. Only a museum in the ground floor is open to the public and its adjoining courtyard. Around the courtyard are four elaborately carved doorways representing the four seasons. The peacock door (Autumn) is the best of all.
