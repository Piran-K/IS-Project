City_Palace_of_Jaipur,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,The palace of the old rulers and the current residence of their descendants.,"The City Palace is still occupied by descendants of the rulers of Jaipur. The palace is not run by the government and thus the prices are rather higher here than for other attractions in Jaipur. The palace has some impressive rooms and buildings. It is worth taking a guide here, as the stories are not obvious to outsiders. The huge silver jugs are said to be the biggest in the world, and were used to transport water from the Ganges for the ruler to drink while on a trip to England. There are painting and cashmere workshops in the building and these have generally good quality items for a reasonable price, however you should not feel pressured into buying anything. Overall, definitely a place worth seeing while in Jaipur."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Trudy W,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Felt ripped off,"I had a terrible experience with my official guide thats why i give it a 1 star as it left me feeling ripped off.The palace it a small area to view but it is opulently beautiful. The inner courtyard has four doors which are lovely. You can only take photos in the courtyards not inside the buildings.My guide cost 400 for an hour. He was very rushed, then just over half an hour he took me to the tourist shop. I did not want to go but he said its part of the tour. In i went expecting exactly what was going to happen. Sat on the stool. Listen to the guy ramble on about pashminas and threading them through a string. Then lighting a thread and having to smell in. Then the hard sell. Buy this buy that. Buy something for your friend. This is the cheapest place in Jaipur. So out of curiosity asked how much the bed sheets were. As it turned out i had bought them much less in Udaipur in the local market. It was a tourist rip off. Came out the store annoyed. My guide was already getting the next customers. Came up asked for the 400. He left straight away off to do the next people. I looked at the time and saw i had not had anywhere near an hour. Went back to the main gate to complain. They checked my ticket and said i had not been taken to the weapon section. They said they could take me but after the tourist shop i was to annoyed and very upset with being ripped off i left. Not good.  Would i advise a guide. if you got my one then No."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,exploredaunexplored,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Solo,Culturally rich,"It seems when the king is in the palace, there are two flags hoisted and when he's out then only one flag. Beware of the artisans selling their art. It's good to see but exorbitant to buy. I got tricked into buying one. The museum a shop has much better stuff. City palace is full of colors. The gates depicting the four seasons - wow! So pretty and intricate work of art. There's a painting gallery as well but you can't take photos. To visit the blue mahal you have to pay extra. "
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Sumesh K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,The Way the roayls are living,"Our first time in Jaipur and part of tour we visited the city place , it is a good place and while understanding the history it is really worth to visit. But they charge INR 3000 to visit inside and top of the city palace , which we feels that it is exorbitently high compare to the similer experances in India. So please be careful on that part while you are visiting this place"
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Woodstag,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Jaipur Royal Palace must visit,"Highly recommend visiting the City Palace where the Royal Family still resides which has wonderful architectural buildings which contain the long history of the royal family dynasty, of ornate clothing, drawings and furniture. Within the grounds there are café and restaurant to enable to enjoy the grounds."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Leigh Hammerton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,City Palace - guided tour,Highly recommended - very well informed and provides a fascinating insight into the history of the royal family and the City Palace - not to be missed while visiting Jaipur. It was a privilege to have Gajendra Hairpura as our guide.
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,123GYPSY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Good place where lots of information,We visited this place as a family with senior citizens and toddler - this place is very good and has information about how the kings led their life and displays their personal belongings too Just a point is that we booked a buggy thinking it will be easier for seniors but that Buggy wasn’t really needed - everything is walkable
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,tarun9369,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Truly Royal,"City palace is in the old jaipur city...it is still resided by the royal family...there is parking available but it is prefered to get there by auto or e rickshaw....City palace, jantar mantar , hawa Mahal , local shopping area are all within walking distance...tickets are rs 300 for Indian adult and rs 150 for Indian student...Again the palace is very big and beautiful architecture....there r various sections and museum...u can also take a guide...approx two hours required...."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,weiwei_sg,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,An amazing peek into the lives of Maharajas,"We took the Royal Tour rather than the normal entry to the courtyards and galleries. The cost of INR 4000 per foreigner/INR 3000 per Indian resident compared to INR750 for the usual entry. The difference was access to the private residence and rooms not opened to the general public. We thoroughly enjoyed the tour and catching a glimpse of how the Rajasthani royalty used to live. The demonstration of the sparkling lights at the Mirror Room, the opulence of the Golden Room, and the artistry of the Blue Room need to be seen to be believed. The guide was also knowledgeable and really added to the visit. It was well worth the cost.Pro Tip: students with documentary proof of student status and children below 12 pay INR 2000."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Romain T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Nothing special there,"Nothing special, after seing agra and Delhi this site feels expensive and not well maintained. I would recommend doing something else instead "
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Wani Zahari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,A must visit place if you’re in Jaipur!,"A must visit place if you’re visiting Jaipur! A beautiful palace that is still quite well preserved. I was there with my family and we bought a private tour package, which also included visits to Jantar Mantar, Amber Fort, and a few other places. Our tour guide Satish was very knowledgeable (and he took really good photos! Highly recommended. Do contact him if you are looking for a tour guide:+91 98293 55664). We went when it was not the school holidays, so the crowd wasn’t that bad. But if you’re visiting during the holidays, I have heard that the palace can be quite crowded, so you may want to plan your visit earlier in the morning."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Anirban Roy Gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,City Palace walk,"What a wonderful place of simple decor yet Royal feeling, MUST take a guide to listen to the rich history. Avoid buying in the shop inside"
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,R Goel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,A must visit place on a Jaipur tour ,"It is a must visit place on a Jaipur tour. Sprawling place. Most of the exhibits display the lavish lifestyle of the kings and their families. The ticket is on the higher side, being a public property.Easy to access, being in the heart of the city..the city grew around it over the years. Many of the attractions such as Jantar Mantar, Hawa Mahal and Govind Dev ji temple are adjacent to our within walking distance of the palace."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,sayon s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Best part of city spots,Nice place to spend time if you like kings and stories. We took a guide but it was same was covered in the text in front of exhibits. There’s plenty to see . Keep time and preferably go early. After 12 it will be like a fair.
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,santosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,Good,"Beautifull place but entry tickets are costly , for one indian it is 300 and for foreigners it is just tripple , it should be affordable for every one ."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Suhas G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Different museums here,"The different museums had Rjasthani textiles and clothes worn by palace inhabitants, jewelry they wore and the armaments they used."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,FlavourSeeker,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,"Not compelling enough, honestly","Went here for a tour. The prices to get in are fairly high (400 for Indians, and 700 for foreigners), and there will be several people asking to be your tour guide, for a fee. In my opinion, this is not really necessary. The city palace is a very nice structure, but it seems that it has been allowed to deteriorate quite a lot, which is really sad to see. The artifacts are interesting as well, and the large silver bowls are impressive. You are not allowed to take photos inside, which is a shame, as the court or ""Darbar"" is photo worthy, but has not been preserved effectively. You are allowed to see some museum pieces, such as outfits worn by the various Maharajas, but there isn't enough in there to be very compelling. The private residence tours, which may have been more interesting are a steep price increase, at 3000 for Indians and 4000 for foreigners! I do not know if that aspect is worth it, as I did not avail of that.All in all, this could potentially be skipped."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,dr. Jijit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,Beware of traffic police ,Need two days to cover almost all if u have idea about wr to go. Beware of traffic police if ur vehicle is from other state  they bribe heavily even if u r upto date.food and stay are good and  average cost.
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Bebe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,A very beautiful palace,"My guide Gajendra Haripura was very informative, nice and very welcoming. Great talker and very friendly."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Anita K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Beautiful Palace,"Jaipur is a Tourist city, right from the driver to the guide everyone will tell you the story of the city and also guide you to the best places to shop.The City Palace is a beautiful palace worth paying the little extra, take a guide and visit the inside portions of the palace. It gives you an idea of how they used to live 300 years ago. The palace is well maintained and the Royalty still live in part of the Palace which is not open to visitors."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,ian m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Another must-see in Jaipur.,The palace and museum are well laid out and everything is explained very well I thought.A tesimony to what a family with both a huge ego and massive wealth does with their money. Witness the huge silver urns made to carry Ganges water all the way to England.
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Sophie U,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,Worst place in Jaipur to visit as a tourist.,"Honestly the worst place to visit in Jaipur. This city has so much to offer and I only went to visit this place because of the reviews. How they were wrong. You pay more than double to visit as a tourist and they won’t even allow you to photograph most of the palace. Why? Because if they did people would realise there’s nothing to see here. Luckily my husband is Indian and can give me a real interpretation. So I’m telling you, do NOT come here. There’s nothing to see. You can pay the same to visit the amber fort or pay nothing to see the streets of Jaipur. But I promise you, the places you cannot photograph, you can only not photograph because there is nothing worth seeing and if the outside world knew this they wouldn’t bother coming. Just like I wish I hadn’t have."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Shwetha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,Special palace,Beautiful palace. The museum reveals a lot of insights into the royal family and their life. Paintings were fascinating. The largest silver pot is placed here for display..The Pritam nivas Is very impressive. Diwane e Aam was ao special. 
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Roney B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Family,Royal tour,Very good palace to visit.. Enjoy Royal city palace tour with us for the best feel. Witness the most beautiful part of City palace.
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,DanWon74,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Nice palace (still in use) with good tour,"Had a very good guide to the palace sharing some background stories. The palace living quarters are closed to public but the tour offers many nice parts that are accessible to public. Impressive silver water tanks, armoury and cloth exhibition at guest house are a must. Much better than Hawa Mahal."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Aparna,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Gorgeous and really interesting,"Didn't quite know what to expect from the City Palace, but it was really stunning. Particularly recommend some of the exhibits - could have spent hours at the art gallery. Do not miss the armoury, not so much for the displays of weapons as  the incredible painted frescos on the ceilings. For 3000 rs per head, you can also go see the residential parts of the palace where the royal family still live ( we didn't bother!). There's what looks like a nice restaurant in the Palace ( didn't try) and restrooms. Well worth the slightly expensive ticket. "
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Noam B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,"Some highlights, but generally speaking - a waste of time and money!","After paying an exaggarated  foreighner's price of 700 Rupees we were first directed by the guards to one of the museum's shops, which made us angry. The Mubarak Mahal has nice architecture, and there is another museum's shop inside. There are some exhibits in the premises, but you are not allowed to take indoors photos despite the price you have paid. 2 costume-dressed guys told us to take photos with them, and then asked for tip, a behaviour that would have been accepted in the streets, but not inside a private palace. The huge silver urns are type of curiosity and the peacock-decorated arches in Pritam Chowk plazza are really impressive. The main palace is closed to regular visitors, but you can see some photos of the family, which not for this we meant to spend our time.Amber fort is much-much nicer. Visit city palace only if you have spare time (and money...)"
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,shwetarose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Wheelchair accessible City Palace Jaipur,"Wheelchair Full Accessible City Palace of Jaipur. Hire guide for sure to know the entire site in detail. Very beautiful, very interesting."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,A_SK,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,"Absolutely must see this gorgeous palace, but we were disappointed!","We were a group of five ladies who went to the beautiful City Palace for a tour. The Royal tour was an additional Rs. 3,000 per person for a ticket but that included a tour of the Royal quarters with the beautiful Lalique dining table that a few of us had seen before. Upon going in, while we did see the gorgeous Sheesh Mahal and  Neel Mahal (with our amazing personal guide we had taken there) we were told that since the Maharaja is at home we can’t see the other floors (including the dining room). We were all most disappointed. The Royal Grandeur tickets were not worth it at all. Overall, of-course the palace is a must see but either the tourist needs to be informed that the tour isn’t possible or price the tickets accordingly. Certainly not buy the tickets and then feel short changed."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Stefan,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Not worth it,"Underwelming, overpriced, bad tour guide, unstructured, bad presentation of the few interesting objects and pictures not allowed anywhere inside."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Texas2Wanderers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Great Experience,"A complex of courtyards, gardens and buildings, the impressive City Palace is right in the centre of the Old City. The outer wall was built by Jai Singh, but within it the palace has been enlarged and adapted over the centuries. There are palace buildings from different eras, some dating from the early 20th century. Despite the gradual development, the whole is a striking blend of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Savita kumari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,Great architecture,The architecture of the city palace is beautiful. A part of the palace has been converted into a private museum by the royals. The entrance fee is exorbitant but the collection inside is unique

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,VidPamsKris,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,"Great monument, let down by govt","City palace entry ticket costs INR 300 per person amd is the most expensive entry fee for any Jaipur sight seeing location....and at that price, the facilities provided by the govt are dismal. There is no description anywhere, so you are at the mercy of a guide not knowing whether he is giving you the correct information or not. The museums have great collection of arms/paintings but there are no facilities for the visitors - No AC, rickety noisy fans that wont let you hear anything that guide is saying....no description anywhere...and lousy guards glued to the mobiles. Its clearly overpriced for what you get and not worth it at all."

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,vivek0210,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Friends,"The City Palace, Jaipur","The City Palace is one of the must visit places in Jaipur. The entrance costs about Rs200. The other option is to  pay Rs.3000 to see the luxury and grandeur of the  private rooms of the palace.  The royal families in Rajasthan lived a very lavish and indulgent life surrounded by beauty, art, traditions and aesthetics. Every room, corridor, garden has a story. Always hire a guide while visiting any palaces in Jaipur. "
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,kevin g,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Solo,Outrageously expensive,Way too expensive for foreign tourists.  $60USD for the palace and museum.  Hawkers everywhere and no photographs.  Save your time and money and see something else.

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,froufroutravelling,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,WHO CAN AFFORD IT?,"We were really disappointed. The museum includes some interesting displays, the courtyard and one nice interior hall for the VERY EXPENSIVE price of 700 rupees. But, to see any of the more opulent interiors, you have to pay the SHOKING amount of 3500 rupees !!!!!!!!! For a couple that would be 7.000 rupees !!!!!! We did not enter in the Palace, just the museum, and instead browsed through the photos in the internet."

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Annapurna Nikam,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 • Couples,People are on tip of their toes to make you spend money on useless stuff by quoting art,"The place available for public viewing, which has entry fee of rs 200, is useless. The place very badly maintainedYou need to pay rs 3000 for visiting sheesh mahal with guide. It’s worth taking photos thereThen the guide forces you to the shopping centres inside the palace where they show you pashmina shawls and some Rajasthani dresses. These are of such low quality and the people here are looting the tourists like anything in the name of royal family trust. The price are 3 to 4 times higher and you can easy tell that from the quality of material.The people in Rajasthan are noted for making business, which is a known fact and are also noted for taking advantage of tourists and looting themes selling poor stuff. This is evident thought out the state.The Bandhu I sarees that you see in any city of Rajasthan have much better quality and are available in lesser price."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,George W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 • Solo,A must stop while in Jaipur,"No trip to Jaipur is complete without a stop at one of its beautiful palaces, and my trip to City Palace was absolutely fantastic. Because of my tight travel schedule I didn’t have an entire day to spend exploring the palace and it’s rich history, but luckily my guide, Gajendra Haripura, was amazing and efficiently used all my allotted time to teach me about the history of the buildings, it’s royal family and we still had time to do some shopping in the artisans area and he was kind enough to be my Instagram photographer for some truly great photographs."

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,ShyamKasturi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,One of the finest must visit places in Jaipur,This is one of the major attractions of Jaipur.

I took the royal tour out of curiosity and had a guided tour of the golden room and the blue room among other things.

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,JayeshLC,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Skip the Visit,"If you are interested in just seeing the old clothes and armory used by the Kings you can visit the Palace as it has not much history. There not much photo options here as inside the palace premises in the various rooms photography is not allowed. Also there are life size paintings of all the kings displayed in meeting room but again no photography. Guides are available, but you can bargain and in current situation a guide can be available for INR 100 and show you the palace in an hour."

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Gaurav M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Couples,Pashmina & Jaipuri Rajai Fraud at Sovinour Shops ,We went there in Jan 2021 & our guide took us to this Sovinour Shop inside the city palace. They sell Jaipuri rajai & pashmina shawl stating that its made at Maharaj's factory itself & its a factory outlet. They started with 5000 but we were not interested then they gave us 25% discount stating that its due to covid. We bought Rajai & Shawl at 3300/- each. But these are definitely not worth the claims made by the shopkeeper. DO NOT BUY THESE.  If you really want to buy try reaching some of the real factories which are many in Jaipur. Buy from them directly.

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Repertoire Events & Mice Pvt Ltd,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Family,The Royal Adobe of His Highness of Jaipur,"The most amazing fact about this place is the Royal His Highness still resides here. You can book a room for an experience through air bnb. If I am not wrong it’s 10k USD a night. It has four quarters and huge vessels of silver in which Maharaja of Jaipur once took Ganga jal with him while he used to travel to foreign countries through ships. The palace cafe is a must visit. See the interior work, good silver ornaments, old clothing and fashion. Hire a guide it will be worth. "

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Rajat,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Good place,"If you hire don't hire a guide, you can complete the visit in about 15 minutes but there are just a few information displays , so hiring a guide here would be wise as then you would understand what all is shown in the museum part or the palace complex..The tickets can be booked at the entry gate for the palace, and they are providing plastic handgloves  to every visitor due to Covid, with sanitizer dispensers scattered inside the area"
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Arnab_phenomenon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020 • Friends,Beautiful Palace,"The City Palace was set up by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh the Second, around the same time he shifted  his residence & court from Amber to Jaipur. Jai Singh the Second is regarded as the founder of Jaipur. Until 1949 the City Palace was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur. The Palace has beautiful attractions like the beautifully ornate gates, especially the Peacock gate, the arms & armoury gallery, the hall of audience, the Sabha Nivas & the silver urn that contained holy Gangajal. This one's a must-see for anyone visiting Jaipur "

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Exploration276081,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,EXPENSIVE PLACE WITH LESS EXHIBITION,For the price which they charge from the tourists is exhorbitant and not  value for money. A good collection of royal treasures but poor exhibition needs to be revamped. For the amount of tickets they should an art gallery to exhibit the best collection of original paintings of jaipur and moughal paitings. THE SILEH KHANA IS CLOSED PLACE AND VERY VERY HOT TO VISIT.tHIS COLLECTION ON GROUND FLOOR.

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Jeana,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,A Very beautiful Palace,There was a group of middle age children dancing & singing on an outdoor stage when we 1st went in. They had a lot of chairs set up outside & we right away found a seat in the front. A boy played a guitar  & they had a keyboard off to the side. It was an enjoyable dancing  performance. Then we explored the beautiful palace. There were some ladies doing henna for a reasonable charge & we had our hands done in very pretty patterns that we both got to choose. We walked up to the top & the view was spectacular. I highly recommend seeing the palace. 
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Meander With Mer,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,"It's Ok, but I think we just tried to squeeze too much in and we didn't enjoy it.","I have been just palace, temple or building'd out by the time we stopped here on my tour, but I could have skipped it.  That also played into our decision to just do the ""composite"" tour.  While we enjoyed our brief visit there it just wasn't really what we were in the mood for by the time we got there.IF this is something you really want to see make sure you plan your day of sightseeing so you're not too tired like we were. I can understand why others really enjoyed their time there."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Rajas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Great,One of the best museum I have ever seen in my life. What a collection of guns & swords they have. This is residence of Jaipur king also
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Prabhanshu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Amazing Place,"We loved this place - great museums in the old palace rooms of arms, costumes and more. Huge silver urns for the water the Maharajah took to England with him - didn't trust foreign water! Lovely ornate doors. Huge durbar hall where the Mountbattens were enthroned. Fascinating place."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Gl0balCitizen2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,A great place to visit in Jaipur,"The City Palace of Jaipur is beautiful inside. It's Rajasthani architecture is all around to see and there are several museums one can visit. The textiles and garments that the kings and queens of Jaipur wore are quite interesting. There are also two gigantic silver containers that the Maharaja used to carry the holy water of the Ganga , all the way to the UK on his visits. It is a bit of a tourist trap and you will be pestered by guides. The little food kiosk had overpriced things and they didn't look appetising at all. The shop assistants are a bit on the rude side (read nice to foreigners whom they can fleece, than to the natives). At least you can take some very good selfies inside. We did the ordinary tour and not the more expensive Palace tour, where you can see the living quarters of the current Maharaja. I don't believe we missed out much, since I don't think that the special tour is value for money."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Anjan Sengupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Tour Plus Shopping,The City Palace in Jaipur is an exciting place to spend a couple of hours watching some of the historic artifacts and buy some authentic pieces of handicraft and fabric. It is very important to get a good guide in order to understand everything. One can even get inside the living quarters of the Royal Family by paying more.
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Smokey128,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,Magnificent Architecture and frescos ,"Loved this Building from the minute you enter through the Tripolia Gate, walking through a small variety of shops and then through the beautiful Virendra Pol flanked by carved elephants you come across the arched and colonnaded Murbarak Mahal which houses a lovely display of clothing worn by Royalty of the Mogul era. Stop of a lovely lunch in the shade of parasols at the newly opened Palace Cafe. Wonder around the hall where beautiful paintings are sold and then back through Virendra Pol to see the beautiful pink and white open courtyard displaying two huge silver urns. At the rear of the palace is another large courtyard where the ladies used to dance and this is flanked by four magnificent gates representing the season’s. Behind this courtyard you can see the Chandra Mahal where the Royal Family still live "

City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Karen P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,So many beautiful doorways to admire with elegant staff to give information,I loved slowly wandering around the rooms and alleyways of this palace complex but I found the cost of entering the palace itself a little steep. Happy to just view the architecture surrounding it.
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,Skeney57,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Interesting Complex,Some great buildings and continuing the pink theme this Palace has thankfully been retained and is a pleasant way to spend an hour or two exploring. Again no cameras in the main meeting hall but very interesting. Beware taking photos of the guards as they demand rupees afterwards ! I had nothing on me I'm afraid except Visa !
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,MWandAW,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A Palace in the city,"Research shows that the City Palace of Jaipur was established at the same time as the city of Jaipur, by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who moved his court to Jaipur from Amber, in 1727. Until 1949, the City Palace was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur. The Palace was also the location of religious and cultural events, as well as a patron of arts, commerce, and industry. It now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, and continues to be the home of the Jaipur royal family.  My wife and I continue on our 3 week luxury tour of India by visiting this beautiful palace.  The time limited tour with a local guide included mainly external areas, with a few internal rooms and corridors.  We visited  late in the afternoon and many of the exhibitions were closing.  A nice museum, if you have the time to see the Hall of Audience, the Textile gallery, the Arms and Amour gallery,  the Painting and Photographic gallery and the Transport gallery."
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,R1chardN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Another magnificent Palace,The magnificent City Palace is near the centre of Jaipur and dates back to the 18th century.  The Palace is still lived in - the living quarters are sealed off.The Palace is beautifully decorated and houses an exquisite textile museum and displays of armoury and art exhibits.  It is a large Palace with many buildings and with the help of the pictures it is possible to imagine the pomp and pageantry of the life of the ruling classes.There is also a gallery where local artist are working and will create some bespoke art for you or you can but one they 'made earlier'.This is an essential visit for anyone touring Jaipur.
City_Palace_of_Jaipur,DP1066,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,An interesting collection of textiles and arms,"Right in the centre of the old city, the palace complex now houses two museums with a collection of costumes and textiles and arms. The guards in traditional dress are more than happy to be photographed for a small consideration (INR100).  At the end of the tour one of the guards showed us how to put on a turban."
