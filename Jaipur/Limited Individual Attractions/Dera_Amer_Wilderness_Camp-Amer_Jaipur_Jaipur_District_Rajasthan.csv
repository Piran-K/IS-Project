Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,andrewcW6133OZ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,A thoroughly memorable experience: very highly recommended!,An outstanding and natural experience with elephants. Anirudh was a lovely host at this beautiful elephant sanctuary. He took us on a walk with Laxmi (a 49yr old female elephant) and we fed her bananas and sugar cane.
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Jerry Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Beautiful creatures ,Great experience up close and personal with the elephants. Very friendly service and very friendly animals! A little of a rough road getting there but we'll worth it! 
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Anita M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Good value and good use of time in Japipur!,"My family visited Dera Amer in March 2019 to have an elephant experience in India. The site is in what seems like a very dry, somewhat remote location. I think it would be hard to find without a driver. When we arrived the elephants were friendly, relaxed and seemed well cared for. The staff led by Bharat Singh were all friendly  and the post-walk lunch was one of the best during our two weeks in India!  Our girls got to watch wild peacocks hovering around the outdoor tandoori oven. We learned about how difficult it is for elephants to bear the weight of passengers (Amer Fort) and how the family at Dera Amer were trying to help the elephants. We did not spend the night or have dinner, but we did get to paint one of the elephant's trunks which was a lot of fun! The paint was washed off afterwards. Our teenage girls enjoyed this nice afternoon. Good value and good use of time in Japipur!"

During our stay we fed them, bathed them, and had breakfast with them.  We've stayed in Glamping tents all around the world and these are top notch!  We can't direct you to our video review on YouTube but, we are DOUGandNIKI and I think you can figure out how to find us.  It's worth seeing...the whole thing is amazing!"
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,DougOnTheRoad67,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,An oasis of safety and kindness,"There were 7 of us on a six week journey through India and this was a highlight for us.  Talking with the family and staff who take care of the three elephants currently living there, we realized that all of them are heartfelt stewards of the land, the elephants and all the natural surroundings.  Off the beaten track, this is an oasis not to be missed!"
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Kristine English,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Owners are simply wonderfully kind,I'll never forget walking onto the compound just to be greeted by an elephant. And then spending the afternoon walking trails with her. The owner and his nephew truly know how special it all is.
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Gill P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,"Amazing elephants, wonderful lunch!","We visited this remarkable place during a Golden Triangle Tour in early March. We were greeted at the gates by the owners nephew and a most beautiful elephant. We fed her bananas, which she loved and were offered a refreshing drink before taking a walk with them through the scrubland, We took the shorter walk offered as it was quite hot. During our walk we learned about Dera Amer and the animals that live there.After our walk we gave her some alfalfa which she obviously loves, then we were taken to a shaded dining area for a most delicious lunch, where home grown veggies were used in the dishes. There were just the two of us there and we felt thoroughly pampered by the staff and enjoyed the wonderful spread that had been laid on for us. We were able to spend more time with the beautiful elephants in their shady area before we left and it was an experience I will never forget. All the animals look well fed and very contented and this place is a credit to the owners."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,feelaird,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Clamping Indian style ,Loved glamping overnight in the beautiful tents and spending quality time with the rescue elephants as they strolled around. There is no riding elephants which is terrific as it causes these peaceful giants great issues with their backs. The drinks at sunset were wonderful followed by dinner and a camp fire to sit around. Lovely after some hectic weeks in India. Only stay 1 night as there is not a lot to do apart from read and relax.....
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,mimnev,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,"A magical, unmissable experience","I’ve been in two minds about writing this - my first ever review on TripAdvisor.  I would like to jealously guard this amazing place to ensure we can get in on our inevitable return to Rajasthan but sometimes a place is so special you have to share it and this is such a place.  We stayed for two nights at Dera Amer and whilst you can visit for a day (it’s a short distance outside of Jaipur) I really recommend that you stay at least one night in their beautifully appointed and luxurious tented camps. The levels of service and attention to detail are unparalleled.  We were greeted by Ripudaman who looked after us for the duration of our stay and made sure our every wish was catered for. He took us on a tour of the local area and gave us a real understanding of life and the history of the rural hamlet.  We were assigned our own personal elephant - the beautiful Rangmala - for the duration of our stay.  She joined us every morning for breakfast and we took her for walks, bathed and  fed her.  We felt very bonded to her by the end of our stay and were so sad to say goodbye.  All the elephants are very well looked after and obviously happy, having been rescued from a life of hard work as tourist attractions in Jaipur - they are the lucky ones! We were the only people staying in our camp with four amazing staff looking after us -  this is something they try to ensure for all guests so the experience is very personalised.  The food was delicious - honestly the best we’ve had in India to date.  Locally grown on the owners farm, organic, beautifully prepared and lots to choose from.  The whole enterprise is very ecological - no plastic to be found anywhere.  Our stay at Dera Amer has been the highlight of our trip.  We are already planning a return visit with our children.  If you like elephants and you have the chance to go and stay - grab it!  You can thank me later."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,HuntleyNewYork,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Another world just a short distance from Jaipur,"I don’t understand some of the reviews here. The elephants are clearly well cared for, friendly, gentle, and always eager for a snack. And there are no elephant rides, a compassionate responsible decision. The only one who rides is the elephant care giver as you take a walk through the property, so the elephant can gently be guided to walk with you. It’s an arid place, with native plants I’d never seen before, many peacocks that do a fantastic job of hiding in the scrub, and even a few camels, dogs & cows. If you’re an animal lover it’s impossible not to enjoy the encounters you’ll find here. "
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Matthew D.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Food for your Animal-Loving Soul!!,"We felt utterly transported to another place the moment we arrived to Dera Amer and immediately fed the elephants we encountered with 4 bananas.Then off on a leisurely stroll with Bharat through the winding pathways of the surrounding grounds along with a conversation about how his family and the staff care for the elephants, their age and different histories, and an overview of the other animals they're taking care of - like stray dogs and camels.After spending two days in Jaipur seeing these animals in the streets and/or for rides in varied degrees of suffering, it made myself and my wife quite happy to see them cared for in such a holistic way.When the walk ended, we sat in a type of veranda overlooking the entire property and drank incredibly good coffee, tea, and some cookies on the house.  Exceeded our expectations and my gosh we could've stayed there forever.  Worth the cost and we'll definitely come back the next time we're in Jaipur!"
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Mildred2011,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Excellent work in a peaceful setting ,Went for lunch and a visit to this wonderful elephant sanctuary - a very short drive from Jaipur but a world away from the bustleOn arrival the welcome is warm and relaxed coffee on the terrace overlooking the nature reserve while the owner explains how he has taken part of a former farm back to nature. The elephants are all rescued from prior commercial / domestic useA short walk with an elephant leads to lunch in a secluded part of the reserve. Some of the best vegetarian dishes we have had supplied from their own organic gardenAbsolutely a must if you are in Jaipur

Unless you have small children who really want to feed a banana to a sad looking elephant, don’t waste your time or money here. The walk with the glib, arrogant guide is tedious, you’ll learn nothing from your stroll past the adjacent hamlet, and the meal is lousy. We felt stuck and couldn't wait to get out of there."

I also met one of the six dromedaries: Jimmi, very nice! Then they offered me an excellent aperitif in front of the fire followed by a buffet dinner, excellent service and impeccable quality of the food. Surely one of the most beautiful experiences of my trip in India!"
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,919annabelh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,An amazing experience ,"We absolutely loved our experience with this camp.  We arrived in the afternoon and were introduced to our elephant and her two sisters, fed them some bananas, and went for a nice walk with her and her mahout.  These are captive born elephants rescued to the camp and their mahouts are like a parent to them.  There is no riding or painting, just a nice walk with a big ol’ elephant.  After, we had a great dinner by the fire and watched the sunset while listening to the elephants settle in for the night.  We did not stay the evening but their glamping set up looks great.  The staff is great, very accommodating, friendly, and knowledgeable.  "
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,H W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,A Peaceful Haven for these Gentle Giants,"Found out about ""Dera Amer"" on a web search.  Contacted them for a daily visit, did not stay at the tented camp.  In case they don't reply immediately, remember to insist.                     We were picked up from our hotel in Jaipur on time, taken to Dera Amer.  Greeted by the staff and had our first interaction with our elephant, Rangmala!  We fed Rangmala some fruits and gave her a quick bath.  Mahout was the only one riding her and we had a walk within the estate, accompanied by Anirudh.  Who was answering all our questions, while given us the grand tour.It was an amazing experience altogether!  Elephants were well taken care of.  No drawing, no riding.  Interaction was welcome by all means.  The premises were well preserved, the service was beautiful (from elephants, to personnel and location and lunch).  Felt so connected with the elephant and nature.  A tranquil get away from the city.We also had a look at the tents, and it worths spending the night (please note the rate is high).Bharat, such a gentleman, said goodbye on our exit.  Driver transferred us back to our hotel.  Totally recommended!"
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,JohnandAl,,,,We went to this wonderful elephant sanctuary yesterday and had an amazing time. The 3 rescued elephants are so well looked after it was fantastic to spend time with them and then walk with one and her keeper.The lunch afterwards was delicious and there was lots of wildlife to sit and observe while eating.This is so worth a visit and not far out of Jaipur.
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,beadfreak,,,,"We booked two nights here and we were glad we did as I feel we would have missed out on the total relaxation if we spent only one night. If you are not nature lovers or outdoor people one night however would be sufficient. From the moment we arrived we were looked after and waited on hand and foot. The tents are beautifully appointed with piping hot water. Each camp area comes with what I can only describe as your private 'tent butler'! There are only two camp areas with four tents in each however if one tent is booked they will not let out the rest so you have total privacy. Although a bit on the pricey side this place is worth it. All drinks and food and snacks are included in the price including alcohol. Beautiful chilled wine was served at our camp area when we arrived. Dinner starts with sundowner drinks, then a fire pit and then onto dinner either at your private camp area or another location. The buffet dinner was excellent with the best naan fresh and hot from the tandoor sandlots of choice. They also offered 'western food' if we wanted it but we declined.The animals were great entertainment for the kids who could go and visit the elephants any time they wished. Elephant came the first breakfast time and had a good bath (be careful of the side spray when she shoots it out of her trunk!). Camel cart ride is short but entertaining and we enjoyed the jeep tour of the area. It is cold at night so come prepared with a jumper/shawl/jacket. The hot water bottles placed in our bed when we got back from dinner were very welcome!!"
,,,,,"Dera Amer Safari is a 1 hour drive from Jaipur city. Our driver took us down some dirt roads to then arrive at Dera Amer. We were greeted by the nephew of the owner (forgot his name) who was very welcoming.  We then met one of the 3 elephants 🐘 they have on their reserve and we were allowed to feed her. We then went on a 20 minute walk with her and it was awesome! After the walk, we were seated by a camp fire and enjoyed a drink then a full buffet dinner. There was another couple with us and we had a great night with them. This 180 acre property is sustainable, by making their own vegetables and they have the animals best interests at heart. Apart from the 3 elephants they had 6 camels, some friendly dogs and at night some leopards! We thoroughly enjoyed our time here."
,,,,,"I went here with a textile group from the UK, it is worth the beautiful experience to see how they are happy and well looked after. The lunch was delicious. The only complaint I have is the Kingfisher beer was a total ripoff at INR600 per bottle."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,stenquist1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Eden for elephants and people near Jaipur,"Eden for elephants and people near Jaipur.  We arrived before nightfall and were greeted at the gate by Bharat Singh and company.  The company included a pair of grounds keepers and a beautiful female elephant, Laxmi, who is approx. 40 years old.  Bharat led us I a walk around the property, Laxmi, bringing up the rear. We heard the the night before a leopard was spotted in a hill, but we were not so lucky.The elephants all seem to be treated well.  They are rescued from circuses, private zoos, elephant ride parks, etc.  and apparently are too civilized to survive on their own if set free.  BTW These Indian elephants do not have enormous tusks, so they are not targets for ivory harvesting.  The dinner was a home cooked meal by the on staff chef and was wonderful.  One of the best Indian dinners we had in india."

Beautiful property, in stunning countryside where leopards had been spotted the week before!  The family who own the lodge have 4 elephants and 2 camels, treated really well - no riding, rather my son was invited to feed and water.  We were treated to well - invited for breakfast and to explore the countryside and animals.  The tented accommodation runs October to March, we visited mid-April when the weather is too hot at 40+ degrees, though a couple of families were there for lunch and to ride the camels, feed the elephants - for this booking is essential. Thank you so much."

Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,flgirlmd,,,,Not to be missed if you like elephants.  We were lucky enough to be there during a camel polo competition too - just for fun with a wedding party.  All staff were so welcoming and the four elephants at the camp were well cared for and highly valued.  It’s a proper chance to get to know more about these beautiful animals whilst being close and personal.  We didn’t ride Sonia but just walked with her for about half an hour.  We also had refreshments and enjoyed the whole facility which was immaculately clean and beautiful.  Thank you for our visit.  We will remember it always.
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,udaijit s,,,,"This was probably the high spot of our trip to Rajasthan.  My husband and I were travelling with our adult son and had been discussing the rights and wrongs of riding elephants.  It was fantastic to find elephants living as they do at Dera Amer.  Laxmi and her two companions have the freedom to roam the farm and are obviously very well looked after and never called upon to be ridden.  Their only obligation appears to be to  make themselves available to greet visitors if and when they arrive.  We were the only ones there when we called in.  After meeting Laxmi and feeding her bananas we were served a delicious lunch in heavenly surroundings and watched peahens and peachicks, cows and a mongoose strolling nearby plus a host of birds we were unable to identify.  The staff were putting out chairs ready for a polo demonstration later in the afternoon which would have been wonderful to watch had we had time. The staff were charming and helpful."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Sanjay1972,,,,"wonderful elephant camp where they truly care for and love the animals ... they were very thoughtful in regards to their elephants’ safety and health and limited our group to 10 minute bareback rides with the mahout in charge.  afterwards relaxed by the fire with live indian folk-music, cocktails, and a full rajasthani dinner.  highly recommend this very ethical camp."

We did the elephant ride which was quite uncomfortable for my husband as he is a lot heavier than me he had to move into middle to get balanced up, I’ve since learnt that it is not a good thing for the elephant to carry people in the howdah as their skeleton are not made for it.I understand this attraction has saved this elephant from heavy work in the city, but perhaps you could walk with the elephant and the mahoot instead?The food was very good and the staff very attentive but as we were on our own it was missing a bit of atmosphere."

I thought that we would be able to wash and  paint the elephants due to other reviews I had read on Trip Advisor.  They no longer provide this opportunity.  However, we were the only guests, and asked if we could paint the elephant, so we were allowed to do it. Our elephant enjoyed the attention, and curled her trunk playfully.  We hugged and petted her. That was amazing. Dinner was excellent and the experience was worth it.We also appreciated that the mahoot does not use a metal pick to guide the elephant (which they did in Thailand)."

So peaceful. Would really recommend a visit."
,,,,,"We were taken here on our way back from the Amber Fort. It is out in the country away from hectic city, and is very quiet and peaceful I had heard bad tales about how the elephants were exploited in India, but here they definitely seemed to care for them very well indeed. We did have a ride on one through the nearby countryside for about 30 minutes which was very enjoyable. The Mahoot who took us was very smiley during the trip but really turned his nose up at the tip we gave him - which was a bit off putting. We were served with a lovely lunch outside under a Gazebo, excellent service and lovely food. I would definitely recommend a trip here as it was a little bit of sanity in a very hectic schedule."

The Dera Amer owner said that in winter the elephants don't get a bath or play in water because its too cold and so its not good for their health. I'm glad they look out for the elephants. We enjoyed hugs, petting, brushing, painting, feeding sugar cane and banana to our elephant. They didn't give us a time limit. It was calm and I loved that there was no rush. We didn't eat there but it looked like it was to the standard of a 5 star hotel. I see some new companies trying to compete. They seem to have less baggage atop the elephant's back. Ours had their saddles on the whole time. I wish maybe they were bare for the elephant's sake. They say they don't mind? This place also offers elephant polo so I'm not sure how much the elephants love that."

We spotted peacocks on the way. The camp fire experience was amazing, it was nice to be away from traffic n noise and be one with the nature. The food was fresh and they used local ingredients. However I found it a little bland for Indian taste. Overall an amazing experience. "
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Safariholic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,"Our tour agency reccomend us this adventure, no regrets! It was my first time riding the elephant I was very excited! ","We did not want to go to one of the elephant places which uses their elephants at the Amber Fort for the controversial rides so asked at our hotel - the Royal Heritage Haveli - for a recommendation for a place where the elephants were properly looked after.  So far as we could judge this was such a place.  It only has two elephants at the moment, females in their thirties rescued from circus life.  However in addition to looking after these elephants, and a camel, the place tries to educate local elephant owners about  feeding, medical treatment and other care. They were fully appreciative of the fact that we did not want to paint or ride the elephants.  They told us they did not really approve of the painting but many visitors expected to be able to do it and it did not harm the elephants. They are careful about when they wash the elephants or let them bathe and although they can be ridden, it is only in howdahs which are much lighter than normal and which only accommodate two people at a time. I note what has been said about the riding and painting in some reviews but suggest that it is easy to criticise when you are not having to make hard choices about how to raise funds for good work - if you are too purist you will fail altogether; some compromise which does not undermine your main objectives may be necessary."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,udaijit s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Amazing experience,"Miles of dire drive to get here, feed the poor thing, go for a walk with it (I refused to ride), had dinner (nice but nothing wow) outside in the bush beside a firepit that fed us a steady stream of smoke/soot, covered with blankets, since it was freezing, and then endured a late night return to the City.Not what was expected or explained to us as being the nature of this Activity.In summary - a complete waste of time.If the idea is that this place caters for and is in-effect a Retirement Home for Elephants rescued from a life-of-servitude giving people rides or whatever - fine. In fact good.But offering rides to the Visitors on those self-same Elephants doesn't quite work  for me and I would rather see them UNshackled & Unridden. Their days of being a Beast-of-Burden are over, surely."

Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,pollockwise,,,,"I visited Dera Amer with two more friends at the end of October and I would do it again. The visit started by warm smiles of Dera Amer staff members, who encouraged us to feed our elephants and introduced us to them, followed by 30min ride. I can't describe the feeling of touching an elephant or looking in to the eyes of the elephant and noticing the state of bliss while chewing on a sugar cane. At least I felt as joyful as a child. During the ride the man ""riding"" our lovely elephant Lakshmi as much as he could would be pointing out to us local flora & fauna and would try to answer our questions. Not for a single moment during the ride I felt unsafe or ""taken on ride as a bunch of tourists"". The whole experience was with much of respect towards nature, elephants and us as guests. At the end of our morning ride we had fresh lime soda sitting on the terrace and watching peacocks and elephants. I did not want to leave the peaceful and beautiful place."

Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,chaitanyam19,,,,I went to this safari expecting to see “elephants as close the their natural habitat”.  Yet when I arrived the elephant had a saddle on its back and a man sitting on its head with a stick poking him.  There is nothing natural about this.  This sight made me extremely upset and has to be stopped.  Please let the elephant enjoy their life and stop this unnecessary cruelty.I really wish I had not gone.

You were the only guest with us that evening I was personally there to take care of you.if you had mentioned it to us we would have clarified on the spot.

The stick  is used only to direct the elephant by lightly touching the elephant,we do not poke the elephant or hit her,these elephants have been a part of our family where we have adopted them from the city just like the cows,camels,abandoned dogs.

the ANIMAL WELFARE BOARD which is constituted by wildlife experts and several animal welfare bodies has specified the saddle with 4 persons seating as a regulated weight for an elephant to carry however we have special light saddles and never seat more than 2 persons on an elephant.

The elephants are part of our family and have been rescued from the city where they were used mercilessly controlled by hooks and a torturous life.

Wish you had spoken to me and we would clarified the whole matter,we love our animals and are fully ethical in our conduct.

if the project was just about profits we would have converted our large farm into a real estate development enterprise and lived in luxury however for us the rescued elephants which are part of our family,the wilderness and farming as well as sustaining majority of the rural village by employment and other means is far more important.

India was hot, humid, and the days could be tough outside for too many hours. But the evenings were lovely and for sure the best evening our 15 day trip was spent at Dera Amer.  We are a family of 3 with a 14 yr old daughter.  We were the only guests and were treated like royalty!  My daughter had the experience of a lifetime painting the trunks and feeding these beautiful animals.  The ride was so peaceful and meditative.  We loved seeing the peacocks in the trees, listening to nature, ambling along the road. The champagne would have been a lot easier to drink through a straw, but having the glass was an added nicety.  And the food for dinner - AMAZING!!  Some of the best we had anywhere!  We absolutely loved this part of trip and were so impressed with the staff and everything about the experience."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Jerrold L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017,Every visitor to Jaipur should visit Dera Amer,"Our travel agent arranged the evening at Dera Amer for us so off we went (we never asked the price of the evening, but it didn't really matter because the experience should not be missed at any cost. About 30-40 minutes out of Jaipur, we bumped along this unpaved road until a clearing with a small open gate. Waiting for us was Mara the 27 year old elephant and Mahoot, her caretaker and driver. We were greeted by staff for a quick welcome drink and then joined more staff inside the compound where we were introduced to Mara and told about her history. The team was led by a most personable manager who was superb. Since it was quite hot, they asked if we would join them and wash down Mara's legs and feet with water and a scrub brush which we both did. Then came the chance to give Mara a drink. Holding the largest garden hose I have ever seen, we poured water into the end of Mara's trunk, and poured, and poured and poured. Finally, she lifted her head and directed her trunk into her mouth, squirting her entire reserve of water in her trunk into her mouth. She quickly placed her trunk in the trough once again and repeated the filling it and emptying it into her mouth. Then came the facepainting. One of the caregivers helped us by outlining a lotus leaf on Mara's snout and let us color it in and add other features to the design. Of course this was watercolor pain that was harmless to Mara. Nothing at this camp is incompatible with the elephants' best care. We washed up now, and then climbed a short staircase to mount Mara's back while she meandered along a trail on the property for 45 minutes. That was a lot of fun, and were surprised to pass a herd of black face monkeys and peacocks as we meandered around the property. We stopped part way and enjoyed a delicious glass of wine, although drinking the wine without spilling while Mara bumped along was quite the feat! We learned that Mahout's family lives 750 km away and returns home infrequently. He has been an elephant caregiver and driver for more than 2 decades and he certainly treats his elephant as if it were his child. With the ride over, we sat down for appetizers, drinks and quiet company. A toothsome dinner followed. We had our choices of vegetarian or meat meal, an excellent bbq buffet with a huge selection of grilled foods. We watched a naan bread making demonstration in the red hot barbecue, which was fascinating. This was definitely not a rushed dinner or evening but as the hour got late, we organized our driver to take us back to the Rambaugh Palace. Before we left, we thanked everyone for this wonderfully loving experience, tipped the whole team, and left a special tip for Mahout, Mara's elephant whisperer.The goal of this camp is to rescue elephants, mostly from the city and give them a place to enjoy life and mature. There are currently 3 elephants at the camp but we understand their goal is to acquire 7 in total. These Asian elephants, smaller than their African cousins, are pampered and well-looked cared for at the camp. As our evening at the camp drew to an end, we were quite heartened that both the camp owners and their employees had a love for the elephants that was measured in everyone's actions, with goals to keep the elephants happy and healthy, working only in the cooler part of the day. Mara was retired for the evening as we wrapped up our dinner with delicious ice cream and so did we, having rekindled our love of elephants and their majestic beauty. Respect and love between the elephants and their caregivers makes for a most healthy relationship in which anyone, man or beast, would be happy to indulge. We urge everyone who reaches Jaipur with an evening to spare, to call and book an evening at Dera Amer. You will definitely be impressed with the experience you have with nature's largest animal, the elephant and the dedicated caregivers who take wonderful care of the elephants. ."

It was a glorious experience from beginning to end. We had a comfortable ride from our hotel in Jaipur, a wonderful experience with the elephant Laxmi, the honorary matriarch of the pack. Our hosts were humble and gracious. The food was authentic and tasty. If your budget allows this is a fine experience. To top it off, not one request for a trip advisor review or tip!!!!!!!!

Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,knoesenm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,Loving home to the gentle giants,"I love India for how animals, big and small, co-exist with humans. Dera Amer is home to a handful of working Asian Elephants. My friend for the day was a beautiful, kind lady elephant named Ramballa. I got to scrub her trunk to her pure delight, painted her and then rode on her through a part of the gardens. She was such a peaceful creature to hug and cuddle with. Not many people will believe that I've cuddled a massive elephant, but I did and she made me love every bit of it.Dera Amer has very welcoming soft green grass and a cooling dining area where you can spend some time at. They are very proud of how to treat and use these gentle giants. I would recommend it over and over again. Pre-booking is essential! The elephants don't work around the clock - they get to rest especially during the hot days."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,hobart_10,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Lovely experience,"This was included in our itinerary on our tour with Enchanting Travels (see separate review on them - really excellent) and we didn't know anything about Dera Amer except that we would have an elephant ride which is what we had requested. We arrived at about 5pm for the elephant ride plus dinner.  We had such a great time.  The elephant ride was so much fun, through fairly barren landscape but just to be on top of a beautiful elephant was all we wanted.  About a half hour into the ride we approached a raised platform and we were curious to see what was coming up next.  To our delight we were handed a glass of wine and off we went again on the elephant ride.  It was quite hilarious trying to get the wine into our mouths rather than down our shirts with the lumbering elephant seriously swaying as he walked.  It was great fun and we got quite a laugh from the whole wonderful experience.  Then we were treated to an absolutely beautiful Indian meal under a large colourful tent on the property.  The food was some of the loveliest we had on our 2 weeks in India and apparently most of the ingredients are organically grown on site.  The staff were very kind, attentive and friendly.  The location of Dera Amer is about half way between Jaipur and the little village of Samode, where we stayed at gorgeous Samode Palace.  In our opinion it is easier to go from Jaipur rather than Samode because the road is better and the time a bit shorter. We would heartily recommend this experience at Dera Amer both for the elephants and the food."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,PWNottingham,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Such a Special Charming Experience with Elephants,"We loved our time here.  Most importantly we felt the animals were well cared for and we were recommended Dera Almer by our Tour Company Abercrombie and Kent for this very reason.  We arrived with our car and driver and were greeted nicely.  We fed the elephants whole bananas. We spent a bit of time with the elephants and also the camels. We were then given an Elephant Safari which we enjoyed tremendously, was just so funny, and which created memories we will never forget.  The area is a dry, arid region,  Sandy with some scrub-like trees.  We saw birds on our Safari including peacocks.  They asked us if we would like a long or short safari and we opted for the longer one.  It was such a novelty to be riding the elephant with the Mahoot sitting in front of us with his bright orange turban driving the elephant for us.  We stopped at a clearing and were provided with a lovely Indian lunch under an awning all on our own with the Indian gentlemen to serve us.  Again, so special enjoyable and memorable.  We saw the tandoor oven and the chapattis being made.  All the traditional cooking pots were lined up from which we could choose lovely food.  Afterwards we had some Earl Grey Tea!  We seemed to be given as much time as we wanted.  The owner's nephew showed as all around in a jeep as we had heard they have Glamping here.  He showed us the tents which were set up and equipped like hotel bedrooms.  It must be a very special place to spend the night and would rather appeal to us.  We liked when we stroked the camels...they have such woolley, densely textured, curly hair on their necks!  Awwww all so sweet charming and memorable!  A real one-off day about which I'm sure we will smile for the rest of our lives."

The owners of this preserve are really trying to do good by the elephants and the environment.  It is located out of town on a bumpy road and it does make you feel like you are in the country.  There is initial time with the elephants, then a 45 minute ride, then, for us, lunch outside.  The ride was a real highlight and at no point did we feel we were exploiting these wonderful animals.  Worth the visit- a must sometime on your visit to India."

The program offered a chance to feed, wash, paint and ride our ""own"" elephant on a safari in the reserved forest area, followed by a meal. The program was to last approximately 3 hours. To our surprise when our group of 18 arrived we were told there were only 3 elephants. We were given bananas to feed them, then two at a time were given at most a five minute ride around the yard.  Next we were told it was too cold to wash the elephants, but they poured water on the trunk of one elephant and we could take turns with a brush to pretend to wash the elephant and get a picture taken. As this was taking too long a second elephant and brush were found. Finally we were given one set of paints and two paint brushes and could again take turns posing for pictures while we ""painted"" our elephant. Our visit ended with sugar cane being brought out to feed the two available elephants. No meal was provided and after about 40 minutes we were sent back to our bus. We did not get the program we were charged for and would not recommend anyone participate in this experience."

The animals were treated very well which is unusual for this kind of event. The staff was helpful, informative, and honest. They did everything possible to make this as enjoyable as possible. We were told that they do only a few rides a day and do not wish to turn this into a ride factory but rather keep it as a family owned farm. We were the only people there during our tour which made it even more enjoyable. We did a 45 minute ride through the desert jungle with a ""driver"" which was 3000 rupees each (we did it with 2 people so I'm not sure how the price would change for a different size group). This included time with the elephants before, a 45 minute ride, painting the elephants after, and lots of pictures. We booked this the day before. Tours do not start until 10am but they run through dinner. I would recommend calling rather than booking online. I'd also recommend wearing pants/shorts rather than a dress/skirt.

We set off and were welcomed at the end of the journey by a tented pavilion with staff and a truly delicious buffet. The elephants had been rescued from the city and given a lovely life in much better surroundings.

Seeing the poor elephants taking people up to the fort in Jaipur was quite upsetting and I would urge people to NOT USE THESE RIDES as they are cruel to the animals. The Dera Amer safari has a small number of rescued elephants. They only do one or two walks a day on sort sandy ground with one or two people on board maximum? They aren't poked with spikes to make them walk faster and respond to vocal commands and squeezes from the handler. We had a brief amble around the countryside for half an hour then had a drink and a supper by a brazier which was very nice. They grow the food themselves where possible and the cooking was v good.I'd recommend it as an evening out of Jaipur.

We were not entirely sure what to expect. Warmly greeted, as it was sunset/dusk, we climbed the elephant steps and began our journey on Mochti as the sun set and darkness fell. It was a journey just long enough, as the howdah was not the most comfortable. Back at the place we started, we were shown to a private area where a fire had been lit, and we enjoyed a glass or three of wine, with Indian snacks. We were then invited to move to our table a few feet away. We appeared to have a completely private area, and were waited on hand and foot. The food was slightly disappointing, and all of it served rapidly, which because of the falling temperatures, meant that it was cold before too long. However, the atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff made up for it."

Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,fairplay01,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Not what we expected.,Our review maybe a little harsh because we were expecting something very different. In essence its an elephant ride around a farm followed by lunch. Didn't float our boat at all. we were under the impression it was a trek through villages etc. It was not that! we stayed an extra day in Jaipur for this and in our opinion it wasn't worth it. Having said that I am sure it would be good for kids.
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,LynneGosport,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Beautiful surroundings and well cared for elephants,"This is such a lovely place and we enjoyed our 20 minute amble through the countryside on our elephant. I could see that all the elephants were well cared for, unlike some tourist attractions. We had a splendid lunch afterwards. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,wakosh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,A well needed rest,"After a couple of hectic days India my girlfriend and I checked in at Dera Amer and boy was it worth it. It was such a well needed rest from the chaotic big cities.We had booked the full package. When we got to ride an elephant, feed, wash, and paint her. She was really calm and you could get really close to her and even hug her trunk. We felt perfectly safe the whole time. No need to worry about safety.We had the whole tent-campingsite to ourselves and had a personal servant. When it got dark the staff made us a small bonfire and a couple of delicious snacks. Then we had a romantic dinner with lit candles and lanterns. The next day we took a ride on a cart dragged by a camel to a local village where we got to see how the villagers lived. It was really interesting to see. We also had a walk in the area and did a bit of bird watching.All in all it was a really relaxing experience. Everything was so quiet and tranquil. The staff made sure that everything was in our tempo and that we were comfortable att all times. I can't recommend this enough!!! It is really worth to stay a night in one of their beautiful tents. Don't hesitate to book!"
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,tahlishepherd,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Brilliant surroundings as well as the gorgeous elephants,"Perfect for our children who are 3, 6 and 8 years old. I searched over the internet for a really unique experience for us as a family and Dera Amer do it very well. On a setting of 180 acres it's a India that everyone should see. You get to feed the elephant, pat and wash and paint so very hands on.  We loved it and the food was amazing too."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,TravelOn9928,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,Remember How Lucky You Are to Travel...,"Sometimes there are events in life that make you sit back and say, “Gee, am I ever blessed.”  For me, being at Dera Amer was one of those experiences.   We were told that the owner, Udaijit Singh, is an organic farmer who is taking the elephants and camels from the city to live in a more natural setting.  It was obvious from the get-go that the animals were well cared for and treated with dignity and respect.The road to get into the site was a bit rough, having been a bit washed out from the rains, but we saw different wildlife such as a fox and a variety of birds.  We were introduced to our elephant and then had a chance to feed her a couple of bananas to develop our friendship.  Then we cleaned up and went for our ride through the jungle, where we saw camels, a variety of birds and butterflies, and heard the calls of peacocks.  We passed by a temple and were entertained with singing and drumming.  After about 45 minutes, we sat on a veranda enjoying drinks and appetizers before moving into an air conditioned room to eat a delicious Indian buffet meal.  The service throughout was superb and the whole experience was excellent and very peaceful.  This was my favourite experience while in India, and I would recommend this trip in a heartbeat!"
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Becsaboodle,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,A magical experience,"We went to Dera Amer as my daughter wanted to see elephants. It was very important to us to choose somewhere that had high welfare standards as we've heard so many horror stories. Dera Amer arranges for you to be collected from your hotel and you are driven up past the Amber Fort  into the peaceful hills above Jaipur. We fed, watered, washed and painted the elephants. They were so calm and sweet natured and it was obvious that they are not just well cared for, but they also have a good relationship with the people that look after them. A 40 minute ride into the jungle, past an old temple and then to a beautiful building where you have drinks and snacks and watch the sunset before going in for a buffet dinner. It was very well run, clean, informative and enjoyable. I would thoroughly recommend it. "
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,oumanota,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Couples,Both Authentic and a bit unsettling -especially for the elephant!,"If you're into elephant rides, a stop at Dera Amer is a must: animals seem to be treated a lot better than at the nearby Fort and other touristy places, there are a lot less people around and ultimately the ride is both fun and enjoyable, away from it all. Well, sort of. At the end of the day it is still a ride that has no other purpose than satisfying tourists' curiosity. It's not taking you form A to B but on a -nice- loop, back to A.  The day we visited we fed the wrong elephant by mistake before mounting another, and no one bothered to give us another banana for ours. It sounds trivial but our ride was quite upset about it the whole time, which should not be underestimated. Those are wild animals and accidents do happen. We felt our guide was a bit tense because of it as well, trying to constantly comfort the elephant while we were already on the tour, which didn't help. So, while we really liked the ride, lunch and spending some time in the quite and beautiful setting, we did feel a bit guilty about hoping on an animal's back that was not really happy about the whole thing."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,Paula P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Out of the box experience,"What a spectacular way to spend a beautiful sunset? Riding a well cared for and loved elephant through the Indian jungle. Our mahout was lovely. He chatted away pointing out the wildlife. After the ride we had a buffet dinner which included traditional Indian food. The lawns were so free and cool. Such a relaxing evening, a real out of the box experience and I can highly recommend."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,XXX2588,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Had the most relaxing time here,"Udjit, the owner is super nice and very accomodating. We had a 40min Eelephant ride on one fo 2 elephants they have. They actually are best friends as they speak to eachother while we walk. It's so funny and these animals are so impressive. It's a little hard to find but once you get there it's like an Oasis in the desert!! No joke! It's beautiful! They even have luxury camping tents with a toilet and a shower: they call it GlamPing. I'd totally would have stayed there had I known before I got there but next time....We visited the tents out of curiosity. There are 4 if I rmemeber correctly and they are a little remote (7min walk) away from the main restaurant. They put torches to light the area up at sunset. It's really amazing! The lucnh was not spicy or hot, just perfect and very relaxing. Loved every bit of it."
Dera_Amer_Wilderness_Camp-Amer,zoe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,A little gem !! ,"Right from the beginning this was a great experience . The booking with Udaijit for the Rhythm of Elephants was easy and straight forward through email and as promised was picked up from our hotel in Jaipur . On arrival we had our first meet with Laxmi and fed her bananas . We were then taken to the house for drinks ( all soft drinks , beer and wine are included in price ) and too cool down as this was a hot day . When Laxmi was ready for bath time we handed water and scrubbing brushes and this allowed us to interact more and gain the trust of Laxmi . Yes we got a bit wet but that's part of the fun !!! When Laxmi had dried off we painted our own design , with natural colourings . The staff were all so friendly and nothing was too much trouble . They were on hand with information , photo taking and drinks when required . We were not rushed and spent as much time as was wanted with Laxmi . When Laxmi was due for a break from the heat we also took a welcome break . The safari ride was good with the mahout checking we were comfy and pointing out any other animals on out travels . Again , drinks were offered half way round which we thought was a great added touch . We said our goodbyes to Laxmi after the ride and arrived at our private dining area which was just beautiful . Lit with candles , cold drinks and staff on hand for literally anything. Starters , the buffet and dessert were amazing , we even watched our bread being made . All the food is fresh produce . Possibly the best meal I've had in India . Again , there was no rush and we didn't feel as though the staff wanted us to go . Overall , an amazing experience that I would recommend while in Jaipur.
