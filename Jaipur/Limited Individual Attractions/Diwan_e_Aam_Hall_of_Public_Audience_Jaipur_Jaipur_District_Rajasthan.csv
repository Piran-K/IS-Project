Diwan_e_Aam_Hall_of_Public_Audience,Charming_Karl,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Couples,The more museum-like section of the City Palace complex,"There are times when not being allowed to take photographs seems less an attempt to get you to buy their books full of photos, and more a matter of showing respect.  The latter is certainly the case here, although I must admit, I was really tempted to yank out my camera more than once.  What stopped me?  Well, our guide was a serious but kind person and I would've been embarrassed to do anything for which he might need to chide me.  Plus, there were plenty of other areas where we were welcome to take photos.As for this hall, we avoided the section that has been turned into a military museum and focused on the part devoted to the history of the royal family.  Lovely."
Diwan_e_Aam_Hall_of_Public_Audience,KLE2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Magnificent Throne Room,The former ceremonial hall now displays rare miniature Mughal paintings and larger than life portraits of the Maharajas of Jaipur.  Seeing these portraits made the history of the Palace come alive and the stories of the rulers more impactful.  The massive carpet that stretched the length of the hall was only partially displayed but the extravagant silver throne was fully visible.  Sadly Photography is not allowed in this part of City Palace Museum.

Diwan_e_Aam_Hall_of_Public_Audience,PrestonGuild,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2012 • Family,Audience in the city,"Mubarak Mahal was built by Maharaja Madho Singh. Contained within it is the Diwan-e-Khas (the Hall of private audience) and Diwan-e-Aam (the hall of public audience). The Hall of the public audience as the name implies were members of the public would arrive with petitions and grievances and seek audience to the King and his ministers. However for more exquisite halls, look at the Amber Fort."
