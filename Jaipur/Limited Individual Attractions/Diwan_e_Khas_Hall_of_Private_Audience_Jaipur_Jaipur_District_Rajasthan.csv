I took so many pictures, you have to because the sun comes in so many different ways, it is hard sometimes to get a true picture, but oh it is so beautiful.  So PINK! Other areas are also pretty.  My favorite in a different area.  Review on another area of the palace."

Diwan_e_Khas_Hall_of_Private_Audience,Rumples,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Amazing Silver Vessels Here,"This raised, open-sided pink pavilion in one of the City Palace's courtyards beckoned to us because of its prime location, separated from the other structures in the area. The interior showed off a marble floor, pillars and beautiful chandeliers. Wall adornments included a circular display of old rifles.The structure, known as the Hall of Private Audience, is where the maharajas used to consult with their ministers in earlier times. But the big draw for me here turned out to be two huge silver vessels -- billed as the largest in the world -- displayed apart from each other.Made from 1894-96 for Maharaja Sawai Singh II, they each stand 5.2-feet high, hold up to 1,057 gallons and weigh 750 pounds. The maharaja needed them to carry water from the Ganges River to drink during a trip to England in 1901 because, for religious reasons, he did not want to drink foreign water. As a history buff, I found these vessels to be extremely fascinating.Both steps and ramps access the pavilion, which only had a few visitors on a late afternoon in December. When we returned to the courtyard, I heard a rustling noise overhead and saw two big monkeys scampering along a high wall. I was surprised to see them in the middle of a very busy city."
