EleJaipur,Oliver T,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Dangerous experience!!!,"Avoid at all cost!! This is not safe at all, I will explain what happened during my visit:First of all, we go there with our driver, and we sit down with the guy who explain everything from his cellphone, he explain the packages and to be honest, even for Europeans is very expensive (over ‚Ç¨60 for 1h) I told him I only wanted to ride the elephant, he said for half an hour it would cost me 2500 rupies (20-30‚Ç¨) I accepted that offer, and I sat on the elephants neck. First 10 minutes were amazing, first time being elephant it was an incredible moment, then the elephant started getting angry by breathing hard and harder, and later he started making sounds with his trump louder and louder and i said to the guy to calm him down (he did not speak English) he kept telling me it‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs ok, no problem, but then he started beating the elephant with his stick, and then it got a lot worse, the elephant was starting moving around, trying to get out of the situation, he got really upset and was making huge sounds with his trumpet. Scariest moment of my life, luckily for me, the elephant got close to an edge at the same level of my feet, and I jumped out of the animal to be safe. This animals are wild animals, it was 40 degrees to ride them, and if you look at YouTube videos of people killed by elephants you will see how dangerous it is, it literally can kill you."
EleJaipur,acu023,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,One of the highlights of my trip!!!,Absolutely had so much fun riding the elephant. It was very important to me that the elephants are being treated well and kept in a spacious village. I could tell that they are being looked after. The ride took about half an hour. It costed me a lot but it was worth the experience.

EleJaipur,julie t,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,not nice,I saw elephants shackled in souless concrete blocks. I saw a 'social area' that contained no socialising elelephants. Why would anyone want to paint an elephant?  The most unnatural place ive ever seen animals kept in. At least in zoos the animals are kept in a group not isolated like this.

The guides are well informed and they teach you all about the elephants, how to climb onto them using the trunk, how to ride without a saddle! I felt very relaxed, the walk was not rushed.. although we went in summer and it was super hot, the guide still offered an extra few minutes in the walk just to make the experience more worth while. After the ride we also got to feed the elephants a huge bag of bananas, chats with the well informed Salim and the rest of the crew.. absolutely no rush to leave, super accommodating teamüôè‚úåÔ∏èüí™üëåü§ò "

EleJaipur,jasonh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Amazing elephants ,"While visiting jaipur we wanted to do more than visit monuments, we wanted to have experiences. initially we were a little put off by the price but realised money was going to help home and rehabilitate the elephants. Each couple are assigned to their own elephant. It was a fantastic experience as you spent time getting to know your elephant and then going through the different activities with your elephant. The operation runs so smoothly and is incredibly professional - without losing the Indian authenticity. All staff are fantastic but specially narsing. Make sure you have a 100% battery for your camera!!because the guy there salim took great photos of us........The only regret you will have is if you don't go..... must recommend"
