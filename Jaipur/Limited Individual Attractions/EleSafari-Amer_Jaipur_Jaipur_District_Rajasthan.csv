EleSafari-Amer,Gregory F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples,An amazing experience,"This was certainly a highlight of our time in India. I absolutely recommend EleSafari. My girlfriend and I went alone but im sure our kids would love it too. Being able to hang out and feed the elephants, paint them, and just go for a walk is something we'll never forget. On top of that, everyone that works there was amazing. They even helped by talking to my driver and sending gps coordinates so we could be certain we were at the right place.Dont be thrown off when you drive to the area or enter the gates. Its definitely not a luxury area but the staff are very upfront about that. Once you are at the property, it is well kept and everyone is friendly. They were also super responsive on whatsapp.Bit of advice, be careful when you enter the main gate from the road. Everyone wants the next tourist to go to their part so be sure to follow the staff from here and not a random guy. "

EleSafari-Amer,Aliya khan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Elesafari experience 2023 - A different experience.,"I was recommended Elesafari by my cousin from UAE who had visited in 2019.Since then I have always wanted to visit Jaipur and see to experience Elesafari by myself and as the restrictions has been eased now, I wasted no time and planned my journey with my husband to Jaipur.Elesafari was a fantastic and a new experience for me. At first I was scared to go near  the Elephant but after seeing how well behaved and well trained the giant jumbo elephant is when I started interacting with it and started playing with the giant lovely Elephant whose name was Tara. The elephant(Tara) was very well behaved and has been well trained by is care taker. I fed Tara sugarcane and a bunch of bananas which she happily ate with a smiling also fed some water and also had fun in the drawing task. The staff there is very kind and the my volunteer Mr Yunus was kind enough to tolerate my all nonsensical questions.At the end we took a ride on the elephant to enjoy the place.The elephants are well trained.I would highly recommend to all the people who are visiting Jaipur or India should add this in your itinerary.

EleSafari-Amer,ILU_EleSafari,,,,"A magical experience with the elephants. Ilu and his entire team is simply the best and their hospitality is to class. Ilu is very safe rive and informative right from the first email till the time we left the farm. While booking we were a bit concerned but once Ilu explained us how they are working towards the welfare of the elephants and their mahouts we were totally relieved. The next 2-3 hours were spent very close the the elephants pampering, feeding, painting using organic colours, washing and taking them for a walk. There was no minor sign of cruelty and the elephants looked quite healthy.We also booked a day tour of Jaipur to witness the historical and popular monuments along with the elephants. Very well organised itinerary and seamless experience. The knowledge and insights shared about each site was exceptional."

Their elephant interaction program gives you a unique chance to be so close and personal with the elephants. Also their team is super duper friendly who makes sure that you enjoy every moment at the farm. We also did a sightseeing tour along with the elephant interaction program which indeed saved a lot of time and most importantly money. I suggest you guys to book the experience with a day tour as we did which will definitely be a great option."

EleSafari-Amer,AmandaZ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Just book without a second thought.. Amazing city tour with elesafari ,"Having only a single day in Jaipur and reading some amazing reviews of elesafari we decided to book the elephant interaction program along with the Jaipur city tour. At first we were in a doubt if we could finish the tour and the elephant experience in a single day but everything was planned so well that we visited almost all the popular monuments while also visiting the beautiful elephants at elesafari. An early morning pick up was arranged from our hotel. A clean SUV was sent with a super awesome driver who was an amazing combination of your guide and chauffeur. First he took us to a popular roadside shop where we had some mouth watering lassi before starting off exploring other monuments. We then visited the City Palace, the house of the Royal family of Jaipur along with Jantar Mantar observatory which was simply mind boggling. After driving through the Wind palace, we took a halt for lunch before visiting the magnificent Amber palace. It is a spectacular piece of architecture. Later on we visited the lovely elephants at elesafari where we were greeted by the owner ILU who was so welcoming. He gave us detailed information about the place and the lives of elephants in Jaipur. We started the experience by getting introduced to Tara and feeding off her bundles of sugarcane with pure love. This was followed by a brief painting using chemical free colors which turned out to be a very unique experience. We even gave her a little wash as it was winter and the entire body washing was closed. This was followed by a short bareback ride. In the end we gave her some sweet bananas as a treat for being so gentle.The overall time spent with the team of elesafari including the City tour and elephant experience was too special. I'm glad that we booked their services and got some amazing memories with the City tour and the giant elephants. Simply book without a second thought !"

EleSafari-Amer,ILU_EleSafari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Second visit at EleSafari ,If you are in Jaipur and wish to be up personal and lose with the elephants in an ethical way then elesafari is the best place.The elephants there are treated so humanely with affection. Moreover every elephant has its own caretaker who takes care for them. It feels so satisfying that money which you pay goes for the welfare of these gentle giants. Also they provide city tours which we booked that can be combined with the elephant experience and it‚Äôs totally worth it and also saves a lot of time.Amazing time!

EleSafari-Amer,Greg T,,,,We were a group of four friends and booked a day tour of Jaipur with the elephant interaction program. We were provided a private SUV for the day tour and the pick up was on time. The car was clean and the driver was too polite. We started early morning so that we could cover most of the sightseeing along with elesafari experience as we had only one day and thanks to the team the mission was accomplished. The experience at elesafari with the elephants was also an amazing one where we interacted with them so closely. It was so heart warming to see that elephants are looked after very well and are treated with so much love and affection.We found plenty other companies bu are glad that we went on with elesafari which gave us tonnes of memories to cherish for life.P.S. Book directly with the owner ILU rather than depending on your driver's ou tour guides.

EleSafari-Amer,arif Badgujar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Unique experience ,Having a free day in Jaipur we decided to visit elesafari and meet the elephants there. Booked tje experience through WhatsApp which was pretty smooth. A private pick up was arranged from our hotel. On our way we requested our driver to stop at Water palace was a quick photo session which he politely agreed. Upon arrival we were served beverages and the owner ILU gave us a brief history about the lives of elephants at Jaipur. It was so satisfying to know that elephants are treated and very well taken care of. We started off by feeding our elephants Tara and Payal and even made bundles for them. It was followed by painting them using non toxic colors which was a fun part where we wished my cousin a happy birthday. Later we gave them some water to drink and gave them a scrub which they seemed to enjoy a lot. The last part was a bareback ride across the village which was so quiet and peaceful. All in all it was a marvelous experience where you can learn alot about these beautiful animals while doing fun activities with them. The fabulous team acts as the icing on te cake who take every small effort to make you time memorable.

EleSafari-Amer,ILU_EleSafari,,,,My partner booked elephant experience and a day tour of Jaipur with elesafari and it turned out to be an amazing experience. The combined package of elephant experience along with the day tour is a truly favourable option for travellers and also pocket friendly. Excellent reviews from other travellers convinced us to take on their services. The day tour was just amazing where we visited some popular tourist attractions. After half  day of exploring Jaipur we visited the elephants. We were hungry and on request the owner ILU arranged some snacks for us. The next couple of hours were spent getting so personal and doing some fun activities with our elephant Tara. Plenty of beverages were served during the experience. The time that we spent at elesafari farm was something that we would cherish for lifetime.

It was soooo special to meet our elephants Payal and Tara again. My cousins enjoyed like small kids while painting on the elephants using organic colors. We were not allowed to wash our elephants due to the cold weather which was totally fine with us.Overall again a memorable experience and I wish I can visit again and bring more people here."

,,,,,Booked elesafari for the elephant interaction program along with a day tour of Jaipur. Right from the beginning the experience has been excellent with smooth and prmopt response from ILU regarding the sightseeing tour to the experience with the elephants. Everything was so well planned. The tour itinerary covered almost all the popular monuments and forts with a nice driver. Jaipur is a beautiful city and we munched on some lip smacking indian cuisine. Also the time spent at the farm with Payal is something we would cherish for a lifetime. Learned a lot about the lives of the elephants of Jaipur and the amazing work these people are doing for their welfare. Commendable staff who were so courteous throughout our stay at the farm. We'll surely visit Jaipur again and would again love to visit elesafari farm

EleSafari-Amer,Andrew,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Adorable Tara and Payal,Some amazing reviews convinced us to visit elesafari elephant farm. We made a booking through WhatsApp and it was a smooth process where all our queries were cleared by ILU. A time slot was alloted to us and transportation was arranged from our hotel. Before visiting the farm we did a tour of Jaipur and visited some beautiful monuments. It was a peak season and the moments were packed with tourists still our driver Khan was so patient and made sure we visited all the popular sites. We were not forced for shopping traps and were given plenty of freedom during the tour.After witnessing the magnificent amer palace we went to elesafari to meet the cuties. Upon arrival we were greeted by by ILU and he gave us a detailed introduction about the place and the lives of elephants living there. Then he introduced us to Anu our new giant friend who was so calm. We truly enjoyed feeding her sugarcanes which she munched like a machine. We were surprised to see the quantity of food consumed by the elephants. Then we decorated them using chemical free colors for which we were hesitant but when we checked the colors which were really washable and not harmful for the elephants we decided to try painting. After this it was time for a little wash and scrub followed by a bare back elephant ride across the pond. The experience is so special where you directly contribute for the welfare of these elephants and their care takers. It is fun to be so close to these elephants in a natural environment along with a super friendly team.

,,,,,My partner booked the elephant experience along with the Jaipur city tour and it was an amazing experience. We opted for a tuk tuk tour to get a more local experience and the driver provided was simply the best. Almost all the popular sites were included in the sightseeing tour and plenty of time was given to explore the monuments. Also our driver was very knowledgeable about the city and gave us many great stories about the pink city.After lunch we visited the elesafari farm where the elephants were waiting for us swinging their tails and munching on their meals. Upon arrival we were greeted by ILU the owner and he gave us a brief background about the place and the experience. Then we were introduced to our elephant Anu an asian female elephant who was very gentle and calm. We started by feeding her and were amazed by the quantity of food consumed by her.  Her caretaker even taught us to make bundles for her. After feeding her for sometime we started to paint her using non toxic colors and this was the most fun part. The next was washing her but due to cold weather the whole body wash was not allowed and we were completely okay with it. The last part was an option between elephant ride or a walk and we decided to take Anu for a walk along the pond which was so peaceful. The entire experience was soooo surreal and we are glad that we got to do it. The staff was so helpful and it was because of them that the experience became such an amazing one.  I would suggest you to directly contact ILU through email or whatsapp rather than booking through some agent or driver or guides.
