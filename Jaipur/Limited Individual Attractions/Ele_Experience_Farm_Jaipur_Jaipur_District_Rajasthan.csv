Ele_Experience_Farm,eleexperience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021 • Friends,I love the experience,Went to Ele experience Farm today with my family and 3 year old kids was greeted the founder and owner himself (Farhan Khan) quiet and knowledgeable Gai and very soft spoke doesn't like tourist things allowed which was very good for us because my son was with me through in 100 questions of him and he will answer each one of them clearly and in-depth he considers his job oppression and he enjoyed doing it you will see that when you meet him he loves his animal he had had arranged cold drinks and milk for us hospitality at its best then came the elephant what a Majestic animal she was Sonia was her name I had never been so close to one and was particularly scared a little at first but all your spheres go away when you touch the elephants we hugged her said her sugarcane juice and green vegetables played with her and we painted on her body yes you can Paint on animal in fact they love it because they don't use normal Paints brush they use brush with which are made from bamboo stick which 😌relax. The colours elephants and the colours and harmful as they are organic and get easily washed away after painting we had elephant safari where to set on the elephant and took a ride we suggest for their back ride if you are with family or if you are with the kids you can go there.

Ele_Experience_Farm,AlbertT,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Family,Happiest day with elephant,"The elephant safari in elephant village is a relatively new edition to the Jaipur tourism and we are lucky to experience one of this during our last visit to Jaipur. Actually we were going throught the options of such adventure close to nature and we were lucky to get this contact of ""Ele Experience Farm""contacted by Mr Farhan Khan. To begin with they do have the option of hotel pickup and drop. After entering the premises which is very close to the Amber fort the first thought which comes is ""WOW"".. we felt us if we were actually entering and elephant Kingdom Mr Farhan Khan was there personally to introduce us to the concept behind this new Ventures he same to be an elephant lover himself with gave us a good feeling over all the facilities were there to make us most comfortable even thought the village is still being developed by the authorities one should not go there with the expectations oppo A5 Star experience because it actually is a hands on experience of being close to an elephant the gives you an option of choosing your activities and rates are divided accordingly we decided to go through the full package elephant ride on a chair since we had at 2 year old kid elephant feeding painting on the elephant with natural colour and stick and finally giving the elephant a bath the activities were carried out with the atmos care and guidance of the team of ""Ele Experience Farm"". Most importently now were in between we failed that sum of force on the beast animal and infecked the story behind these elephant present in experience farm is heart warming most of them are rescued from the hardships of a circus Amer fort sawari is etc the team of Ali experience farm to take a lot of care of these elephants and infect are doing a kind of social work which is very appreciated we allow the experience and hope to enjoy it again when we will come village is fully build up by the coming here thank you for the memories."

We spent a lovely morning playing with Laxmi, the extremely well behaived, kid friendly and docile elephant who allowed us to feed her loads of food (to the absolute delight of my daughter), colouring with safe washable colours on her legs and posing for photos with theatrics worthy of a circus. We highly recommend visiting the farm (tip - go early in the morning to enjoy a relaxed morning with the elephants)."

The Animals seemed in great condition and very happy. The people working there also showed great passion for the animals and seemed to love working with them to provide an unforgettable experience. At the end I even had the chance to fly a kite with the locals and people working there which provided a family like atmosphere.All in all it‘s so worth it and I can only encourage people interested in Elephant riding to come here.

Ele_Experience_Farm,eleexperience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Amazing elephant experience!,"This is truly a great experience. Faran went out of his way to make this a memorable day for me and I can't thank him enough for that.You can feed, walk, and paint the elephants at the farm (you can't wash them in the winter unfortunately) and the staff did a great job answering any question I had. The elephants were rescued from circuses from the south of India and are therefore not able to adjust to life in the wild. All the elephants were very affectionate and sweet.Faran picked me up from Amer Fort and on the way back we stopped off for some chai and he introduced me to his friends who were practicing for the kite festival that is happening in a couple of days. It was a great local experience and I would recommend anyone to spend a day here."
