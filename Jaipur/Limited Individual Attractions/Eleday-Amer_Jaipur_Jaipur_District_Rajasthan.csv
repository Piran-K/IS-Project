Eleday-Amer,Rakesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Family,Best day activities in Jaipur,"What an amazing place it is i enjoyed quite a lot with my wife and kids. There are several options we could choose to interact with elephant but we choose elephant washing and feeding Banana to the elephant. We spend almost 4 hour and our time was quality time. We learn as well lot of things about elephant. I will say people should go and visit this place. If you don't do any another activity with elephant, than you don't need to pay anything. That we like because other companies asked us price in advance.Meet Mr. Push there he is founder of eleday. Nice guy."

This company was recommended to me by my friends who recently visited India. I really liked their careful attitude to elephants, very caring owners. I was allowed to ride, feed the elephant and even wash it! I will never forget such an experience.

Eleday-Amer,Pushpendra,,,,Eleday is the best place for elephant riding or interacting with elephants in jaipur. We book our day with eleday for spending a day with elephant. We had great fun there. We learn a lot of things about elephant. We walk with elephant and had bare back ride. later we painted elephant. and feeding elephant banana was the most amazing experience we had. Eleday is a place where you can notice that they are not at all curl or bad with elephants. Over all we had wonderful day there.Thank you eleday and team.

Eleday-Amer,Pushpendra,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,VERY DISAPPOINTING AND  A BAD EXPERIENCE!,"Me and my family and gone for the eleday programme one year back and thoroughly enjoyed. Infact you might find my review somewhere here below.This time I arranged my parents to enjoy the festival of Holi here arranged by the organisers as “Eleholi Festival 2020”. But It was a disgusting experience for them. (1)We were not informed about cancellation of the event due to Coronavirus (2)Infact when we called for confirmation of pick & drop , we were again not informed about the cancellation (3)We were obliged to get the pick up and drop but that was the only good service BUT even the pick up guy didn’t inform that such event was cancelled (4)On reaching there my parents were informed about the cancellation and about them sending emails to all participants which I disagree of getting (5)I had selected the highest placed ticket but no one bothered to call us informing about the cancellation (6)These kind of organisations are the best examples for us Indians going complacent with their product and service when they start getting a good name. (7)Very poor behaviour of the staff as well for giving out lies to my parents about the whole situation"
Eleday-Amer,orchid,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Elephant ride,"Dear Guest 

Due to COVID we didn't organize holi with colors but insist that we organized holi with flowers. 
I would like to give some of the answers to your question. 
1. We mentioned it that there will be no colors at the festival but there will be flowers insist of colors. 
2. We called your parents one day before and explain all situations and also told them everything but they still told us they wanted to come and experience the holi with flowers and elephants.
3.  The driver was hired, and we already talked with your parents then why would the driver speak about it again. 
4. on reaching the Holi festival we again told them that if you want you can have a look and go back we will refund you, but they said"" we understand you cant organize a festival with colors, and we are more interested with the elephant so we would like to join.
5. This I already answered you previously we called a day before holi festival to know where they are staying or interested to visit or not. 
6. Don't mind you are a good example of a person who just wants to enjoy everything and at end of the day want your money back. As you can write anything does don't know what happens exactly.
7. I feel disappointed when you wrote this cause I was here most of the time with your parents and I did my best to make them feel good. I still remember that they needed tissue paper and water bottles. Even there was a counter and self-service but I run and get a water bottle for them. It's so easy to write that the behavior of the staff was not good. 

I even spoked with you over on phone but you weren't ready to listen to the situation after all you will listen to your parents. you should be.
Maybe now you could understand. The only cause of COVID we couldn't organize festival with colors.

Eleday-Amer,Pushpendra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Best Experience,"Visited ELEDAY with family in January 2020 . The fee was quite expensive. The area didn't seem suitable for elephants to live. No water for the elephants to splash in (which I know elephants love to do ). The area was very dry, very limited food for them. They just stood still and lonely. (The elephants were the ones they use for tourists to ride up to Amer Fort and Palace), such a shame! The elephants looked sad and unhappy. The one we had to paint and interact with was blind in one eye. I noticed she had a very big cataract in her left eye. When i questioned one of the fellows there, as to why they haven't done anything to remove it, the reply was ""but she can still see!"". 'and she may not go through the operation'.  I said, 'that's not the point and she should  have been attended to and not left like that"" I don't know why the owners have kept her in that condition , (the cataract didn't happen overnight) it must have been growing for quite a while and never checked in time. It doesn't seem to me that the owners care for these beautiful animals properly and SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN . That was so sad to see. I think they will lose money if they  lose an elephant. That's cruel I think!, They are only looking how much money they can make out of these poor unfortunate lovely animals and lose the tourists at the same time!  i ADVISE NO ONE TO ENCOURAGE THE OWNERS TO CONTINUE RUNNING THIS PLACE BY VISITING OR WRITING GLOWING ACCOUNTS OF THEIR VISIT! They don't deserve to be operating."

We appreciate your concern and feedback, but we want to tell you that you went to another place there are so many touts that misguide tourists and use our organization's name

Our elephants are fit and in very good condition There are some rescued elephants as well.  There is plenty of food for the elephant and the only industry is elephants that feed the everyday fruits.
As you wrote we are expensive then you should check on our website which is also the only website with mentioned the fees. which is 3500 INR per person

,,,,,"It is amazing to meet such impressive animals close up. The main one we had on our visit was so patient and serene. However, the animals still work part of the day doing the standard fort runs on the road and then just transport us tourists round a 200m route in the field. They don't look badly treated, but each of our 2 animals did have a couple of cuts/sores. We got to meet, ride, paint, wash and feed them and the kids loved it, but my wife was a little upset. It's a very expensive visit and the handlers will ask for extra money in tips."
,,,,,"Dear RSD78

Thanks for your feedback. We have some rescued elephants you might have seen time they rubbed with the trees so they have some cut marks. We give special treatment in that case.
With money, we charge 3500 INR, which we never pressure to spend. many other organizations ask for 5000 as well. Tips are gratitude which is not included in the package it all depends on you if you want to give or not.

,,,,,After spending some time with the elephants and their caretakers I noticed the use of the word LE so many times. LE in Hindi means Have iT. Why they use iT so much? Because elephants need to eat 16 hours a day! Every elephant has his own caretaker and feeds the elephant for hours and hours every day. I was happy to see these beautiful animals are well taken care of. The people working there are very Nice and welcoming and the boss is a very special excentric person who you Should definately meet. Eleday is super close to the Amber Fort and easy to combine in 1 day. Bahut dhanyavaad people and bad mein milenge!! 😉

Eleday-Amer,catal17,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,fantastic day out with elephants,"I have booked eleday with sightseeing. Sightseeing was good but eleday was outstanding activities i have done with my family.Its very nice place even for children my children was happy. Still wants to go back.there are these four activities we enjoyed and spent almost half of our day with elephants. Tour was very reasonable, so any body can book. plus one suggestion if you book eleday only it will cost you3500 INR per person and if you book sightseeing with eleday its also 3500 INR per person so enjoy both. I will highly recommend this tour to everybody at my place. Thank you eleday!"

Eleday-Amer,Alejandra A,,,,"This experience was amazing. We’ve met Radha, she is my age. She took us on a tour around the garden, which was awesome. Then I washed her and she washed me. I could not get enough from all the cuddles and gave her a little neck massage. I definitely recommend everyone to do this. The people at the elephant garden are very friendly and helpful and shared our enthusiasm. Khan took loads of pictures and videos for us while doing the activities. Iliyas was Radha’s trainer and was also very helpful. We are very thankful for this experience."

Eleday-Amer,Pushpendra,,,,"What an amazing experience feeding,bonding, riding and washing. Radha my elephants name was truly beautiful, gentle, calm and follows instructions very well. The connection with her and my partner Pallavi was totally incredible and I hope she will remember us when we next visit Jaipur India. Our tour guide was excellent, spoke English very well and an excellent photographer too. Thank you Khan. Radha's trainer was very experienced and the bondship between them was awesome, his name is Iliyas. Thank you so much Radha and crew at the Eleday Elephant Park for such an amazing experience. Hope to see you all again soon."
