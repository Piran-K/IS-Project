Elefun-Amer,Pooja,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Elfun was awesome and Shabbo rocks!!,This was in December 2022 and we had an awesome experience with Elfun. My daughter enjoyed the lovely time spent with Shabbo the 35 year old Elephant and the entire hospitality and commitment from the group was very good. Would like to try the entire day trip in summer when the days are long. We recommend Elfun üëç

Elefun-Amer,Elefun,,,,Elefun is a fun family friendly elephant sanctuary that has saved over 50 elephants. The attachment the care takers and elephants have with eachother is obvious from the moment you arrive. We had a great experience painting and feeding the elephants. We learned that applying paint is a therapeutic experience for the elephant which is a fun activity as you get to watch the elephants show affection to you and the care takers. I highly recommend anyone visiting India to visit the sanctuary and take part in this remarkable experience.

We told the driver to go to elefun, he was like yes sure is the same and took us to the village.

After looking at a number of elephant experience websites, we selected elefun based on excellent reviews about them. We were not disappointed. Mr. Aftab and his team were very helpful - from sending his team member to help us reach the place to making us comfortable, we were assisted all through the time we spent there. We also had good time with their elephant Rangoli, and had our share of fun! It was a wonderful experience. And would love to visit them again if we are in Jaipur."

We were skeptical but made believers as we saw how much the workers loved and cared for them. Her caretaker is dedicated to her and sleeps next to her in a small apartment. He has known her since he was a young boy and clearly loves her. They do not use sticks or hooks but train by love and respect instead of fear or Punishment. We opted to walk alongside our elephant instead of ride her with just a blanket and I suggest that for a more deep connection with your elephant. We fed her after and boy did she love bananas and sugarcane! We had a great time and will be back to visit Shapu which means beautiful in Hindi.

I was well looked after from the start as I was picked up on the way and even stopped for a lassi!When we got to the destination I was then taught more about elephants before I was able to start feeding the elephant sugar cane. Afterwards we then did some elephant painting before finishing off with an elephant ride through the wildlife around. Even though I was travelling solo, I was able to have lots of photos taken with the elephant during each event!I would recommend this tour to anyone particularly if you‚Äôve not been up and close with an elephant before!"

Elefun-Amer,Abbas,,,,"Have you heard of Haati-Gaon before?Yes, there is a place called ‚ÄúHaathi-Gaon‚Äù near Amber fort in Jaipur. I was planning for such an activity since years but this year finally decided to give it a shot. We were in Jaipur and googled about Haathi-Gaon. Luckily we got in a touch with Mr. Aftab, a very polite man who guided us to reach the place. It was such a nice, beautifully maintained green space where we got the chance to meet two lovely female elephants Tara and Payal. The mahouht gave us sugarcanes to make friends with these two elephants. I was initially scared as my 5 years old daughter wanted to get close to these huge elephants but soon the team and the elephants themselves they made us so comfortable and the fear of getting closer, touching them faded away.I would strongly recommend a 2-3 hours trip at Haathi-Gaon in case you are planning to visit Jaipur with your kids where only adults enjoy to shop. This calm space will not only give your little once a chance to get closer to nature, interact, touch and paint the elephants but you will also enjoy doing all this, if you haven‚Äôt done it before.By the end of our trip, we were hugging Tara and Payal and my little once didn‚Äôt want to leave at all.We are definitely meeting Tara and Payal in our next visit to Jaipur.I can say this in bold, italics and underline ‚ÄúMONEY WORTH SPENT‚Äù.A big thanks to Mr. Aftab and his lovely team. Wish them all the best!Manisha Malhotra"

,,,,,"Everyone has a dream.  My dream came true at the Jaipur Elephant Farm.  The farm houses almost 200 elephants, which are housed in dedicated buildings and cared for by different families.  Each elephant has a handler who is with him 19 hours a day (it turns out that they sleep 5 hours a night).  I met one of the elephants at the farm and spent two days with her.  We went for a walk in the reserve, I fed her sandwiches with bananas, sugar cane and more.  These are elephants that were saved from difficult living situations and living conditions in which they suffered for long periods.  Today, they cannot manage in nature alone, and it is necessary to take care of their well-being.  The team I met was a dedicated team, and the knowledge I received about the elephants was extremely interesting.  The only thing I didn't connect with was the drawing on the elephants and riding them.  I will definitely try to visit the place again for a longer period to help this wonderful team and hug Luxmi again."

,,,,,One of the best place if you are an animal lover and want to experience the life with an elephant. One can enjoy feeding bathing painting and riding on elephant at a single place. All the services are guided by well trained professionals.The owner of this place Mr. Aftab was a nice host. He detialed about the whole package and cost very clearly.I recommend to visit this place once not only for experiencing the activities with elephant but also to support these lovely animals which are rescued from various sources.Note: Please book for this through verified website only as there are many scammers too.

Elefun-Amer,Tina,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Will never forget laddu,"My family and I (7 of us) went to Elefun on October 6, 2022. We contacted Mr. Aftab (77370 91222) who was so helpful and gentle. He's the caretaker of Elefun. From the time he received us till we left the Elefun, he was helpful and polite. We were very apprehensive about entering Elephant Village since we read many bad reviews about how tourists are exploited by some of the elephant parks inside the elephant village. But we met the perfect person Mr. Aftab who was fair to inform the prices to spend time with the elephants in the beginning itself when I messaged him over WhatsApp while booking in advance.Our 3 hours' experience at Elefun was fantastic. We spent time with a 31 year old elephant called Laddu. We gave food to it. Then we drew on the elephant. Then we gave a shower to Laddu and vice versa by sitting on it :) Then we went on a 45 minutes' ride. We could have spent more time. Mr. Aftab was kind enough to give us ample time to spend with the gentle beast, Laddu. We loved Laddu so much that it will be in our memory for very long time. The mahout, Faizal was also a wonderful boy. We understood how he cares for his elephants like his family members. He helped us in conversing with Laddu in the words it could understood and explained a lot of things about elephants. Another wonderful person was Mr. Aslam who is fondly called Mr. Bean for his similarity in looks with Rowan Atkinson. He served us with good masala tea and gave us couple of water bottles whenever it was hot. If you are looking for a perfect place at a reasonable price to have a lifetime experience with elephants at Jaipur, then it has to be Elefun taken care by Mr. Aftab."

Elefun-Amer,traveller20002,,,,"Our group of 5 adults and 2 children arrived by a private bus and were immediately greeted by a person in charge and introduced to 2 elephants and their handlers. The introduction was done slowly and carefully, the elephants and the humans (us) were given plenty of time to get used to each other.The care of the elephants, the running of the facility, and the future of the entire project was discussed at length during a lovely teatime outdoors. We were able go for a very long walk riding the elephants, after which the kids painted them with washable paint using bamboo sticks - apparently they tickle theanimal, then washed them and fed them a bucket of bananas. The biggest thrill for the kids was sitting on the elephant's neck being sprayed with water coming out of her trunk. There was a photographer available that was taking very professional pictures, but the handlers and the guide also took our videos and pictures with our own cameras. The entire facility is very clean and we saw several other elephants with other groups of people being treated exactly the same kind way. For us, this was one ofthe most memorable experiences we had in India."

We were excited to see elephants, but we didn¬¥t expected to be as magical as it was. We went for them but ended having the time of our lives! The people from Elefun was extremely nice, specially Aftab, the owner, who started this Elephant oasis with care and love, to protect them and to create a space of meaningful interaction between humans and this amazing animals. The experience blowed our minds, it was PURE MAGIC! Definitively a MUST if you go to Jaipur.... Been able to wash, feed, paint, massage and ride a beautiful elephant, was absolutely stunning.
