Elephant_Activity_Planner,Paula H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Couples,Dream come true,"So didnt actually plan this as we were at the amber fort and our tuk tuk driver just said i want to show you something nice (i think part of the tuk tuk school training as well as the visit to my uncle/cousins textile factory) but..... so glad we did. We didnt even know where we were going, its not far from the fort and into what looked like a local village. We stopped at large gates and entered into a walled grass area. We were invited to sit down and offered tea. The grass had chickens running around and very friendly labrodour pups (5 months) . So by the size of the pool and yard we asumed we were here for the elephants. The main man started talking to us and then the elephant arrived. It was all very casual but nice after the hassle of hawkers all day. He said we could take photos and sent someone to buy bananas. We fed the elephant then they asked if we would like to sit on one. We said yes. The guide then took us a walk around the village which by now was after 7pm. I cant describe this experience in words. It took my breath away. The elephant (8 in the village) were so happy looking and looked really well cared for. I think we arrived quite late and perhaps took them by surprise but if this is how they normally do it then i would not complain. It was peaceful, beautiful and dare i say an almost spiritual experience we felt connected with the elephant and not commercial in anyway. I did see paints and things and knew you could help bathe the elephant but as i said we arrived unplanned. We paid equivalent of £36 for an hour and a half of absolute beauty and worth every penny.

I didn't know that elephants are such nice and charming animals.The guys from Elephant Activity Planner were so nice.At first, we got to know a little about the elephants they have and then we enjoyed a ride on Shobha, one of the elephant ladies.Afterwards, they let us paint the elephants and wash then. Finally, we gave them lots of bananas to eat.This was so much fun!The elephants are treated very well here and seem to be a part of the family at this place.In the evening we even had a little cooking class and afterwards enjoyed a lovely self-cooked Indian dinner outside.Thank you very much for this awesome experience!!!"
