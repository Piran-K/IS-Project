After riding the elephant in a circle in a not so large area , they encourage you to paint,wash , and feed the elephant. It was a very worthwhile experience, and you help provide income for their hefty upkeep. You can ride the elephant bare back , or on a platform tied to their back. Totally great experience with elephant adventure fun park "
