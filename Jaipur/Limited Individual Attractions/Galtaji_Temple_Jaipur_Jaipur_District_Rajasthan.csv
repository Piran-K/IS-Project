Galtaji_Temple,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,A mixed bag of memories,"GALTAJI is an ancient Hindu pilgrimage about six miles from Jaipur.It consists of several temples built into a narrow cleft in the ring of hills surrounding the city.The site is famous for its natural springs which collect in tanks. The holiest of these is Galta Kund which never goes dry.It is considered auspicious to bathe in the waters of Galtaji and thousands come to do so every year. Therein lies a problem.Firstly when you put people and their food together in a natural setting it attracts the local monkeys and they do things in the waters that you don't want to know about.For that matter, the impact on the purity of the waters from scores and scores of people using it to bathe every day is also something you probably don't want to dwell on.Add to that wandering cattle and their droppings, great heaps of rubbish lying about in the undergrowth, monkeys being fed plastic packets of milk with the stench later from that and you rightly get the impression that religious purity has become, to say the least, a little tarnished.I should stress at this point that those visiting this cleft of temples should expect to be tested physically since I estimated the steep climb to the Sun Temple at the top and back down at close to two miles over frequently uneven and stony ground. Take care.My way began up past one temple and up several sections of stone steps with a fence of razor wire on my left. Monkeys treated that barrier with contempt.The human bathing area -- one for men and one for women -- was packed at one tank with people stripping off and plunging in while another tank I passed had several dozen monkeys individually and collectively swimming in its waters.The path-passage took a sharp left and climbed past what seemed to be a popular monkey feeding point before the rough path climbed steeply up into the hills.When I arrived at the Sun Temple it offered majestic views over Jaipur and a chance to get my breath back. It was a hot day and I needed the bottled water I had brought with me. Make sure you bring some too.On the way down my guide pointed out a wonderful archaeological site of early 1700s astronomical instruments choked in trees and undergrowth near a huge pile of cow dung.Apparently a much larger similar astronomical observatory site, Jantar Mantar, down in Jaipur got all the restoration money despite the fact that this overgrown site near the Sun Temple is actually older and, therefore, historically more important.I am highlighting the situation in this and other related reviews in the hope Indian authorities spare a little money to restore this site too. It certainly deserves it because even neglect couldn't hide the lovely curved marble instruments, structures and scientific markings.Coming on down we passed a holy man sat cross-legged on the pavement watching the world go by. I wonder what he thought of the changes to this religious site?Back down towards the entrance we eased our way past the bathing bedlam, discarded drifts of monkey food and a few less savoury deposits to eventually drive away with very mixed memories.The site itself should have been lovely with its tanks of water, historic temples, gorge-like setting and wonderful views, but mankind's grubby fingerprints had been left all over it from piles of discarded rubbish and food to wear and tear on the monuments and pathway.It is still worth a visit but be prepared to see history clash with modernity."
Galtaji_Temple,Neadansu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Beautiful ,"Galtaji is a place few tourists visit, but a lot of localites do. It is a shortish drive outside the city and yes, it is an absolutely instagrammable place. The setting of the temple is almost otherworldly. The monkeys are free - so watch them."
Galtaji_Temple,India,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Dirty,Religious places with such great importance should be kept clean. Extremely dirty place. Filled with cows and monkeys. And ppl just there to extort money .
Galtaji_Temple,S G S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Govt of Rajasthan! Pls wake up! Save this gem!,"Road to Galta ji was also very scenic and filled with heritage buildings! The temple in itself is small, but the surroundings are amazing! Wish the govt saved the space and kept it clean! Worth a visit nevertheless."
Galtaji_Temple,beckynmax,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Shabby but pretty,"This once beautiful pilgrimage site has seen better days. The approach to ghe temple anx parkibg area are strewn with rubbish and filth. One you get close to the bathing pools, if is as bit cleaner. The buildings are rundown and faded, but still quite lovely. It is worth a trip  , just know it is not an idyllic spot."
Galtaji_Temple,Austinhman,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Ask for Deepesh,If your looking for a fun time go to this temple but before you enter ask the locals for a man named Deepesh. He‚Äôs a local man that likes the nickname ‚ÄúMonkey Master‚Äù. And he forsure is! Deepesh made my friend and I extremely comfortable around the monkeys and within 2 mins we had monkeys climbing all over us! It made for some really fun pictures! Deepesh is just a local but he never rushed us as we took our time playing with the monkeys and taking pictures of the temple and monkeys. It has definitely been a highlight of our trip!
Galtaji_Temple,pruthviraj m,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good location but poor maintenance and hygiene. ,Location of the temple in between two mountains is amazing. The place however needs some serious attention with respect to housekeeping and maintaining hygiene and needs to be more organised. Temple premise is full of monkeys which is an added attraction. 
Galtaji_Temple,goanjock,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021,Amazing Experience,"This was an amazing experience that felt like something out of a film set. We had taken a few bags of cashew nuts with us and shortly after entering Mrs Jock squealed with delight as a monkey jumped on to her shoulder and for her that was one ticked off the bucket list. We found the site atmospheric and very impressive. There were monkeys playing everywhere and it was great to watch a puppy also playing and then sleeping in the sun with a monkey. At the first pool the view back really is stunning. When we reached the top pool the monkeys were playing around the pool, swimming, diving in to the pool and even bomb diving from the roof of a surrounding building. I was just about to get a photo of a dive bombing monkey when another monkey climbed on to my shoulder and the shot was missed. I could have taken more photos but to be honest I was too busy be fascinated and smiling watching the monkeys playing together and having fun in the water like children and it was a joy to watch and experience.It really was a magical experience and yet another amazing memory from a trip of a lifetime :-)."
Galtaji_Temple,Nara A,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Rubbish and barbed wire abound,"Dear God, clean this place up and get rid of the barbed wire! The sacred pond was shut down and there was discarded rubbish and clothing everywhere. Ugly barbed wire wrapping monuments and kind side, yuck. I came here a decade ago and it was magical, now an ugly mess."
Galtaji_Temple,vikash,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Magnificent but presently in ruins.,"It's a very beautiful and wonderful temple complex, but as written in other reviews at present it is mostly closed and in ruins. The reason they tell is COVID but that's not true .. if everything else is open why this temple complex is not maintained and open. It needs maintenance, cleaning and care. At present it looks like some abandoned site.People charge parking fee but don't give slip, temple priests ask you to donate good money. Someone from the trust or Rajasthan govt pls intervene and take care of this wonderful place."
Galtaji_Temple,Rakesh,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Worst state of such a superb attraction,"Do not make mistake of going. It was closed during Covid amd then reopened without any cleaning. Main part is still closed. Worst cleanliness. Rs 30 for parking and Rs 100 per camera phone and there is nothing to see except ruins of old building and local people and lot of cow dung. My sincere suggestion: do not waste your time going here and my advise to Rajasthan Tourism department: Publish openly that this is no longer a tourist attraction and for God sake, do not charge any fee to see cow dung and ruins"
Galtaji_Temple,The Travel Curry,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Average experience,"Swarmed by monkeys (as they represent lord Hanuman), Galtaji Temple is located on the outskirts of Jaipur. The winding roads through the hilly forests feels like an adventure as you dodge cows and other domestic animals that reside in nearby villages. The main shrine with the pond was closed on our visit. Not sure if it was due to renovation or COVID restriction. We had to pacify ourselves by visiting other two adjoining temples, that have old architecture. Its the location and folklore that casts a spell on you. But the bunch of monkeys and a parking fee of 100 INR are turn offs. Also the surroundings need maintenance big time. The fact that the temple authorities made us register our details on a website was bit surprising. He said the registration is done in order to avoid long queues. But the temple premises was empty. There were hardly any visitors post the unlock, forget about a rush!"
Galtaji_Temple,Kajal saxena,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Worst experience ever,"Very terrible experience , me n my friends came from kota specifically to visit galta ji . At entry gate two individuals were sitting n denied to give entry by saying that galta ji is closed though it was open___ n after heated discussion they let us in___ then at galta ji main gate they were asking to pay 150 rupees per device then only they will allow us to enter__ reason they give its because of covid__ very rude and unlikely behaviour from these people__ i doubt if they are people assigned by temple authority or just some fraudsters filling their pockets ."
Galtaji_Temple,Nandini,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Needs mainbtainance,"We could not enter the temple due to the Covid restrictions in place but what we saw from the gates can be summarised to say , it requires attention. The monkeys are big in number and it is evident that they are often fed there. The location is beautiful and the road that leads you to that was also pictersque"
Galtaji_Temple,Anand Sharma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Monkey temple with jaipur walk,"Temple was out skirt of Jaipur. It was very peaceful, not commercialization. We booked a walking tour name Jaipur walk, their expert guide find this amazing places. In galta temple local people are coming to temple to take holy deep in the pond. It was amazing to see their rituals. People are very friendly with animals, some of them are feeding  cows, birds even some people feed small ants to. Then near hanuman temple near gate i saw lot of monkeys. It was a fun. Monkeys here are peoples friendly. monkeys are coming and take their food from peoples. Jaipur walk doing great job. they took us to less known places. It give a real experiences."
Galtaji_Temple,Sharon C,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Don't waste your time or money,"It took us 40 odd minutes to get here: somewhere we thought was a must see. Whilst the entrance fee is small, they charge you extra for even daring to use a camera and for using the toilets. I was approached by a man after using the toilets who told me they were not free. There were no signs anywhere alluding to this and when I asked how much, he said "" whatever I thought"". On payment, this went straight into his pocket. The site itself has the air of an open farm at the start. But the place has obviously been given over to the monkeys in every sense. They are everywhere. The place is filthy and litter strewn with razor wire along certain steps and there are begging bowls all over. Whilst we had experienced the litter of India, if this place is so special, then they have an odd way of showing it. The tanks had filthy, rancid water in them and I actually did not feel safe here. ( It was 5pm at our visit) We were so, so disappointed and appalled at the place that within 10 minutes tops, we were back at the car. It also seems that come the end of the day the Monkeys congregate at the way out: thank the Lord for a walking stick, when waved about the little blighters, took notice of us and stayed away!!! Yes, it is not much to get in, but they find all and every way to sting you for a bit more and it is a way out so needs a concerted effort to get here. It feels as if they think a few more Monkeys will add to the ambiance and people are flocking to see them, however, the monkeys are ruining the place, taking over and running amok."
Galtaji_Temple,Kil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Attacked by monkey,"Galtaji is unlike anything you will ever experience. Before heading there you must be sure that you are ready, both physically and mentally. I had done enough reading beforehand to understand what to vaguely expect, but even then, I could not be fully prepared for what was in store.As myself and my trusted companions uber‚Äôd up, our driver informed us that tourists rarely frequented there and that getting a taxi back would be difficult as it is so isolated. Our options were to pay the man extra to wait, or risk being extorted by the rickshaw drivers that operate there. We chose the former for a guaranteed escape route.On arrival we had to pay 200 rupees each for entry, with further charges to be able to use cameras. You could risk not paying the charge and sneaking a few pics, but I don‚Äôt think the local mafiosos who run the place would be pleased if they caught you. A man who called himself the ‚Äòmonkey master‚Äô then offered his services as a guide for the price of 150 rupees per person. While somewhat extortionate, this is a key decision - take the guide to guarantee your safe passage. Refuse him at your peril.Following the monkey master inside the enclosure, we tried to take in the beauty of the temple and surrounding buildings. This was difficult due to the general sense of unease that had crept in among us, heightened by the lack of visible tourists/general people at the temple, as well as the incessant chanting coming out of the speakers that was almost straight out of a horror film. We felt heavily out of place. On the plus side there were many monkeys, and the place was quite pretty and picturesque, although poorly maintained in parts.We had heard rumours of a monkey king who offered blessings in exchange for generous donations. To avoid being extorted any further and getting tangled up in any more local mafioso schemes we steered clear however.As we made our way to the top of the temple, we received a warning by the guard that one of the monkeys had gone rogue and was biting people. Simultaneously, we spotted a large, bounding monkey with black skin and white fur at the peak of the mountain that stood out from the rest. He was thrashing about uncontrollably, and by the sound of his war cries was clearly the alpha/king kong that the guard was referring to. People were fleeing from the top of the mountain in terror, and within seconds king kong flew from nearly 100m away to about 15m from us. My unsuspecting companion, who was unaware of the situation, stood within dangerous distance. While his life flashed before his eyes, he called out in desperation, tears streaming down his face. Suddenly, a fearless hero armed with a brush began swatting at king kong - it was the monkey master! King kong fled overhead in response, and while we didn‚Äôt see him again, the possibility of his remaining presence kept us on edge. Near death crisis averted - the monkey master had earned his keep.It was fairly peaceful from this point onwards. We fed the monkeys with the help of the monkey master, took some pics and admired the beauty of the temple. There was one last test to come however, as the monkey master informed us that as it was approaching a certain time only recognised people of the holy class could remain in the temple, so we had to flee before that became an issue. We escaped, adrenaline pumping, paid the man and were on our way. Not the experience I‚Äôd expected from this ancient holy temple, but the one I needed."
Galtaji_Temple,Ria Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Beautiful and ancient temple,"Good surroundin, natural water lake.but lack of maintenance though lots of traveller's were there from India and abroad."
Galtaji_Temple,Russell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Must see Monkey Temple,This is a magical place and well worth a visit. Our driver dropped us at the gate and we were met by a guide called Abdul. I highly recommend him. He is the monkey master. He helped us feed the monkeys and keep them under control. He has been a guide for 15 years and can tell you all about the temple. The temple is really beautiful. In the afternoon many Hindu‚Äôs bathe in the water as they believe it helps their wellbeing. 
Galtaji_Temple,Himanshu Bhatt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Nice scenic view,"The temple is situated outside city and there the 2 gates you need aprox 1 to 2 hrs to visit the place , the view is really amazing."
Galtaji_Temple,Gidons51,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Nice monkeys temple , not a must .",This is a temple from the 15 century with a few temples inside . There are a few sacred water ponds which are used for bathing for blessings .all the grounds are full with monkeys that look for your feeding . Entrance 1.5 USDLRS. Camera using 2 USDLRS.
Galtaji_Temple,harley7642,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Very interesting temple in a fabulous setting,"Hired a guide at the gate. Really nice guy, spoke excellent English and provided all of the peanuts we needed for the monkeys. Protected us from the naughty ones as well!!! Paid a small fee for a photography pass but there is no entance fee. A very intriguing place in a beauitful setting, very peaceful. Excellent place for photographers, also a great place to see leopards after sundown!!"
Galtaji_Temple,Ainsley S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great experience,"The temples are interesting and beautiful but really we came for the monkeys! We got a guide at the entrance who showed us around the place, explained all about the temples, the different pools of holy water for bathing and, of course, helped us feed the monkeys. We bought some peanuts at the entrance for them and with the help of our guide we fed them and had them sitting on our heads - the kids loved it! Our guide spoke excellent English, took great photos,was knowledgeable and we enjoyed sharing a cup of chai with him. A must do especially if you‚Äôre travelling with kids!"
Galtaji_Temple,Ryan,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Lovely but full of crooks,"If you like monkeys and scenic temples this is the right place to come. Beware of the entry gate, they will request 50 rupees per person for taking pictures however they only ask forgeiners. I don't mind paying entry fees but it is clear from the up-keep that the entry fee does not go back into the maintenance of the temple. There was a 'holy man' that beckoned us over to perform a blessing and then asked where we were from so he knew where to pitch his price at the end of it. Please note there was no mention of a fee for the blessing beforehand and he was very insistant that we had one! Unhappy with the fee we gave he requested more, similar to another 'holy man' in this temple that sat with a tin requesting donations. Never in my life have I been to a Hindu temple where this happens, very disappointing. I hope the government takes this site over and does away with this. Again I am happy to pay fee if it lines the right pockets!"
Galtaji_Temple,Shobha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Nice temple,There are lot of monkeys here . We brought some food for them like peanuts . Temple is nice . One gets positive vibes from here . Will love to visit here again
Galtaji_Temple,Girraj Sonkhiya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Peaceful Place.,Galtaji temple also known as the monkey temple. This is one of the best and famous temple in jaipur. The time you entered in the temple you will find the monkeys and monks all nearby. One of the holy places where you will find peace. Peoples also take baths in the kund. There is one temple on top of the mountain named THE SUN TEMPLE it holds a beautiful view and the path is also good for trekking. For me this place is best attraction.
Galtaji_Temple,WhiteMouseBurrow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,The famous temple complex,"The temple complex is a sacred place associated with Hanuman. And it is not surprising that a large number of monkeys live on the territory of the complex. Very friendly monkeys, as communicate mainly with local residents, not tourists."
Galtaji_Temple,carleton23,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Monkey heaven,"We went to see the monkeys, of which there are hundreds of macaques who come to the temple for food (apples and peanuts). The temple complex is rather neglected, but is interesting in its situation in a rocky gorge from where water flows into the temple pools. These are bathing pools for men and women (separately). The temples are crumbling but still have lovely frescoes. If you engage with the 'monkey king' he will expect a tip, but he will let you feed the monkeys and take your photo if you wish."
Galtaji_Temple,MR Max,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Cool place.,"Really nice experince! Beatiful place. Not alot of people (we went on a sunday around 11, but slot of monkeys :) . Ask for the monkey master Ricky, he will show you around and protect you from the monkeys, hes also a really good at taking pictures. We bought peanuts at the entrence that we gave to the monkeys and paid 50 rupies each for brining in the cameras."
Galtaji_Temple,HEMANT SINGH NEGI,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Average Place,"Though the surrounding and architecture is very beautiful but its totally neglected.Full of Cows, dogs, monkeys and hence the place is full of dirt because of them as nothing is maintained here by temple committee or Jaipur Development Authority.The temple is located outside the city hence one have to go especially on this route to visit the temple. But I felt not worth of coming because of the dirty surroundings.Otherwise it was ok... its covering a big area and one has to climb enough steps to reach the main temple.Thus I would like to add that even only if you have time then go to this place, don't sacrifice any other place in your mind for this place."
Galtaji_Temple,Andrea Christine Clifford,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Extremely Neglected ,"My advice is to be prepared! Tour guide drove me to this place on my second day.I found it interesting but depressing...terribly neglected and full of shady people wanting to take your money.I did not feel safe here, as there are many unpredictable monkeys, it is filthy, smells terrible and filled with untrustworthy people lurking around.However, the surroundings were interesting and I was able to take one or two interesting photographs."

Galtaji_Temple,ukrishnaswamy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Holy Waters,"A natural spring was discovered up a small hillock again in Rajasthan, close to Jaipur. On my way to Chand Bouri, I stopped here.

Galtaji_Temple,shyamsunderc2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Visiting Galtaji Kund and Temple,"On the eastern fringes outside the pink city there is a mountainous region in which is situated the holy Galtaji. From a Gaumukh water falls from the mountain into three kunds (somewhat like small ponds) separated in height. Historically the three kunds were perhaps made for separate bathing by men, women and children. Presently only one kund was open for bathing. Place is famous for bathing on the occasion of Makar Sankranti falling around 14/15th January every year.There is a small Shiva Temple besides a bigger Hanuman Temple nearby. Monkeys in hordes are freely roaming around the place.Although well endowed with scenic beauty and mountainous surroundings; place is dirty, poorly maintained and unkept. Still quite a few foreigners can always be sighted taking photographs and making videos.The spot has a great potential to be developed into a beautiful tourist place if cared for by the local authorities."
Galtaji_Temple,NaomiScott32,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"AKA Monkey Temple, beautiful but watch the guides and it's a long way back","At Galtaji you start at the bottom of a steepish hill where you can buy banana's and nuts to feed the monkeys.  A ""guide"" didn't ask us if wanted a guide but just walked with us feeding the monkeys and talking to us about the temple.Once at the top you feed the monkeys and get an incredible view of the city, then you travel back down the other side of the hill again steep and pot holey to the temple on the other side.  It's quite steep and very slippy, I stupidly had a pair of juti's on from the monkey and kept slipping over.  The temple itself is beautiful, there's a small temple at the front where you can be blessed (donations of course are welcome).  If like me you're lazy and wore inappropriate footwear for scrabbling up and down steep hills there is a guy with a motorbike who'll bring you back for 300 Rupee's however it's a tad frightening experience.Our ""guide"" was very pushy at the end suggesting we give him 800 Rupees which we refused and gave him less.  This was early days in India for us and we should have negotiated before heading off, 150 Rupee's is reasonable."

Galtaji_Temple,Kris_Toor,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Interesting but held by local mafia,"It is a nice complex of temples that offers a view of the city id you come from the side where the Sun temple is. But as some of the reviews pointed there is a rather weird payment system. They charge you for a camera but yet they do not charge you for the phone. Many of the latest models of phones have much better camera than mine. Anyways, the guys taking payments don't look anything like authorities. Totally contrary they just casually sit and ask you for money. On the ""receipt"" that they give you they handwrite the price so there are no ""rules"" for how much you pay. We were there with friendly local and he did warn us about those practices. So there are weird mafia-like practices going on and everyone knows about it. Local not paying it is quite normal in India the prices for locals are usually around 10% of foreign prices or non. Which is fair taking into account economy of the country. On the second thought I just remember that on my way back there were 3 young guys that were rather aggressive towards me and tried really hard to get their hands on my camera. Summing up, the place is interesting and worth visiting. Yet, it needs more care taken of and security, as there are some shady business going on. Go see it, with a group and a local guy and don't miss the sunset from the Sun temple."
Galtaji_Temple,ErnRam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The gentile monkeys!,"My goodness, our simple offerings of banana's to the monkey families, in the surrounds of this historic and revered site, will always be such a memory for us.Thank you Devraj our Butler from the Sujan Rajmahal Palace for sharing."
Galtaji_Temple,Tarique S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING,"This Temple is dedicated to Galta ji (Grand son of Brahma ji, as per hindu religion). The best part of Galta ji Temple is its location. It is located in a gorge on the outskirt of city Jaipur. If you love trekking approach this temple from city side. From this side you first have to walk up hill and then downhill from summit to reach this temple. If you don't wanna walk much, approach this temple from Rani Bagh side. From Rani bagh side you can explore this little garden and the temple as well. To reach Rani Bagh, one has to travel 5 extra miles. This place is worth visiting. Beware of Monkeys, though they are friendly and no case of monkey bite has been reported yet. Just avoid carrying any food in hand. Sellers at entrance would try to sell you food for monkeys. Buy these only if you are not afraid of monkeys."
Galtaji_Temple,archrsmith,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Interesting place to visit but different than expected,"We took a tuk-tuk to the edge of the city and then hiked up the switchbacks to get to the monkey temple. I think all in all it took an hour to hike up, see the monkey temple and come back down. The hike up offered nice views of the city, if you can see through the smog! We paid 50 rupees each to a guy standing at the front of the temple though I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt anything official. There were no monkeys swimming in the pools, understandably so, the water was green! There were monkeys around though, not the hundreds I was expecting. They were also quite aggressive and most seemed to be fighting or chasing each other. The temple is beautiful and I was glad we went regardless of the monkeys. It‚Äôs so disheartening to see such beautiful architecture in disrepair and surrounded by trash. It‚Äôs too bad someone hasn‚Äôt kept up the grounds as I would have gladly paid a hefty entrance fee! I‚Äôd still recommend paying a visit, just don‚Äôt expect the romanticized vision some of the guidebooks paint!"

The colorful saris mixed with the architecture was so beautiful my eyes could not get enough!  And then the monkeys.... wow, so many and lots of babies as well.   And to see the women twirling in their saris to the music was simply fabulous!!  This was definitely one of my favorite stops along the way."
Galtaji_Temple,Jim W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Business,Unique Experience - It is Known as the Monkey Temple for a Reason,"It is an amazing old temple set in a valley away from the city.  You will not be disappointed in the monkey population, which is the main draw for western visitors.  It is a bit of a hike to get to the back portion of the temple but you should make the effort if you are able.  You are allowed to feed them (mostly fruit) and I was never in fear of being molested by any of them.  It is a unique experience in a beautiful setting."

Galtaji_Temple,LoneStarTripTaker,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Unique Experience ,"This turned out to be one of the most enjoyable places we visited in Jaipur. This unusual and unique temple is off the beaten path.  The drive there itself was interesting because we got to see so much of the non-tourist parts of Jaipur. Once we arrived, the temple is architecturally interesting and well worth the visit. Monkeys are everywhere and add to the overall experience. Part of the temple includes ritual bathing areas where the local boys frolic and swim. It was a fun to watch the boys dive from the cliff and ledges as monkeys played and stood watch over the scene. The kids were a lot of fun because they were just as interested and excited to see Western tourists as we were to see them. Hard to describe but well worth 2-3 hours (including travel time) to relax and stroll around a truly unique place. "

Then there is a steep walk to the top, which offers an amazing view of the city "
Galtaji_Temple,adisrinoida,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Worth a detour,"The temple in itself is huge and spectacular. Do not go if monkeys freak you out. Or, you can hire a ""guide"" whose basic job is to teach you to feed the monkeys, and to keep them away from you if it gets overwhelming. The ""pool"" or kund has refreshing water and you must take a dip in it. Given the crowd, the dip is definitely not recommended for females."

The advantage is that you get to see another temple on the way called the Sun Temple.From the back: a lot easier to access and the drive is 5-10 min longer."

The monkeys were so much fun to watch. Yes there is garbage in places, but unless you plan to clean it up yourself, it is likely best to focus on the beauty and the positive.

Galtaji_Temple,Aman Choudhary,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,DISAPPOINTED,A rather nasty turnout to a beautiful place which it was. The authorities who charge double from Foreign Tourists and nothing from Locals should at least try to keep it clean for both of them. The place is stacked from monkey poop all over the water is as green as a fresh cup of Matcha and it is embarrassing to face our guests and overhear what they have to say about the state of this place which was a haven for religious and traveling seekers in Rajasthan. Strongly not recommended to visit as this is a gem lost in ignorance.

Galtaji_Temple,Ricardo R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Not a wonderful place but it is Ok,"Coming from Pink city we passa gate and there is a good climbing to get to this temple, but we enter from the back not from the main entrance on the other side, so we escape the charge for cameras, it is not for the money but it is easy to get to this temple from the rock path from the Pink city. Anyway if comeing this way do not show your camera until you passed the pools or they may make you go to the entrance wich is a bit far. there are two pools, one for men and a bigger one for women, but I saw only locals entering the dirty waters,  not a good idea for westerns."

He said it was free to enter - which is technically true, but as soon as you go through the gate the 150 rupee 'camera' fee is demanded. The whole place smelt awful and the monkeys are everywhere. Next we were invited to enter a prayer room, where we were blessed and then 100 rupees EACH was demanded by the young person. The buildings are not impressive and glad to get out after 20 minutes - which I will never get back. Don't bother visiting."

So as son as you get out of the main Jaipur city and on to the highway, the drive is awesome, good highway road for most of the way. Well worth the drive.The temple itself was quite deserted, well not a lot f humans around, but hundreds of monkeys!!! It is locally also called as the Monkey Temple, very aptly. As always, like with most of the cultural sites in India, the cleanliness could off course be taken care of. People come in, fed the monkeys, but the cleanliness is not up to the mark, so you can see half eaten fruits and vegetables rotting all around. If you have an extra day in Jaipur, only then would I suggest a visit here."

Really enjoyed watching the monkeys swinging in the trees, chasing each other & frolicking in the water. The setting is quite beautiful as well. Definitely worth a visit. I'm told it's particularly beautiful after the rainy season. We visited when it was very dry and there were still plenty of monkeys. There is no entry fee but there is a 50INR camera fee that is collected (& receipt issued) near the entrance. For those concerned about the walk to the temple it's not very far & you don't have to climb up the steps to the second level."
Galtaji_Temple,jdulisse,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Mixed Emotions,"Prior to our visit to Jaipur, I decided I wanted to visit Galtaji simply based on some of the photos I had seen. I didn't do any research on the site which I regretted after being there - I think my experience would have been more enjoyable with some previously acquired knowledge. The reviews here on TripAdvisor are very mixed and I happen to agree with most of them. The temple complex itself was very unique, with a different look and vibe from anything else we saw in Rajasthan. It was relatively deserted when we went but after a week's worth of crowded tourist attractions, the general lack of people made us feel more like we didn't belong there instead of being a welcomed change of pace. We were charged entrance fees as well as the camera fee - our first mistake. We explored the first temple at the base of the hill (the one on the right as you're walking up). There, we were greeted by a priest who led us to a chained door that looked as ancient as he did. He unlocked the door and tried to usher us into a tiny chamber. This sent red flags up to my distrustful brain but after some coaxing from my boyfriend and the priest, I decided to go inside. The priest chanted what I assume was a blessing while he gently hit my boyfriend and I over the head with some peacock feathers and tied a string to both of our wrists. Then, of course, he demanded a donation. Our cash was already running low for the day and he was obviously displeased that we only gave him 100 rupees. We made our way out of the temple and continued on to the first water tank. We wanted to continue on to the other tanks and see the view from the top but we noticed a small collection of priests standing by the pathway up and just didn't have the money or the wherewithal to provide yet another tip we assumed would be asked of us. Looking back, I regret not seeing the entirety of the complex but at the time was frustrated at how easily my money was consistently being parted from me.As to the monkeys, they are plentiful but ignored us since we ignored them. If you're so inclined, it didn't seem difficult to engage them with the help of some food or a local's assistance."
Galtaji_Temple,satobt,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Bad condition,Cool looking building but the whole place is in terrible condition.  There are a lot of monkeys with free rein over the entire place.  You can get a tuktuk to drop you off towards the west of the temple.  The road from Jaipur ends at the hill.  Its a 35 minute walk to hanuman temple.  Otherwise if you go from the east of the temple the road is much longer.
Galtaji_Temple,harsimran21,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,A temple is a temple,you shouldn't expect enjoyment at a place which is for religious purpose. It is not well maintained. you can see a lot of monkeys. They never hurt you is the legend. 
Galtaji_Temple,sue j,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Horrible experience,"I researched this place before we went and was mentally prepared for the monkeys, and the scams or so I thought. Our driver took us up there and dropped us at the bottom gate.  We were already aware that there was no fee to go up to the temple, but that there was a 50 rupee camera charge. There is a sign to this effect at the bottom and I took a picture just as  a marker in order to identify  my photos at a later date. As we passed through the gate there was no place to pay the camera charge so I assumed it would be at the temple. A young couple, tourists, came over and asked us if we had paid anything and seemed a bit perplexed about the procedure so we decided to walk up with them. As we began walking up a man came over....he was very aggressive and accused us of not paying the entry fee. We protested that there wasn't one but he became quite heated, demanding 150 each, then adding that he wanted a further 200 each for the camera fee. We were sure he was not legit and refused payment to him for either. He then tried to send us out of the compound and insisted that we took our cameras back and left them in the car. We refused but the young couple were quite distressed by its agression and began walking back, but then had second thoughts decided to join us again. The aggressive man shouted a lot and we said we were perfectly happy to pay for the camera, but only to the right person. And that we would be asking for a receipt. At this point he bobbed into a temple and came out with a bit of paper, which was not a receipt book, all the time shouting at my husband who was refusing to give him these fees. At this point I took out my iPad and showed him the picture of the 50 rupees fees I had taken and told him I was now filming him and would take the video to the police....strangely he suddenly disappeared.By now so much time was wasted that the young couple said they no longer had the time to go up to the top as they were on a coach trip, so they returned. We carried on to the top. The place is filthy with rubbish and a valley walk that could so easily be beautiful is squalid. We felt like almost everyone was there to try to part us from cash, from the beggars, the overly dressed women and old men wanting to pose  for shots, but most of all from the temple people on the way up. The temple at the top has nothing to commend it other than a good view of .Jaipur. The monkeys by the way, were actually pretty well behaved and we saw them swimming in the filthy water that is supposed to be the ladies bathing pool. There was one highlight though, and that was a group of wild peacocks who were wandering about and who flew aver out heads and across the valley."

Galtaji_Temple,iamrawat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Peaceful dirty place,"Dedicated to the Hindu gods is this temple situated in the aravali hills at a distance from about 10-12 kms from the main city. The place has a great architecture with excellent reflections in the pond l, which is very dirty and really needs to be cleaned.. something not good about the Hindu worship is the mess it creates around the place. That said the temple can be approached from two sides, one the bazaar and second the transport Nagar side. I would recommend you take the transport Nagar route (especially if you on a two wheeler) because the road is good and not steep unlike the other way which is steep and not a good road.Needless to say that the place is fested with monkeys as it's also known as the monkey temple. Keep away from the monkeys they don't harm you unless you threaten them in any way. But if you carrying any food articles tlbe assured they will sense it and make sure it's their lunch üòÄ"

The priests/caretakers had told us that there would be a charge if we wanted to take pictures so we opted out. But when we got out of the gate, we took pictures of the surroundings and one of the priests shouted at us and cursing us. It was a horrible experience for us."
