This gateway was built between 1611 and 1667, and is a mix of Mughal and Rajput architectural styles. It honored the Mughal emperors and was dedicated to Lord Ganesh, the Hindu deity that ""removes all obstacles in life"". At its central and long arch, Lord Ganesh is depicted at an unusual and rare form - its image is in the profile. On its upper floor, known as ""Suhag Mahal"", delicate latticed windows allowed women of the royal household to observe other areas of ""Amber Fort"" while unseen from the outside. After crossing ""Ganesh Pol"", you will reach the beautiful persian ""charbagh"" style gardens and the famous ""Sheesh Mall"" (Hall of Mirrors) and ""Sukh Mahal"" (Hall of Pleasures), the most visited attractions within ""Amber Fort"". May Lord Ganesh protect your journey throughout Jaipur and Rajasthan! Enjoy!"

All of the fort is a photographers dream, but this gateway in particular is one of the best parts of it; be sure you explore all the court yard (there are baths to the left of this gateway) before walking through here into the hall of mirrors!"

Ganesh_Pol_Gateway,Rahul P Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Family,Beautiful Architecture,"From the endless variety of paintings and stone inlays eyes run! Very nice and picturesque. Ganesh Pol Gate is located in front of the pillared courtroom. The entrance (Ganesh Pol) leads to three palaces around a garden, the architecture of the gateway is a fusion of Mughal and Rajput architectural styles, which adjoins the villas and private reception areas. This area is decorated almost in baroque style by the amount of white marble, mosaics and small mirrors. The top of the gates have been decorated with lattice pattern as seen outside from the back side, which is also beautiful. It is a place that conveys much peace and one should be treated with the respect it deserves. Worth visit it."
Ganesh_Pol_Gateway,Erindel66,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Couples,Wonderful entrance to the heaven,"This is the feeling that people should have had when they came to visit the Maharaja at Fort Amber. This wonderful gateway leads you to the palaces of the Maharaja. It is dedicated to the deity Ganesh, which chairs the lintel of the main door. Please, spend a little time to admire all the paintings that decorates the gateway and also have a look to the latticework that cover all the windows, which allowed the pass of the wind so as to refresh and also let the women watch without being seen.Its a great way to enter in the world of maharajas after arriving at the main coutyard by elephant."
