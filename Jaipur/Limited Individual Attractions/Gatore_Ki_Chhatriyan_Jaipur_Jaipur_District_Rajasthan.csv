Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,exploredaunexplored,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Solo,My favorite in Jaipur! ,This place is off beat. Hardly any tourists. Amazing marble work. It is beautifully done. There is a calm to this place. You can sit and meditate. It's the resting place for the departed royal family. Please go with a guide. 
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Vidyadhar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,The greatest hidden gem of Jaipur,"The place is really, seriously, beautiful. It is not quite a popular tourist destination and is rather heard to reach but I recommend hiring an Uber here take a stroll and take lots of photo as this place is so worthy at every angles. Please be reminded that the complex contains three parts - make sure to visit them all. Each offers different artistic styles as well. If you have a time to spare (like, from Jal Mahal), please visit this place. You will not regret a second in here."

Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Angelo V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Not many tourists,"I saw it from the fort on top of the hill and wander how to get there. Right after the fort I went down and I wasn’t mistaken, it’s a gem , very nice temples and well preserved garden, which is almost never the case in India . Go there and spend a couple of hours, take your time , take a lot of pictures because it’s cámara candy and even the birds keep flyng around the temple which make it for Amazon pics. Enjoy"
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Marathon_Dreams,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Oft beat place to visit,"Not a well travelled tourist spot. But well maintained structures of bygone era. Looking at different domes, you will get an idea of how the era evolved. Its quiet with hardly any tourist. So we have seen 2 beautiful girls getting photo  shoots done with professional photographers, mostly for their portfolio. Our car driver surprised when we told him that we wanted to visit this place as it is not commercialized."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Orchid4841,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Tranquil and intriguing ...,"This place is a delight, so quiet and peaceful. There is much to see and photograph in this well kept and tranquil spot. Lovely to visit somewhere that wasn't crammed with tourists and that wasn't full of litter. The entrance fee is excellent value and I'd urge anyone to spend a couple of hours here soaking up the atmosphere."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Cheryllee1963,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,A must visit,My husband and I spent a wonderful morning here. There are so many cenotaphs of the Maharajas to see. It is beautiful maintained and perfect for photographers. It is so quiet and peaceful here. I can’t recommend this place enough to spend an hour or two. It is only 30 rupees to enter which is an incredible price.

Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Andrea Christine Clifford,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Solo,Jaipur’s Hidden Treasure,"A must see location of Jaipur, my tour guide surprised me with his favourite location at the end of the day, just when I thought I had seen it all. Peaceful and picturesque, it is almost a surreal experience, and now my favourite place too. The resting place of the former Kings of Jaipur, I recommend you spend some time at this special place. Photographs cannot capture the feeling you experience being there, it is a feeling of inner peace."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Navya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,"Beautiful, lush","The place is gorgeous, intricate designs can be seen everywhere, when I went it was even more beautiful because of the lush green trees. It's still a little unexplored so there werent many tourists around. "

Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,JLandMike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Hidden gem,Not a heavily visited site but it should be. Beautifully preserved and deceptively bigger than it appears from the outside.  30 rps to enter and you are transported back in time.  Lovely views from the top and some great photo opps.  No guides in sight so either read up before or after or simply enjoy all that Incredible India has to offer.

Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Cloud_Matt,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Very pretty intricate stonework. ,"Our best advise; if he is there get a tour from The Gardener - he proudly showed us round and explained everything. In return we have him a small tip. His enthusiasm for the place is captivating. We were the only people there, able to wander round and enjoy the mountain surroundings. "
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Puha P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Quiet & beautiful architecture! ,"Surrounded by green hills, the Gatore Ki Chhatriyan is a complex of temples and tombs in the foothills of the Nahargarh (Tiger) Fort. It was the royal crematorium for the majestic rulers of Rajasthan. The beautiful edifice also has a cenotaph for each of the more famous maharajas cremated there. Engraved with beautiful Rajasthani carvings, the cenotaphs are one of the major attractions of the place. The cenotaphs are shaped like umbrellas (chhatris) and hence the place is called Gatore Ki Chhatriyan. Lots of photo opportunities here! "
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Nhuong N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Beautiful structures can't be missed.,"I would vote second after Amber fort in Jaipur.

Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Laura Gillis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Gatore ki Chhatriyan,"These are beautiful old tombs of Rajasthani royalty. The area is peaceful and quiet. You really have to dodge tip hungry men wanting to be your guides, though. "
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,jdash_01,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,An Amazing Surprise!,"My wife and I got a tour guide for the day, and he recommended this place, said it was his favorite spot in Jaipur. We trusted him, and it was TOTALLY worth it! First place we went in the morning, and it was completely empty. Really beautiful buildings and designs, and way bigger than it looked on the outside! It ended up being one of our highlights from our days in Jaipur. Highly recommend it!"
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Aida234,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,A hidden gem in Jaipur,"I don’t understand how this isn’t rated much higher on trip advisor? I visited the other sites recommended but this was one of the best places by far. When you visit here, it’s incredibly quiet and hardly any tourists - it’s nestled away from the crazy traffic so you truly feel like you’re in a little Indian paradise. We spent an hour just wondering around the buildings and sitting there in peace watching the birds fly overheard. I felt like I could easily sit there all day and stare at the incredible buildings. I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to get away from the busy tourist areas and just wanting to appreciate the beautiful Mughal architecture. "
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Richard G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Great,As all the others say this is a little tranquil paradise tucked away and a chance to walk around at your pace without being hassled.
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Leah B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,"Beautiful, who knew !?!","This didn’t come up as a top place to visit when I was researching my trip, but it was on the composite ticket and our home stay host suggested we stop on the way to Amber Fort. It was beautiful and serene and it’s not to miss! There aren’t tour guides here but one of the employees ended up giving us a tour and the history or the place. This was one of my favorite things! "
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Johnsculptor,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Tranquil gem,"The memorials built of local and Carrara marble are set in a tranquil valley beneath the Tiger fort and Gary Ganesh temple. The architecture and placement of the memorials is wonderful and almost devoid of people. Behind the memorials are some original water storage sites and a small temple complex beautiful because of its location and lack of tourists. The quality of the carving on the buildings is fist class, most carved on large blocks. Combine this with a walk up to the Ganesh temple on the top of the hill, fabulous views and a nice walk. As you go up the steps there is a less steep route on the left that meanders up the hill in the shade, beautiful. For the more adventurous you can also cut across to the road leading to the Tiger fort a lovely walk passing donkeys traveling up and down the hills. "
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Gourav99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017,This place a hidden gem,"This place a hidden gem, I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Jaipur .The place is a few minutes drive away from the Jal Mahal, the entry fees is just Rs 20 with no camera fees. This place is every photographers paradise . All the sculptures are so beautiful you fell like you are visiting a mini Taj Mahal. Even the maintenance of the place is just top notch, the grass well trimmed and the sculptures are regularly scrubbed clean of dirt. Its an awesome place for a pre or post wedding shoot. The best part is that its not crowded at all like the other forts and palaces in Rajasthan."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,hnybhardwaj,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Royal memorials built for royal family,"We visited in Aug-2017 first week. As other reviews suggest, this is not a popular spot (probably because Hindus don't prefer visiting cremation grounds/memorials as tourism spot) and there is small entry fee. Each memorial is a fine piece of intricate art however sadly there is no plaque/signage put to explain significance of the memorial or the individual in whose memory it was built. Memorial in the memory of the previous king is still under construction. The place site is very peaceful, located close to a temple for which you need to climb good number of steps. Many foreigners visit this place to click photographs. You may consider visiting this place if you have ample time to explore Jaipur."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Awender,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,OK OK Place,I dont really see the purpose of visiting this place. The place is rigged with some tombs and has some historical significance. But on a sunny day this is something one should surely skip.
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,NoelnGeraldine,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Worth a short visit ,Crematorium for the Royal family of Jaipur. Stunning architecture. Only 30rps entry. Well worth a short stop . Great photo opportunities. Make sure you have a guide to explain the history of the place. Very quiet and peaceful. 
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Paridhi7392,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Couples,Royal building,Gator ki Chhariyan is awesome Royal building. it looks amazing. Mind blowing place for photography view.
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Mairead R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,A breathtaking deserted temple ,"If you get the chance to see this place, do it! Extremely beautiful and unique, you will likely be the only ones walking around this place. Be careful about going in the heat of the day as shoes must be removed and we burnt our feet a little! "
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Vinay H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,"Whoa, a Photographer's delight","A short review - ""This place is amazing to take photographs in"". Uncrowded, quiet, clean and lovely carvings, this place is a delight. A restroom would be a great addition. You could spend a quiet afternoon or a couple of hrs here en-route the Hawa Mahal"
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Steve B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Surprising!,This place doesn't sound much fom the reviews but it's a lovely place to visit.Clean and looking gorgeous in the sunshine.30 Rupees to go in.Several tombs of maharajahs going back into the hills is succession.A dramatic location with walls and steps disappearing up steep hill side.Worth climbing the first set of steps to the right for a fabulaous view of the whole complex.Well worth a visit for an hour or so in its own right.
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Amie N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,Stunning Tombs in unexpected quiet corner of the city,"This is worth checking out. I got my hands henna-ed first by the lady at the drinks cart right beside it. She has lots of gorgeous designs. Then I was shown around the tombs of the kings by a funny little man who had lots of stories in pigeon English, while the henna dried. After 30 minutes, she put some oil on and off I trotted refreshed and ready to see the Albert City Museum."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Rebecca V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Monkeys!,"If you like monkeys then this is a great place to see lots of them roaming around! The buildings are also pretty, however there are no toilet facilities which can prove a bit risky if you have Dehli belly!"
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,joshisandeep,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Real Royal architecture,This is the real architecture of Royal rajasthan herein Royal cemetery are there and made chatriyan for them.
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Freckle_Eye,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Also known as Royal Gaitor Tumbas,"If your an avid photographer this is a stunning place to go and take some amazing shots, the architecture and the marble statuses and carvings are truly beautiful.Best time to visit is in the evening at around 17:00, much more quite and starts to get a little cooler at this hour which makes it much more enjoyable :)The one thing that put me off this place was the wild monkeys, be wary! Do not engage with them and walk away if they start gathering, I was surrounded and had to leave at a run, quite a scary experience from that point."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,JaipurAbhiraj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Hidden treasure but no washroom inside,"Beautiful built perfect place to see. Indian visitor fee is twenty rupees and there are some small shop at the parking area  where you can buy cold drink ,mineral water, and chips.Parking is free on this site. Take care of monkeys inside the monuments as this is located on the foothills of Arravili hills,Take water bottles inside in summer season as no drinking water inside also there is no washroom and toilet inside the monument."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Samarpreet88,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Very Calm & Architectural Place,On my last vacations i saw this place in Jaipur very interesting and calm place.serene & traditional
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,thebonbondundee,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Beautiful,"Costs approx 30pence to enter and inside are many beautiful buildings. We spent 30minutes walking round. It is very hot and dusty (they are currently creating another building), so take water to keep you cool. If you are interested in henna, a lady with a fruit cart does amazing henna, you should just come the are just for henna from her!"
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,India_Expl0rer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,"Beautiful, calm and serene place","We had very less time to visit this attraction but it was worth the every minute spent. We came here after visiting the Amber fort so it was so relaxing after all the chaos there. There were only 3-4 foreign tourists there. The entry fee for Indian nationals is 20 rupees. (Don't know about the foreign tourists as it was not written there). The guard sitting there was giving the entry slip only when asked to. These are the tombs of the royal family of Jaipur. There are three phases.All are beautiful but the third one is the exceptional, made up of Italian marble and minute carvings on the ceiling and pillars. The whole place is set amidst hills. A temple is also inside the premises near the second phase. There are a lot of baboons around. peacocks are also common. You can sit here for a long time as there is no hustle and bustle. Really enjoyed the visit."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Flávia C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,Peaceful and hidden place,What a precious place outside the beaten path!It's well worth a visit and it takes only about 45 min to go around the place. The architecture is just amazing and exploring the place is intriguing.It was the royal crematorium for the majestic rulers of Rajasthan. This incredible place has a cenotaph for each of the more famous maharajas cremated there and they are all engraved with beautiful Rajasthani carvings. Just a jaw-dropping magnificent location.
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,ddevarshi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Couples,Cenotaph of Rajput Kachchawa Rajput kings of Jaipur,"This is duplicate entry for another attraction under name ""Roayal Gaitore Tumbas"" and is a place where Kings of Royal family of Jaipur were cremated. There is a separate place for cremation of maharanis (Queens). This place is on foothills of Aravalli. Special structures have been erected in their honour. Although tombs are characteristic of mughal or islamic architecture but in case of Rajput rulers chhatris are made. Chhatris are somewhat open structure where a canopy is supported on several pillars. Canopy is not a 'tomb like' or circular dome in chhatris but has geometrically shaped or has ribbed circular structure.Here, at Gaitore, there are 2 clusters of Cenotaphs. The back cluster (Northern) or the one away from entrance has more intricately carved pillars and panels. The rulers of Jaipur were devotees of Lord Krushna so the inner walls of canopy depict various scenes from life of Krushna such as Kalia mardan (killing of giant serpent), holding of goverdhan parvat, maha-Ras. Apart from that mythological scenes such as churning of ocean (samudra manthan) have also been carved here. Some of the marble carvings of these cenotaphs match Delwara or Ranakpur carvings in their finesse. You need to pass through narrow roads and crowded city to reach this place. However, once you reach here you will find that this place does not attract much crowd and is calm and desolate. There is an entrance fee of Rs 20 for Indian citizens. Parking is free. I could see no toilets inside the monument. There are some shops near parking where you can get tea, cold drinks, biscuits etc but no restaurant is there. The starting point for uphill climb for Garh Ganesh Temple is near parking. On your way to Garh Ganesh you can get bird's eye view of cenotaphs which appear like a miniature model from above."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,aviral812,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,Beautiful but waste without a guide,"Gaitore ki Chhatri is not a very famous place for tourists who visit Jaipur. It has a beautiful Rajputana/Mughal architecture and it used to serve as the crematory of Kachhwaha dynasty. However, no guides are available who can tell us about the history associated with the place. One is left to admire the beauty of the architecture and peaceful surroundings. It can be developed into a major tourist spot if managed properly."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Iman F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Couples,Beautiful Architechture,"Its a less known place of Jaipur and people don't often come and visit it coz its a crematorium! But the architecture is beautiful and exploring the various structures is intriguing,"
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Kris H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Solo,Nice architecture,Nice piece of architecture. When we where here there where absolute no tourist. You got a nice view over jaipur from the top of the temprl in the second courtyard. We did it without a guide and had no troubles. The main reason to visit must be the architecture and the silence of this place.
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Ranjan_K_Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Couples,Not much without guide,"Gaitore or Gaya Ka Thor (meaning, the last abode of departed souls) is the crematory of the Kachhwaha Rajput dynasty of Jaipur. The premises houses about a dozen cenotaphs of which seven are large in size. The first of these cenotaphs was that of Sawai Maharaja Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur and the latest is that of Sawai Raja Man Singh, the father of Maharaja Bhawani Singh, the last king of Jaipur. These cenotaphs present not just an important part of history, but also an excellent example of Rajput architect and craftsmanship.What really pinches a tourist is that there is absolutely no information about these cenotaphs. One would not even know which belongs to who. Thus to have a guide is a must. Had there been information plates about the kings and their period, the tourists would have felt value for money since it is a ticketed monument."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Josip D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Solo,Amazing,"If you are on the way to see the Amber Fort, make sure you make a stop at Gatore Ki Chhatriyan. Cenotaphs are just amazing. It's well worth a visit and it takes only about 45 min to go around the place. I would recommend this before many of the more popular and overpriced attractions in Jaipur. You can hire a guide at the entrance."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,JamesNYC212,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014,Without a guide it lacks flavor,The cenotaphs are not the most impressive that I have seen. The Scindia cenotaphs in Gwalior stand out in my mind. If I had a knowledgeable guide who could have shared some good stories about the monuments then all would have been better. The location is convenient to the Pink City. Even if there were some signs for tourists explaining the names and significance of the monuments that would have been better. It was a bargain. Only 30 rupees to enter.
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,KUSHAL PRATAP SINGH,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2013 • Family,Just AWESOME But make sure to have the GUIDE with you,GATORE ki CHHATRIYAAN is undoubtedly one of the best places to visit but CAUTION:- Make sure to have the GUIDE available at the place itself so that u can enjoy the memorable HISTORICAL FACTS of these beautiful CENOTAPHS otherwise it will just look like Any other normal monument
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,2009Lovetotravel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2013 • Friends,beautiful,"Visited in Aug 2013, on our way back from Amer fort. We spent about an hour. This is the royal crematorium site for Jaipur's royal family. A cenotaph was constructed in recognition of each of the more famous maharajas cremated there. The royal cenotaph is known as “Chhatris” (umbrella-shaped memorial).  The cenotaphs are engraved with magnificent Rajasthani cravings. The road to Gaitore is not too bad. Again no signs, so be prepared to stop and ask. Not many tourists at all. the day we went the only guide was on leave, so we really missed out on learning more. But the place itself is quiet and serene. no facilities, carry your own water as well.  It is one of the most beautiful monuments in Jaipur."
Gatore_Ki_Chhatriyan,Pawan S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,one of the best attraction-Jaipur,"Last April I was in Jaipur with my friends and we visited Amber fort and Gaitor ki Chhatriyan or we say  the Royol Gaitor exactly is a Royal family cenotaph and it is outside of Jaipur. and when you go for Amber fort that time you can visit this beautiful monument all stone nice carve work. we all recommend to visit this place and it is best to visit morning or late afternoon. there is no doubt Amber Fort is amazing but we also love to visit this Royal place. when you enter this complex you can see first the memory of  Sawai Man Singh II ( Mor Mukut Singh; August 21, 1912–June 24, 1970 ) was the last ruling Maharaja of Jaipur State belonging to Kachwaha clan of Rajputs. and in side all royal family as well.we like this place and recommend to all who want go to Jaipur."
