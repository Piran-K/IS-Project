They cited a few cases of their experience where their wishes were fulfilled by prayers here. We visited in the morning around 8:30 hrs when the Aarti was going on. We entered through Hawa Maha, walked a few meters, looked the palace on left side and reached the temple.  We were told that the Queen in the palace used to have a first look at the deity (in temple) from the palace each morning. The temple and the palace face each other. We removed our shoes in open area of the premises as people informed us that the shoes etc. are not stolen from here for fear of the Lord.A large number of devotees were there – more than 200 in numbers, but no chaoes! All were standing as one group and praying. The temple attracts huge number of devotees on all days for divine blessings of Lord Radha Krishna. Devotees throng the deity with full faith and devotion every day. The temple area is clean and very well maintained. While entering the Temple premises, we noticed on left corner some small structure on which was written “Masjid” in green colour.  How come such boards be hanged on a small building in Hindu Temple area? Is it a calculated game of anti social political people? For sure, it is going to create communal colors in future. State Government and administrative authorities must investigate and do the needful."

Govind_Devji_Temple,mathurshradha19,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Govind Devji Temple,"My experience of visiting Govind Devji temple over the last 20 years (being a native here):1. Follow temple timings from the website. Timings differ during summer and winter and special darshan timings are during Janmasthami.2. Lots of florist and puja item shops outside the temple. So no need to bring anything from home.3. Systematic entry and exit. Place to keep shoes in return for token. Do not keep shoes randomly anywhere as dogs and monkeys are in plenty here.4. For best darshan try to squeeze yourself for the front row. Camera is allowed!5. If you want to go inside the temple near the radha krishna, then talk to the pujari. Remember to dress in suit/saree if you want to go inside.6. Try to get tulsi and chandan offered to govind devjji. 7. If you want to conduct any special puja/darshan, talk to the puruhit and go in off season (not during bhadoo month/near janmasthami) due to crowd.8. Before the temple is a place where you can feed grass to cows. Also, you can feed pigeons. Considered pious deed to do so. All grains and grass available there itself.9. Separate counter for collecting prasad. 10. Near to the temple is City Palace and Jantar Mantar which are also good to visit. Just check timings, whicha re usually before 4pm. So plan trip accordingly. 11. Also, Hawa Mahal is walkable and so it JOhri Bazaar which are famous for shopping. 12. Just a few kms before is LMB Restaurant which is perhaps the oldest and safest place to relish traditional rajasthani food, jhewar, ladoo, phini and churma. Note: Parking is problematic. Take a cab/taxi to this place."

Govind_Devji_Temple,Vidya Anil D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Peaceful transcending end to the day,"I am from south India, and this temple was very different from the temples here. We went in the evening about 6 o clock, we walked from hawa mahal, after finishing up visiting it. But this temple is close to city Palace and jantar mantar. But since temple don't have time constraint, we went to hawa mahal after jantar mantr and then walked back to the temple.Visiting the temple is a good idea as after looking at the tourist attractions, in the evening you can visit the beautiful temple.We sat in the temple for a while, the atmosphere, chanting was mesmerizing. They close the curtains in front of the God at around 6:45. We walked around the temple there is lake behind and nice view of nargad fort(not entirely sure if it was jaigarh or nargadh). All in all nice end to out evening. We bought bead sheets outside the temple in the market complex, the quality was great it was priced at 1500 rupees, but we found other places selling it for much lesser, so you may want to look out for that.

It is worth visiting this temple while in Jaipur."
