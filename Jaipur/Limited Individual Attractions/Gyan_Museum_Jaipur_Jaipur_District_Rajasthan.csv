Gyan_Museum,Arpit Agarwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Gyan Museum- Must Visit Once,"The museum is a tribute to Late Mr. Gyan Chand Dhaddha. It has varieties of Textiles, Mughal Rugs depicting the entire hunting scene- the rarest! All over amazing experience, You can spend as much time you want :)"
Gyan_Museum,Nagendra Singh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021,Visiting Experience,"Suppose a theatre, event or an exhibition selling tickets or asking for appointments before the visit. And you discover the tickets/appointments are needed to be taken before the visit as well. Also, you are not sure on what grounds these are approved. Nonetheless, you go through a booking process with no revert from the other side. And travel more than 25 KMs to reach the destination just to discover that it is not open for visitors.I mean respecting your visitors time should be of utmost importance. You have a website that can show your schedule or critical information right? Use it then. Why a visitor could select a date of appointment on a date when no visitation is allowed. What kind of experience is that?"
Gyan_Museum,Turkoosi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Amazing beauty,"This private collection of different cultural items from India is just amazing, collected with exquisite taste. The architecture of the museum is really beautiful, modern and simple, designed for the collection to give the best impression of it. We had also pleasure to meet the son of collector and have nice lunch in the garden."
Gyan_Museum,arpanmehra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Something different,"It's very rare that you see museums in India, that too so well kept. The art and craft will make your experience great. If you want to do something different in Jaipur, this is a must visit if it suits your taste."
Gyan_Museum,919lz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,Absolutely wonderful - A must see in Jaipur,"Discretely hidden in an industrial area in the South of Jaipur, the Gyan museum is a perfect place to visit, away from the uproar near the city’s monuments. First, I have been impressed by the modernity of the architecture, and then stunned by the amazing collection of impressively well-conserved artefacts from all over the world, sometimes dating as far as from the 17th century.The atmosphere inside is very intimate. I have been given a private tour of the museum, so that I got to learn about India’s exceptional craftmanship (silver craft, textile, painting…). It was fascinating!It was a very unique experience, that I recommend to whoever comes to visit Jaipur."
Gyan_Museum,meetkabir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,A great way to start your day,"If you are someone who gets captivated with art, craft and gets lost into this unchartered terrain then Gyan Museum is surely going to entice you with it's fine collection and leave you in awe of things.I personally loved the collection of Hookah mouth pieces, watches and Glasses. It spoke its own story and how these would be priced possession since they would have interacted the most with the collector.The distinguishing feature among all the museum visits and this visit was the personal touch. Since we had someone to guide and lead us and it totally added to the entire experience."
Gyan_Museum,Dan F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Truly Beautiful and Intriguing - A Unique Experiance,"The Gyan museum is the repository of the collections of Gyan Dhaddha, founder of Gyan Jewelry.  Mr. Dhadda had an eclectic set of interests and a specific and particular taste level.  In other words, he was one of those rare individuals who has a great ""eye"" for the unique, the unusual, the beautiful.  His collecton ranges from the world's largest collection of hookah stems, to watches, to georgeous tapestries, to objects d'art, crafts, and paintings.  His collection was sourced from all over the world, but mostly India and Asia. This is an adult venue, I was fascinated, but I can imagine that teens, and certainly younger, would be unexcited.  For the adults it was a wonderful and worthwhile use of a couple of hours.  The building itself is unique, and the exhibit space has been meticulously designed and beautifully executed.  Fascinating."
Gyan_Museum,Sm0uli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,A great museum experience ,Situated in the Industrial  district in Jaipur this museum is worth the visit if you happen to be in Jaipur. Unique private collection of Mr Gyan and housed in a space that is designed superbly well and aesthetically very pleasing . Harneet who is the person incharge of showing us around was well informed about the collections.Appointments to be made prior to the visit. Must see for sure. 
Gyan_Museum,idahosail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,amazing collection in boutique museum,"If you are a serious about museums and want a unique and intimate visit to a museum with Indian and foreign artifacts from the 17th-19th centuries (and more), this place is for you. Based on the personal collections of Mr. Gyan Chand Ji Dhaddha, the gallery is a mind-blowing presentation of artwork, textiles, jewels, metalwork, game pieces, and much more. If you want to visit its best to fill out their inquiry form on the website to get a timeslot.The small but amazingly detailed paintings on rice paper were our favorite. Ms Harneet gave us a personal tour and filled in the back story to many items, both the item itself and/or the mythology behind the art.We spent two hours there to get a full appreciation of the presented collections.If you are also interested in custom jewelry, its worth a visit. There is no requirement to buy, or even to visit the show room, its a soft sell. The company sells most of its jewelry wholesale. But they (sons and grandson) are building brand recognition. If I wasn't retired and we were still accumulating jewelry we would have spent more time in the showroom, the work is exquisite."
Gyan_Museum,Nina8OS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Absolutely stunning,"Wow what a museum and collection. From the moment of arrival as you enter the building in the middle of an industrial estate on the outskirts of Jaipur you can’t help but to be blown away! First the architecture of the building is stunning and just perfect to house the amazing collection of treasures collected by this family. To be also shown their jewellery workshops was so fascinating and what an amazing company and experience this is. We were lucky enough to be shown around by Harneet Kaur, their marketing and communications manager and her knowledge and insight made the whole experience all the more fantastic. A must see place for all to see if you love and appreciate beautiful objects, architecture, amazing jewellery and a stunning collection of treasures."
Gyan_Museum,sahil b,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Gyan museum,This is a must good place which art culture history together.a place with incredible architecture and soothing ambience. this place has some amazing art effect and a great place to go for which include masterpieces from history and some amazing text  which can be a great part of learning
Gyan_Museum,Anthony H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Incredibly unique museum experience,"Located in a random industrial area on the outskirts of Jaipur, this museum is in an amazing designed building specifically created to hold the collection of gems and artifacts. Because we were the only visitors on the day we were there, we had a private tour of the entire collection. There is a cool synergy between the collection and the physical space. If you're into architecture this place is a worth a visit to see the building alone. Really unique experience that most travelers to Jaipur still don't know about."
Gyan_Museum,Travelbugged1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,A must see in Jaipur.,"This place is truly a hidden gem! Hard to find but when you do, it is totally worth it. This beautifully designed space. Our visit was elegantly conducted and was very educational.It was an honour to access the curated museum. We saw the factory and the skilled craftsmen at work. You could feel the vibe, the passion and the sense of aesthetics of the founder. A man of taste who you can discover through the visit. The brand is full of heritage and vision translated into the collection which they make with the most personalised experience. This is probably my favourite place in India, just because of the amount of thinking and style that has gone into making this space and designing the experience. Harneet the Marketing executive isa true professional and really represents the brand. Thank you thank you!"
Gyan_Museum,Nitza,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,"A Treasure Trove in the Sitapura Industrial Area, 30 Minutes from Jaipur Center","At a first glance, from the road, Gem Place seems like any other industrial building. That is, until you have the opportunity to enter the premises, open its doors, and then witness  this beautiful high tech and yet intimate museum.  Harneet from the marketing team welcomed me and gave me an optional tour of the manufacturing facility before she took me to the first floor and opened that huge door. WOW. The collection begun by Mr. Gyan Chand Dhaddha is stunning. The 17th century jeweled hookah mouthpieces were unique. The textiles and old jewelry were my favorites. I left with a goodie bag as well! The 20 to 30 minute drive is absolutely and totally worth it. Please note it is best to make reservations."
Gyan_Museum,amrita1308,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Business,A hidden gem in Jaipur Industrial area,"Gyan Museum  is a stunning example of how one man's pursuit of knowledge can become a source of collective learning. The museum houses over 2,500 treasured pieces, which he amassed during his lifetime including textiles, paintings, antique jewellery, vintage spectacles, rare inscriptions and objet d'art from around the world. A tribute by his sons, Suresh and Arun Dhaddha, the museum is a signature concept by French designer Paul Mathieu and is a must visit when in Jaipur!!"
Gyan_Museum,aparna p,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,Peace and passion,"Jaipur's riot of colours and crafts can often overwhelm the senses. Gyan Museum provides a refreshing change, with it's minimalist, contemporary design. The collection is amazing; from paintings to jewellery, objets d'art and massive textiles and it's incredible how this is all the work of one man. It's a joy to spend an afternoon pottering around the very chic space. Do pop by the Gem Plaza boutique next door. It's all the luxury and gorgeousness you expect of Jaipur, minus the 'noise'."
Gyan_Museum,rashmi s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,"Gyan museum is an experience in itself given its assemblage, display & architecture.","Gyan museum is beautiful tribute to celebrate Mr. Gyan Chand's love for art, culture and appreciation; constructed by his sons. As humbling is his mammoth collection so is the warmness of his family and entire staff. The pursuit of excellence is very much visible in both the museum and his family owned factory 'Gem Plaza'. A must visit gem of Jaipur."
Gyan_Museum,JMH252,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,A Real Treasure of a Museum Located in Sitapura,"I booked this visit directly with the museum before I travelled to Jaipur and I was not disappointed. Around 20-25 minute drive from central Jaipur. A very insightful tour led by Harneet. I thought the collection was wonderfully curated and the museum itself is really atmospheric and beautiful. A real eclectic collection which obviously inspires the beautiful jewellery currently handcrafted by Gyan Jewels which has its workshop onsite too.  I was lucky enough to view a selection of their current creations, some of them a modern take on Indian classics. Superb visit, thoroughly recommended."
Gyan_Museum,Heartfelt56,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,WONDERFUL SURPRISE IN SITAPURA,Such an amazing gallery with beautiful objects collected by this amazing man and exhibited beautifully by his family.

Gyan_Museum,nehaasthana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Business,"Experiential Museum In Jaipur, India","Hello Everyone, I am completely in awe to write a short note for wonderful work curated by Dhaddha family in memory of their father late Mr. Gyan Chand Dhaddha. Gyan museum is a wonderful walk into contemprory art curated by artist around the globe and collectiables from families private collection. I am a design & fashion educationist and had a lot of enthusisum to visit the museum and I must say it was beyond our expectation.

Gyan_Museum,akhild10,,,,"The Gyan Gallery is a truly remarkable destination in one of India's most beloved and beautiful cities. It opened in January 2016 and has quickly proven itself one of Jaipur's most remarkable destinations. Located in the official jewelry manufacturing district, it's very strictly open by-appointment-only and should be on the top of every visitor's must-do list. Designed by the renowned French furniture designer Paul Mathieu, the Gyan Gallery houses the private art collection of the Gem Plaza family. Assembled by the current owner's father, the collection features a jaw dropping array of art, textiles, jewelry, coins, furniture and myriad objet d'art on a scale that boggles the mind in its beauty, and quality. The interiors are a vision of cool white and gray spaces, minimal and spare, permitting the objects on offer to shine. Indian museums should take note of the respect given the priceless items on display, especially the manner in which the miniature paintings are displayed. No trip to Jaipur is complete without a visit to the Gyan Gallery."

The setting is very contemporary  and the  display and lighting are superb;  in addition each item is provided with a scholarly label. I highly recommend anyone with an interest in the arts to spend time here as the architecture, the design of the gallery and the items on show are a feast for the eyes and for the mind."

But once there - one is transformed into a world of luxury where every single millimetre and artefact is carefully thought about and curated. The selection of artefacts exhibited spans a wide period of time and product and is part of a vast privately collected lifelong collection of indian objects. The display cabinets highlight the beauty of the products and the space itself is magical, luxurious and tranquil. Though the displays are themed - there is no single overriding theme which is perfect for anyone wanting to get a glimpse of the diverse Indian art history.This small gem of a gallery is of world class and a true ""must see"" while in Jaipur. Visiting the gallery is in a single word - mermerising."

The setting is in a dark space that adds to the pleasure that the collection brings to the soul being uplifting and inspiring, the museum deserves contemplation and quiet to truly experience the treasures. The architecture of the museum is magical and in the mood of a dark and surprising Aladin's treasure cave.  The entrance to the inner sanctum is a by way of a majestic white hall watched over by a 2 meter tall carved malachite Ganesh. A spiraling white, smooth surfaced stair case leads to the main room of the collection.  The door opens to  pools of light on selected pieces of artistic treasures in textiles, precious metals, gem stones and finely painted miniatures  that span centuries of Indian history. This intimate architectural space best displays an important collection of jewelry, swords, ceremonial textiles, board games, spectacles and gem carved sculptures.  Not to be missed.
