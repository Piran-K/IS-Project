Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Probably the most iconic sight in Jaipur.,The Hawa Mahal is a beautiful and iconic sight. It is a series of 365 latticed windows created in a harmonious whole soaring up from the streets. It was to enable the ladies of the palace to gaze out into the town rather than being entirely secluded. It is well worth seeing. Be advised though that there are a lot of tourist shops on this street.

Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,KittyinLondon,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,5 min for photos and you're done,We saw this about 10 times during our stay in Jaipur and a couple of times at night. It's much prettier at night. All you need is 5 min to pose for a photo. We didn't venture inside as people told us it could get very crowded in narrow passageways and there wasn't much to see past the facade. You can get some geat photos from cafe's across the street
Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,Rishi S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Okie dokie,This place is hyped a lot but really it's nothing much to see....just a palace with a lot of small windows The crowd on that street really makes it difficult to even get a good picture of the Mahal.
Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,123GYPSY,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Huge and beautiful at night,Hawa mahal is located centrally and is a huge structure with many windows making it extremely breezy! Right outside of the hawa mahal is street shopping that I found more interesting. The road is normally having traffic jam throughout and it’s best to take an auto when visiting this place as parking can get tedious There are cafés on the opposite side of the road that offer good balconies for clicking pics
Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,tarun9369,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Mesmerizing ,Most people didn't know that Hawa Mahal can be seen from inside also...and it's not just a wall of jharokhas but more than that...entry ticket is rs 50 for Indian adult...you can go to various towers but the stairs are very narrow and only one side entry is allowed so be ready for waiting time...once you get at the top u can see various parts of old jaipur including the amer fort and fort walls stretching across the hills....

Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Striking frontage,"WHEN I first saw Hawa Mahal I couldn't believe how bright, sharp and colourful the frontage was.It is also known as Palace of Wind or the Wind Palace and was built in 1799 from red and pink sandstone.I haven't counted them all but it is said to have 953 small windows decorated with intricate latticework for the ladies of the time to look out on passing life without being seen.The palace itself is a five-storey pyramidal structure the top three floors of which have the width of a single room while the first and second floors have patios in front of them.But it was the striking colours of the frontage I will remember. Definitely worth a visit despite the contrast between the palace and nearby heaps of rubbish."

Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,ian m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Jaipur must-see.,The problem here is getting a decent view of the palace as it's situated on a very busy street and you're constantly bothered by hawkers and beggers. To get a decent view in comfort the easiest solution is to cross the road (not that easy) and climb to one of the high level cafes opposite (Tattoo was our choice) where for the price of a Coke you can go out onto the rooftop and stay as long as you like.

Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,Kate T,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,"Tour guide bring me to ""Crocodile"" shop","We went to Jaipur under so called a luxury trip by MxGxDX travel agency. Their tour guide very irresponsible. After fail to con us to buy at ""Crocodile shop"" he went missing in action for the plan trip suppose to choki dhani village. We heavily suspect there's a collusion between tour guide and the so called government approved shop that CON tourist.  In comparison to yesterday's enthusiasm, Tour Guide A's attitude has altered indifferently. After an hour of useless lingering around Amber Fort, Tour Guide A suggested that we go to a restaurant for lunch and then return to the hotel while waiting for the Mercedes E-Class to fix its air conditioning. All afternoon activities have been cancelled or postponed until the car's air conditioning has been repaired. There was no backup plan or additional transportation arranged by the trip agency (MXGXDX Travel). At this Jaipur town, tour guide bring us to buy super expensive goods. Please see photo attached as evidence!"

Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,kim buay p,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Gorgeous pink city,"I did a guided live stream walking tour of the pink city of Jaipur with Dilip from Heygo.He was an excellent guide who taught us so much about Jaipur's history, architecture and way of life. After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan. He explained why the buildings are all painted pink in the old town.  The city was painted pink to welcome HRH Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VII, Emperor of India), in 1876.  Many of the avenues still remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.   Even the buses are pink.  We also noticed that there are no policemen or traffic lights guiding the traffic on the roads but it works well among the citizens.  There was much honkings but it was not due to impatient drivers. It is just a way of life for the drivers to greet each other.  He showed us beautiful pink roadside buildings where the shops are on the ground floor while the businessmen and their families live upstairs.  He also mentioned that ladies in Jaipur like to dressed in bright colours to make up for lack of colour in the desert part of Jaipur.Even the street lamp posts are lovely.  When we reached the majestic and gorgeous Hawa Mahal, he explained that the facade with lattice windows were for the royal ladies to view the street processions without being seen.  There are many windows as in the past the Maharajas had many wives.  The pink colour for buildings is mandatory for the common people.  Dilip kindly allowed us to take very good postcard shots of Hawa Mahal.  However this rule did not apply to the Maharaja as we noticed the entrance to his Palace is not painted in pink.He also pointed out the flowers market near the temples as the flowers are used as offerings to the God,  Popular colours are red (which symbolises energy) and yellow (knowledge and wisdom)."

Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,Nandini,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Visual treat by night,"During the day, due to hustle bustle and over crowded streets , you might not enjoy jostling through the crowd., I ceretainly did not enjoy that. Also, in that area, all shops have their names in Hindi which I think is unfair as you cannot expect all to read the names only in that official language.  The same area once the shops close is a visual treat. It was lit up and it can blow away your sense. The only jarring point was the huge banner displayed with the covid instructions and the CM's face.  That for tourists, that was an eye sore.  The illumination though , takes away all the negative aspects"
Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,Exploration276081,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Wonder of Indian  architecture,"Palace of winds , a palace built by Maharaja Praatap singh in the year 1799 a.d.. I came to know during my visit that the palace which normally think and see is in fact the backside of the building , the frontside  is entered through Tripolia bazar and than we reach to a courtyard known as Rajendra hazari guards  now office of Jaipur Nagar Nigam. The Palace could be entered through a gate and than through a rampart could reach to the top to see the overlooking view of hawa mahal baza. I was told by our guide that the palace has 945 latticed windows  from where the ladies of the royal court could see the processions without being seen by public. I was also told by our guide that the widows have been built only with the help of lime only and there is no use of stone or bricks. The architecture is like a peacock feather because the Maharaja was devoted to Lord Krishna and peacock feather is the crown of lord Krishna."
Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind,travelnomadNZ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Stunning Sight Hawa Mahal,Hawa Mahal - Palace of the Wind was stunning. I saw it by day on an Intrepid Tour. I believe it would be amazing by night. The road and traffic was very busy so we didn’t stop long.Hint: make sure you have a guide familiar with Hawa Mahal so they can explain the history. Suitable footwear and clothing. A good camera (video option) and sunglasses.

This popular tourist spot that you see in my pictures is actually the back of the palace. I didn't go inside, didn't need to, coz the view from outside is good enough :-) lovely place for a photo op. The shops on the other side of the Palace are worth visiting for clothes/accessories shopping "
