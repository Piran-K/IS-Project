The temple contains a statue of Lord Shri Krishna which is believed to be the same statue that Meera Bai worshipped in the State of Mewar. This idol was saved from being destroyed during the Mughal attack on Mewar by Amer rulers & was brought to Amer. And for that very reason it is also known as Meera Bai temple. The striking architectural elements of the temple are a blend of different architectural styles taking inspiration from Mughal, Jain, and Hindu, Mughal ones. At the entrance of the temple, you will come across a beautiful marble archway which is being guarded by two marble elephants. Surprisingly, the archway and the elephants have been carved from a single piece of stone. The temple is connected to the Amer Palace having two entrances, where the first one leads you to the Palace and other one leads you to the Amer town. This temple was built beside the courtyard of the Amer palace in a way so that the queen could easily visit the temple anytime.

Jagat_Shiromani_Ji_Temple,Jim W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Business,Beautiful Small Temple Near the Amber Fort,This is less than a mile from the Amber Fort and yet nobody seems to go there.  Don't make that mistake.  I realize many are on a big bus tour and don't have a choice but try your best.  It is a temple to Krishna & Meera and it is good to have a guide to explain the story.  The detail inside and outside the temple is amazing.  I'm glad we had the opportunity to visit. There are many other sites to see in the same little area around the temple.

It is visible from back side of the fort. Trek down the fort from back gate and ask any locals around. Its also known as Krishna-Meera temple. Most of the people in jaipur are not aware of this temple. Its an excellent example of hindu architecture and feels like articians have poured their heart while carving various motifs."

Jagat_Shiromani_Ji_Temple,Arun S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Amazing and Peaceful,"This temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna and Meera Bai (one of its king in India). The temple architeture is mix of mugal, jain and south Indian styles. This temple was made in the memory of Jagat Singh, the son of king Man Singh, when fighting against Mugals. Legends says that on Jagat Singh death her mother demanded Mughal emperor to construct a temple in her son's memory. The cost of the temple in those days (1701 AD) came around equivalent to 982 thousand rupees in that time(which was huge for that time). This temple has the same lord Krishna idol which Meera used to worship in Mewar. It was saved from Mughals and brought here in this temple. You'll see Meera's idol placed next to Krishna in here.The architecture of this temple is amazing. Just next to it there is a Lord Gradua temple, which is amazing as well. It is very quiet away from the corwds. Entry to this place is free. Priest at this temple is very humble and tell the history very proudly if you ask him. There were many movies shot at this temple (Bhool Bhulaiya etc). Recently there was another movie scene shot here. Must visit when in Amer, i can assure that you'll be more happy that you decided to visit here."

Jagat_Shiromani_Ji_Temple,Tracy E,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,"beautiful temple, annoying 'staff'","we wandered over from the amber fort, and there was hardly anyone around, which was a relief after the crush of people at the fort. however, we climbed the steps and were immediately told we had to pay an entrance fee of 25r each. i researched a lot of places before our trip, and i didn't remember an entrance fee for this temple, so i was on guard after that. at amber fort, a security guard had sort of shanghaied us into a tour we didn't want, and this seemed to be heading in the same direction. the guy hovered around us after that, trying to lead us in a different direction, and we really just wanted to explore on our own. more (Indian) people started streaming in, and we asked him, didn't he need to go collect the entrance fee from them? to which he just looked at us blankly and wouldn't leave. maybe he didn't have any bad intentions, but we just didn't want a tour! we just wanted to walk around! why does everyone else get to walk at their own pace but not us? eventually, i had enough of being followed and we left which was a real shame because we barely saw any of it and the whole experience felt unsafe. before we traveled to india, i had read about a 'foreigner tax' and i expected to be overcharged for some things, but i didn't expect to be followed and lead around- that was actually kind of disturbing and made me feel unsafe."
Jagat_Shiromani_Ji_Temple,vini_phooh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Very serene and peaceful place,I liked the whole place as it was not crowded. It is an ancient temple which has great historical significance. Will like to go again if possible.
Jagat_Shiromani_Ji_Temple,BananaLu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Magical temple!,"I spotted this temple from Amber Fort and bugged my friends until we located it in the village down the hill (you might need to ask directions several times as people seemed rather confused on what temple we were looking for and where it was...). We went there late afternoon after finishing the forts visits and the sunlight made the temple look even better. It dates back to 17th Century. We did not find much information on it, but it is dedicated to Meera Bai (poet who was devoted to Krishna), Krishna and Vishnu.The sculptures are superb and perfectly well preserved. Some elephants sculptures and towers at the entrance are very impressive. It is a beautiful and peaceful place. Do not hesitate to sit and meditate. As most temples of that period, there is not much to see inside and distract you from the deity; the most spectacular is the structure and the outside part of the temple.It is totally worth a visit! Do not miss it as it is very different from the Rajput forts and palaces you will visit in this area. Totally magical!Note that there are few steps to climb, I doubt there is an access for disabled people..."

Jagat_Shiromani_Ji_Temple,Tom W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Peaceful oasis of calm,During a walkabout through Amer village we had a welcome break at this beautiful Hindu Temple. Although we were led to believe that it is often quite crowded our visit was very peaceful and was a welcome change from the cacophony of hooters which is part and parcel of everyday India when in built-up areas. A quiet place for reflection which afforded our guide the opportunity to give quite a detailed explanation of the various carvings throughout the Temple. We were allowed to take pictures within the Temple and also with the resident priest who was very accommodating. It is courtesy to offer a small amount for this opportunity.

Our driver had taken us to see the Elephants in their stables, so what could we do next? The temple is beautiful, built at the turn of the 15th/16th centuries.

Jagat_Shiromani_Ji_Temple,ddevarshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Couples,Old temple built by Queen of Jaipur in memory of her son.,"Amer town offers many small attractions apart from Amer and Jaigarh fort. If you are not short of time you can include this place in your itinerary. It is on way to to Amer Fort if you are taking your vehicle to Amer fort. However, it will not be possible to park car and see this monument on busy days due to traffic. The monument is under Archaeological Survey of India. It is said that Amer has about 300 temples. This is one of the best  temples of Amer area as it has many idols carved in stone. Many other temples such as Laxmi Narayan and Shiva Temple are built with plain flat stone blocks and are not exquisitely carved.If you intend to see this temple the best strategy would be to park your vehicle near Panna Meena Kund and walk upto this place. Public conveyance is available from Jaipur to Amer town from where this temple is hardly a kilometer away."

There is a path that connects the Amber fort to the Jagat Shiromaniji temple and this temple is a must visit when in Jaipur.The temple was first built by Queen Kankawati, the wife of Raja Man Singh for her son Jagat Singh in 1608. The main deity is Krishna and the temple carvings are exquisite.As usual the path between the temple and the fort are not very well maintained and there is trash lining both sides of the path at any given point of time. The Temple could also be maintained better. It is clean but the premises could be cleaner. But do not miss it as it provides some wonderful photo opportunities and can be combined with a visit to the fort. This temple is also not crowded and very pleasant. "

Jagat_Shiromani_Ji_Temple,megan g,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2012 • Couples,Local culture and Exquisite beauty without the tourist trap feel,"This was one of the most wonderful and surprising temple sites we came upon, located in Amer Jaipur, India behind Amer Fort. Built around 1601, It was simply gorgeous with its amazing giant marble and sandstone carvings of elephants and elegant pillars, grand stairway, and shrines to Krishna and Meera Bai that are still used by the locals. Be sure to ask what the bell is for at the entrance.  Our guide referred to it as ""Meera Temple"" so it was a little confusing for me to locate it online, so it may go by both names with the locals if you are trying to find it by tuk-tuk.  This was one of my favorite places we visited in India. There were no lines, and no fees. We simply pulled up, hopped out of our car and checked the place out. There were a few others there, but it wasn't too busy either. It didn't feel like a tourist trap.  Check it out, especially if you are in the area of Amer Fort and want the feel of something a little more quaint and local, but with culture, history, and exquisite beauty.  There are several web sites to read up on the history of the Meera Bai and Krishna and Jagat Shiromani Ji Temple if you do a web search and want more info."
