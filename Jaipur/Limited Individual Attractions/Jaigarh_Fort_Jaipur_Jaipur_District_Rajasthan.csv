Jaigarh_Fort,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,A large fort that dominates the skyline of Amer.,"Jaigarh Fort looms over Amer Fort and would have provided a last line of defence. The fortress is sprawling and has gardens and museums within. It also has a large cannon, the Jaivana Cannon, that is one of the larger movable cannons in the world. It also has great views overlooking Amer, which is very impressive. The only detraction to this wonderful place is that people insist on driving their cars inside the fort, which takes away from the experience somewhat."

Jaigarh_Fort,singhasam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,"Mighty cannon, stunning views.","A WEALTH of attractions lie in wait for any visitor who makes the effort to clamber about in this hillside fort overlooking Jaipur.It formed part of the city's defences and was built in 1726 to protect the Amber Fort and its palaces complex below.Top of the the list of things to see has to be the colossal 1720 Jaivana Cannon which, at 50 tons, is claimed to be the biggest in the world.This artillery beast swallowed 50kg cannonballs for fun and when it was test fired using 100kg of gunpowder it fired a cannonball 22kms. No wonder people didn't attack the fort!A museum area inside includes some of the cannonballs together with collections of weapons and other artefacts such as shields, helmets and arrows.For me the views stole the show, dizzying panoramas down to the Amber Fort below and across to more fortifications on the hillside opposite.I also loved the views down on the other side of the fort towards more fortifications waiting for restoration. No one was allowed down there because of the threat of collapse and the risk posed by snakes but you could see the network of defences created all those years ago.Jaigarh can be combined with a visit to the nearby Nahargarh Fort and provides a very useful guide to how defences operated when viewed below from the Amber Fort. Fascinating visit."
Jaigarh_Fort,Anand D Nanavati,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Biggest cannon in the world,Very nice fort.  4 wheeler can go upto the top of the fort.  Beautiful view from top and large cannon on top of the fort.  We had a nice time on top of the fort.   Combine with Nahargarh
Jaigarh_Fort,satish7113,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Jaigarh Fort,"The best thing to see in Jaigarh Fort is the Jaigarh Cannon. It is said to be the biggest cannon in the World, that can through cannons at a distance of 35 Km. It uses 100kg of gunpowder to fire a cannon. It needs the power of 4 elephants to turn the cannon."
Jaigarh_Fort,Himanshu B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Friends,⚠️ cartel of guide and shops,Guide will not bargain on its fee because he will loot you by praising so much about shops product and will drag you into shop without completing tour. Product are fake and higly priced.  Don't come under their false claims and promises about quality and return policies.There is only canon otherwise it's average.
Jaigarh_Fort,ajay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Rajput Fort,Fort with the largest cannon in the world. The fort is a great example of preserved forts of the Rajput kingdom. The fort was constructed as an military fort for the protection of Amber palace. The museum inside the fort is interesting and also the shop by the Rajasthan government is good to buy stuff. The water storage tanks with the history of gold being stored are also very interesting.Taking Guide recommended.
Jaigarh_Fort,Lamberaj,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,Beautiful place covered with thugs called guides,The place is beautiful with a huge awe inspiring history but the guides are thugs. They give false stories and lead you to their internal shop of artefacts and manipulate you into buying. My strong suggestions dont buy from there. Go to only RTDC shops and buy as they loot you.
Jaigarh_Fort,ShyamKasturi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Very spacious fort that needs time to explore,"It is very spacious and large fort and needs considerable amount of energy, time and patience to roam around. Guides are available with fixed rates. It will take at-least 2-3hrs for checking out all major parts of the fort. Better not to go in a hurry schedule like 1hr or 1hr30min. in hand if you want to explore completely."
Jaigarh_Fort,Shravan B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Visit to see the huge sprawling courtyards and world's largest cannon,"This fort has the world's largest cannon and the fort is one huge massive structure like a maze There is a lot of walking and it is recommended to club this fort along with Nahargarh fortIf you are not interested in seeing the coutyards and the inner structure of the fort ,can just visit the largest cannon which is near the entrance of the fort"
Jaigarh_Fort,Abdulla P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Friends,Jaipur ka Jharokha,"Jaipur ka Jharokha .......The view from the Jaigarh Fort ......It's timeless,  from my first visit sometime in 2007 and my repeat visits thereafter, it never fails to amaze and offer a new window (pun intended) for the scenic beauty it offers.A fort having the world's largest cannon which was never required to tbe fired except for a test fire which landed some 35 kms away and the crater is now a lake.A fort that was built to restrain any attacking army from reaching its ramparts, never had to test it's defence due to the alliances it natured with being the in laws to the Great Mughal Emperor Akbar to being the  alliances with the British and post independence providing the treasure which never was disclosed yet took a 50 days of search and blocking of the Delhi Jaipur Highway by the armed forces in 1977.A tale of how love conquers and alliances helps progress to how betrayal and deceit hampers legacy.... Its all wrapped for an interesting lesson from the pages of history which needs to be treasured as we ""progress"" .It was built in 1726 AD by Sawan Jai Singh II and sits at several hundred feet above the sea level. The almost-intact fort is enclosed by huge walls and is connected to the Amer Fort with subterranean passages. It is believed to be built to protect the Amer Fort and is one of the strongest monuments of Jaipur."
Jaigarh_Fort,Subbukanyakumari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,A must visit fort offering scenic views of Jaipur city,"We visited the Jaigarh fort during last week of Sep’21 and the place was less crowded. The ticket to the Jaigarh fort costs INR 100 for Indian nationals and INR 50 for Indian students. The good thing is that private vehicles are allowed inside the fort at INR 100, otherwise it would have been difficult for us to walk such long distances under the scorching sun. This fort is managed by the Jaipur Royal Family. The Jaigarh Fort, located on the Aravalli range of hills provides an excellent of view of Aravalli hills and the Amer Fort down below. The view from fort is very amazing towards Jaipur city or Jal Mahal which is scenic beauty. The world's largest cannon on wheels, Jaivana is displayed here and is the main attraction. We hired a local guide and he told us stories of how Jaivana was test fired once which scared Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and the cannon was never used during an actual battle. The guide also told us about the treasures stored under the water tanks in the fort which was taken by Indira Gandhi during a search operation in 1977 during emergency, though there are no evidence for that. It must visit place if you are in Jaipur and can be covered along with Nahargarh fort and Amber Palace."
Jaigarh_Fort,Mohammed khan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Family,Waste of money and time,"Waste of time to go there see only cannon there nothings else to see there, be careful with chitter they ask to visit there shop to buy in triple price there product , and they waste your time and money"

Jaigarh_Fort,A Choudhury,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020 • Solo,Magnificent Fort,"The second most important fort to visit in Jaipur, this fort was built mainly to protect the Amber fort. The main attraction here is the Jaivana Cannon which was the world's largest cannon at the time of its manufacture and it was fired only once. The fort offers a beautiful view of the surroundings from the top. One hour is sufficient to visit the fort and photography is permitted."
Jaigarh_Fort,AMIT KUMAR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Friends,Jaigarh Fort,The Jaivana Canon in Jaigarh Fort is what that attracts tourists. Fort is well maintained and still the royal family lives there . From the hill top you see the entire Jaipur city!
Jaigarh_Fort,Rani75,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Fort,"Ancient Fort, they speak history of India.We have to walk but it's worth the explore.We get engrossed in the stories."
Jaigarh_Fort,Connector45197123546,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Couples,Fraud Guides cum Shop Agents,Guys do not ever hire any Guide in any of the forts they are not more than agents of the Shop in fort..They will take 50-100-200 Rs from u in the name of fort tour but they will not even let u explore the whole fort and the fort trip ends at the shop of fort...Big Tourist SCAM!!!! PLEASE AVOID THESE FRAUDSTERS
Jaigarh_Fort,Sanjay Malhotra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Mesmerising Jaigarh fort,"The Jaigarh Fort is still the property of the royal family of Jaipur. It's on the montain. It is well maintained and has lots of historical values. Since it's a privately owned property, thee are many weddings, movie shootings etc take place within the palace. From the back side of the palace the Amber fort can be seen. There is a tunnel which connects Amber fort with the Jairgarh fort."
Jaigarh_Fort,GAUTAM G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,The fort with a big gun and an army of monkeys ,This truly is a fort with a lot of trouble some monkeys constantly attacking tourists carrying food or teasing them so if you are any one of the above don't be.Be sure to have your own booked transportation as vehicle traffic is minimal and getting a ride back to the city extremely troublesome.Things to see are the massive cannon and the fort  museum which is currently poorly maintained by the current king and his trusts.This can be avoided if you are short of time but can be done in conjunction with the Amer fort visit. 
Jaigarh_Fort,Vinay B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Great fort and the local guide gave a good historical background of the fort....one of the good forts in Jaipur,Great fort and the local guide gave a good historical background of the fort...one of the good forts in Jaipur
Jaigarh_Fort,Akhilesh A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Worlds largest cannon in the entire history,jaigarh fort was basically to protect the amer fort & it has worlds largest cannon inside it which has capacity to destroy the entire city in one go The cannon has not been used once even but its an treat to watch an massive cannon which is probably much bigger than ur suv cars Also the view from this place is so beautiful & try out the restaurant over there for some quick drinks with view
Jaigarh_Fort,Vinay K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2020 • Friends,Canon fort ,"Worlds bighest cannon that too target only.once in life , there u can understand history and manufacturing process of diffrent diffrent canons "
Jaigarh_Fort,Bholu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Jaigarh Fort,For some reason not that many people go up here. That's their loss!This is a large historical military complex that is well worth exploring in full. The real highlight is right at the end high point with beautiful battlements encircling a lovely garden. Don't leave without finding it as many seem to do.One downside of this site is that they allow cars to drive in for a fee which somewhat spoiled the ambience of some of the more accessible locations.You really don't need a guide here as long as you do a bit of reading before visiting
Jaigarh_Fort,Prabhanshu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Jaigarh Fort,"A very well maintained fort, where the King's guards still live with their families. Excellend millitary architecture - amazing the way soldiers in the 17th - 18th century used to evade enemies by using hot oil from the walls. The largest cannon in the world, weighing more than 100 tons ""Jaivana"" was amazing to see. Check out the amazing sarees and quilts available in the handicraft shop owned by the king, inside the Jaigarh fort."
Jaigarh_Fort,Anjan Sengupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Nothing in the Fort except Jaivana,"This fort has nothing except for Jaivana Canon which makes it worth a visit. The views frm the fort are also good, but the fort is not that attractive as  compared to Amber Fort."
Jaigarh_Fort,Akshay,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,A good historical place to visit in Jaipur,There is nothing much to explore but there is Jaivana cannon which is considered world's biggest cannon.You can also visit two small museum there.

Jaigarh_Fort,AJAYAERON,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Heritage FORT,Must visit place if you are visiting Jaipur. Nicely conserved site with display of Arms & ammunition of Royals of Jaipur
Jaigarh_Fort,Lakshmi N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,A majestic fort,A huge fort which hosts a huge huge cannon. You can walk along the magnificent walls of the fort and get a very good view from there. But except for the huge cannon and the view there is the nothing much to see. You either visit this or Nahargarh fort. Visiting both is not really worth it if you are on a tight schedule of day or 2 in Jaipur.This is usually deserted a little compared to Amer fort. So monkeys fill the space. Beware of the monkey menace. I recommend carrying a stick with you while walking along the fort walls just in case you encounter monkeys.
Jaigarh_Fort,The Wedding Vow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,"Incredible View of a Mini ""Great Wall of China""","Went up to Jaigarh Fort to check out the view overseeing Amber Fort, and found out about this mini Great Wall of China (see picture). Beautiful walls, and when I googled, I realised there was actually a Great Wall of India located at Kumbhalgarh Fort. Too far from Jaipur - a 6.5 hr drive, hence this will do! :)"
Jaigarh_Fort,Dr Sandesh Kedia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Just visit Amber fort and you are done.,Just visit Amber fort and you are done. No other fort can satisfy you if you spent a good time at Amber fort.
Jaigarh_Fort,camsandeep,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Nice place,"You can find world's biggest cannon; and the 60 gallon water storage underground tank and the Great Wall protecting the fort. If you don't have time, you can skip it as see other places."

Jaigarh_Fort,Anil Shirole,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Don’t miss... fantastic heritage and genius...!,"The fort is at the top of the mountain and accessible also from Amer fort. Provide a whole day to visit Jaigarh and Amer Forts. It is a wonderful place and ‘ankh bhar ke dekh lo’.  The guides do injustice to these places, as they have to maximise the number of customers, so they are in a hurry to go to the next point, and give very little time... take an audio guide instead and go around the place fully. Alternative is to research on the net... before going to the place... go right down to the gardens and view Amer fort and surroundings from the top... start the day early at Nahargarh, come to Jaigarh and top it with Amer.. "
Jaigarh_Fort,Shobha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,My favourite,It was my favourite in Jaipur . I visited here with my family. Entry fee is also not high it is around 25 . It was in word beautiful. Will like to visit here again
Jaigarh_Fort,Devendra G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Beautiful fort - Very well maintained,"Jaigarh fort, which means the palace of victory is situated in Jaipur. It overlooks the amer fort. The fort was built by Sawai Jai singh. The fort features a cannon named ""Jaivana""(Jaivana Cannon), which was manufactured in the fort and was then the world's largest cannon. Jaigarh Fort and Amer Fort are connected by underground tunnels. There are escape ways for the royal family in the situation of a war. The fort complex has a ram temple and a kall bhairav temple. It has a huge water tank to store water for the soldiers. The water tank is still in use.The views from the fort are stunning. Once can see amer fort and the entire old Jaipur city. Must visit once with a guide who can explain the monument in detail."
Jaigarh_Fort,prasanna n,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Stunning views!!,This place probably has the best views in all of jaipur. Worlds largest cannon is an added attractionWould recommend driving up till the top especially with kids and elders
Jaigarh_Fort,S Verma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Grand Fort and Beautiful View,"A beautiful fort with mark of grandeur all over it.. You enter the main visiting area of the fort through a labyrinth which gives you access to different parts like Kitchen, Dining area, Queen's palace etc. Although not much of the structure is left it gives you a perfect glimpse of what it had been in its full glory... Vast, beautiful and wisely designed for protection as well as public welfare (the water storage area for example). The view of the protective wall and pathway spread across multiple hills around and the Amer Palace below takes you back in history. There are ample photo opportunities so visitors keep your camera handy :)Couple of things to keep in mind, It is quite a long walk to cover the fort area so you might want to brief the senior travelersKeep an eye on the children (if you are traveling with any) as there is a labyrinth and some steep areas around You can take your vehicle inside the main entrance, ask at the ticketing officeGuide may not be required however absolutely upto you :) "
Jaigarh_Fort,p g,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Only canon is attraction,If you are not into visiting structure or old building then the only thing I liked is the biggest canon ...
Jaigarh_Fort,DDBTrip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Beautiful defence fort,"It is not exactly a fort, it was built to protect Amber fort. It is famous as it houses the world's largest cannon on wheels, Jaivana. But not just this, it gives exceptional views of the Aravalli mountains and the city. There is a tunnel from Amber fort to this fort which is accessible, so it is easier to reach. Do visit if you have time and enjoy the views with less crowd.Also a song from Salman khan,s latest movie Dabbang 3 was shot here. "
Jaigarh_Fort,Surendra RR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Great Fort ,One of the historical places to visit in Jaipur. The right time to visit would be in rain or in winter .Good places visit with family and friends... 
Jaigarh_Fort,Marathon_Dreams,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Real fort on the mountain,"Although there is nothing much remained on this fort,except the canon, but the fort walls and its vast expanse gives you an idea of how it will be when it was functioning. If you are looking for signs of royalty and their lifestyle symbols, don't visit this fort. This fort is built to protect Amer palace/fort below (Jaigarh fort overlooks Amer Palace). Once can visualize vision of the king which has built this fort and protective wall which goes around Amer (around 12km). Its open with lots of walking around the outer walls. The canon is also worth seeing. If you love photography, this fort provides amazing angles of various structures."
Jaigarh_Fort,Grumpy013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Have to,Just another amazing place to visit. You could spend hours wondering around. It is big too. A lot of history too. Must do this one & Amber Fort together in the same day. You also have a museum and an armoury exhibition. 
Jaigarh_Fort,CleopatraLuxor,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,"Such a vast, dominant structure",200 rupees to enter. Go early morning as it gets very hot after noon. We took a tuktuk up and it felt a little 'hairy' in places but drivers are experienced so no reason to be alarmed. There's a small restaurant there (we didn't try) and a place selling spicy puff potato fare (20 rupees each). Views across to Amber Fort are amazing. Worth the money. Suitable footwear a must!
Jaigarh_Fort,dizzybl0nde,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Worth going,Not as busy as many of the other forts. Definitely worth going. Was not expensive to go in and some good photo opportunities.

Jaigarh_Fort,832vgs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A Defence Fort!,Jaigarh Fort of Jaipur situated along the Aravali Ranges close to the Amer Fort and Lake was built by King Jai Singh II to protect the Amer Fort and its palace complex. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that an artillery Cannon called 'Jaivana'; which was manufactured in the fort precincts and is the world's largest wheeled cannon is located there.  A place worth visiting for its architectural and historical value.
Jaigarh_Fort,Sanjukta M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Nice,Nice experience! Specially the hilly way up to Jaigarh fort is  more interesting with peacocks running here and there - can take some lovely pictures.
Jaigarh_Fort,prasanthshenoy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Must see after Amber Fort,"I would put this as a must see fort for 2 reasons, beautiful views from the top, biggest canon. Basically this fort was constructed for defense purposes and safety of Amber palace. Primarily used by soldiers and other commanders in those times. The views all around especially that of Amber palace, the Aravalli mountains and Jal Mahal from here are breathtaking. You can use your vehicle to drive to the top of the fort with some additional 100/- entry ticket for the vehicle."
Jaigarh_Fort,Pooja S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Spectacular view of the city ,Jaigarh fort is the other way of Nahargarh Fort. Has a beautiful view and has a lot of plants everywhere. This is mainly known for a rooftop and it's view of the city. 
Jaigarh_Fort,Shima,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Breathtaking ,"You get to this place by walking through a tunnel from Amber Fort. The place is full of history and you get great views of Jaipur from several vantage points. It is well worth a visit, but be ready to walk.

Jaigarh_Fort,carleton23,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Fantastic fortress views,"If you have chance, drive up the hill above Amber to this fort which dates from 1726. You can see the world's largest wheeled cannon. Beyond that is a series of rooms and corridors, some containing the armoury and other artefacts. It opens out into a hidden garden and fantastic panoramas over Amber and the fortress walls, so you really get to see the scale of the construction."
Jaigarh_Fort,Valisa,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Nothing special,Twhe main attraction of this place jaivana cannan.  I don't think this place is worth visiting..  Nothing special. You can easily skin this place.  There are many other beautiful places in Jaipur other than this

Jaigarh_Fort,deepti,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Rajput Legacy,"Jaigarh Fort, which is a part of the same complex as that of Amer Fort, as the two are connected by a subterranean passage. The passage was meant to evacuate the royal family in case of an attack on Amber Palace. The 18th-century tunnel was thrown open to the public and has been made motorable. To facilitate the trip to Jaigarh, golf carts operate from Ganesh Pol to Awani Gate, the fort’s entry. The ride is very nominally priced at rupees 70 for a one way trip and rupees 100 for two way and operates from 9am to 4pm. Jaigarh fort can also be approached from the Amer Fort over a short climb along a steep hill track. The fort is named after Jai Singh II, who got it built to protect the Amer fort. Hence, it was actually a defensive structure rather than a palace itself. What really makes it famous is a celebrated cannon named Jaivana, which was then the world's largest cannon on wheels.  The fort never witnessed any major resistance, and therefore, despite the cannon’s exceptional record, it was test-fired only once. The fort museum is a testimony of this fort being used as a major center of artillery depository. Used weapons and other war utilities are preserved and displayed at the museum. The fort precincts also include Laxmi Vilas, Lalit Mandir, Aram Mandir, and the Vilas Mandir."
Jaigarh_Fort,Bhumika S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Beautiful place,It was an historic visit to this fort for us as everything is nicely preserved in the fort. The garden is luch green and the atmosphere is calm.I spent almost 2 hours here and it was really a memorable visit.
Jaigarh_Fort,Abhimanyu M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Good Place to visit,"Visited Jaigarh fort and it was worth it. It is better than Nahargarh fort because of less crowd.

Carry water bottle, cap/hat, sunglasses with you , the place offers amazing views of Amer town,  Amber fort, Sagar and arravali range"
Jaigarh_Fort,ANISH VERMA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Must visit in JAIPUR ,"Enjoy the hill drive in JAIPUR to reach this place!Jaigarh hosts Jaivana, the largest cannon in the world.Have a look at the city from the top of the hill, its beautiful.

Jaigarh_Fort,Shonil_B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,One more hidden Gem of Jaipur,"One more neglected by tourist place, or even if they visit, they just visit the Jaivana Cannon and go back. But this fort is much more than the cannon. It has fantastic view of the Amer gad, the great wall of Amer, the dark rooms complex structure ( the maze or bhulbullaiya), and walking on the walls of this fort makes your visit here a worth. Good place for photography too."
Jaigarh_Fort,IntrepidNomad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Yet another breathtaking historic monument,When reviewing a monument/historical attraction in India it is difficult not to seem like you are repeating yourself. Jaipur is an incredible state with so much history in this area. If you make the effort to visit Amber Palace/Fort then go the little bit further and see the Jaigarh Fort. The views are amazing and the the world's largest cannon is situated here as well.Jaipur is an incredible state and this Fort is one of the reasons why.
Jaigarh_Fort,RajShar10,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Nice views from the ramparts,"It is a bit away from the city but is worth the trip. World's biggest cannon is definitely a big draw. There is a tunnel that goes all the way to the Amber Palace. Looking at the forge that was used to build cannons is a must.However, the entrance is not well-maintained. One can definitely avoid rides on camels or elephants as it is simply a form of animal cruelty."
Jaigarh_Fort,Krishnapal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Majestic fort,Very beautiful and huge fort. One of the must see thing of Jaipur. Views from fort are heavily beautiful.
Jaigarh_Fort,Schanbis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,A Historic Fort,"Situated on the promontory called Cheel ka Teela, Jaigarh Fort is quite rugged. From here you can see Amer Fort too. There is a watch tower from where you can get spectacular views. A famous cannon called JAYVANA is an interesting exhibit here. Chaarbag Garden is beautiful, not to miss."

Jaigarh_Fort,RobinLSK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Amazing Fort on a Hill Top,"An amazing fort with beautiful view of Jaipur City. Once home to 10,000 soldiers guarding and defending the kingdom. It is also the home to the largest cannon built in India, that fired only once, where the soldiers had to jump into the reservoir due to the heat and noise generated by the cannon. Poor soldiers and I can't imagine the spectacle of this event! :)A wonderful fort to explore and enjoy."
Jaigarh_Fort,Shalini S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Fascinating,This fort was built atop a hill to defend Amer fort and houses the largest canon named Jaivan. The huge walls surrounding it and Nahargarh form the defense system for the living quarters of Amer fort. It is really fascinating to study the architecture and the strong defense mechanism. Must visit along with Amer and Nahargarh forts to have comprehensive view. Carry sufficient water as one gets thirsty after walking.

Jaigarh_Fort,rich005,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Nice spot for sunset drinks,"Our driver recommended heading up to see sunset from here. It didn’t disappoint. You can spend half an hour or so looking around the fort - free entry. Then sunset point has entry fee (Rs 400 or so for foreigners). It was worth it though, we found a nice seat and enjoyed looking out across the whole of Jaipur watching the sun go down while drinking Kingfishers. Stayed until it was dark then drove down again. We saw some tuk tuks make it up but we were in a car. Takes around 20 minutes from Pink City. Police were checking everyone on the way down to make sure drivers were not drunk."
Jaigarh_Fort,Charvi_Shah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,If you love ancient and historic place then this place is for you,This place preserves one of the strongest weapons of the World in ancient times. The place provides a great view of the surroundings.
Jaigarh_Fort,vivek_agr,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Nothing major,The only attraction of this place is the Cannon which is said to be one of the largest in the world.  Private cars can go right upto the courtyard(parking extra) of the cannon otherwise it can also be parked outside from where it is about 350metres walk. 
Jaigarh_Fort,Asiiia,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Its not worth going up there... ,We went up to the fort and were a bit disappointed. It’s very huge and there’s actually not much to see. You can enjoy a nice view over Jaipur or the Amber fort but that’s it. The fort is old and not well treated. 
Jaigarh_Fort,nosourgrapes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Jaigar gets my vote,This huge rambling fort is one of the most impressive in Rajasthan. might equals right and this fort was built to protect. the small holes to pour boiling water in the enemy are still notably there as are the slits for firing bows and arrows. any marauder who could break into this citadel would be tough and wily indeed. Jaigar is less busy than the other nearby but it is infinitely interesting. allow an hour or two to wander about and take in the atmosphere oh and dont forget to check the worlds biggest cannon that can hurl the 22 lb cannon balls an incredible 30-40 km!
Jaigarh_Fort,Johari Jaipur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Jaigarh,Historical place it's a fort built by King of jaipur main attraction of the fort is ancient तोप used in war
Jaigarh_Fort,Prathamesh Sawant,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Home to world's biggest cannon of its time!!,"If you have already visited Amer before this, then this fort will underwhelm. However, its now home to Jaivana - the biggest cannon of its time."
Jaigarh_Fort,Vivek Chaturvedi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Magnificence personified,"a must visit on your trip to jaipur with some time on your hands.. especially great fun when visiting with people who has an eye to history.. magnificence of the bygone era is evident in every nook n corner of the fort.. pride of jaipur, must say.."
Jaigarh_Fort,Aveek B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Though its not spledid as Amer fort but its a must visit after Amer fort,Forts in Rajasthan should be covered either in early morning (Jaigarh opens at 9.30 AM) or in late evening to avoid the sun. In Jaigarh fort one needs to walk long distance in order to explore the full fort. It was mainly the cannon making factory and soldiers used to stay in Jaigarh fort. The bhulbhulaiya inside is another notable place along with the largest cannon inside the fort. It is near to Amer fort and both are interlinked by a road for pedestrian though few take the road. The view from the end point of Amer fort from Jaigarh is a nice one.
Jaigarh_Fort,BeingSakshi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Average,"A good place, little isolated now as compare to Amer palace. But you will get good view of Amer palace from here. Visit only if you don't have time constraint, else even skipping it won't hurt."
Jaigarh_Fort,Kumar A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Fort visit,What an amazing fort is this. It's very huge and require almost half a day to see it properly.Its managed by the royal family so very well maintained.
Jaigarh_Fort,ruchikachugh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Great history and beautiful fort,"Our visit was made memorable by our guide, hansraj  gujjar, who offered us beautiful and detailed description of the this place."
Jaigarh_Fort,P P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Hidden treasure wonderful piece of history ,The jaigarh fort is likely the least marketed historical place is town. That said I would strongly recommend it for the discerning traveler that likes to understand the role of history and historical actions in modern day world or specifically for rajasthan. The story and history around the cannon and the armoury factory is unique link to the Mughal rajputana diplomacy and the good and bad sides of the Man Singh and Akbar links. The tunnel connecting to Amer fort is worth a visit. Useful to take a informed guide to truly appreciate what was built a 1000 plus years ago and the foresight that went into it. 
Jaigarh_Fort,S B Khare,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,A magnificent legacy of Rajput kings of Jaipur,"This fort was a retreat of Rajput kings of Jaipur whenever the Amer Palace was under attack. Secret tunnels connect the Amer palace to the fort. The Rajsthan government has now opened one of the tunnels so that tourists now can go on foot from Amer Palace to Jaigarh Fort. The fort has an elaborate system of monsoon water collection, filtering and utilization, something worth knowing about. It has a very beautiful hilltop garden maintained even today. A guide is quite helpful and are quite informative at a small tip. The fort and the living quarters are connected with an intricate system of pathways. There is also the largest cannon of the world on display. Another very interesting display is the king and queen having lunch spread with their consorts."
