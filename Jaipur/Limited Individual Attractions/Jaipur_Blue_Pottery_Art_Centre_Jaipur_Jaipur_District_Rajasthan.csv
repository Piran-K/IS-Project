Jaipur_Blue_Pottery_Art_Centre,Nadia L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,A Cultural & Educational Experience.,"Blue Pottery is a dying art that needs revival.Anil is 9th generation pottery maker, and you can tell his love for his art by his words (and prices too). We had the opportunity to take our kids to his factory and he was kind enough to not only show us how it is all made, but with each piece he has on display came learnings of history & culture. It was truly an educational and enlightening experience."
