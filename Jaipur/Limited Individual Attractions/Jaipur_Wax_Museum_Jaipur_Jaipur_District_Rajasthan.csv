Worthless totally 3/10."

The statues of the Maharani of Jaipur both young and old are beautiful. But the main attraction is the Sheesh Mahal. Built a few years back, it is made completely of mirrors, and is a site to behold.

It is an initiative of a creative company and houses wax real life-like statues of Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagor, Charlie Chaplin, Albert Einstein, Bhagat Singh, Sachin Tendulkar, Amitabh Bachan, Kalpana Chawla and many more. It also houses statues of Rajput Royals such as Sawai Man Singh, Sawai Jai Singh, Maharana Pratap and Gayatri Devi. The ticket for both Sheesh Mahal and Wax Museum is priced at Rs.500 for Indians.

So, one might say that the entry fees is a bit higher, which is but its worth paying, because of the Sheesh Mahal which they have created here. Tour all organized by Rajputana Cabs."

Although I had visited many wax Museums but will surely love to mention here that the particular one is very different and with a theme.it is not just few statues at a fort but each statue kept there has a theme a concept and a purpose as to why it has a place there .each has a backdrop and visual effects surrounding it so that eveey one can get a knowledge with a glance and even if you are lazy  to read up the writings..so I say this wax museum is just different .Now attatched to it is the Sheesh Mahal a place that makes you feel royal a place with intricacies of glass art .. this is a jaw drop  beautiful and mesmerizing place.  One comes to know how rich is our art and culture.A must visit place . Many thanks to the  creator of this Museum Mr.Anoop Srivastava for  giving India a glimpse of its richness in knowledge ,persons and culture.A must visit place #jaipur wax museum"

There are beautiful wax and silicon statues of history, cinema, literature  and sports celebrities like Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, Rajnikanth, Amitabh Bachhan, Albert Einstein, etc. There are two sections viz.

Jaipur_Wax_Museum,arifahmed2017,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Much lower quality and limited statues ,Nice place .But wax statues are of much low quality as compared to the madam Tussad and also they are of limited numbers . On top of that you are not allowed to take pictures on your own when you have already paid the price of 500 rupees .

It is located at the top of the hill, which is the highest point in Jaipur.  The museum is very much comparable to Madam tussads.  The wax replicas are placed in line as per history.  The dress provided on the statues are exactly the same, as the originals. visitors are not allowed to photograph, but their official photographers would assist you with good photographs, where ever you need.  wax statues are real looking, so minutely crafted.  overall it deserves appreciation."

Jaipur_Wax_Museum,Venkataraman U,,,,"The ticket price is pretty steep at Rs 500 per person, and it is for both Wax Museum and the adjoining Sheesh Mahal.Wax museum is divided into two parts: first part containing wax statues of Indian and International celebrities and the second containing statues of distinguished personalities in Rajasthan's history. In total, there are about 30 wax statues.The statues are pretty good and done well. However, I don't really understand the fuss about it. True, for kids, it is exciting and knowledgeable but for adults, come on, they are just statues.Now, a word about the racket going on there. You can get your photos clicked, but not from your own camera. With your express permission, the museum people tag a photographer along with you and he keeps clicking your snaps with all the statues. At the end, there is a camera room where you can select which photos you want and they will transfer the soft copy to your phone. Each soft copy costs your Rs 25, with a minimum of 8 copies. Bloody scammers won't miss an opportunity to loot the tourists. It was seriously off-putting.Now, a word about the Sheesh Mahal. It's a total wastage of time. All you have is a single hall with mirrors, big and large, all around. They tell you the place consists of 3 million mirrors, with the floor also made up of mirrors. A lousy presentation, a completely disinterested host, and stupid mirrors all around without really anything magical make it such a damp squib. The place was recently made, and there is no history associated with it even though it is located right there within the Nahargarh fort premises. But the cunning people have clubbed the tickets with Wax Museum, so you don't have an option to opt out of visiting this lousy Sheesh Mahal. Instead, go see the original Sheesh Mahal in Amer Fort....you'll be blown over.All in all, nothing terribly exciting and can be avoided. The kids, however, will most likely enjoy it."

,,,,,We really appreciate you taking the time to share your rating with us .
,,,,,"After the Nahargarh Fort visit, the tourists normally head towards the recently constructed Wax Museum and the modern Sheesh Mahal. Around 15 Indian wax statues and 9 international artists including Michael Jackson as well as the Spider Man are on display with imagined setting. The organisers are providing disposable foot covers to ensure neatness of the place. On payment,  the tourists can collect specific number of pics (soft copy) by the photographers arranged by the organisers. The actual artist who has done the wax statues deserve explicit attribution. The adjacent Sheesh Mahal, made of several lakhs of pieces of glass, is another attraction. The glass pieces are well collaged from floor to ceiling to make an excellent mirror palace. A guide present there explains the intricacies. Worth seeing once."

The wax museum 1 doesn't offer anything new for people seen Madame Tussauds and as photography is not allowed gets over within 10 minutes as it is too small. But good job done to maintain the figures. The 2nd museum is of famous rulers which can be interesting, especially Maha rana Pratap figure which stands more than 7 ft. Tall and dominating. The most interesting is the Sheesh Mahal which is quite spectacular for its use of 2.5 lakh pieces of glass specially carved. Overall a 1 time visit, for people not interested in history can avoid.
