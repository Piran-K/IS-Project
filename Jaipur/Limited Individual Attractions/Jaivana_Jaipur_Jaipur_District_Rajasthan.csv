Jaivana,Amit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,World's Largest Cannon of Ancient Era ,"Travelling with friends, I went to see the Biggest Cannon of the world that has its Abode at the Jaigarh Fort of Jaipur. The cannon has a barrel of 20.2 ft and weighs 50 tonne.  The cannon tears on a  a two-wheeled vehicle and the wheels are about 5ft in diameter. Apart from this, the vehicle also has two removable additional wheels for transport, their diameter is about 9 feet.The cannon has the capacity of being fed with 100 kg of gunpowder with 50 kg shell making it able to fire package load of 150kgs.The cannon was fired only once, with 100 kilograms of gunpowder, and when fired was claimed to have covered a distance of about 35 kilometres. It is said that the projectile fired from it made a small lake in Chaksu.As per the stories doing the rounds and being believed, the impact was so powerful that it actually lived to its words as Weapon of  Mass destruction. The loud noise created by the blow made people deaf and pregnant women suffered miscarriages. Seeing this destruction of large scale it was never used again.  But being a lethal weapon with immense power it was kept in the fort as a backbone. And the Royal family still gets it maintained every year and prays before it once a year by performing the Swastik Pooja. Must visit place as you explore Jaipur. Stay connected as I bring more stories from the Pink city of Forts - Jaipur. Fort timings : 9am to 5pm ticket price : Rs. 100 for Indians  Rs. 200 for foreigners"

Jaivana,Shutterbug_Iyer,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,The biggest Cannon,"If you are visiting Jaigarh fort in Jaipur you are sure to see Jaivana, believed to be the biggest cannon in the world. It was cast by Maharaja Jaisingh II in 1720. Jai Singh II took a keen interest in developing armory and munitions. Perhaps he also wanted to impress his Mughal overlords. The gigantic proportion of the gun is quite impressive. But the size and weight itself would have been a weakness. It was (test) fired only once. Folklore has it that the 50 kg cannon ball traveled 45 kms. Ballistics experts reckon that it would not have been more than 5 kms. Definitely worth ticking the box if you visit Jaigarh."

But the impact was so loud that many people lost their ears and hence it was never used again. Said to be the largest ancient gun in India.Visit this place, also for the views from the ramparts surrounding this Cannon. Don't just stand near the cannon, move around, climb the surrounding wall and see the panaroma all around. Also, the factory of the Jaivana is close to the site; don't forget to see it. Take a good guide along who can explain you the factory, it is worth it."

Its quite interesting to see the canon this big and with a range beyond anyone can see. It is one of the main attraction in Jaigarh fort and included as part of the fort ticket. One can also take his own vehicle all the way up to this canon inside the fort (with additional entry fee), as its bit of walking and climbing some section of the fort. Though we walked to it from the main fort entrance, as i find walking the best way to explore the places."

Jaivana,Saipola1970,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Jaivana,"The Jaivana Cannon (located at the Jaigarh Fort, Jaipur) was only Fired Once by the Jai Singh-II, as a test-fire in 1720 and the then Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah is known to have attended the event before ousting the Sayyid Brothers from power. The most exaggerated myth claims that the weapon had a range of 40 km (25 mi), other sources say it is 35, 22 and 11 km (6.8 mi), although the exact range could perhaps never be determined without adequate scientific computation. Most sources, including local tourist guides agree that it was fired in the direction of Chaksu. The impact is said by many locals and tourist guides to be powerful enough to have caused a depression where a pond can be seen today.Legend also says that when it was about to be shot, it was kept near a water tank. This was kept there for the gunner to dive in and escape the shock waves. But during the shot, he and eight other soldiers along with one elephant were reportedly killed due to the shock waves. Many small houses in Jaipur collapsed as well."

It  has 20 feet long barrel weighing about 50 tonnes. Diameter of its barrel is 11 inches and it could fire to the range of 22 miles having 100 kg gunpowder. This was the biggest gun of its time. Even today it attracts awe among the visitors. It is on top of the fort and from the surroundings of the gun you get a fabulous view of the city."

Jaivana,mishra712,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Huge!,"Jaivaan is a really huge and bulky canon....and that's about it. If you have made to the Jaigarh fort, in all probabilities you would see it. If Jaigarh is not in your plans, then Jaivaan is not big enough an attraction to visit for."
