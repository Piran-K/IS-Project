Jal_Mahal,Woodstag,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Lovely lake and palace to visit whilst in Jaipur,"Part of our prearranged personal guided tour whilst in Jaipur. Jal Mahal is a beautiful palace built and situated in the Man Sagar Lake, which you can views from the Amer Road. This palace is built in red sandstone, a five-storied building, of which four floors remain underwater. Sadly there is no entry to the palace and can only be viewed from the road. There is a lovely lake which could be brought to life with investment for the lake and palace to have quality restaurants, water and sailing facilities."
Jal_Mahal,Shiv,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,"Loot in the market ,Rude behavior of market ticket counter and other staff","Earlier it was free entry ,but now authority has started paid access to stupid market and see Jalmahal.

Jal_Mahal,Inderpal Singh A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Evening mood,"Jal Mahal is ideal place for all age groups. Best time is evening in summers and sunshine time in winters.  You can't go inside as it's closed for public but you can spend an hour for street walk and capturing the pics. In evening, bargain shopping is not a bad idea for local items. "
Jal_Mahal,A Choudhury,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020 • Solo,Wonderful,"Located in the middle of a lake, you can click a few photos from the roadside and spend some time here. There is no way to enter the palace. Visit this while going to or coming back from Amber fort or Jaigarh fort."

I visited here at the sunset and though there was hustle and bustle of the city, it was still very soothing with the chai from street vendor there. The palace light up when the nature's light goes off 😇You can come here for an evening walk with family or friends. But the entry is prohibited at Jal Mahal. You can just admire it's beauty from afar. 😇"
Jal_Mahal,Old Pro,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Couples,Cool,Cool look at but very difficult to get to. It's worth about 3 minutes to look at and then move on to something else
Jal_Mahal,JayeshLC,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Photo Stop Only,This site is closed for visitors and so you cannot go inside. It is only a photo stop but you will not get very good pictures.
Jal_Mahal,Naresh Kumar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Man-made Injustice,"There is so much garbage piled up at the visitors viewing area that is so depressing and completely destroys the experience of the beautiful monument set in the lake.Secondly, the place is filled with beggars who harass the tourists."
Jal_Mahal,DOUG and NIKI,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Very cool but a quick visit place,"We are giving this stop an average review not because the Water Palace isn't interesting but because it just wasn't a very big stop for the day.  So, we'd say plan to stop by and visit, just don't make it the focus of your day.  The marketplace was really very interesting.We have a full video review."
Jal_Mahal,Polo_and_Marco,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Just a view; but it is stunning despite floating garbage ,You can’t visit the palace on the water but the view from the lake something like you never seen before. Unfortunately the lake is dirty needs to be cleaned so don’t be fooled by pristine photos where all the floating garbage has been photoshopped out. 
Jal_Mahal,Anirudh Singh Rajpurohit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020,Jal Mahal Is A Beauty,"Jal Mahal Jaipur Is Reopen And Best palace To Explore In Rainy Season  builduing that made in the centre of a lake , u can easily watch one side of this builduing on the way to amber fort , ek behtreen namuna.."
Jal_Mahal,Lyndyr,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Beautiful to photograph at different times of the day.,"Beautiful to photograph from down next to the lake or see Jaipur come alight from sunset through to when it lights up from the road to Jaigarh Fort. The Jal Mahal is beautifully lit. and the lake reflection makes it especially lovely at night. There is work underway to clean up the lake and restore the palace. which is five storeys, but only the top storey is visible above the lake. There is a market along the road there, we didn't find any problems with the hawkers. We were there in early March 2020They just have to make a living, must be tough this year if they are around at all now."
Jal_Mahal,Vinay K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2020 • Friends,sthapatya art ,"A builduing that made in the centre of a lake , u can easily watch one side of this builduing on the way to amber fort , ek behtreen namuna art ka that too made and stand from years "
Jal_Mahal,Gl0balCitizen2013,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,"Seriously, don't step out of your car!","Jal Mahal looks good in pictures and from far away. Of all Jaipur attractions, this was the worst. You can get down from the car, only to be confronted by hawkers, touts & crowds. It is dirty & as you near the water, the most disgusting smell assaults your senses! Unfortunately, I am saddened to say that the people around have little civic sense either. And it isn't worth getting down, for even a few pictures, because once you breathe in that disgusting smell, it stays with you! Admire the place from far, is my advice to you!"
Jal_Mahal,Anjan Sengupta,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,I m still confused,"Just like my last visit in 2017, I am still confused why this structure was built. This time I had an even worse experience with a foul smell in the waters when we tried to get some pictures from the road. The hawkers on the street makes the things a bit more clumsy. This place can be avoided.."
Jal_Mahal,Skeney57,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Summer & Water Palace,"Title according to our guide so could be a furphy ?? But obvious that it would be a cooler location during the heat of Summer with cool water breezes. What is known is that it was built in 1799 AD and is only viewed from the roadside. A hundred hawkers on site , so it is a well frequented stop. Worth a 10 minute break in your day I reckon ?"
Jal_Mahal,R1chardN,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Okay for a photograph,The still waters give a perfect reflection and so this is good for a photograph.  You can only view this from the road and cannot go into it.  It was a former hunting palace and is presently being converted.There is a market in the area by the place that gives the best views.  The lake smelled when we were there and dead fish floating in it.  Our guide told us that was due to a chemical release the previous week.
Jal_Mahal,DP1066,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Worth a photograph!,"Known as the Water Palace, this former hunting lodge is in the process of being converted into a restaurant.  It can be viewed from the road that runs alongside the lake."
Jal_Mahal,mikef888au,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A break in your coach trip,"Not as spectacular as mooted. A palace in the middle of a lake, can be viewed from the lake side walk 150-200m away. The many hawkers and street vendors detract from the possible beauty and allure of this palace. The hazy atmosphere also diminished the view, making photography difficult. I was there mid afternoon 15th March and it looked rather shabby from all aspects. We only stopped to have a look.......no one on my tour wanted to stay more then a few minutes....enough said.Probably much nicer in the evening"
Jal_Mahal,Rucha121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Palace on Waters,"It is now known as Taj Lake Palace. It is located right in the midst of Lake Pichola. Standing tall and beautiful in the middle of Lake, Taj Lake Palace is an 18th-century historic stay in the City of Lakes offering an ethereal experience of the era of kings and queens"
Jal_Mahal,Asia traveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Just drive past and view this from the viewpoint,"This Palace probably looks more picturesque in the evening (I hope), because it is very average to see by daytime. We were told by our driver that you cannot actually go across the water to the Jal mahal, not sure if this is true or not. If so, its a very average drive by sighting, and I suppose I would try to see this place in the evening compared to daytime. "
Jal_Mahal,Jayesh D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Water Palace,Amazing place to visit either in day time or in evening in middle ot Man sagar lake in Jaipur.  Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh constructed Jal Mahal in 1799 to serve as a hunting lodge during his duck shooting trips.
Jal_Mahal,ashutosh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Jalmahal,Nicely  developed with vision of water conservation  and tourism.  Feel vibrant when you are on top of jalmahal viewing  nature  and  clean water. Beautifully decorated  museum  to display  historic  past od palace.good experience.

Jal_Mahal,Philip P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Impressive, but not possible to visit.",Imagine that you want to duck hunt ... so just build a small cottage in the middle of field and make a lake around it! Wow!I hope that the plans to organise guided visits will be made reality - in that case I'll go back.
Jal_Mahal,Abhishek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,A guided tour is not allowed,"One is not allowed to be close to Jal Mahal, and internal tour, or guided tour is out of the question. You can take a view from distance, and it is fasciniting. It will be great, if they will allow a boat tour closer to the palace. "
Jal_Mahal,Indirapuram,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A neglected palace,"It may be a palace but not accessible by tourists, you can not go there, you can’t  see it from inside, you can’t have a close look. Not properly maintained  by the authorities. You can just enjoy the lake and hills around. I have visited this place a number of times but could never see it from inside nor could have a close look. Not worth a visit"
Jal_Mahal,Ashish Reja,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Memorable one,Place is very good for see its situated in the centre of the River area was very fantastic for the visitors
Jal_Mahal,Anjali,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Good at night 🤩,Visit it at night u will find many streets shopping at and some food to canmel ride also available but I didn’t take it because animals get hurted buy us only
Jal_Mahal,Gidons51,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,An old palace in the middle of the pond ,This palace was built for the use of the royal family of Jaipur and is surrounded by an artificial pond . Can be reached only by boat . Is used by the royal family only twice a year . Is not open for visits of the public . 
Jal_Mahal,Angela G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Golden Triangle,"You can get dropped off along the side of the lake where there are viewing points to take photos of the Palace on the lake. There are many crafts being sold along here who want to sell you something so be ready to haggle. Don't miss the wildlife statues here of an elephant, peacock etc leading into an arch.Busy area, no toilets that I could see so go before hand."
Jal_Mahal,AJAYAERON,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Palace inside Water,Its just Amazing to visit Jal Mahal. Name of this Site says PALACE on WATER. You will find picturesque view & nice heritage  site
Jal_Mahal,fionamb13,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Seen from afar,"One can not see this palace very closely, unless you stay at the hotel there. Very disappointing as the gardens looked nice. There are lots of street vendors and beggars who made the visit there unpleasant. "
Jal_Mahal,Lakshmi N,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Not a tourist attraction,"This does not qualify a tourist attraction. It does not offer anything to stop by, and spend time. You can only watch it from the shore and cant get close to it. You can very well watch it on a drive to or from Amer fort. The only reason why you might want to stop there is the road side shopping option available in from the front of the Jal Mahal. But you have a lot of other places to do road side shopping in Jaipur! This should be your first place to skip if you are on a tight schedule in Jaipur"
Jal_Mahal,vidushhi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,What a place!,I’ve been going to Jaipur my whole life but only this once did I visit the Jal Mahal! Unfortunately one can’t go too close but it’s still a site to savour ! 
Jal_Mahal,Bongtraveller,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Unfortunately smelly,"Just a single picture worth, this attraction offers nothing but disappointment. Tourists can click pictures of Jal mahal from the promenade. The area surrounding the promenade is very smelly. The roadside hawkers sitting on the promenade have nothing new to offer as well. This attraction can be avoided big time."
Jal_Mahal,J Campoos,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Smelly ,Just a palace immersed in water. We stopped just for the picture. Place smells horrible and it’s full of people selling you stuff. Don’t think that is worth seeing.
Jal_Mahal,Anjali,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Do not visit during daytime,The light show at night is the only good thing about the monument. If you during the day you can do a lot of shopping for tiny things.
Jal_Mahal,Ghadeer2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,“Water Palace”,We had to stop roadside to view the Jal Mahal which is located in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. It was built as theatre. It is a beautiful site from a distance on a foggy day. There were plenty of traditional handicrafts venders and sellers along the roadside.SEE photos.
Jal_Mahal,Rodkoi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Roadside Stop and Viewing,A palace in the centre of a lake in Jaipur. You cannot visit and are constantly pestered by beggars and touts. Very pretty but nothing special.
Jal_Mahal,Dean S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Beautiful. ,"So lovely, you can’t go on the the island, you just stop for a few mins by the road and look from the road. It’s a shame the government don’t allow you to go on the island. It’s gorgeous. "
Jal_Mahal,Old Pro,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Pretty cool,I guess the only reason I like this place is because it was poking up out of the water like a floating Hotel. I guess the royalty in the area found it nice in the summer time because the water cooled the entire building. I thought that was very interesting. I don't know if you can actually go to it when you can see it from the road way and one of the Street Markets along the way. It's worth a glimpse
Jal_Mahal,Itinerant_Foodies,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Worth the stop!,"This is worth a stop along the road as this is one of a kind, even if you’ve been to Venice!  You’ll fight for space along the hockers and the mopeds but the juxtaposition of water and palace is odd to say the least."
Jal_Mahal,Zubair K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Relaxation in Night,In jaipur jal mahal is famous there are 7 floor but u can only see 2 floors near by nargarh fort and in night this place is very peaceful
Jal_Mahal,switchedoff,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,A visit means you look across the water from the road!,"As with  a few ""attractions"" and historic buildings in India, this is a view from the road only place.  Looks great but why do these things get listed as attractions?"
Jal_Mahal,Fred V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Another must see while in Jaipur,  This is yet another must see in Jaipur. It's a quick stop for a photo and you can be on your way. This is a good area to see and/or ride camel's. I didn't ride a camel but the camel owners let me pat the camels and take photos
Jal_Mahal,Lesley N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Drive by,It's interesting to drive by and see. Didn't go out to it but the history of how it was made is interesting.....look it up yourselves. 
Jal_Mahal,Tour582774,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Stinky,"Poorly maintained, but fort was good , just on the way on the road so doesn't waste much timeNot clean"
Jal_Mahal,Dr Sandesh Kedia,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Don't waste your time here,You can see it from far distance from the dhore of the lake. It would have been great experience to visit here if the entry is allowed. 
Jal_Mahal,Dr Sandesh Kedia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,You can only see it from far away from the shore of lake,It could have been great experience if we could visit the same and see inside. Currently you can see it from far distance from the shore of the lake.
Jal_Mahal,Vijayaraghavan S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,On the way stop to the Amer Fort complex,Nothing much to write about here. No boating or visit to the Mahal allowed. It's just a photo op on the way to the Jaipur fortsAsk the auto guy to stop for few minutes in way to the forts and this place is checked off the list
Jal_Mahal,camsandeep,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Photo Stop,"This place can't be accessed but you can have a good photos at the time of sunset and sunrise. Went during Kite festival, this sky around this place is filled with kites. It is a really enjoyable moment but too crowded."
Jal_Mahal,abrahamsuji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Unique structure,A unique structure in water. Cannot go inside. Can admire it from distance. Surrounding water body is not clean. There are local street sale on the sides. Can visit on passing by to Amer fort
Jal_Mahal,mgaurav7,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Visit to Jaipur,Jal Mahal is another tourist place to visit in jaipur.Though it is not open for public.It adds to the beauty if scenic Jaipur.
Jal_Mahal,Sanchi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Super Place,Awesome Place to visit with family and friends. Best location for all ages in every season. Recommended.
Jal_Mahal,Jeanine,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Floating palace better in pictures,Although this is definitely something unique the pictures online make it look much more spectacular than it really is. Very dirty near it and a fence obscures any good views.
Jal_Mahal,RSD78,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Pretty but not accessible,"A pretty summer palace in the middle of a lake, which is great for a photo backdrop, but, as it's not accessible, that's about it. Stalls and and attractions along the lakeside where you take photos from make it more entertaining."
Jal_Mahal,Steve R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Light up the Night,"If you have the opportunity, save the trip to Jal Mahal for night time.  Although it is equally impressive during the day, the reflection of the palace on the dark water at night really accentuates this place.  Plus, it is MUCH less busy."
Jal_Mahal,raam,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Don't expect too much,Try to go at evening to see the light work.I went for sunrise view but it's been little foggy and it will take less than hour to enjoy the area.
Jal_Mahal,Kilroy_Mariner,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Passing through visit,"There are whole lot of hawkers all around Jal Mahal promenade, making it lose out its charm.A short visit (10 mins),whilst passing thru is sufficient."
Jal_Mahal,zobi2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Interesting site with locals ,"Mostly Indians hanging out here, interesting view. You can buy and eat street food, stroll along the street.However not much to do as a tourist."
Jal_Mahal,Pratima Moghe,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Picturesque view,"Though the palace is not accessible to tourist anymore, one can see it from the street. The water levels are at the palace floor levels giving it a floating feel. Can be utilised as a refreshment break while appreciating the view. Should be visited during the day. Light show is also available in the evening but not much worth."
Jal_Mahal,Sreekumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Only a possible view from the lakeshore ,You must have seen this installation in many movies.We can only move from the lakeshore. There are no boating available now.

Jal_Mahal,Milita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Lovely park to chill and shop,A good stop after the amber fort. A lovely place to walk around and relax. There are small stalls to buy souvenirs and one can take pictures in ethnic clothes.
Jal_Mahal,Devendra G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Picturesque view,"Jal Mahal (meaning ""Water Palace"") is a palace in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur. Basis the information shared by guide, the palace was used by the royal family, especially during the summers. However, a tourist can only watch the palace from side of the roads. One is not allowed to visit the palace by any means. However, the palalce has picturesque view from the road."
Jal_Mahal,ZestBKK,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Not Much To See,"We visited Jal Mahal on our way back to Jaipur from the Amber Fort. While the palace itself is picturesque enough, you can’t get to it and so have to look from the viewing area which tends to attract a large number of vendors. We visited mid morning and so perhaps visiting in the evening when it is lit up would provide a better view and photo opportunity."
Jal_Mahal,prasanna n,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples, Stop-click-go  !!,The view is splendid if u can ignore the noise around. Difficult to find a serene spot for a photograph before the hawkers literally mob u with their stuff. 
Jal_Mahal,BeaBi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Just OK,"Area around Lake is like dumping site, lots of rats around. The building looks very nice, but better on the picture."
Jal_Mahal,Paulnewman04,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,A serene get away,"We were on a trip to Agartala and local friends took us to the Neer Mahal built by the local Maharaja in 1930. To reach there you have to fo by a motor boat which operates with a minimum  of 20 tourists or you can hire a small rowing boat for Rs. 300. The palace is a white wonder. It has 24 rooms, built in 1930, it was a place where Rabindranath Tagore had visited 7 times. The garden is beautiful and the palace is well maintained.  It is a must visit if you are in the state of Tripura."
Jal_Mahal,Samir S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Jal Mahal - stunning architecture,"One of the beautiful architectural marvel in heart of Jaipur , Rajasthan ,India.Maharaj Madho Singh -1 constructed the Jal Mahal in 1750. It is in the middle of man sagar lake. Jal Mahal , seems floating in lake and from the bank it appears as a single story building , but as our guide told there are four submerged floor beneath the  water level . Architectural marvel stops the water seepage for so many years. The light sand colored stone walls of the Jal Mahal Jaipur are at a stark contrast to the deep blue of the waters of the lake, while from the innards of the palace lush foliage sprouts. One can not go to Jal Mahal currently , visitors stop at the bank of the lake and click photograph.  Earlier , as per our guide , gondolas used to carry visitors right up-to the Mahal. In winter one can see variety of birds in the lake. Worth visiting this place if you are in Jaipur."

Jal_Mahal,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,It’s so picturesque,"Jal Mahal is a palace in Jaipur and located in the middle of a lake which is why the name of the palace translates into Water Palace in English. The palace is reachable by boat only, but well worth a detour because it’s so picturesque."
