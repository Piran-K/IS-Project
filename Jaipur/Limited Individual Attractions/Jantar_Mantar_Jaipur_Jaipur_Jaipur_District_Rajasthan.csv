Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,The observatory of the rulers of Jaipur.,"This was where the rulers of Jaipur had teams of astronomers and astrologers watching the heavens to make observations. It contains a number of technical marvels, including the world’s largest purpose-built sundial. However, as impressive as everything here is, it didn’t advance the science of astronomy much, as the theories built upon here were already known elsewhere and the precision of the observations didn’t in themselves add to scientific knowledge. But it is still a very impressive sight to see and a must-see while in Jaipur."

He had built 5 Jantar Mantars across the western part of the country (Jaipur, Mathura, Ujjain and Benaras) though currently operational only in Jaipur.Definitely recommend and should be part of your city tour that can be very informative to the children.Refer to the review photos for the ticket prices break up and operating hours."

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,A Tale of Two Sites.,"MONEY can be life for a country's great archaeological sites....but lack of it can be death.Of all the places I visited during a fantastic holiday to India it was Jantar Mantar that brought home to me the fine margins between deciding what to preserve of a country's history and what to abandon to the elements and encroaching undergrowth.First I'll give you the good news because much money has been lavished on Jantar Mantar to ensure that this large site containing nineteen astronomical instruments is preserved for future generations to enjoy and appreciate.It was completed in 1734 and deserves its place as a UNESCO World Heritage site.Among the instruments I strolled round were the world's largest stone sundial.For those of you who don't know -- and that included me because I had to look it up -- Jantar Mantar literally means ""calculating machine"".This astronomical observatory  touches everything from star and zodiac signs to time, the sun and the location of the Pole star.To show you how good their calculations were, the best instrument can calculate the correct time accurate to within two seconds.Now we come to the bad news.A short time later in my holiday I climbed all the way up to the Sun Temple overlooking Jaipur.Along the way my guide pointed to the left where a farmer wearing only a loin cloth was stood near a big pile of cow manure feeding leaves to his animals.Very nice, I thought, and prepared to walk away, but my guide shook his head and pointed again. This time I saw what he meant.Beyond the pile of manure and almost swallowed up by trees and thick undergrowth was a smaller version of Jantar Mantar.We stumbled our way through thorny growth, grass and tree roots and the deeper we got the clearer our view of the astronomical instruments became.Many still had their original curved marble marked out in sections for calculations, but some had been damaged or looted, other had been destroyed altogether and it was clear that Nature and the passage of time had not been kind to the site.So why am I mentioning it? Because this site is older and, therefore, historically more important than Jantar Mantar.Its downfall lay in its size. It was built in the very early 1700s but was much smaller than Jantar Mantar, so when restoration money became available the authorities opted to spend it on the much larger site. To me it is a bit like renovating a football stadium while leaving the Colosseum to crumble into ruins.What anyone reading this review could do is pay their own visit to the Sun Temple and then stop off and view this astronomical site for themselves. If enough tourists mention it then perhaps the Indian authorities will spare a bit of money to preserve this site as well.Jantar Mantar is a wonderful and fascinating site to visit, but spare a thought for its smaller poorer brother on your way up to the Sun Temple."

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Mukesh B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Auditorium session a must,"Royals are not for the luxurious life, their battles, the size of their state, their palaces and the wealth they amassed. Not too many Kings are known to be involved in science and scientific experiments. But Jai Singh of Jaipur was different. He understood the growing population of his state and shifted from his ancestral Kingdom Aamer by creating a complete new city called Jaipur in the early 17th century.The boundary walls were created with pink stones hence the name Pink City.The king had planned the city in colonies and the roads of each colony is cross crossed exactly in 90 degrees. You would never be lost in Jaipur city, ant street you are in will connect you to the main road exactly in 90 degrees.That's science used in planning the city.Coming to Jantar mantar. It is another masterpiece of science and understanding of heavenly bodies.In the days when watches and clocks were not available, Jain Singh with his men created the perfect Sun Dial. No one would have thought that sun and it's shade can be used to locate the currect time of the day minute by minute.There are other set ups created in Jantar, all to do with the study of heavenly bodies and their connection with human life like the zodiac signs.I strongly suggest one should visit the Auditorium in Jantar Mantar first. An half an hour audio video session gives you a clear understanding of each and every set up created inside the Jantar Mantar. Once you have known how each one of them functions, the way you look at it changes completely.It is no more a piece of ancient monuments to you but the science. You start analysing it in the same manner it was designed for.You tend to think like a scientist and not a mere spectator or visitor.Unlike the monument in other cities, this place is laced with green garden and trees. It gives you relief from the scorching heat from the Sun. The washroom is well maintained.All in all a great place to explore of our ancient science at a very affordable ticket price"

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Arpit Agarwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Jantar Mantar - Jaipur,"At first glance, Jantar Mantar may look to be nothing more than a bunch of larger-than-life abstract sculptures. But this is not an art gallery—it's a special collection of astronomical tools started by Rajput ruler Jai Singh II to measure the heavens nearly 300 years ago.The observatory consists of nineteen instruments for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking the location of major stars as the earth orbits around the sun, ascertaining the declinations of planets, and determining the celestial altitudes and related ephemerides."

It was like an ancient science experiment come to life.  Built between 1727-34 AD it has a noteworthy collection of traditional astronomical instruments.  I recommend a guide as most of the items would be impossible to determine what they are/were or used for.  If science isn't your thing the angles and geometry if the instruments also make them very photogenic, the while place was a great unexpected surprise for me.  I wish we had had more time there."

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,PhilthetravellerXI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Fantastic experience of early science.,"This site is a must when you are in Jaipur but do take a tour otherwise it is near impossible to understand the complexities and science of the site. It is the largest observatory in India. We were expecting to see telescopes but the area is dedicated to shadows and movements of the sun and stars with shadows cast as the sun moves around at various times of the day indeed months and year. It is amazing how the early Indian scientists, going back 300 years, were able to document and predict times and locations based on the solar system. Horoscopes are catered for and all the astrological signs are there. To look at the park it appears more of an amusement or architectural centre until one has the explanations  about the geometry and lines of shadows and light. Quite amazing. A modest entry fee applies and we took a pre-booked tour which lasted around an hour. It is also worth buying the guidebook which explains more about the science and history of the observatory."

T he observatories with their monumental instruments, built in the early 18th century,have fascinated the scientists and layman alike more than 300 years. What  makes them fascinating that they were built in a day and age when astronomy had ceased to be medieval, and great strides had been made in devolopment in Europe.Newton already had published  in 1685 his PRINCIPIA which provided a solid basis for the theoritical aspect of celestial mechanics,In 1656,HUYGENS invented pendulum clock for accurate time keeping. John Flamsteed published  his  calibrated catalog of stars with unprecendented accuracy of + 10 of arc.micrometer and crosswire fitted telescopes were a common sight in observatories.      Jai singh, unware of devolopments in Europe. erected naked eye instuments of masonary and stone,in the tradition of medieval astronomers such as Ulugh Beg.

It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and houses two large sundials, accurate to two seconds, and a wide collection of other 18th century astrological instruments. Our guide explained how each worked - it is simply incredible.  The instruments were all built on this site - they have not been moved to get everything at one location.You need a good guide to understand the importance of astrology in Hindu life.  for example it is still used today for business, politics and assessing the compatibility in marriage arrangements.This an intersting collection and a must for any visit to Jaipur."

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Zebanuck,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Go with a guide who knows,This is a great place to go if you’re into science or astronomy but you really need a good guide who can explain what all the devices are. 
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Wen-D K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Mind blowing,Truly mind blowing to think these instruments of astrological measurement were designed some 300 years ago and are still accurate. Fascinating place.
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Dennis P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,An interesting masonry observatory,These stone intruments from over 300 years ago were built on the inspiration of the young Maharaja Jai Singh who was passionate about astronomy. While it was fascinating to find out that a huge stone sundial could measure the accuracy of time to within 3 seconds in in all honesty became a bit bored with all the contraptions and went to find a place to sit in the sun while awaiting the rest of the group.
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Morris,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Even if you're not interested in astronomy this place is mind blowing!,"Sun dials have always interested me but seeing this collection of every size(some 5 feet tall up to as tall as a three story building), shape and style of object used to measure the earths movements is truly astounding. We did have a guide to explain each structure and how and what it measured with the earths movement so I""m not sure it would have been as informative on your own."
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Steven_Teo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Marvel the ingenuity of old,"If you are interested in history, astrology, or anything that has to do with timekeeping, this is the place to visit. Then you will need a guide to take you through this amazing place. I could not help but marvel how the scientist of old could figure out all the contraption in this place."
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,SalimM,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Just an amazing place,"The Jantar Mantar was constructed by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II who from a very young age was fascinated by the movement of the celestial objects.  He built five of these of which the one in Jaipur was the biggest.The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur consists of 19 large instruments each serving a very specific purpose. The most significant among these is the Samrat Yantra which is the largest stone sundial in the world and is now also a Unesco heritage site.The instruments at the Jaipur Jantar Mantar are made of stone and are very large structures. To ensure accuracy the structures were first made out of wood and the measurements were adjusted. Once the dimensions were perfected the construction was replicated in stone to give us the magnificent Jantar Mantar.To fully appreciate the wonders here, you really need a guide who can explain what is what so you can see exactly how they work. Absolutely jaw dropping to see that these instruments were build over 300 years ago."
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Hardeep N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Feat of science,"Personally I found this to be quite interesting because I had a tour guide with me, who was able to explain what the different parts were and how they would have been used when first created. I do question how interesting I’d have found some of this without a guide. In any case, a lot of what you see is a feat of mankind and how it has created, and that’s worth the ticket price if nothing else."
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,SallyRY,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Interesting ,Interesting for a quick look around with amazingly accurate sundials. Unless you have a particular interest in the history of time telling though it will not take too long to see.

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Prasad M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Amazing monument,"This place is amazing.  It is simply jaw dropping.  How could kings of olden days construct such civil structures in stone, marble and bricks with such accuracy.  Absolutely precise astronomical calculations with such huge structures! Their knowledge of astronomy is truly remarkable.  In fact, the guide could tell the time by showing the shadow of a static object, accurate to the minute.  You can check your watch. This more extensive than the one in Delhi.  A lot more insreuments."

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,emanmahmoud1,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Boring+++++,"This visit was part of our G Adventure golden triangle one week guided tour. You can only visit if you like astrology or astronomy. You need the sun to understand the demo but our day was extremely cloudy and dull. Our guide was like a physics or maths teacher giving us lesson and quizzing us as if we were school kids. The photos on tripadvisor are photoshopped, the place is pale and bland. Not my cup of tea."
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Fraser66,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Biggest Sundial in India,This is an observatory with the biggest sundial in India. Our guide explained in detail how each part of the observatory functioned and how the dials and timings worked.The astronomers in those days were so clever to work out how to read time and seasons as well as the zodiac.Worth a visit if you like science 
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Philip P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Interesting to intriguing visit.,"Once more, please take a guide (at least an audio guide)! I paid about 25-30 €/USD for 4-5 hours and several monuments, not more, and it give not only valuable info but also spares time at ticket offices, ...This observatory looks attractive but you need the sun (what we missed), some time, and preferable some basic info about astrology (what I miss...) rather then of astronomy."
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Rucha121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Ancient scientific place,"We visited this place with kids, as they had learnt about Jantar mantar in school books. we wanted to experience first hand, how in olden days they used to calculate time using sunlight.

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Richard B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Wonderful outdoor astronomy and sculpture park,A must see for anyone who loves science and art.  Built in 1726 this is a beautiful display of both abstract  sculpture and accurate astronomy measuring devices.  A remarkable synthesis of art and science
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Philip_Marsh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Quirky,If I hadn’t been told that it was an observatory I would have guessed that it was a sculpture park. The site houses a series (19) of architectural astronomical instruments built by Maratha Raipur King Sawai Jai Singh II. These were completed in 1734. When their functions are explained they make sense but don’t ask me to repeat the explanation.Most visitors seemed to be somewhat bemused.As it’s located in the centre of Jaipur then it’s worth a visit whilst you are there.
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Paulo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Incredible,A most incredible place  to visit as we had a friendly guide .Nice to know about old way of calculating time.

Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Kate R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,OK,To make any sense of it you will need a guide to explain how each part works.I personally found it boring and would have preferred to opt out of this tour.Very popular with the locals as they put a huge influence on their astrological readings when entering into arranged marriages.
Jantar_Mantar_Jaipur,Himanshu Bhatt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,good place to visit,"its one the unique place to visit there is a BIG sun dial and apart from sun dial there are many other observatory instruments works on sun,air and wind directions are available there "
