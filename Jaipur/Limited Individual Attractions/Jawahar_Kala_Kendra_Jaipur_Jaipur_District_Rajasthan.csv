The cafeteria at JKK is known for it's excellent coffee and dosa, do try to make time for some. The place is best visited when there is an ongoing presentation. You can also pick up local handicrafts here at economical prices; the painting folders sold here are excellent."
Jawahar_Kala_Kendra,aviral812,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Friends,Need more such places in Jaipur,"Jawahar Kala Kendra is the art hub of Jaipur. I have seen plays, heard opera, had meals at Indian Coffee House, attended handicrafts and food festivals, and sometimes come here just to sit down and relax while watching people rehearsing. I have visited this place with my family, friends and sometimes alone as well. We need more such places in Jaipur where one can easily meet artists."
Jawahar_Kala_Kendra,ddevarshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Couples,If you are an art lover then you must visit this place,"An artist, art critique or art lover would certainly like to visit this place. Earlier Art Gallery of Ravindra Rang manch (Ram Niwas Garden) was a happening place in field of arts but now JKK has become art capital of the town. There is an open air theater, two other theaters, art galleries and a coffee house in this area. The huge open campus is used for handicrafts exhibitions. There is no entry ticket. During the summer vacations of schools, the kendra (Center) also organizes classes for teaching fine, performing or visual arts to young kids. In a way it is mini Bharat Bhawan for Jaipur."
Jawahar_Kala_Kendra,MarianneF26,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Friends,Cool and relaxing place,"This is one of my favourite spots in Jaipur. The atmosphere is relaxing, and you get a break from the huzzling and buzzling streets of the city. This is also a place where they arrange concerts, dance preformances and art exibitions. And don`t miss the craftfair at Holi. In the eating section I love their Special Dosa and Cold Coffee! :)"
Jawahar_Kala_Kendra,Oiane S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Business,New-traditional architecture,"Not to miss if you are following the Charles Correa heritage. I liked the idea of creating a hub for arts, music, cinema.Reminds me a little bit ot Jantar Mantar, the astrological idea is flowing in these spaces."
Jawahar_Kala_Kendra,Steve H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015,In need of TLC but still an engaging building,"Designed by Charles Correa, this building, essentially an Indian Arts Centre, is a welcome counterpart to all the historical edifices in Jaipur. It draws on traditional spatial arrangements but pushes and pulls them into a modern context. Definitely berth a visit, but the fabric of the building desperately needs maintenance& care. "
Jawahar_Kala_Kendra,Nagendra_Rajawat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Friends,Hang out place for students,"Its proximity to a couple of colleges and Rajasthan University helps it attract hordes of students. The reasonable prices of refreshments served there also is a big draw among students. A good place for a short chit chat or long discussions. It keeps on hosting several exhibitions related to handicrafts. Recommend visit to the place if some exhibition, play or some other fine arts activity is going on."

Jawahar_Kala_Kendra,pia_qcner,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 • Friends,art in great piece of architecture,"theater performances, cultural events and exhibitions collected in great modern architecture (my thing). green area around with outdoor museum with reconstructions of traditional villages from around the Rajasthan (museum is not impresive though). you would have to check what is happening there on spot, because most of events are temporary. there is restaurant/buffet inside where you can enjoy typical Indian cuisine for a fair price. good place to hang out and no so turistic."

Jawahar_Kala_Kendra,profpmlakhotia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Friends,The Cultural Soul of the Pink City,"Have been in the India's cultural hub that Jaipur is, for two decades now coming from the cultural capital that Calcutta ever has been, I have visited Jawahar Kala Kendra every now and then. Its gallerias, theatrical arenas, its lavish gardens and open areas and its Shilpgram - the mini craft village have their unique charm. And one would be hardly satisfied to have visited the place without enjoying the tidbits of its Coffee House. Once in a while, one gets hurts about its maintenance and reception approach but once you start enjoying what it offers, one is bound to forget the lack of human skill as compared to its natural beauty and artistic aroma."

The place is well managed and centrally located. My only grouse is the parking facility. Why don't the administartors of JKK allow people's vehicles to be parked inside the premises? 
Jawahar_Kala_Kendra,Dharmendar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2013 • Friends,Cultural Hub,"Jawahar Kala Kendra is better known as JKK and is a cultural hub that attracts a lot of artists, musicians and other craftsmen.
