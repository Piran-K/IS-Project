Highly recommend!"

Kerala_Ayurveda_Kendra,mahendra75,,,,"Great Ayurveda spa experience in India! I found this place to be the perfect level of hospitality that made the entire experience from start to finish relaxing. First of all, they organize transport for you which is just a nice touch. Then the staff, who spoke decent English, would walk you through your package options without being any sort of pushy. Very professional and relaxing process and I found the facilities to be quite clean. The massage itself was great. It was my first time ever doing shirodhara, which is the Indian hot oil dripping and wow was it surreal. My massage therapist “Lucy” (probably spelling that wrong) was great throughout the whole process checking on my pressure, making sure I was comfortable, etc. and finally, pricing was reasonable. definitely recommend if you’re looking for a massage place in Jaipur! As an American tourist who has found India to be overwhelming this is just what I needed to relax"

Booking a massage was very easy and we were seen promptly. The massage itself was typical of what you will find in an Asian spa (if you have modesty qualms, you will need to communicate this upfront with English-speaking staff). I loved the oil massage and my facial; they were both invigorating and relaxing. My husband also had a massage and nasal treatment, and found both to be excellent. Highly recommend for anyone in need of a recharge while in Jaipur."
