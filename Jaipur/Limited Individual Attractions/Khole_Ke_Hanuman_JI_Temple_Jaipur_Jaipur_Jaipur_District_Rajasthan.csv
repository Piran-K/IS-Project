And also, the monkey master, Deepish was there who gave us a tour and helped us interact with monkeys and get pictures. You should get him as guide when you visit this place!!"

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,Wanderba,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,"Cool temple in pretty countryside, hypocritical/aggressive priests.","Overall my experience here was good. I enjoyed seeing the temple and the monkeys. Being out in the desert hills was also cool. However, it is very dirty. Also, I was harassed by a priest for apparently not giving a large enough donation. They are all smiles until they don't get paid what they want. Not very Godly or holy if you ask me...religion is the same no matter where you go. Some believe for the right reasons and others are hypocrites and pretenders. Be wary of the welcoming smiles and proselytizing. Just enjoy the scenery and novelty of the experience."

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,rajdsingh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,"Dirty, smelly and money grabbing temples","It is a real shame - this could be a wonderful and beautiful site as long as it was maintained properly by the local temples but instead they choose to leave the place to rot and there are flies, mosquitoes and rotten food everywhere. We saw shoes, underwear and other disgusting things just laying around.The temple people are pressuring you to give donations but you can't see where the money is being spent because it certainly isn't the maintenance of this place. Disgraceful and shameful.The monkeys are wild so be careful - they're cute and lovely but wild, so they'll snatch things from you :)"

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,in_voyager,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,Beautiful temple on the hill,Visited Khole Ke Hanuman temple during my recent Jaipur trip. It's very peaceful and serene. I'm sure it must be very crowded on Tues/Saturdays. 
Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,drgizmo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Mix of cool and creepy,"We came late (almost 5 pm) on a Friday and monkeys were everywhere (I believe there may be a regular feeding event around 4 most days, which would explain that). Pretty neat to see so many all around, and they were not aggressive, probably because many had either just eaten or were still hanging around finishing their chapati and looking rather satisfied, so no need to harass the visitors. :) We were surprised by the guy who chased us down at the entrance to pay 50 rupees per camera (but that aligned with the signs we had missed at the entrance so we did not protest too much). Then made the mistake of following another young man into the first white temple on the right in the complex. After telling him we were not paying he said he was not a guide and of course would not stop talking to us while we tried to look around in peace. Before we knew it he was saying prayers to us and tying the sacred strings on our wrist and then finally the demand for 100 rupees per person as a donation. I knew that was coming and it's always awkward to get out of it. My husband folded up one 100 rupee note and offered it just to get out and then we were hounded about paying more, but refused and left feeling annoyed. (I've been working in India for 20 years so it's not like this situation is new to me...) We then were careful not to enter any more temples and just wandered through the complex heading up to the top gradually. There were lots of flies everywhere and discarded bits of food on the ground from the monkeys, so kind of a mess at various points but there are some really interesting viewpoints as well and you feel like you are off the main tourist trail. When we descended and left, the guy at the first temple and his friend came running out to accost us and complain that the 100 rupee note my husband had left for him was ""broken"" (it had a bit of a rip on it). I had no more patience at that time and told him we did not have any more so he could either keep that one or give it back to us and we'd be on our way. He kept it and we left."

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,ddevarshi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,A lot of travellers are confusing it with Galta temple,"I have observed that a lot of photographs of Galta Temple have been posted here so do not decide to visit this place merely on the basis of photographs posted here. The Galta Temple and Khole ke Hanuman Temple are two different locations, kilometers apart from each other. A Jaipurite keeps on visiting this temple as now a days alot of people organize 'Goths' occasion such as  birthday, superannuation, returning from a pilgrimage etc. You need not spend energy in organizing since everything is managed by the mandir or parties or family get-together at this place. Such parties were known as 'goths' when done for pleasure and spending leisure time during pleasant weather of monsoon. Goth may or may not have a religious purpose attached to it. Such parties are also known as 'prasadi' when done to some auspicious or religious or social management. You need to pay only. Charges are not as exorbitant as they are of other event managers or caterers. Added advantage is that religious people of Jaipur who are critical about how much one spent, how much one saved, how great was the show, how was the food etc, do not dare to comment regarding anything since it is no longer a party but a 'prasadi' i.e. thanks to lord or God who has blessed the family with auspicious day.  There are 24 such kitchens (rasoi) or 'dining halls'. All 24 may be busy on holidays. The place is surrounded by Aravalli hills. There is sufficient parking and the place is not far from city of Jaipur. In addition you get to have darshan of Hanuman ji. What more one could ask for? If you are a non-religious tourist looking for historical monuments  then you may not find anything interesting here."
Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,Caroline M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Must see!!,"We visited here for a few hours one morning. We chose to go alone as we just wanted to take in the view and the wildlife. Monkeys are everywhere and it's likely you will be ambushed. It's well worth sitting near the bottom pool to watch the monkeys diving In and out of the water. I recommend you avoid going inside the temple as they want money for your visit and show no gratitude to donations, big or small! Not the friendliest and the temples themselves are not much to look at. Much better to view the monkeys hanging out of the windows etc. Be sure to walk through the centre and up the path that winds up a small hill. You will be rewarded with beautiful views of Jaipur and you will meet some quirky locals on your way up and down. We did not see langurs in the temple area but we were rewarded with a large troop in the trees on exit."

I think I would have enjoyed it more if it had been better maintained.  To begin with, the car park was something of a farmyard with so many animals including cows and buffalo and a great deal of faeces.  Inside the temple complex the buildings were not in good condition, the pool waters did not appeal and there was a huge amount of rubbish strewn across the complex.  If you like monkeys, you will like it here as there are hundreds and visitors are encouraged to buy bananas to feed to them. We did not linger."

This location did not disappoint.Several Hindu temples (some still in use) scatter a cobblestone pathway that runs between a mountain ridge. Walk the entire path from one end to the next for optimal site seeing (and an epic view of Jaipur from the top temple). Several monkey families (of two different species) inhabit these ruins / buildings / trees / hills. If you don't see them at first, just keep exploring. They seem to go down closer to the foot of the mountain (on either side of it) to get food at certain times of day. On the side facing downtown Jaipur (opposite side of where the main temple complex is), a man arrives daily to feed them fresh and discarded fruit. This is quite the scene to see.Drivers are able to access either side of the mountain for you to start your hike from. "

When I googled 'Jaipur,' this was the first picture that came up- and I decided we were going to India. So we HAD to see this in person, and it did not disappoint!We went by car, and while I am usually all for walking, I'm glad we didn't- it is a looong walk to this temple over all kinds of terrain. You will pay a small 'camera' fee at the entrance- i think it was about 50r each, and the guy actually wrote us a receipt, so it's probably not a scam. we did not enter any of the buildings at the bottom of the hill- at this point in our trip, we had learned that pretty much any time you are invited inside a building or engaged in conversation, you will be expected to pay or tip at the end, and we were pretty weary of it. however, we did climb the hill and explored all the open air areas, and the temple is pretty cool. there a few small pools and monkeys everywhere. we also saw about a million pigeons and a couple peacocks on the ride there.we went in the late afternoon, so it was fairly shaded and quiet, only a few other couples walking around with guides, and almost no touts or beggars."

The swayambhu murti of Hanuman ji was at the centre of this temple, to which devotees regularly throng. It was not crowded when we went there, and we got good darshan. The temple also has other deities including shiv ji and it was great to be there on Mahashivratri. "

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,MKBhatnagar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,"""Jai Hanuman Gyan Guru Sagar""",The temple is situated on Jaipur Delhi Highway in the mountains hardly 10 kms from main city. It was identified in 1965.It is one of the most ancient and famous temples of Rajasthan. The temple has developed slathers over the years. Individuals from rich to poor come to visit this integral part of Indian tradition for the faith they have in their hearts.It is one of the biggest temple in Rajasthan and people have blind trust for this place.  You will have to go either by your own or hired transport as there is no public transport available. The place is beautiful and peaceful gives mental peace if you sit there for a while and spend some time.  Its a good place and should be visited once.

The complex is large and provides a lot of space to sit around and enjoy the greenery and openness. There are several kitchens that are available on hire if you wish to have a 'Bhandara'.The temple is very well revered, and people travel great distances from Jaipur, even by foot (based on their beliefs)  to visit and pay their respects to Hanumanji."

Unfortunately, the water was drained when I was there last week. Not sure if it only has water seasonally or not....hopefully it's normally full of water. The Monkey Temple was a bit of a trek outside of Jaipur, but it's definitely worth the journey and was one of our favorite places in Jaipur. "

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,Greg T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,Interesting temple,"This temple complex is quite interest and not as crowded as others. Its definitely worth making the excursion out of the city to see.There are two ways of getting here. Either by bus which takes you to the main entrance, or walking the path over the hill from the city side. I took the path over the hill. It is over a km and first winds up before winding down. Wear some shoes with decent tread as I wore jandals which had the tread worn down and I kept slipping on the paved stones.There are also probably more monkeys on the path than in the actual temple complex."

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,Jack K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Fascinating Temple Swarming With Playful Monkeys,"This is a wonderful change of pace sightseeing spot near Jaipur.  It is a series of  colorful religious buildings and bathing tanks in a relatively unpopulated area. The monkeys are fun to watch at play and not at all aggressive. The bathers follow Hindu rituals and one can also catch  Aarti ceremonies, even in these narrow, small tanks.  Less than an hour will suffice at one's leisure.  It is fun to buy bananas and other treats at the entrance form hawkers.  The monkeys are used to taking them casually and can strip the skin skillfully without blinking an eye. Highly recommended."

This was one of the filthiest places I have been to in all of India. Plates and cups where thrown all over the place. Hundred of makaks around and most of them in bad shape and pretty aggressive too.

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,Nisha K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016,Scenicly located,One of the most beautiful and strategically located temple by far i have seen .The scenic view of the temple in between the hills and the greenery around is breath taking and has a pleasant effect on the mind.But is disheartening to see that the place is getting spoilt by the visitors throwing plastic and other stuff in the pond below. Would have be great if the government takes initiative to conserve  the heritage of such places and make the public aware about cleanliness.Yeah and the place is an ideal hanuman ka temple with the big population of monkeys all around.

Best time to visit it is dawn. The temple is managed so nicely, small kiosks, street sellers, hawkers, you can enjoy it all there. It is so peaceful and refreshing to visit it, the parking facility is nice, general public facilities are also on the point. The temple is huge and magnificent, it also has the facility to celebrate your occasions by throwing a dinner party"

We went in early in the day, and some street vendors sold us peanuts so we could feed the monkeys that stand on both sides of the trail. The views from the top of the mountain just before taking the steps down to the temple are breathtaking. We really enjoyed our visit."

Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,ngrewal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,Distant and distantly eerie,"Quite an odd little place as you may frequently hear of spots in India. Is it a temple? Is it a walking trail? Another home for scores of monkeys? A tourist attraction?Apparently you can walk across to the monkey temple in Jaipur from here although I came by tuk-tuk so didnt want to venture across that way. It was a decrepit in many places and clearly wasn't seen as a priority to restore. Some areas are beautiful and it was cool to see people stripping down at the top to make a splash. If you're sick of temples already, this isn't a conventional one. There aren't lots of statues with hidden meanings you won't know but there is a plethora of little buildings to go in and out of if you dare."
Khole_Ke_Hanuman_JI_Temple_Jaipur,Bali2006,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,A place that inspired the most opposite feelings ever experienced,"One of the places with the most stunning architecture in the world, BUT cannot get over the utter state of dereliction of the whole complex.There are people asking for money as donations to the temple, but I doubt that any of it really goes to the upkeep due to massive amounts of trash and worse everywhere in the floors.Got some of my most precious photos ever, but I wished that the government really takes over the complex, so that there is minimal cleaning and restoration.I would go back as it is STUNNING. Only for the adventurous."
