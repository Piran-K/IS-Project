Maharaja_Sawai_Man_Singh_II_Museum,Christopher,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Jaipur's rich history and beautiful architecture for all to see.,"This is a must if you are in Jaipur for more than a day; you will need to spend at least half a day there to enjoy and absorb its rich history and beautiful architecture.  It’s worth going online before you visit because there are numerous visitor ‘packages’ on offer, including exclusive access to private rooms in the Palace, night-time visits, and how much you should pay one of the tourist guides who hover inside the gates (300 Rupees).  The standard entry cost however is 700 Rupees if you just turn up, worth every penny or Rupee.There is so much to see, most of which has been written about here, but I would urge you, if you’re interested in this sort of thing, to visit the easy-to-miss Arms and Armour museum, tucked away in a corner, which has the most exquisite and inventive weapons of attack and defence, including serrated swords that slice through chain mail and armour.  My favourite exhibit was the ‘tiger claw’ – a knuckleduster concealing in the palm of the hand of its wearer, five razor sharp curved blades.  Given the choice, I’d rather be killed by a tiger."

Maharaja_Sawai_Man_Singh_II_Museum,jonahNJ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,A larger than life man,"Though this is a relatively small museum, it provided great insight into Man Singh. The displays showed that this was not just a powerful man who is iconic in the history of India in general and Jaipur in particular. He was also a literally huge man—approximately 7 feet tall who weighed approximately 500 pounds. The robe that was on display looked more  like a tent that could provide cover for a small family. Yet the robe was very ornate as were other articles of clothing that were on display. Also adjacent to the museum is a “garage” which displays several vintage carriages.A visit to this museum is well worth a look for the robe alone!"

Maharaja_Sawai_Man_Singh_II_Museum,jamesdean25745,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Over the top but interesting,"Three steps lead up to the entrance where a small foreigners rate (100 rupees) gains you entrance to a corridor that winds around the well-lit building, in which there are various rooms with exhibits. These range from masks to full size puppets; the masks primarily denoting evil and various wall mounted examples of the puppets and central display tables containing background information papers (not in English) were typically for folklore support.Although there are ceiling fans these were not activated even when were invited to watch a 10 minute puppet show. The auditorium is quite small and the end stage clearly allows the puppets to carry off their extravagant routines (Bollywood for puppets).The sheer flamboyance makes this a site to visit."

I would say that ths is the only palace in Jaipur that is so much maintained. The king of this palace - Maharaja - ManSingh II is still alive.

Maharaja_Sawai_Man_Singh_II_Museum,tk44,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2012,"Interesting enough, but not exciting","This museum is located in the gorgeous City Palace of Jaipur and is kind of a poor cousin to it. It's like they thought a palace needs an additional attraction - put up some pictures and called it a museum. The collection has some value as a brief view of history, of course, but as a separate attraction, the museum was not attractive enough for me.You need to go through all the usual hassle - bag checks, ticketing, double-stamping etc and it is not really worth the crowds in there. If I'd visit the City Palace again, I would stay outside and stare/photograph the exeptionally beautiful moghul palace architecture and only go inside if it gets really hot in the sun. The visit took me about 10 mins in the queue and 15 mins inside."
