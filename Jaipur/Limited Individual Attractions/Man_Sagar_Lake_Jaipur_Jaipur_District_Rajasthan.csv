Man_Sagar_Lake,Lucy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,Underwhelming despite apparent popularity,"We went here as part of a day tour which took us to 5/6 other places. There is an unbelievable amount of people selling things and the hassle that comes with it as a tourist. We took a photo of it and left, as it’s quite far away and you can’t approach it, it felt like once we had seen it we could walk away after a minute."

Man_Sagar_Lake,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,The lake housing the Jal Mahal; needs better amenities,"The Man Sagar Lake is better known as the lake housing the famous Jal Mahal. Surrounded by hills on 3 sides, this lake has a promenade on the fourth side, where visitors come to take photos.The lake itself is not in good shape, with cleanliness (rather, the lack of it) being a major issue. Also, there is no boating facility provided, which could be useful for tourists as well as a money-spinner for the authorities. On the positive side, the pavilions in the lake, offer great opportunities for bird watching, with a large number and variety of birds gathered on them at any given point of time. Sprucing up of the place by authorities will make it a top attraction."
Man_Sagar_Lake,rapha_y_nici,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Beautiful area,The scenery here is picturesque if you are able to forget the traffic and the crowds. The water palast Jal Mahal has been built by Jai Singh II. even its history doesn’t seem to be absolutely clear. Worth a stop and doable onthe way to Amber and Nahargarh Fort.

Man_Sagar_Lake,SerendipityIndia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Huge pretty lake,"Man Sagar Lake is the one with Jal Mahal in center of it. On a day with nice weather, with the backdrop of mountains, it makes for an interesting evening out. The pictures with the half submerged Jal Mahal are a photographers delight. Don't think you can step into the lake with boats and all, just can enjoy the scenery and the ducks that are swimming by. There are lot of vendors along the lake with things like Camel ride, photos in traditional attire - especially opposite the Trident hotel."

Currently closed to the public and under litigation between the people who bought it to open a hotel and those wanting it not to open (sad).It was restored apparently but you can’t se it currently except from afarThe view is impressive but spoilt by trash strewn everywhere and in the water.

Man_Sagar_Lake,MikeFJones,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,"Man Sagar Lake - Built for Famines, turned into a Toilet but slowly Recovering!","Its an artificial lake, situated in Jaipur, the capital of the state of Rajasthan in India. It was named after Raja Man Singh, the then ruler of Amer, who constructed it in 1610 by damming the Dharbawati river. The Jal Mahal is situated in the middle of the lake. It was built to avoid famines that desolated this region 400 years gos. Badly, the majority of the sewage from Jaipur City is flowing to the lake body untreated and hence there is severe contamination of the ground water in and around the lake area, but seems the local government is about to doing something (... they said). Easy to arrive by tuk-tuk, taxi or private car, and not worth to stop by but by Jal Mahal shots only."

Man_Sagar_Lake,Saipola1970,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Mansagar,"The Jal Mahal Palace at the centre of the lake was originally constructed in the 18th century as a shooting lodge by the Maharaja, as the lake was a thriving home to diverse wildlife that included a large flamingo population. The destructive pollution of the 1990s combined with intensive farming demands significantly reduced the extent of aquatic wildlife and migratory birds found more suitable locations but things are being reversed. Today grey heron, wagtails and blue-tailed bee-eaters are all making a comeback while fish stocks are even increasing.Most visitors stop along the Amer-Jaipur road as this provides the best views over the Jal Mahal Palace.Lake Mansagar lies in a natural depression that would, without human interference, be annually filled by the monsoon rains. The natural shallow lake was enhanced by a dam stretching between the two hill ranges of Amer and Amagarh. This initial dam was constructed in the 16th century after a deadly famine in 1596 was caused by a failure of the monsoon rains.Maharaja Mansingh-I constructed the primitive dam in 1610 from soil and rock over the Darbhavati River so as to increase the levels of stored water and prevent another famine. The height of the dam was increased and strengthened in the 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh-II who also constructed the water Palace. This later dam was constructed from solid cut rock to provide additional strength and gave the Lake Man Sagar its present maximum depth of 7 meters."

Man_Sagar_Lake,Rajat Chakraborty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,Spectacular Lake Palace- I think that's why Jaipur should be called 'The Pink City',"If I were to quote my reason for calling Jaipur the 'Pink City', apart for all the existing reasons, it would be the colour of this palace over sunset, best viewed from the Jaigarh Fort. When you look at this palace from the jaigarh fort, it appears as a shining pink palace placed between the adjacent hills in such a way that the sunset lies exactly behind the entire setup, throwing its last amber light over the lake waters and makes it look majestically beautiful. So, Jaipur may be called the Pink City because of the historic pink coloured terracota stone buidings, or because the city was painted pink once to welcome Prince of Wales and Queen Victoria, my reason for calling it a Pink City would be the glimpse of this palace in the evening. If you have not tried it, you should try it out."

Walk closer and it's hard to find the beauty in this smelly, trash filled, polluted lake. I could only stand the raw sewage smell for about three photos. Then you must wade through the vendors who surround your car. What ever reviewer stated 'lake is well maintained' must either have been at a different lake or been used to this environmental shame. Sad. Drive slow, take photo from car, keep going to Amber Fort."

Man_Sagar_Lake,relaxtripp,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Jal Mahal Lake,Great views from the banks. Now they are not allowing for boating in the lake. There are information in net that a light show at evening is there. But locals have told me no light shows for sometime.
Man_Sagar_Lake,Heather A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Good Stop Off Point,"There's not a lot to see here, but we stopped off on our way back from Amer Fort to see the summer residence of the Mararaja in the lake. It was a bit of a hazy winters day so the views weren't perfect, however it's still a pretty spot to explore. We only stopped for a few minutes as we'd had a long day of touring the city at this point and the children were getting fed up! There are stall holders here and be aware of the ""professional"" beggars (as our driver called them!). We could have strolled up the prominade a bit more if we'd had the time."

Man_Sagar_Lake,Richa Kedia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Great Lake with a large number of birds,The lake is beautiful especially in the morning when there are less people around. I reached the lake at 7 am and took some great pictures of the sunrise at the lake and Jal Mahal and then sat there till 10 am to observe the birds and take their shots. It is only after 11 am that there are too many people at the lake and then the birds fly away.
Man_Sagar_Lake,drn85,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Mansagar lake... Tourist spot...,"Mansagar lake located in Jaipur around 6km from the city, is one of the most sought tourist attractions in Jaipur. The famous jalmahal is located in this lake. There is a small park on the banks of this lake, where people can have an evening walk, making use of the street sales. The rates are very affordable and are subjected to bargaining. Many other options avail include the Jaipur costume photography and small refreshment. The lake is nice to see, but throwing the waste over it had made it a bit ugly. Let's forget all those... once you are in Jaipur visit this place for sure."

A palace on the lake to look at and plenty of stalls to enjoy. It was fun watching the family's get dress up in traditional clothes and get their photo's taken. Lots of smiles all round.
