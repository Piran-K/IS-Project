Monkey_Temple,Joe,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,Over rated,"We saw lots of good reviews about this temple, however the best bit was the views walking to the temple. It’s one of the dirtiest landmarks I have seen in India and despite it saying it was free entry online it cost to go when there is very little to see. If you want to see a monkey there’s more on your walk to the temple than in it, but there’s plenty of monkeys around India anyway. If you’re in this area I wouldn’t go past the viewpoint to look over the city."
Monkey_Temple,kierfly,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Monkey Man Rohit,"What a spectacular place to visit. And a wonderful tour guide like Rohit is a must. Monkey Man Rohit is a great guide and will help you understand the temple and engage with the monkeys in the best way. Thank you, Rohit!"
Monkey_Temple,Federico,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,A hidden gem and a must-see in Jaipur!,"A genuinely beautiful place: the experience of walking through the temple while be surrounded by monkeys is absolutely unique.Strongly recommend to climb up the hill to the Sun Temple for a breath-taking view of Jaipur from above.Sadly, the entire site is heavily polluted, which is a pity considering how beautiful it is."
Monkey_Temple,MTischendorf,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Solo,A bit shabby but worth it,"The place is pretty run down with lots of garbage lying around. Nevertheless it's worth a visit.  Scenery is nice, and the Monkeys are friendly as long as you don't get too close to them. Priests will try to get a donation from you. Entry fee is currently 250 Rupees including photography. A sunset spot with a great view over Jaipur is nearby (15 minutes walk)."
Monkey_Temple,Richard,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,Monkey temple with monkey man.. worthy :),"Monkey temple was amazing experience.. Thanks to monkey man, who live there. Thanks to him we can feed them with safety.."
Monkey_Temple,Cathygreg3,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Dont bother going,"It was really sad to see what would usually be a beautiful place in the state that it is in now.  The place is not being maintained anymore and they have actually closed it off and stopped you going near the water.  It is really dirty, rubbish everywhere and the water is very bad.  I would not even bother going out to see it and pay the money for it until at least it can be fixed up a whole lot."
Monkey_Temple,Katie&Sébastien,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Couples,The pictures are different than the reality ,Not well maintained! Poor welcome with just a pushy donation request after the entrance payment. The monkeys are far from the place we observe them.
Monkey_Temple,Rahul Saini,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Monkey Thieves :),Its quite calm place. I visited there on Dec'2019. It is also known as galta ji temple. It has a lake where you can take bath as well. 
Monkey_Temple,zorrothecat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020,Great day out,Large complex but a slice of life and not too many foreign tourists (pre covid March 2020) Need to get taxi or tick tuck to get there as a bit out of town. I took  tuck to one of the city gates and walked over the hill approaching from the back as it looked ok on google maps but it was mainly a  stony walking path and took me  a little while but lovely views. 
Monkey_Temple,Lidia B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Peace, quiet and monkeys","The Galta Ji Monkey Temple in Jaipur is a place where you can feel the real silence. The monkeys are very sociable. You can easily feed them and watch how they manage during feeding. There are a lot of monkeys in the temples themselves, but just go lower to see the whole view of the city from one side and meet the little creatures. The complex of temples causes that man begins to contemplate the surrounding beauty in silence."
Monkey_Temple,Juanatrotamundos,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,A rip-off! Very bad experience,"This temple is well hidden on the mountains. You have to climb up and then down again to get there. It’s an isolated place with small groups of young men selling and smoking pot. I was with my boyfriend but felt intimidated. There are no signs or whatsoever that indicates where the temple is. We had to ask for directions to the people there and then being ask for money in return. When we finally got to the place we found out that apart from the entrance ticket (100 rupees) you have to pay a camera fee even if you plan to take pics with your cellphone that was more expensive than the actual ticket (150 rupees). That’s a total rip-off! So you end up paying 250 per persons. As we found that ridiculous we decided not to pay for the camera and just enjoy the visit. The staff at the counter was threatening us about taking pics without the permit and pushing us to put away the cellphone (that I was carrying it in my hand all the way down the mountain) as if they were security personal. They were close to be aggressive and they were blocking our entry with their bodies until we put the phone away. It was a horrible experience! Moreover, The temple is not worthy at all!! Not the walk up and down, not the entry fee (you can do a lot in India with 250 rupees per person), not the unsafe feeling. It’s a dirty and smelly place private owned so I guess they just see the income from the tourist coming and do little to make the experience enjoyable."
Monkey_Temple,rogeryoung,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,MONKEYS!,Monkeys. What more can I say? Monkeys playing. Monkeys sleeping. Monkeys bathing and generally being monkeys. In a temple just for them. All very intimate. Gold. No hawkers. A must visit in Jaipur 
Monkey_Temple,GillandJack,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,An unexpected bonus,"Driving from Ranthambhore to Jaipur we stopped off at a craft center, refreshment stop, and met an English couple who suggested we see this Monkey Sanctuary as it was on the outskirts of Jaipur. Our driver was happy to adjust the programme and took us to this astonishing abandoned temple overrun with monkeys. Having expected some sort of small, enclosed sanctuary we were just amazed at the scale of the place. The old, huge temple is built in to huge cliffs  and must have been magnificent once. The site felt quite eerie but we were so pleased we made the detour. Lots of cheeky monkeys but at no stage did they approach too close or seem threatening. A special experience."
Monkey_Temple,Anusha_Rahul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Serene and away from City,"A beauktiful place to sit and relax with family in the laps of Galta Ghati and amongst a beautiful temple premises. It is on the Delhi Jaipur Highway. You would witness a lot of monkey around and thats not a brainer to guess. So keep calm, like literally calm. Do not get excited or panicked because then you would panic the monkeys there. They love being around however if your tease/ shout or fiddle with them they would not be so nice. We were able to enjoy every bit of it. You should be aware that there is a fees to carry your camera if you are carrying one.  Have fun"
Monkey_Temple,Mahesh Pardeshi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Must visit temple near Jaipur,It is a serene place and amazing temple. During evening you will find a lot of monkeys coming down from the hills and this scene shouldn't be missed. Try to book a round trip cab if you aren't going by your own car because there is no network coverage due to place being in the middle of two hills.
Monkey_Temple,Noel M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Monkeys Everywhere,"If you're interested in seeing monkeys all around you, then you'll enjoy the Monkey Temple of Jaipur.Initially,my wife and I were excited about seeing monkeys all over the place. We expected to pay a small entrance fee to get in but we didn't expect to pay to use our camera as well.Since we didn't know when we would have this experience ever again, we bit the bullet, paid the required fees and went inside. Monkeys greeted us as soon as we stepped foot into this temple.They were climbingand jumping on each other, looking for food in the water and leaping from place to place.As we climbed the steep set of steps to the top level, monkeys of all types and colors walked along side of us.There were light brown-faced ones,red faced-ones and at the very top of the steps were black-faced ones.As long as you kept your cool, they went pass you and went on there way.However,if you showed you were scared of them, they sensed it and climbed on your shoulder.Once that happens,stay calm and in a little while they'll jump off of you.Also,be careful about bringing food here since they'll either grab it out of your hand or leap on you to get it.The view from the top of the temple will give you a nice view of Jaipur but it's not the cleanest place to visit.An interesting point I learned from some of the other visitors who come here regularly is that people bring bananas for the monkeys every Tuesday and Friday,They aren't afraid of the monkeys which the monkeys sense and they simply take the bananas out of their hands and run off. I debated between giving this site a 3 or a 4 rating.As a unique experience which you may never have again, I decided to give this temple a 4 rating.It was truly a unique experience for my wife and I.Noel Mouldovan"
Monkey_Temple,Asteri N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Interesting to visit but not for be careful of scams. ,"The monkey temple is worth visiting as it is hidden in the hills and being abandoned give a charm to the place. We saw monkeys but not so many as the locals claim. Our tuktuk driver told us that it was free of charge and in the entrance we had to pay 100 reps or 150 rps if you want to use your camera (!). The place was very dirty and not taking care of, so I don't see what the entrance was for. We believe it is a scam and so agreed our driver. It's up to you but if there is time visit it, there is also a small temple called sun temple with a view of the city in the way. "
Monkey_Temple,J Campoos,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Good luck ,Well it’s an unique experience and I will really recommend going there. The temples are not very well maintained and I think that it is also part of the magic. Monkeys can be good fun but also dangerous so be careful.My advice is to not carry food and good luck going upstairs 🤣
Monkey_Temple,Rodkoi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Short Visit,Visited this temple on the outskirts of Jaipur on our way from Jaipur to Agra. Lots of steps and as the name suggests full of monkeys which are being fed! Temple itself not very interesting and lots of steps up. You can watch the locals bathing in the holy water and do so yourself if you wish.
Monkey_Temple,Tha B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,TERRIFYING BEWARE WILD MONKEYS WATCH YOUR CHILDREN.,"I’m not kidding. Don’t feed them cause they will overpower, and fight over you. Went around 1pm. On entry you could hear visitors screaming. A 10 year old (ish) child was tormenting the monkeys with food got literally tackled by one. The parents weren’t nearby and had to pull the monkey off the child. They quickly left. There were beggars inside (they looked like) and one of their infants was walking away from the group. The infant was quickly dragged by the neck by the monkeys teeth. I thought perhaps bitten but the mother quickly ran after the child nonchalantly laughing it off. I never went to the top platform only made it up to the first stairs as we were highly watched and outnumbered by the monkeys. Stay with a group. I found a group but we were being circled. I found no garbage nor sick monkeys unlike the other reviews. This is a real review. Please be careful and don’t carry any food with you AND make sure you have return transportation cause Ola won’t come and get you. Drivers kept cancelling on me and the signal was very weak. 50 rupees to take pictures which is ridiculous. Monkeys climb up your legs and swing off your bag. I would recommend the monkey man. I saw him with a tour group. He at least keeps you safe and has a way to control the monkeys."
Monkey_Temple,HollyGB70,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Dismal place,"A half hour drive,out of Jaiphur, through a slum area, up to a very run down and unmaintained temple area. Distinctly smelly, loads of rubbish on the ground and a group of motley monkeys,  which you are warned to stay away from because of infection risk and then they want a fee to use your camera.Many uneven steps, with razor wire to keep the monkeys away on one side,  and no hand rail."
Monkey_Temple,Fred V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo, My favorite spot in Jaipur,"  This was my favorite spot in Jaipur. The temple complex is stunning. There are many monkeys here , but they are not aggressive in the least. There are also many cows and pigeons. Feeding them is good karma , so there are people selling various foods for the animals. It's both a photographers dream and a serene place to visit"
Monkey_Temple,markeric,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Definitely worth a visit.,"We nearly didn’t visit this place during our stay in Jaipur as the reviews were mixed, but very glad we went.Our driver dropped us at the monkey gate, not at the temple itself. So we had long walk up the hill surrounded by monkeys, saw the 6 legged cow, (yes really!!), visited the sun temple with great views of the city and then walked down to the Monkey temple itself, which is fairly modest, but worth a picture or two. We then paid 200 rupees to be driven by motor bike back up and down to our taxi, very bumpy ride!We really enjoyed it and had a guide with us who we met as we parked our taxi, and he was worth the money. We dont normally use guides and it wasn’t essential here, but worked for us. The monkeys were really cute and yes it’s not the cleanest of places but feels really authentic. Wasn’t busy either.Wouldn’t be easy if you have bad mobility."
Monkey_Temple,Carolra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,monkeys & more monkeys,We were there at feeding time. The monkeys came out of the rocks. There were so many they looked like the rocks were moving!!
Monkey_Temple,sayaliGandhi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Beware of the monkeys.,A lot of monkeys in this place as the name suggests. The temple is beautiful and serene. It's a little bit of a climb to get to the top and is a little dirty as it is not well kept.
Monkey_Temple,Atul,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Poorly maintained dirty temple.. ,Extremely dirty.. Even at peak season hardly 10 people visted during my presence. Should be last in your list
Monkey_Temple,Travellinggoalgent,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Cheeky monkeys 🐒 ,You got to love them or hate them: monkeys! The temple is a little run down and not that well kept but the monkeys make up for that. Got some fantastic photos. Kids will love these monkeys but beware they can be cheeky or even somewhat aggressive!! 
Monkey_Temple,Mina B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,A good place to visit ,"This was a really fun place to visit. The monkeys roam around and are happy as long as you don’t touch them. You don’t need to book an official guide, there is a young chap who will happily show you around and explain important facts as you go around. You will also have the opportunity to feed cows. We all really enjoyed this happy monkey temple. "
Monkey_Temple,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A very picturesque temple,"The Hanuman Ji Temple aka Monkey Temple is a very impressive looking building built into a cliff face with a water pool at the bottom of the cliff. As soon as you see it, it’s like a scene out of an Indiana Jones movie. The temple itself isn’t 5 stars, but it’s very picturesque temple to visit and the trek to get there is very enjoyable. So plus one for that."
Monkey_Temple,Jas and Jas London,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,Worth the drive,"After four hours in the jeep along the now ""normal"" roads we arrived at the infamous Monkey Temple - greeted by some cows and donkeys just outside the compound you go through an old iron gate and into a beautiful courtyard with temples left and right.Already you can see and hear hundreds of monkeys chattering away - sitting on rooftops and running around all over the place - the gate is there to stop predators getting in rather than for monkeys getting out.After walking through a courtyard you come to an open stone pool and there you will see monkeys swimming, diving, jumping and playing- an incredible site - watching monkeys play in a pool attached to a temple built into the abode of a mountain- all very Indiana Jones.The monkeys will come and sit on your shoulder and they will pull your hair/ ears and try to nibble at bracelets and bangles.They also eat nuts out of your hand DO NOT STROKE THEM if they choose to sit on you then that's up to them but you cant touch them as they dont like it and can bite.Anyhoo  - pop into the temples and the holy man will give you blessings for a donation- 500rps is about right and another 500rps to the man who showed us around.Fascinating and fun couple of hours def worth the trip."
Monkey_Temple,rogerl044,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Hillside temple,We had to request this from the guide and I am glad we did. The temple is not grand and designed to take advantage of the hill.Lots of pilgrims and very few tourists. A bit dirty and lots of Monkeys but they looked healthy and did not bother us. The people were friendly and the view from the top is worth the climb.
Monkey_Temple,Frieda P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Sad and disappointing,"This temple was not a pleasant place to visit. There were piles and piles of food and fat over fed monkeys lazing around. It was very smelly and just so much litter and food everywhere it was really sad. There was rubbish handing off everything it was just such a mess, we wanted to leave as soon as we arrived. It really needs to be maintained, we were looking forward to visiting this temple but left disappointed and discusted."
Monkey_Temple,Thibault B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Fun site,"The monkey temple was a fun excursion. Situated in the hills, the place was full of monkeys, without too many tourists. Monkeys are free, and we could visit some small temples. "
Monkey_Temple,mgc6754,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Not for me!,"We paid to go in and then asked for a donation for 'upkeep'.  Then taken in to the first temple and underwent a 'blessing' - we were not asked it was just performed.  Then we were asked for 500 rupees each, the explanation given was 'you come from a wealthy country, you can afford it'.  This did not set the tone for the visit.  Half way up the steps we were confronted by a man asking for money - we had to pay to take camera!Definitely would not recommend this for a visit - however, I see lots of positive reviews on here so perhaps we were unlucky."
Monkey_Temple,Yijing Gu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Smells monkey,"You can smell the monkeys from far away. It was cold today, so not many of them were in the temple. Some monkeys stole a saree and covered themselves like human. They are very friendly to people. Do not take anyone who gives you peanuts to feed the monkey though. They will ask you for money then. Not a tremendous temple, but with 1100 years history. Need around half an hour drive from water palace, since the road condition is limited."
Monkey_Temple,jonathan7p,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Amazing experience if done right,"We had a great time visiting the monkey temple and would recommend it highly. Our tour group Driver India Private Tours got us a monkey master who showed us the ropes. Both my fiancee and I had monkeys sit on our shoulders which made for some fun selfies. The view of Jaipur from the top of the hill is also excellent.Some guests seem to have had bad experiences either mobbed with monkeys or unable to interact with them. We went about 1030 am and it was a nice balance (many monkeys were full and napping, but there were still a handful around who were happy to interact)."
Monkey_Temple,Katy T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,"Worth the Visit, but Use Common Sense","Many reviewers have stated they felt very unsafe and threatened by both the monkeys and the workers wandering around. If you have a tour guide or a friend who is Indian, you'll be perfectly safe and are not bothered by the locals at all. Not sure how it would be without a guide in relation to the locals bothering you.The monkeys were adorable and friendly...if you interact with the young ones. Avoid the adults, both the moms and the adult males. They are more defensive and not as friendly. I never felt like I was going to be attacked though. You can still throw them peanuts or crackers, but only hand them to the younger ones. As you can see in the picture, my husband had a young one climb right on his shoulder after he gave the monkey a cracker. Almost stole his sunglasses though haha. It was not at all a taxing walk, not sure why other reviewers thought it was, even going to the top. If you want to go into a temple, expect someone to ask you to pay a tip. I didn't feel like I was forced to do so though, so we didn't.Watching the Hindu people cleanse themselves in the water from the Ganges was a very peaceful experience. It is not polite to take photos of them. All in all I think it's worth a trip, especially if you have a guide."
Monkey_Temple,Sarah Lewis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Lots of walking but worthwhile ,"Visited the monkey temple in Jaipur in a tuktuk. After a very long walk up a steep hill, then down the other side you reach this sacred Hindu temple inhabited by hundreds of monkeys!It is filthy-littered with rubbish, banana skins, monkey nut shells, and raga muffins trying to get money/food from you....but a must see, unbelievable! Top tip, hop on one of the locals mopeds for a ride back for 150 rupees! Well worth the money 🐒"
Monkey_Temple,jazsacher,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,One of my Favorite Stops,"I absolutely loved visiting the Monkey Temple outside of Jaipur.  In my opinion this is a required visit if you're in the Jaipur area.  What I love is the rawness of this place.  It's not the cleanest area to visit but you see everything here in its raw form - pigs, cows, pigeons, etc.  You see monkeys swimming in the concrete bathing area alongside the people.  You see amazing architecture of palaces literally connected to the mountain.  You climb concrete stairways that seem to go on forever from one bathing area to the next.  You see sights and hear sounds and smell the rawness of the area which gives you a full sensory overload.  This place is a long drive outside of town, but well worth it in my opinion."
Monkey_Temple,P a,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Do people not realise ,"Do people not realise that India has rabies? I would not let a monkey be climbing all over me, (As much as I'm sure the Monkeys are OK) are people seriously willing to risk it! just to get a selfie?! "
Monkey_Temple,Sommer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Hire Monkey Mogli,"We visited the temple but our experience would not have been the same without the help of the monkey whisperer-Monkey Mogli.

Monkey_Temple,S C Mishra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Visit to the temple,"The visit to the temple was interesting.There were monkeys on both sides of theentrance walk-way. One can distribute food items like banana to the monkeyswhich will be taken by the monkeys andeaten by them. After the entrance walk-way, one can visit the temple which is situated at top after climbing up the stairs."
Monkey_Temple,ChamH_01,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Beautiful setting,"Galta Ji temple is a lovely tucked away temple.The place is quite dirty and overrun by monkeys but a beautiful location and well worth a visit.

Having said that, we did see a short monkey fight that scared the s*** out of us 😂😂😂 🐒 "

Monkey_Temple,geoffhyland,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Pleased I Went,"On the way there, I browsed a few reviews. I thought ‘uh-uh, mistake!’Was it dirty, rundown, unkempt and all that? ...Yes. Am I pleased I went? Yes, indeed!Whilst this place confronted everything ‘western’ in me, I found it surprisingly pleasing. I tried to see it through different eyes - it’s kinda what India makes you do anyway- and there is indeed something beautiful here. You will be charged a INR50 camera fee on entrance. And then asked to make donations at each temple if you decide to enter. I didn’t and I kept going to the top, pausing at the various ponds. The monkeys were amusing, appeared well-fed and didn’t bother me. Ignore them unless they’re the reason you came in the first place. Clearly for locals, the ritual ablutions were spiritually important. I respected that. Don’t come if you prefer the more sanitised experience. For the rest... a rather unobviously beautiful adventure. "
Monkey_Temple,KDM2013,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,"Gross, dirty, wild monkeys.....filthy water!",While my 26 year old son thought is was a lark to stop we ended up leaving in haste as a nasty monkey showing his teeth chased us....filthy and dirty!  A place for a money grab!We hadn't planned to stop here but our driver wanted to take us....it was good for a few laughs but not a place to go out of your way to see.
Monkey_Temple,curtishinton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,An Indian highlight ,"I wasn’t sure what to expect. Our driver recommended this site, so we went. It isn’t “an official” site. IE we arrived at the bottom of a road and could see a temple at the summit. We were greeted by people selling peanuts to feed to the monkeys. Get  a bag apiece. You will need them. Then we were asked if we wanted a “monkey protection guide”. I know monkeys can be dangerous but I don’t like to use untrained and unregistered guides. I opted for safety and took the guide. That was a very good choice. We began our climb and were quickly met by a large group of monkeys. With our guide we fed them and they climbed on us. This is where the guide is super helpful. The monkeys can bite and scratch which means a rabies concern. So a guide is recommended. We met a lady coming down who had been scratched. Our team of 3 enjoyed the monkey interaction. We continued the hike up. Once at the top, the guide asked if we wanted to go further to the temple in the valley. Others were doing it, so we did. After some downhill hiking, the valley opened up to a series of structures and temples and a bunch more monkeys. Wow it was breathtaking. We went to the valley floor and explored and had more monkey interaction. We hiked back up and went to the summit temple. The guide asked for his money on the way down and was requesting way too much. However, we settled on a good price which was overly generous because we had enjoyed it so much. I had to be very firm with the guide that he wasn’t getting any more. Final tips- get the peanuts- get a monkey protection guide- you must be in good hiking/ walking shape- don’t overpay the guide. No more than $20 USD. I paid more than that and found out I should have gave less. He asked for $100. I laughed. - go to the valley - understand the monkeys can bite and scratch- also, the hills are full of leopards. They don’t bother the humans. Stay with guide and others. "
Monkey_Temple,Pete,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,A must in Jaipur.,"This was my favorite temple in all India i got to admit.Go straight to the back of the Temple, and look for the Monkey Master, he is very fluent in English and can give you a very good tour of the place, call the monkeys and take good pictures.In the entrance to the right you will see a small room where a priest is going to be asking you more and more money, don’t get fooled by him. The main attraction is in the back."
Monkey_Temple,Orchid Z,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Monkeys galore!,"The Monkey Temple is officially known as Chat Kebalaji.   The legend that has been passed down tells of ""blessed"" water that appeared hundreds of years ago and no one knows the source.  It's located in the  middle of the forrest with a  beautiful view and consists of small ponds.  First people go for absolution in the middle pond before going to temple.  Monkeys use the upper and lower ponds.  The monkeys here are certainly well fed!"
Monkey_Temple,Raquel B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Beautiful and surprising!,"If you take the route from the city entrance and take a bit of a hike up, the temple and it's beauty will surprise you. The monkeys are fun but be aware that they ARE monkeys and a bit dirty so they'll make you a little smelly. You'll need a wash afterward. Deepesh is the best guide. I've been twice and he was kid and considerate and not pushy about money. Therefore, be generous, he's worth it!The temples and pools are really beautiful and if you're brave, you can even dip with the locals. I did and it was fun and the people joyful."
Monkey_Temple,Pouya S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,A must in Jaipur,Most fun temple I've visited in India. You get to interact with the monkeys and feed them. I recommend to pay one of the guys (they will seek you) for a better experience. They will show you how to feed the monkeys and get them to sit on your shoulders. 
Monkey_Temple,Joseph R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Photojournalist,Even erase is always from Jaipur itself it is well worth the trip many beautiful temples within the complex occupied by two species of monkeys who are friendly and will come and take peanuts from you

My wife arranged for us to visit Jaipur so I could go backThe reality is the place is filthy and monkeys are wild but they don’t attack. I am quite happy to buy nuts and let them jump on you. There is a trick, be calm, avoid the adults and the young will climb on your shoulder. Be calm and don’t look them in the eye. If you go right to the top which is about 10 minute walk above the temple the view is amazing. This place is marmite. You either love it or hate it. I love it, I’ve sat quite happily with 2 monkeys on me feeding them peanuts. It was a joy. "
Monkey_Temple,Shannon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Fun experience,"A lot of fun. Rohit was our guide and made us feel comfortable and safe amongst the monkeys. He’s also a great picture taker, highly recommend him as your monkey man! :) don’t go into the temples if you don’t want to pay money. We went in and I actually enjoyed it. We got blessed and got a necklace and bracelet and he put paint on our foreheads, but of course you have to tip."
Monkey_Temple,Scott H,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Be careful,"I've been travelling in Asia for the past 3 months and spent around 5 weeks in India. During that time I think this monkey temple was one of the most stressful experiences we had.My wife and I initially got dropped off by a tuk tuk driver and were immediately mobbed by people insisting on selling us peanuts to feed the monkeys. It was a bit intimdating tbh. The next thing we know we are being instructed by our driver to walk up the hill with a 10 year old kid who would show us around and 'protect us' from the monkeys!A couple of observations:There are a lot of monkeys up there, they are very wild and some are quite big/aggressive. I've encountered monkeys on many occasions before on my travels, but this experience was not a fun one tbh. They follow you closely and are not afraid of you at all. I was glad to be protected tbh, even if it was by a kid.On the way up we were joined by a man who the boy claimed would show us round. He kept trying to put a monkey on my wife for a pic despite us continually saying no. Many of them do not look like the healthiest monkeys you'll see tbh, so we were a bit worried. Two eventually jumped on my wifes head and another tried to steal my bag.There's lots of dodgy looking groups of men hanging about on the way to the temple. We were followed a few times. There is also quite a lot of trash about. I wouldn't say it's a very sanitary place and it's certainly not well looked after.The temple itself isn't really all that special and we didn't feel all that comfortable being there tbh. Several guys asked us for money and one even told me to be careful with our 'guide' as he was not to be trusted and would try and rob/take all my stuff. This 'guide' later on insisted on me giving him a 'gift' despite the fact he hadn't been invited to join us and hadn't really shown us anything in the 10 minutes or so he was there.The kid that walked with us was lovely and was from a very poor family. I'd have happily given him some decent money, but I suspect (and he implied as much) that much of it would get taken from him by the men that 'organise' these tours and who sit all day drinking chai at the entrance. I made sure to give him money before we were in eyeshot of them. Had he not been with us it would have been a pretty terrifying experience in all honesty.Our tuk tuk driver feigned some outrage at our experience, but it's all for show really. I suspect there is a pretty long running and established scam here. Be mindful.Ultimately this trip was way more hassle than its worth. I've at times felt a bit unsafe at places in India, but this was the absolute worst. My recommendation for Jaipur more broadly would be to book trips via your hotel. It might be more expensive, but there is accountability and your time won't be spent visiting places such as this where it feels unsafe and you're likely to get scammed. It's an amazing city, but there are many tuk tuk drivers that will offer you cheap personal tours which aren't always what they seem. Ours gave us no warning or heads up about the temple whatsoever, he merely sat with his feet up talking to his mates at the bottom.If you must go here please be very careful. I just don't think it's worth it at all."
Monkey_Temple,JennRain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Friends,Love this place,"Don’t listen to the bad reviews, this place is amazing, make sure you get the guide I will add a photo of him. Don’t go inside the temples they just want to convert you. Just say no to the beggars. Buy food for monkeys they are safe and tame. The history, and beauty. "
Monkey_Temple,Lucy,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,Avoid avoid avoid.,"I don't usually write reviews but feel I need to warn others. We went as part of a day tour, this was one of 5 or 6 places we were going. I assumed it was just some ruins and the monkeys would be playing or doing their own thing on the ruins and that we would just watch them. I WAS WRONG. I can see now that I was naive and made 2 mistakes:1) I didn’t buy any of the money food the beggars were selling. In retrospect having some food in my hand would have made it easier to get the moneys off me as I could have thrown it and they would have chased it, leaving me alone. 2) The children of the beggars run round you and harass you as soon as they see you, they try and sell you things or offer to come with you to “protect you from the monkeys” - I should have taken one of the children up on this as no doubt they’d have been much braver than me when the monkeys surrounded us. Anyway, we started walking up the hill and there was a row of little tents, there are some extremely poor people living on the side of monkey temple, not very nice to see. They had a pig and a cow mid way through giving birth with them so to someone from the UK this was a bizarre enough start to the visit. As we got up the hill and saw more monkeys, I unzipped my bag and got my phone out. I think the monkeys thought I was getting food out of my bag and they jumped towards us. Some of the bigger ones are quite scary, I saw one grabbing the nuts out of another tourists hand, they aren’t cute like you’d imagine. I was surrounded by about 5 monkeys and more were running towards me, one jumped onto the back of my skirt and was swinging on it. I ended up throwing my water bottle which they all chased and we promptly turned around and walked away as fast as we could. They aren’t intimidated by humans (which they are in the other parts of India I’ve been to) as they’re so used to seeing them and grabbing food off them. They swiped and hissed at my partner."

Monkey_Temple,MC0nT0ur,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,A great visit,A great relaxing walk after the hustle and bustle of some of the other Jaipur attractions. Brilliant views from temple. Opted to walk up to temple on my own after declining the offer of the accompaniment of the youths at the Tuk Tuk drop off point.the monkeys were well behaved. 
Monkey_Temple,Asha Simunek,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,We survived.. never again.,"Lots of fat monkeys which are used to get food from people, so they are everywhere waiting for it. Kids trying to sell you monkey food or be your guide. As a girl I didn’t feel comfortable being there, many guys are taking bath there and watching us very strangely. One of them asked us for donation, place is messy and unclean so for the money they could at least keep the place tidy. I didn’t enjoy this place and was glad being out of there. Maybe if you join some kind of ceremony with more knowledge then could be nice..."
Monkey_Temple,Adar Giladi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,Must visit with Children,We always were afraid of the monkies and at last with help of monkey master (300-500 rupee) we were able to take photos with them sitting on our shoulders.They are cute but you need to be carefull.We bought some peanuts outside and each child gave the monkies one by one.Be careful not to get near mothers with babies.The place itself is so beautiful...You can take a dip in the pool with all other indian visitors.Highly recommended !
Monkey_Temple,damiadvisor,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,"Good site, cheater guide “Monkey Master”","The temple is great to visit.There are local people having holy baths and kids studying Sanskrit.Also monkeys are funny.I strongly suggest not to take guides, you can have the tour by yourself.We have been cheated by the “MONKEY MASTER” (in pictures) guide that was asking 1.500 Rs for the tour."
Monkey_Temple,Ashleigh Poole,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Gorgeous views and lovely monekys,"The most well-behaved monkeys I’ve ever met! I was a little cautious of the monkeys taking my belongings etc. but they were just happily playing in their swimming pool, eating bananas, fooling around with each other on the steps. They were absolutely lovely!The temples are manned by ‘monkey men’ who try to bless you and take big tips. You pay an entrance fee so these men are just hanging around trying to make a bit of extra money. We chose one to be blessed by and were given a bracelet and bindi, but if you’re not interested you just have to ignore them and don’t converse at all. There are also men trying to sell you nuts for the monkeys for a very high price. The monkeys will come close to you for photos without the nuts. Brilliant pit stop on our Golden Triangle tour.  "
Monkey_Temple,REVIEWS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Wonderful,Very attractive and wonderful temple. You should visit here once in your life to feel very good.. Visited here with friends and all of us experience was excellent.
Monkey_Temple,Liv Mari S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Amazing views,"The monkey temple is located in a small valley that you can reach by walking through the gate by the main road, then up the hill and down on the other side. On the way you will be able to see a great view, several other temples (the sun temple is at the top of the hill), and a lot of monkeys (hold on to your belongings). Once we walked through the gate a boy started walking with us, presenting himself, asking us questions and explaining things about the area to us. He was very polite and friendly, and we saw several other boys his age following other people around. We allowed him to show us around the area because he was so nice, but he also expected to be payed at the end, so if you want to avoid that you should let them know in the beginning. It is also good to know that if you enter any of the temples, the people there expect you to give a donation. We did not bring that much cash, so in one of the temples we only gave a few coins, and they were clearly angry with us for not giving more money, which was rather unpleasant. People also came up to us to make us hold one of the monkeys on our shoulders, and got quite angry when we refused to do it. A woman also walked right up to me to give me a red dot on my forehead, and when i tried to stop her she pushed my hand to the side, and demanded money from me before i could walk on. So the people there can be quite intense, and be mindful of who you want to give our money to. We were also a little confused because of the name of this place, but do not mistake it for the Khole Ke Hanuman Ji temple, which is in a different location and does not have monkeys."

Monkey_Temple,Greengrassbros,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Totally worth visiting,"You don't need a guide to visit the temple, just a driver and then purchase peanuts on your way in and enjoy!We went later in the day as the monkeys don't like to come out in the hottest part of the day. There were so many monkeys! A monkey jumped on my arm. They are pretty harmless but expect you to have peanuts and so are quite demanding. They will come and pull on your pockets to try and get to the food.They were adorable.It was also in an old hindu temple that was quite beautiful but not up-kept. There is trash there largely due to the fact that the monkeys run off with anything they can get their hands on.We saw so many baby monkeys and it's just unlike anything else you will experience."

Monkey_Temple,Julie B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Watch which Gate you enter by,"There are two entrances to this temple - one from the main road which is simple and straight forward, they other is via a steep hill climb, up and down which s very uninteresting and locals try to sell you a moto taxi. The temple itself was quite nice to walk around - plenty of monkeys there but quite dirty. The monkeys are obviously well fed and most definitely not scared of humans,"
Monkey_Temple,Manoj Vapi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Beautiful temple with lots of monkeys,Here there r ard eight temples with lots of monkeys roaming everywhere. This place could be great tourist spot if govt try to keep it more maintain and clean. Beaware of your shoes or chappals as monkeys try to take away when going to temple for worship. Tirupati temple is worth visiting.Here is Ganga water but very dirty neats to be maintain. Can visit once.

Monkey_Temple,DonJoeyM,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Amazing visit... ,"Had an amazing trip with the guide ‘Ricky’ - he took the best pictures, told some great stories about the monkeys and spoke great English.

Had them on my head, shoulders, legs.. everywhere. They just want food!"

Monkey_Temple,Harriet S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Cannon balling monkeys are great fun but...,It was great watching the monkeys jump in the water but I felt incredibly unsafe as a female (and was with my boyfriend) Someone tried to steal from my boyfriends bag while he was wearing it.The men got incredibly aggressive and disrespectful to me to the point of me feeling incredibly scared and uncomfortable and we had to leave - a real shame. (A lot worse than the rest of India) Would really not recommend.
Monkey_Temple,stenquist1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Good place to see monkeys and absorb some Hindu culture,"The drive from Jaipur was about 15 minutes.  We bought our admission tickets and started to walk when a Hindu priest convinced us to go into his temple.  He did some arcane ritual with talisman over our heads, chanted some prayers, then had us pour a bit of water over a small altar.  We felt blessed.  We walked on and saw many monkeys and some great architecture.  Spending 45-50 minutes was enough and worth the price of admission. Some great photo ops."
Monkey_Temple,philipsK7729PY,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,Blessings... at a price,"The temples here are important but not particularly attractive. You should know that you will be asked for a lot of donations, and not just the usual couple of hundred rupees. Some of the Brahmins do spend time.with you and tell you about their believes and the history of the place, so you.feel happy to give a nice donation. Unfortunately there are others who just want money, and as much as they can get.Dont miss the wonderful Sun Temple.at the top of the hill. The atmosphere there is totally different, full of peace and the love of God... any small donation is happily received by the delightful lady who watches over the temple."

Monkey_Temple,cakewithaview,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Monkey business,"I liked this place despite the monkeys! I wouldn't recommend feeding them even though they didn't act aggressively but our guide said it wasn't advisable and, looking at them, I wasn't tempted anyway :) The buildings and temples look rather neglected but I found this added to their appeal. If you walk up the steps you'll come to a poor where the faithful bathe for purification and there's also a pool where the monkeys enjoy swimming and diving! We were lucky enough to see a group of people (I think they were Hare Krishnas) singing and dancing and this made for an enjoyable all round visit."
Monkey_Temple,SeattleNomad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,One of my favorite stops in Jaipur!,"I'd first learned of Galta Ji from the Wild India documentary and wanted to see cannon-balling monkeys. However, I was hesitant since I've been around aggressive monkeys before and didn't want to get bitten. My friend and I visited in the late afternoon and we were one of a handful of people. This was one of the highlights of our trip and we spent about 3 hours there being entertained by all the monkeys (and even had to hike out after the sun had set). If you stay past sundown, the paths are dimly lit (but are lit enough for you to watch your step). If you're solo, it's a lonely path, but we had a local walk with us half the way and he insisted it was perfectly safe for us (two women) to traverse alone. First off, if you're planning to rickshaw/Uber/Ola, make sure to hire the driver for the duration of your stay at Galta Ji or be prepared to hike up and out to the Surajpol Bazar Road & Route 248 intersection to find a ride (save your water as the hike out is steep!). There is minimal cell phone reception at the Hanuman Ji (eastern) entrance so calling for a ride is difficult to impossible and there weren't any rickshaws or drivers for hire. I'd recommend entering from the Hanuman Ji side and if you want to walk out, go up the stairs through the temples and then out to the west past the Sun Temple. We didn't mind paying the camera fee since it was a negligible amount compared to other sites around the city and it was nice it was a flat fee/no higher foreigner fees. We never ran into any aggressive touts and thought the monkeys were tamer than most we've seen elsewhere in the world and within India. Yes, they're dirty and some are unhealthy because they are WILD--they may be tamer and used to human interaction, but they are not zoo animals and are not anyone's personal pets. We weren't pestered for donations as other reviewers complain of, but we also live in Mumbai, so may have grown used to beggars and scams. The temples are run down, but it's India and I can only imagine the cost to maintain or repair the structures. If visitors want to help restore the temples, I'm sure they'd be grateful for donations. If you're a photographer, you'll love the monkeys...they were tame and used to human interaction and I got some amazing shots. However, you do have to worry about some of the more playful younger monkeys wanting to crawl up your leg while you're staring into your viewfinder. I only had one I had to dodge, but it made for a funny experience. I definitely recommend making a stop at Galta Ji if you're in Jaipur...it's probably the most unique attraction we visited and I'll definitely be back to take more photos."
Monkey_Temple,Gina M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Don’t go!,"From the outset we were harassed by all the scams I had read about (“take photo with snake”, deformed animals, forced bindi blessing), all the while climbing along a very littered pathway. Once at the Monkey Temple (also very dirty), our 10 year old guide (literally), Ravi, was feeding a tomato to a smaller monkey when my friend was attacked and bitten by a bigger monkey.  We have, so far, visited three hospitals (scary indeed!) to get her the requisite series of rabies shots.  Tomorrow is the fourth out of five Indian hospitals we will need to visit before returning home to the US. Save yourself from wasting your time and possibly endangering yourself and do not go to the Monkey Temple."
Monkey_Temple,Kevin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Beautiful place... But beware of the trap,"I'll start by saying Monkey / Sun Temple  is a must, and was arguably our favourite visit in Jaipur… though visitors beware of potential scam. I'll jump to the chase, a smooth talking young man in his early twenties operates by offering you the chance to go with him to areas off the touristic map to buy some of Jaipur's finest fabrics. To put it simply, it's an outlet type shop that after our second visit was full of lured tourists with the same puzzled faces … Other notable offerings of the young man may include being invited to the wedding of an unknown person from 'the neighborhood’ (of course an overpriced sarii for the occasion is highly encouraged), being on taken on a ride on the back of a moped through Jaipur's hectic streets (the most fun and dangerous part of the night), flooting the bill for petrol for a tour of Jaipur which will of course include another visit to the outlet shop and lastly a meal in a very very local restaurant where you will politely pick up the bill (including your hosts comission, note; he will most likely go back inside while you wait in the car to ‘question the bill’ aka collect his commission) There you have it. Research has shown he and young men alike operate as a gang and with the help of some police (note his 'father’ is a policeman). I write this review / literary piece in awe at the smoothness of the operation, it's impressive. Luckily, we only paid over the odds for a few things, but I hope this message saves readers / potential victims millions of rupees in the futurePS. The real people of India don't give a monkeys where you are from, if it's their first or second question and are on 3 wheels or a nicely ironed shirt then ignore."
Monkey_Temple,Lawyer/Exporter,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Interesting.,This is ok if you have the time but it is not great. It is a drive down a remote road which is interesting.

Monkey_Temple,Julie K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Sunset over Jaipur,Visited just before sunset and well worth it. Used a guide (monkey man) think we paid him Rps 300 but very informative about the history of the temple and it’s buildings. Also ensured we got to hand feed safe monkeys from our hands and sat on our shouldersIt’s a tough climb to the summit but worth it for the views over Jaipur Beware of going inside the temple itself as you will be ‘blessed’ and asked for Rps 500 donation (we only gave 200 but were frowned upon) 
Monkey_Temple,Steve D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,A very charming experience,"Galta Ji is a large Hindu temple complex that lies 10km to the east of Jaipur. Galta Ji Jaipur is a Hindu temple built around a natural spring that has been channeled to fill seven large pools.called kunds.The largest, the Galta Kund, according to legend has never ran dry. The Galta Kund is the deepest pool and during important festivals pilgrims jump from the surrounding cliffs into the tank. There is no entrance fee to visit the temple.You can buy monkey food but take care as the monkeys can surround you. for the food. There are 200 hundred monkeys within the temple complex.Look out for the very colourful pilgrims and the large stelae adorned with Hindu gods.The complex is fascinating but has lots of rubbish scattered about."

Monkey_Temple,Simon R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Worth a visit,"Ok, so the temple gets its publicity from the monkeys. There are a lot of them, and can be entertaining. We didn’t experience any aggressive ones.However the temple itself is amazing, built at the bottom of a rock face, and ascending up it. There is a lot of rubbish around which is a shame, but I guess their funding is limited, as the fee to take a camera in is minimal. Donations are required to enter the various temples, but again it is up to you what you give.It is an unmissable part of the history of the region, and the journey there is an eye opener too."
Monkey_Temple,Edin Krnic,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Monkey temple ,I was not satisfied with Monkey temple in Jaipur. Monkeys are very aggressive and have to be careful. If you want to be good friend with monkeys buy nuts or bananas to gave them 
Monkey_Temple,Henriksalling,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Dirty buy worth going,"Galta Ji or Hanuman Temple is an amazing place. Plenty of monkey to look at and to get really close to. They are not aggresive and if you treat them with a banana or a peanut they are happy to take them of your hand.Hunuman has a lot of charm and locals come here to have a bath.Dont know how Galta Ji is funded, but cleaning up the place could be a place to spend some of the money you pay. It is very dirty and it is such a pity that no one cleans up the whole complex.Entrance is free, but you pay 50 rupies to be alloved to take pictures. You spend around an hour and a half.Getting there is easy with a tuktuk. From the city around 300. Make sure that your driver knows the place. Getting back is somehow more exspensive and the drivers take atvantage of you beeing a long way away from you hotel. Exspect to pay double price on your way back.I have tried to change the location on Tripadvisor, since they had it wrong. Double check with Google Maps before you go.Summing up: Go there and enjoy the silence and the beautiful surroundings"
Monkey_Temple,Kevin G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Amazing,"Had never heard of this place before. Truly amazing structure with real relevance to the worshipers who come here to bath in the water from the holy spring. For a small donation you can get a blessing from the priest  at the top of the stairs near the original monkey rock and for a few rupees more you can buy some grass to  feed the cattle.One word of warning, as you ascend the stairs after the bathing pool be careful as razor wire is jutting out from the top if the fence and on the opposite side the cliff face juts out over the path so be careful you don't lose an eye on the wire or brain yourself on the rocks.
