No system of putting tilak here which I don't appreciate. In most majestic temples, all devotees are atleast put tilak by priest on their forehead5. Terrible condition of footwear kept outside the temple, better if you leave them in car/hotel/etc6. Wear daily chappals and not expensive shoes as there can be wear n tear7. Try to negotiate with the priest to give you some sindoor on plastic sheet which has been put on Ganpati8. Lots of beggars that can be avoided9.
