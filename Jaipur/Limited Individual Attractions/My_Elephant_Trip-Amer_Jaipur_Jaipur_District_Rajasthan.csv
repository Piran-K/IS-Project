My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Shir abadi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Amazing experience with elephants,"I loved how they educated us on the elephants first and then the trip. They seem to be very compassionate with the elephants, feed and take care of them well. We were introduced to the elephant (caressed their trunks) then fed them. The elephants are trained well and it’s fascinating to see them follow their instructors directions!"
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Francesca V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Great experience,"In this village they take a very good care of these beautiful animals. It is worth visiting the village and support those people as it is like a shelter for animals. And it is very peaceful there so if you get tired by noises of the city, come there for couple of hours to  calm down. Very much recommended!"
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Alessio T,,,,Me and my big sister went for volunteering with elephants and the guide was very cheerful and nice spoke very good English the place and stuff were very friendly they save the elephants and the money goes for donations.
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Tom3601,,,,We came 1st of March 2020 to see the rescue elephants and learn a bit about how these lovely animals live in India. We were sceptical about organisations that offer elephant riding but these people are not anything like that. They genuinely love and care for elephants and we had the opportunity to learn about them and feed them. We also took an elephant for a small walk with his guardian of course. Apart from the Taj Mahal I think this was my best experience in India. Elephants live happily here and depend on the donations that visitors give.
,,,,,"Possibility to have a natural safari with elephants. The people who take care of them is very lovely. If you are in Jaipur, we Recomend to come. The elephants, rescue from circles, are really happy, coming they are even to happy."
,,,,,"They have eleven beautiful elephants. We tried introduction, feeding the elephant and riding and it was a great experience. The people here are friendly and willing and they help you with riding and take photos of you. Very content with the visit."
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Diogo F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Amazing,it was a fantastic experience to be with the elephants. I went out full and felt the elephants happy. worth the whole experience
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Meg M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Dishonest about the way the elephants are treated.,"We went to visit the elephants and were invited to touch, ride, paint, bath and feed them for Rs3500 each.We declined the bathing as it was far too cold but we were concerned that they were willing to let us do this to keep us happy - what about the poor elephants. We were also assured that cradles and sears were not used but once we were in and had paid our money they most definitely were being used. I felt betrayed and I felt I had let these poor animals down. They deserve to be treated with more respect and not like an amateur circus apparatus. Disappointed just doesn’t cover it. I believed the line they sold us to get us in the door but the reality was very different. Please don’t encourage the exploitation of these wonderful creatures."
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,June Jenkins,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Something's not right here,"I came away from this place feeling very uncomfortable about the whole situation.  I asked several times if the elephants were ridden & was assured they definitely weren't, but later after reading their business card it clearly states that riding is an activity.The ""volunteer"" clearly  said that the elephants were allowed to roam free on acres of surrounding bushland, but when I went for a walk with Lakshmi along some laneways  surrounding the area  the bushland was cropped with only a small strip of bushland visible at the back of the reception area.  There was also an area out the back where some guys were sitting close to 3 or 4 other elephants, one with a cradle attached for riding.  One attendant gave an elephant several sharp slaps on it's head. I watched them for several seconds recieving glares from the group of guys, then I asked the ""volunteer"" from My Elephant Trip if those elephants were part of the 11 others located somewhere on the property.  He was very uncomfortable & quickly moved me on after telling me they were a seperate group not connected with them.This appears to be one very well oiled operation.  The pressured smooth talk is consistent with all other comments that believe this is a scam.  They appear to be well fed, but one has to ask exactly what's going on there .   I feel ashamed of myself for being part of this & I can only hope that the 8500 rupees I paid will go to the elephant's food & care.  There's some pretty smooth tactics in play here to part you with your money."

My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Tiago Carvalho,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,My elephant trip im enjoying!,"It's an elephant sanctuary that takes care of rescued elephants and nurtures them back to health. The contribution will help the place keep going.Here you can feed the elephants, take a walk with them and ride them, without chairs that hurt the elephants."
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Joao Gonçalves,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,"Good work, Thank you 💪🏽",Very good experience with elephantes.

My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Lucia Henriques,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Meeting elephants,"So we went to this place, had some good talking about how elephants are created, about the conditions that they are treatted in Rajastan and they thought us how to communicate with them. Also we had some touching, a little walking in the Park. They truely take care of elephants here and look happy and healthy, and that is really important. Recommend it, was such a great experience!!"
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Samuel R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Nice time,"It's amazing to realize the work that's done here with these animals. All over India/Asia I have found elephants being mistreated and it is great to see that here there is a huge love for these animals. We had with Nana but others were here recovering, it's shocking to realise the state they are in. It was a great experience, keep up this great work. They're contributing to all of us."
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Suri&Benji,,,,"We had a very nice experience taking care of the elephants and learning about them (introduction, fred, lifestyle, psychology...).We recommend this experience if you love animals because you can see them free (not in a zoo o circus). The elephants are happy here."
,,,,,Our rickshaw driver suggested this place instead of paying the ride in Amber Fort. Still you need to pay here (credit card accepted) for being with the elephants but it is kind of donation..my wife loved this place
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Nicola,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Meeting Laccha,Laccha was a great meeting because she had a thought past but she knows how to deal with humans and she helps the association to collect money they use to help her friends in the jungle.

My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Stephanvs36,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,BIGGEST SCAM EVER!!!,"I was taken to this place via a tour with The Hosteller, which I did not know would include elephants. This is not a welfare center. The elephants are not happy. If you are taken here REFUSE and WALK AWAY."

My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Andrea C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Great experience ,"What a beautiful experience! Due to my budget limitations I was able to partake only in “introduction” and “feeding” activities. But there are quite a few other things you could do - like paint the trunk of the elephant with natural colors, wash her, go for a walk beside the elephant, etc. There is also an option of riding the elephant, but only without a saddle to protect the animal’s neck/back. So, you would ride him/her on a blanket, the way the villagers have been doing it for ages. It’s also good to know that the money you spent would go toward the worthy purpose of rescuing and supporting these magnificent animals. "
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Valerio P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Amazing experience,Greta experience! Rakish welcomed me and explained me everything about elephants and how they work here.

My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Pietro M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Not a sanctuary but a money making place!,It was a great experience. They take care of the elephants. I suggest this experience.Rakiesh was very nice.
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,drslims,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Say no thanks and leave,If you pass by Jaipur this is an experience to do ... one of a kind beautiful people who spend their lives to help animals ... 11 elephants happy to be cared for by these people .. people come and help these guys and  the elephants ... namaste
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Kate M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples, This may be a con?,"Really bad experience. That is not a sanctuary! My bad I have not checked before going there! Anyway, when I arrived I was asked to sit at a table. There were other tourists at other tables and someone from the staff talking to them. I immediately knew it’s a scam because the tables were far away so you could not hear what the are saying to others. Than some guy came to me and started the lies: it is a sanctuary, you give donations, talking very spiritual, the painting is natural and helps the elefant to heal if he gets scratches in the wood (what!?), showing me pictures of the sanctuary from I can’t remember where with his “friends” which were foregners telling me they did voluntary work for him (to gain my trust), bla bla bla bla. Why paint an elefant on the head if he has scratches somewhere else? I lost my patience quickly and asked the prices. He thought he got me and immediately prepared an offer in writing: 8500 for riding, taking elefant for walk, paint him, wash him, interaction, feeding. I told him straight that no way I’m paying that amount and no way I’m riding elefants or paint them! He than started to reduce coming down to 2800. I again told him that there is no way he sees that money from me. I told him directly that I will pay 1000 to simply feed and pet the elefant or I will walk out. Of course he agreed. I fed the elefant, gave him a hug and a kiss and left in max 5 minutes. I could see the unhappiness in his eyes and quickly got frustrated that I cannot do more for the poor animal. These are simply the elefants too old or sick to climb to Amer as they did. So they exploit them here. Just avoid the place, don’t be that fool that believes their stories."
My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,stumpymac,,,,"This place is not a sanctuary, but a money making scheme using 2 elephants. Proper sanctuaries should LIMIT human contact, and observations should be from afar (research it yourself on the Internet). They are asking for extortionate amounts of money (especially for Indian prices) using these 2 elephants. If there were 11 roaming free (as they claim) don't you think they'd all be where they get fed? We were told the colours used for you to paint on these majestic creatures was 'medicinal'... Really?! These poor 2 creatures are being 'used' all day to make money, it doesn't feel quite right because it isn't! (they say they are fitted with GPS on the elephants, but none seen) , and they couldn't quite answer how they stop ""all"" the elephants wandering off/away (GPS was their answer, but that does not stop them doing things and the mahout isn't with each elephant 24/7 if they are free to roam) They would not even tell us the name of the place when we asked, until we were leaving (not surprising judging by some of the reviewers who have figured their con out) . Do not take part in this money making scam USING these poor beautiful animals, they are not a voluntary  organisation but a money making scheme, do you research first and donate to a proper cause eg WWF. "
,,,,,"Like many others in reviews, taken here by tuk tuk driver and then the hard sell begins, with the story of it being an elephant sanctuary for rescued elephants. They wanted 7,500 rupees for a full 'donation' package or 5,000 rupees for a smaller package, per person. Very pushy! I wasnt prepared to pay that and agreed on 2,000 for both of us to feed and spend time with the elephants. Only saw 2, although he claimed they had 11, the rest of which were out in the forest with their mahuts. I smelled a bit of a rat but was happy to spend some time with the elephant, which seemed well cared for and happy. I think though that all of this is a moneymaking con and that they may be exploiting the animals to make money as a tourist scam. If im right and i think i am, looking at other reviews and pics on the net of this place, all show the same 2 elephants, no others. If they are exploiting these animals, the indian government need to crack down and intervene. If this is exploitation? Then they are scamming scum! And you should not fall for their lies. The tuk tuk drivers are  in cahoots with them. There seems to be a lot of this tourist scamming in Jaipur!"

My_Elephant_Trip-Amer,Dr. Livingston,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Memorable encounter with a gentle giant,"We had read about the importance of not riding on elephants because of the harm it causes them and the abuse they experience in ""training"" them to give rides.  We were impressed with the introductory conversation we had with the owner of the sanctuary and how he viewed it as a way to educate people about the plight of elephants in Rajasthan.  He appeared to care deeply about their physical and emotional welfare.  We were then told what it would cost to do certain activities and chose to be introduced to and feed an elephant.  It was a memorable moment to touch and hug this animal I so admire and feel for.  We were told how to approach her and feed her and what kind of touch felt good to her.  It was magical for me!  The two elephants there were not tied up in any way and seemed comfortable with the volunteers who helped us touch and feed the one.  We viewed the fee we paid as a way to help feed these elephants and help spread the word that they should be treated with respect and kindness and that the people who work here are try to change the lot of the elephants in Rajasthan that are still subjected to a life they do not deserve.Thank you, elephant village, for caring about these magnificent animals and being their advocates."
