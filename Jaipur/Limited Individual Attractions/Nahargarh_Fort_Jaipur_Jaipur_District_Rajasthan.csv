Nahargarh_Fort,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,A large fortress overlooking the city of Jaipur.,"The Nahargarh Fort looms over the city of Jaipur on a nearby mountain, helping to protect the city. The views here are great, but sometimes obscured by the haze of pollution that sometimes descends over the city. The interior is painted in a uniform manner. The outer areas of the fort also hold restaurants and a host of other attractions. It is far less frequented than Amer or Jaigarh Fort and is good if you want to go to a tourist attraction that is less crowded."
Nahargarh_Fort,Sarah R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Impressive Views but Sheesh Mahal is a rip-off.,"The views of Jaipur and the valley from this fort are impressive.  Thereâ€™s also a step-well inside.Having paid to get into the fort, there is a second steep 700Rp fee to get into a privately-run complex inside (the Sheesh Mahal). This consists of a wax-work museum, a room decorated with mirrors, a moth-eaten stuffed tiger with a clockwork mechanism to move its head from side to side, and also has various side-shows (a magician, a puppet show, a potter, each of whom will want another 100-200Rp).  If youâ€™re the kind of person who loves Disneyland or M&M world, go ahead.  But frankly, itâ€™s a tacky rip-off designed to part tourists from their cash."
Nahargarh_Fort,Trudy W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 â€¢ Solo,Worth the hike up the hill for city views.,I enjoyed walking up the winding hill. Donâ€™t need to  take the tuk tuk. It is 20 minutes and quite steep but you get a great view looking over the city and in the distance the Aravalli mountain range. The palace in the fort is ok  from the outside. Itâ€™s completely empty inside but the view from the roof terrace is nice. The day I went the visibility was bad due to pollution but I still enjoyed the hike up and down. 200 rupee tourist entry.
Nahargarh_Fort,singhasam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Lovely views.,"HIGH on a hillside lies this fort which formed part of the defences for Jaipur.It was mainly built in 1734 although it was later extended and a range of palaces built there.When I visited the fort it was easy to see the commanding views it had of the surrounding countryside and down to the city of Jaipur.The fort, which is also known as the Tiger Fort, was a welcome blustery experience on a hot day.I walked along the ramparts and it was possible to look down on fortifications below which were not open to the public.On the top level visitors could look down into little courtyards which formed part of the Royal apartments which were beautifully painted.Slightly distracting while I was there was a colossal fight among a group of monkeys with much deafening screaming and calling.Different sections of the palaces reflected the seasons with the one lived in during the winter having its own fireplace.Definitely worth a visit which can be combined with the nearby Jaigarh Fort which houses the world's biggest ever cannon."
Nahargarh_Fort,Meghana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 â€¢ Family,Loved it,It was a beautiful place with lovely wax museum magic show puppet show sheesh mahal Worth to visit this place for all tourist Helpful ppl guides photographers enjoyed overall experience would definitely recommend it
Nahargarh_Fort,jsthouston,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 â€¢ Couples,Best of the Forts,While not a fort in the sense of the other two nearby this was by far my favorite site in Jaipur.  Relatively small and beautiful it gave the appearance of a palace rather than a military fort. It also offers the best views of any of the forts over the city and country side
Nahargarh_Fort,Abhishek Wadekar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 â€¢ Couples,A must try spot,Good experience.Good view of the city of Jaipur from the fort.Good spot to spend a quality time with family and friends.
Nahargarh_Fort,Ritikawill,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 â€¢ Friends,Wonderful,"There are several view points and photography points to take good pictures. You can also take elephant ride inside the fort. Must visit palace!Very amazing and huge place with very charming views surrounding.Great architecture design and beautiful historical site. Some area still in repairing, but overall considered well maintained. We wish the place will keep maintained and well preserved."
Nahargarh_Fort,Subrat Saurabh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 â€¢ Couples,One time visit during day time,If you are travelling with kids then you need to walk a lot. You will find local hawkers and guide very expensive. The road to fort is not well maintained and donâ€™t find safe. You will find lot of peacock on the way which is a best part about this fort.
Nahargarh_Fort,Aakash V,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 â€¢ Family,Insecure,"Travel planned to reach the Fort at 7pm expecting it to be lightened. The long 15km route from main road is narrow, broken, unpopulated, thick darkness, no street lights and most susceptible route to get looted or attacked. The Fort was in total darkness with police only to collect entry fees."
Nahargarh_Fort,Ankit Saxena,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 â€¢ Friends,Peaceful and scenice view spot,"Nahar garh Fort is on the hill. Before reaching the fort, there are several places where you can stop and enjoy the view.  You get good view of the Jaipur city. Calm breeze and scenic view."
Nahargarh_Fort,Arpit Agarwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Nahargarh Fort Visit,"Nahargarh fort was a good experience to visit, there only you can see the wall and some temples and doors ðŸšª historical, rest of the items they only build and just to make money from tourists like wax museum sheesh mahal and nothing else to see there"
Nahargarh_Fort,mick582,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 â€¢ Solo,Favourite place in jaipur,This place is just awesome ( I would recommend you to take a bike on rent and driver till there ) the view from the top is excellent you can see the entire pink city from there also they have cafe + bar on the top where you can get some nice dishes and grab some beers .
Nahargarh_Fort,Sarfraz_Vanoo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 â€¢ Family,Jaipur Nahargarh fort,"Very nice experience....From the Nahargarh fort, you get a clear and full view of the entire Jaipur city.It is around 35-45 mins from the city centre and you can take a rickshaw/cab in case you are not taking your car. It has proper parking, has a sheesh Mahal and wax museum, very nice, cleanly managed internal roads.On the way back we sighted more than a hundred peacocks and pea hens in the vicinity..they seem to have a liking for this place. Must visit"
Nahargarh_Fort,Anand D Nanavati,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Combine with jaigarh,Nice fort which can be combined with Jaigarh fort.  We did not go in the paid fort part.  There is sunset point and small eateries outside.
Nahargarh_Fort,satish7113,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Magnificent Nqhargarh Fort,"Climb to Nahargarh fort is awesome. Take your time on the climb. Take pictures. When you reach the Fort, you will witness a fort worth remembering. Great artistic work.  Great views of the Jaipur City.  It gives you moments to connect with your past. Overall great place to visit. Entry fees is Rs 50 for indians."
Nahargarh_Fort,ajay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Beautiful palace,Historical fort built as vacation palace for the king. Taking a guide is highly suggested as it helps in the understanding of structures with the fort.
Nahargarh_Fort,Indrani M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,enjoy bird's eye view of Jaipur city from atop!,"We could only visit the Madhavendra Bhawan in detail since we went around 5pm. even the Baoli was closed for view, though the security guard was sitting at the top of the stairs and could allow small groups to descend the stairs. Moreover at all signages the fort is described to be open till 7pm, without mentioning that the baoli will be closed to visitors. Post dusk, the behaviour of the uncomfortably friendly locals could be better checked with appropriate security measures.  Likewise the local transport could be better utilised if only there were standard rates preventing the fleecing of tourists. The attitude of locals can attract or divert tourists and a State which advertises about ""Padharo mhare desh"" ought to have better policies to maintain their supremacy in tourism. "
Nahargarh_Fort,deepak kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 â€¢ Friends,Nice place,"Very nice place to visit in jaipur, Superb location and Fort,Click beautiful images here to cherish for longâ€¦â€¦â€¦..:â€¦.."
Nahargarh_Fort,ShyamKasturi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Good historic fort,The fort with designs using natural colors is a must see place in Jaipur. Not that much big when compared to Amer or Jaigarh forts. The wax museum and seesh mahal at the entrance of the fort are of very expensive and can be skipped if you already visited wax museum anywhere else.
Nahargarh_Fort,S88064,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 â€¢ Friends,Jaipur visit,Amazing place to visit we have been there with friends and we were very happy nature's and one should visit..
Nahargarh_Fort,Sherin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 â€¢ Family,Avoid Sheesh Mahal,"Fantastic place except for the makeshift Sheesh Mahal here. While taking ticket, avoid Sheesh mahalSheesh Mahal here is Not worth the money. Note that this is not a historic site. This is a makeshift arrangement built in 2017. They charge height to enter this place whereas the the original sheeshmahal in the Amer palace is free to enter and 10000 times better than this.Also no photos are allowed in Sheesh Mahal at Nahargarh fort, whereas you can take photos as you like in the Sheesh Mahal of Amer for which is almost 500 years old."
Nahargarh_Fort,Shravan B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Worth visiting for the breathtaking views of Jaipur city from the top,"Have to visit this fort for a fantastic view of Jaipur city from the top!!!Compared to the other forts ,this fort can be done away with only 1 to 1 and half hr and we did take a guide but felt we wouldn't have missed much if we did not hire him in the first placeThere are other attraction like Sheesh Mahal(artificial),original one is at Amer Fort and Wax Museum for which the ticket charges are separate.On the way to this fort you get breathtaking views of the Jal Mahal for which you can stop your car/cab and take some photos Near to this fort is the Jaigarh fort which is also worth visiting and will take even longer time than this fort,it is adviced to club these two forts together in a single trip as they are nearby to each other.Amer fort should be done separately to do justice to it as it is at an even more further distance away from these 2 fortsYou also have the sunrise and sunset points at this fort and if you happen to be there at this fort during these times ,you can witness beautiful views of sunrise and sunset from this place"
Nahargarh_Fort,Rohin V,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Least suggested,"Nothing much about the place if you have visited Amer Fort, most of the fort is been rented to private business units for restaurant, wax museum, seesh mahal who charge separate to the fort govt entry feeThe only best part is you can view the entire Jaipur city from the fortAll credit goes to govt for not maintaining the same"
Nahargarh_Fort,Subbukanyakumari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Must visit this place in Jaipur which has a rich history of Jaipur Kings,"We visited the Nahargarh fort during last week of Sepâ€™21. The ticket to the Nahargarh fort costs INR 50 for Indian nationals and INR 20 for Indian students. We purchased a composite ticket for INR 400 (INR 100 for students) which allows entry into 8 attractions managed by Government of Rajasthan. City palace, Jaigarh fort etc are managed privately by the Jaipur Royal Family and therefore not covered under the composite ticket.  Itâ€™s the highest of the three forts in Amer and located on the Aravalli hills. The fort offers scenic views of the Jaipur city. The other attraction within its premises is wax museum, sheesh mahal, puppet show etc which are managed by private operators with separate entry fees of INR 500. There are also Segway rides for INR 200.On the way you uphill, you will find a diversion towards Jaigarh fort as well and at the base Amber palace is located.Nahargarh fort is open from 10 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. This is a must visit attraction if you are in Jaipur and taking a guide is recommended."
Nahargarh_Fort,Inderpal Singh A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 â€¢ Family,Less crowded fort,A short and enjoyable 30-35 mins drive from Jaipur city. Not much walk and convinent to access from parking. King Madho Singh was living with his 9 wife's and we'll.managed to access queens room. Jaipur city view is nice from height. Don't forget to capture loveable moments. Entry is rs 50 only but you need to pay rs 500 for sheeshmahal and wax museum. Ohh missed to tell about puppet show.
Nahargarh_Fort,Mohammed khan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 â€¢ Family,Waste of time,"Nahargarh fort  was good experience to visit, there only you can see the wall and some temples and doors ðŸšª historical, rest of items they only build and just to make money from tourists like wax museum sheesh mahal and nothing else to see there"
Nahargarh_Fort,AchintSinghal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 â€¢ Family,Nice but not extraordinary fort...,Its a comparatively new fort and would just like to see place where Rang de basanti movie scene is shot. Some new wax museum is recently developed over there...Nice but not extraordinary fort...
Nahargarh_Fort,fozjon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,amazing place,"having just walked all over Jaigarh Fort in the heat, we weren't sure we were ready for another fort...but this was amazing. So glad we went. This fort has apartments where the King's nine wives had apartments. "
Nahargarh_Fort,KathakaliC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,The gorgeous fort and the grand view from the top left us mesmerized!,"Nahargarh fort at night offers a spectacular view of the whole city. It is magnificent to say the least. It also has a restaurant run by Rajasthan Govt., the food and hospitality is just brilliant!"
Nahargarh_Fort,A Choudhury,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020 â€¢ Solo,Beautiful Fort,Visit this fort in the evening after visiting Amber fort and Jaigarh fort as this fort offers a splendid view of the city during sunset. An hour is enough for this fort and photography is permitted.
Nahargarh_Fort,S88064,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 â€¢ Friends,Nice place ,"Very nice place to visit in jaipur, Superb location and Fort, we were there with friends, we had enjoyed a lot "
Nahargarh_Fort,Ravi Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,It is beautifully built but the main attraction of this fort is the tour of Sheesh Mahal,Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills and probably on of the longest and highest hill in Rajasthan. From here you can see almost Jaipur(Pink City). It is beautifully built but the main attraction of this fort is the tour of Sheesh Mahal
Nahargarh_Fort,KALA Nikhil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 â€¢ Family,Nice place,"Not much of walking from the front entranceAlmost 2km of walking from back side,so if you are not able to walk avoid that way.Should hire guide for better understanding of the place.pay around 100only as it will take only around 25minThere was a sheesh mahal also,which had extra charges,we skipped that placeThere is a beautiful step well inside thay fort where one scene from rang de Basanti was filmed "
Nahargarh_Fort,ritica_travel_diary,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,Nahargarh - Hill top fort,"Located on the hilltop near Amber fort and palace and Jaigarh Fort. It can be reached by taking a forest road. The fort walls can be seen from a distance.  The fort was built for emergency purposes in case of any attack on the kingdom.  What we see inside the fort is where the king can live with his 9 wifeâ€™s and how all the rooms are located around one courtyard. From the top of the fort, we can see the city view. Inside the fort complex there is a Wax museum and 2 restaurants. Overall, it is an interesting place to visit."
Nahargarh_Fort,Bhumika Kaushik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 â€¢ Family,Fort with a view of city Jaipur,"Nahargarh Fort is located at the highest hill location in Jaipur.It is beautifully built but the main attraction of this fort is the tour of Sheesh Mahal. As the name suggests, a place entirely made of glass.There are no pictures allowed inside.The ticket is for 500/- per person which includes the tour of Sheesh Mahal, Wax Museum, a kathputli show, a magic show and pottery. It was every bit worth it.Go there with your family to relax and enjoy the view of the city."
Nahargarh_Fort,JayeshLC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,City View Photo Stop,You can have a good city view of Jaipur. Guide is not required and you can drive right up to the fort.
Nahargarh_Fort,Sim Kaur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 â€¢ Friends,Night view is totally worth it ,"Fort visit timings are 10am-10pmJaipur s promoting night tourism hence the extended visiting timings of fort.Night view is better than the day view. The uphill road towards the fort is dark without many street lights, but once u reach the fort, the top view is totally worth the effort !(Visit at night if u want to escape the crowd. The fort is well lit both inside and outside during night.)Night view is super !"
Nahargarh_Fort,Sanjay Malhotra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Amazing Nahargarh Fort !!!,"We had visited this fort and found very interesting. Apart form the historic values, we can also view Jaipur city from the fort. This is the property of Royal family and is maintained by them. Just to share if you have elderly person in your vehicle, then the security allows you to take your vehicle near the entrance of the fort."
Nahargarh_Fort,ankit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,good fort and large cannon,"good place, try to take there guide as they will help you in parking at good places and will also click photoes for you apart from informing you about the fort.has a large cannon, also good view of the city."
Nahargarh_Fort,Anurag,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 â€¢ Couples,Don't use their Photographer,Place is good.. Nice Scenes.. but don't go for their Photographer.. photographer will click and ask you not pay to at office rather tell you that he will send on your individually. Will ask for money and will not send you photo.. I have already lost 600 rs this way..
Nahargarh_Fort,Lalit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 â€¢ Family,Good place for an exceptional city view,We visited Nahargarh fort on Dec 25th 2020. The fort has been maintained with proper cleaning and security management. The area had a huge crowd which I was not expecting citing Covid scare. The fort had a spectacular view of the city. 
Nahargarh_Fort,AryaTushar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 â€¢ Family,Just another stopover in Jaipur,Nahargarh fort is one more fort in jaipur. It has undergone renovations and is in much better shape than it was 10-12 years ago. Not much to see. It has the residence of nine wives of the king. Will take about half an hour to see. A new addition to the fort is the wax museum and the sheesh mahal . Though nothing extraordinary they were enjoyed by the kids. They are like a very well made bollywood movie set. 
Nahargarh_Fort,monika,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 â€¢ Friends,A fun day in nahargarh fort,Nice palce in Jaipur lots of old things there we were injoy there really miss that time I hope we will be come back next year to visit  here
Nahargarh_Fort,Rajesh Ranjan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 â€¢ Family,Joy filled trip,"Wonderful to visit the Fort. Loved the experience. Wax museum, Sheesh mahal, magic show, pottery, puppetry show are a must watch. The Fort gives a very good view of the pink city. "
Nahargarh_Fort,Vinay B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Great fort,Great fort and the local guide gave a good historical background of the fort....one of the good forts in Jaipur
Nahargarh_Fort,Nandini,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Mediocre,"The fort itself is interesting. What was disappointing is the common refrain about the sunset from there. Honestly, we were disappointed and felt the cafe there which is touted as a place to get your free choice of beverage was overstated. The air quality being bad on the day we visited, we did not find it spectacular. Instead, when the lights came on, that was a better sight to observe of the Jaipur city than any other time."
Nahargarh_Fort,Vinay K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2020 â€¢ Friends,Seen of jaipur,"The fort on the top of jaipur from there u can see arial view of jaipur from one palce can ride of solo scooter , sunset and surising points places local"
Nahargarh_Fort,Gl0balCitizen2013,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Not as impressive as Amber Fort,"The Nahargarh Fort is not as impressive as Amber Fort and there isn't much to see. The drive up to Nahargarh Fort is nice and the view of Jaipur from the Fort is the only good thing about it. There are some ticketed attractions within the Fort, that seemed to me to be a bit amateurish. We spent around 30 minutes at the Fort, took some pictures and headed back down to Jaipur."
Nahargarh_Fort,Anjan Sengupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Can be skipped,I am not sure if this a UNESCO Heritage as it doesn't deserve to be one. There is nothing worth seeing here as compared to Amber or Jaigarh Forts.Its just a place where a King had kept his 9 Queens in different parts of a Building. One can visit here if you have extra time..Also please avoid the so called 'Sheesh Mahal' for which you need to pay extra.Its just a waste of money
Nahargarh_Fort,gundeep singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 â€¢ Solo,The fort,Its is on the top of the mountain nearby the pink city .. the only thing to visit last in pink city. .. from there u can see the whole world below
Nahargarh_Fort,Ajay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Rang De Basanti Fort,"It is really worth the time. Really amazing view of the beautiful pink city from the top. It's good to visit the place with friends or family. I have personally always liked sunsets from a beach, however, sunset from the fort took my breath away. Would definitely recommend everyone to mark Nahargarh Fort as a to-do in their upcoming trip to beautiful Jaipur."
Nahargarh_Fort,SalimM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Worth a visit,"If you have not had your fill of forts then this is yet another one to visit. It is one of the three forts in Jaipur. Appears to have undergone some maintenance and visitors are apparently increasing as it was previously neglected. Going up is an adventure as the road winds up the mountain. Walking is an option but I would not recommend as it is a long and steep hike up.So what do you get to see? The highlight is the Madhavendra Bhavan palace complex. It has nine spacious self-contained apartments, where the king's women lived, set around three sides of a courtyard. The king's quarters are on the remaining side. They're connected to the apartments by a corridor that enabled the king to secretly visit his ladies and frolic in privacy. There is a Sculpture Park where the collections on show change every so often. Finally, there is the wax museum. The museum is divided into three sectionsâ€”a Hall of Icons with statues of celebrities including cricket players and Bollywood actors, a Royal Darbar with paintings and wax statues of Rajasthan royalty in traditional costumes and a stunning modern-day Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace) crafted out of glass pieces.Finally check out the view of the pink city from the top. Absolutely amazing."
Nahargarh_Fort,Asia traveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,"Not too impressive, would skip this unless you have extra time","The Nahargarh fort was not half as impressive as the Amber Palace or the Agra Fort. Its a 20min drive (by car) up the mountain further than Amber Palace, on windy narrow roads and once you get there it seems completely commercialized (wax museum?) and not well maintained. Luckily we only paid SAARC rates to enter this site or I would have been quite disappointed. The Step well is quite interesting to see, but again the Abhaneri Step well is far more impressive if you've seen that. Would probably recommend to skip this unless you have extra time to kill. I would rather have shopped in the market places than spend 2 hours here. "
Nahargarh_Fort,Sandeep G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 â€¢ Business,superb,Here is the place you must visit when you are in Jaipur. Wax museum is really interesting. Though the restaurant there is a let you down completely.
Nahargarh_Fort,Iqbal M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 â€¢ Couples,Lovely,Nahargarh fort is one of the great place it was such a beautiful fort it was .nahargarh fort is very huge fort nice beautiful and i loved it
Nahargarh_Fort,Bryan D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Beautiful fort in Jaipur,"Beautiful fort in the pink city of Jaipur.  Great views from the Fort of the city and the walls.  Looks like the Great Wall of China, built on same type scale.  A must see in Jaipur."
Nahargarh_Fort,Anusha_Rahul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Now you need Ticket,When I first started to go to Nahargarh it was free for all. We were in college and this place was our regular evening walk spot. There were few small eateries but now when I went it had changed so much. There are some super expensive restaurants and some not so expensive ones. But yes its not economical. And now you need a ticket to visit this place. Nahargarh has  the famous Rang De Basanti Beer dive spot. But also has one of the most mesmerising views of City of Jaipur. Must go place
Nahargarh_Fort,annu sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Historical retreat,"Beautiful view of the city from the fort. Historic place built with amazing architecture by  the Maharaj fondly known as the Nahargarh fort. The entry fee to the fort for Indian citizen is INR 50 .  Great place for family hangout with ample of historical information.One would be advised to avoid the wax museum as it is very costly and you cannot take photograph from your mobile phone too, u need to hire a photographer inside who will charge you 300-400 for 8 to 15 photographs, its ticket price is INR 500 that includes entry to wax museum and sheesh mahal. Also in Sheesh Mahal they give wrong information to tourists that itz the only one in the world having a mirror floor. Lot of monkeys are there in the fort but they do not harm the tourists.A visit to the fort is highly recommended to those who love historical places."
Nahargarh_Fort,kshantanayar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 â€¢ Family,Another historical slice! ,Old ramparts having faced many wars & seen many hands changing. Place overrun with monkeys though. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
Nahargarh_Fort,Ashish Reja,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 â€¢ Couples,Very long forte,Good forte for the journey there was very long area for walking good quality of the forte ancient memory
Nahargarh_Fort,Asteri N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 â€¢ Friends,Great view. ,"Great fort, nice view of jaipur! Beautiful architecture with small rooms, labyrinth type. Definitely worth visiting. "
Nahargarh_Fort,royalescape,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Best for the view of Jaipur,Ideally you can sit and enjoy some tea and snacks at RTDC restaurant and enjoy the view of walled city of Jaipur. At night it's more beautiful to watch.
Nahargarh_Fort,Debasis C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Nice fort,You can spend two hours here to see this fort. You will have an idea how a fort looks like. you can have your lunch in the RTDC restaurant which offers excellent food and you will get an excellent view of Jaipur from this hilltop Restaurant.
Nahargarh_Fort,nrups s,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 â€¢ Couples,Keep wondering why we went there ,"It's a loosely developed tourist destination where the tourism board is not sure what to do of place.First of all, its at a high point of the city, so be very careful on choosing the driver.Once you pass the entrance, the points of interest are scattered around. Some robotic animal show here, sunset point there. Some high end restaurant here, some temple there. There were no proper sigb boards or history or relevance of the place mentioned anywhere.There is an rtdc restaurant located in nahargarh from where you can see the whole city. Sounds superb but the service is total turn off.In all, no history, no nature, no thrill. Totally avoidable. "
Nahargarh_Fort,Dr Sandesh Kedia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 â€¢ Couples,"Don't visit, save an hour and spent it on Amber fort",Just visit Amber fort and you are done. No other fort can satisfy you if you spent a good time at Amber fort.
Nahargarh_Fort,anurag62,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"A Must see when in the Pink City, Breattaking Views all over.","Was there in End of December. This Nov-Feb is ideal period to visit this place. Went their quite early , to beat the rush..This is most advisable as by afternoon you may feel scared , as lots and lots of vistors throng this place. You just get into awe of the place , as these places have been built with resources available in those time period. This place is also a reminder of the Proud History of Rajashthani Kings and their Majestic Forts . You can take pics at different places in the Fort , those will all come great. The Road width and maintenace is quite qordonary.Ticket Costs are high...but even then worth a visit. Go with a local guide who can live up history for you. Cheers :)"
Nahargarh_Fort,KSB72,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 â€¢ Family,Great historical monument but disgusting wax museum and house if mirrors,The ride up to the fort is very picturesque. The grand feeling ends right there when one gets in the line to buy the entry tickets where a Rajasthan police cop very rudely chases away the companions of the people in the line.Going in one encounters the wax museum and house of glass . THIS IS A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE and is a total RIP OFF. The guy there behaves as if he owns the fort. The wax museum is substandard and not at par with what you would be expecting and the house of glass is another let down.AVOID THESE TWO and carry on with the tour of the fort.How can the government allow this business enterprise which is masquerading as a part of the history of the great monument   
Nahargarh_Fort,Vijayaraghavan S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 â€¢ Family,Worth visiting too see sunset,Gives a terrific view of Jaipur city. A visit around sunset time is definitely worth it. Takes about 1 hour to see the place and watch the sunset from sunset pointThe auto guys pester you to visit the house of wax inside the fort complex as they get a good commission but we skipped itThe view from the top makes the trip much worth the long drive
Nahargarh_Fort,camsandeep,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Amazing and picturesque view,The highest hill in the area and best time to visit is during sunrise or sunset. You will be having the best view of the city and nature. Wax Museum and seeshplace are worth worth watching.

Nahargarh_Fort,SibsagarVish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,The view outside more memorable,The fort is ideally located on top for a beautiful view of the jaipur city... especially with the sunset as the backdrop. The inside of the fort built for the many queens are quite good but no match for the views outside from the top of the nahargarh fort. worth the visit. not to miss.

Nahargarh_Fort,NISHANKSAROHI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 â€¢ Family,Famous attraction of Pink City.,"Famous Attraction of Jaipur, built by Maharaja Jaisingh II. Basically this fort was the residence of 9 queens of King, separate same portion was made for each queen having. It also served as defence property for the rulers. Breath taking view of jaipur city can also be witnessed from there. There you find one wax museum  and sheesh mahal as famous attraction of there. In wax museum you can watch wax statues near to life  . Sheesh mahal is really mesmerizing Attraction of the property made up of glass work, 24 caratgold plated paintings.. not to miss."
Nahargarh_Fort,bhavnabkumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Entertaining and Mesmerizing,"Nahargarh Fort is located a little outside the Jaipur city. Within the fort there are different attractions. Let me warn you it can be quite a walk with steep staircases. My mother is a senior citizen and has issues with walking long distances; however she did not face that much difficulty. Ask your car driver to drop you at the car park. That is very close to the gate, reduces the walk. Inside the fort, there is a wax museum and sheesh mahal (must see). The ticket is on the expensive side however if your budget permits, don't miss the Sheesh Mahal. It is very beautiful and the do listen to its audio carefully. It is very interesting. The wax museum is fun. You are not allowed to click pictures inside. However, you can request for a photographer. Soft copies of the photos are provided at an extra cost.There are some artists displaying their skills like pottery, traditional folk music and a magician. These are just to pass your time till your turn comes to visit the Sheesh Mahal. Limited people are permitted inside at a time. Next, there is a step well, and a water storage tank. Just gives you information on how rain water was harvested in olden days. The views from this fort are breath-taking. Please don't visit the fort on a Sunday, we did that mistake. It was very crowded. Finally, there is Madhavendra Bhawan. We hired a guide and it was helpful to understand the history of the palace, the queens' rooms, toilets, bathing areas, summer residence, winter residence, chimney, how the king entered and none of the queens knew in whose chamber he would spend his time.... was all very interesting. If your budget permits, do hire a guide. We were charged INR 200/-. The tour took us a lot of time because of the crowd and the fact that I had senior citizens with me who walked very slowly. There are steep, narrow staircases to climb inside Madhavendra Bhawan, not too many though. 2 - 3 hours are sufficient here. There are restaurants inside the fort including a fine dining restaurant. I recommend don't eat from here if you are on a budget. Moreover, the taste is not too great either. There is a small eatery outside the fort which is cheaper. Can't comment on the taste as I did not eat.Overall verdict - Must visit!"
Nahargarh_Fort,Steve R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 â€¢ Couples,Don't let the drive scare you,"Although we didn't visit every high point in Jaipur, I feel confident in saying that the views from Nahargarh Fort are as good as they get.  Definitely worth the crazy drive to get there."
Nahargarh_Fort,wandererlust,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Family,Nice again,"All three forts in Jaipur are adjacent to each other, though you do need to travel a bit to reach them. All 3 of them offer excellent views and are must visits..."
Nahargarh_Fort,Geeta R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,The view is worthwhile during sunset,"Firstly, for those who want to know if you can reach nahargarh fort without taxis/drivers - then yes, it is possible but it is very steep / if you are comfortable driving uphill on a steep road with ditches on side then go for it. I am not comfortable with it and I didnâ€™t do it.Secondly, I would recommend keeping amer fort and nahargarh fort for the same day if youâ€™re young - most of the route is the same and it splits half way through.Thirdly - i personally thought that the fort was only worth the sunset - the fort only had Morden art displayed and I personally thought that that took away from it beauty. Watching the sunset over the entire city of Jaipur was worth it though.Forth - if you are on the heavy side - then the stairs going up to the roof top may not be able to accommodate you."
Nahargarh_Fort,Shobha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 â€¢ Family,Fort is good,The view from fort is good . But avoid buying tickets of wax museum it is about Rs 500 and believe me it is not worth it .
Nahargarh_Fort,Prabhu Ram,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 â€¢ Family,"Fort is good, Avoid wax museum ",Separate tickets for Fort and Wax museum. Buy tickets only for Fort visit.Privately run Wax museum not worth Rs 500 per person. Instead you would spend more time in Fort.

Nahargarh_Fort,Chitralekha Services Syndicate,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 â€¢ Family,Nahargarh fort,You have put a wrong photograph  of Naharagarh fortPleaze insert correct photo.Although Nahargarh  which also known  as Sudarshangarh was used as a stronghold for the protection of Jaipur.During the period of Maharaja Jagat singh Raskappor a Nautch girl who was trying to become queen of Jaipur was imprisoned  here.Later duding the reign of Maharaj Madho singh second the fort was  used as prison house for prisoners.

Nahargarh_Fort,Akash Deep,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 â€¢ Family,Nahargarh Fort,"- Nice one, situated on a moderate height. - I never drove on hills but it was an easy one and made it with my own car.- It is divided into 3 parts:   - Only palace visit - entry fee 100/-  - Sheeshmahal and Wax Museus - 500/- per person. Children above 3 will also be charged full.- Better to get a guide from inside the palace. I strognly recommend to get one else it would not be a worth trip. Guide will tell you the significance of each room and other areas of the fort.- Wax museusm is worth to pay a visit.Very good learning for children.- Sheeshmehal is also a good one.- Clicks are not allowed inside Sheeshmehal and Wax museum however, you can hire an inhouse photographer and he would charge you as per the pic size you prefer.- There is a food court as well inside the fort. Plan your trip to Jaigarh fort next as it is on the way while returning from Nahargarh.- Overall, it was a nice experience."

Nahargarh_Fort,Sriram_064,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,The second best of the 3 forts in Jaipur. Don't Miss!!!,The Palaces that were used by the queens of Jaipur are ornate and decorated very well with paintings. There is an added attraction of various artefacts on display that are of modern architects and sculptors in each of these palaces. The Palaces are just a Never Miss since they are very well maintained to this day.
Nahargarh_Fort,PKfamily,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 â€¢ Couples,Great views,This hill fort has spectacular view points. The interior is filled with art installations and is very different to other forts.
Nahargarh_Fort,Luise E,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 â€¢ Friends,Just donâ€™t. ,"200 rupees, but at least 800 rupees to come and go, as it is a steep way up, of 11 kilometers. We found the fort poorly kept, and it had weird modern art exposed, which took the beauty of of the place.Wouldnâ€™t recommend it. "
Nahargarh_Fort,Grumpy013,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 â€¢ Family,Maybe,We were disappointed! It's a lot of money when you add the transport & tickets. You see the fort and around. You need to pay for all the other attractions. Foodcourt is okay - not a lot of tables. We had shakes and there were not good and food&drinks are expensive. Better to go to Amber Fort. 
Nahargarh_Fort,Martina Hohnjec,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 â€¢ Friends,Absolute must-see!,"A location that is an absolute must-see! Get a motorcycle, head there before the sunrise and enjoy the city panoramic view before everyone wakes up. I also had some fresh fruits from a guy who cut them fresh. After, take a beautiful road down to the city."

Nahargarh_Fort,Leslie L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 â€¢ Solo,Wonderful view of Jaipur city if not for the fog,"I took a day tour with Royal Majestic Tours booked through Viator.com. The guide, Mukesh was excellent and very knowledgeable. After Amber Fort we went to Nahargarh Fort to admire the views of Jaipur city. Unfortunately, it was a foggy day. The fort, however, has an interesting history and is certainly worth visiting. "
Nahargarh_Fort,jazsacher,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Interesting Fort,"I enjoyed my visit to the Nahargarh Fort in Jaipur.  This was a large facility and grounds and was easy to get lost since there were 2 separate entrances and exists.  What I enjoyed most about my visit were incredible views of Jaipur city up close which made some amazing shots  As for the rest of the visit, it was just ok.  Nice to walk around and view the structure and its various fort architecture.  However, I wouldn't list this as one of the top attractions to see in Jaipur."
