Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,exploredaunexplored,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Solo,Photostop,We went in the afternoon and it was a bad time to visit this place. Scorching heat. Go early morning or in the evening. You can't go down. You need a special permission if you want to go down. It's nice but not well maintained.  The water is supposed to have medicinal properties but I'm not sure if it still holds true.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Michael,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Beautiful historic location,Fantastic place to visit during sunset. Highly recommend!Do not walk into the steps though as the security guards will be watching.There is a temple right next door which makes it even more picturesque.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,beckynmax,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Solo,Interesting architecture,"Worth a stop if you are in the area. About 5 minutes unless you climb down. Pretty step well with a nice old, abandoned temple across the road."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,FLnurseER,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Hidden architectural gem,"On the way to the Amber Fort our guide had stopped for a little surprise visit here. The 450 year stepwell is an eight story staircase architectural gem that does not take a long time to see, but the pictures from here are simply stunning. What a marvelous public gathering place it must have been in its heyday."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,vivek0210,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Friends,Architectural brilliance of Step wells in Rajasthan,"If you visit the Amber Fort don't miss the famous Panna Meena Ka Kund. It a simple square stepped well that take 10 minutes to visit. If you want to experience and understand the architectural brilliance, symmetry and science behind the Kund (stepped well) you should spend over an hour."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,goanjock,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Absolutely Fascinating,Absolutely fascinating stepwell with stunning backdrops in all directions. It is nice and peaceful and whilst close to the Amber Fort is off the main tourist track. We spent about half an hour just wandering round whilst soaking up the atmosphere. A definite must see when in the area.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Eileen G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Nice Views,"This stepwell is in a lovely spot with great views of the fort and surrounding buildings. Since we had already seen the Chand Baori this stepwell was slightly less impressive. But it is worth seeing, especially if you haven't been to Chand Baori."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Rahul Mishra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Hidden Gems of Old Amer City,"When you walk inside the city of Amer, you will find that history and archeology is scattered there. whose most beautiful pearl is this place."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Deb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Hidden Gem,A hidden gem and a must-explore place. One of the most Instagram-worthy places. A bit of better upkeep and maintenance is required though.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,ShyamKasturi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Historic step-well,"This historical step-well is located nearby Amber Fort. You have to ask your vehicle driver, during your visit to Amer Fort, to take there, otherwise, they will skip it. We were not allowed to go down on steps. We can only see from top and take some snaps."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Joanna H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Friends,Best city tour - no sense of being rushed,"Nizam came to take us around Jaipur at short notice, my friend could only travel by car - a very clean and comfortable car with bottles of water for us,  We went on a city tour to Gaitor Tumbas - I had never been before despite going to Jaipur more times than I could count. Then Nizam drove us to Amber Fort and waited while I looked around.  Then we went to Panna Meena ka Kund, I'm most interested in the Baoris in Rajasthan Nizam was curtious and polite he had interesting things to say about the places we visited.  He stayed with us and made us feel very safe. The water Palace is so beautiful we had a coconut water there just to enjoy it for longer.We wanted to buy textiles and asked Nizam if he knew a good place. Mina sat in the work room and the men ran textiles to her there while I went into the main shop. I found it to be very reasonable in rates and fast for making up the clothes. Well done Nizam - much better shopping experience than usual in Jaipur! Like Victor Kiam, I liked the trip so much I bought a company!!!10/10 Nizam"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,JayeshLC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Nice Photo Stop,"This is in AMER Fort and very nice place for photo opportunity. You cannot climb down the steps and if you want photography done for any special occasion, you need to take permission as it is under UNESCO. It is very good site for Pre-Wedding Photo shoots and lot of film shootings have happened here."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,angelacollins3,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Close attraction,"Nice looking stepwell, would have enhanced the experience if we were able to walk down. The attraction is worth stopping at on the way to the Amer Fort "
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Gl0balCitizen2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,"A fascinating, historic stepwell","This is a fascinating stepwell, which we found quite interesting, since we had never seen a stepwell before. It is an example of the extraordinary ingenuity of Indian people, who thought of this innovative way to store & utilise water in the arid lands of Rajasthan. It is well worth a visit, just because it is so different and unusual an architectural form. What is truly remarkable is that it was once bustling with life, the place where women gathered to get water from for their daily needs."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Dennis P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Very interesting !!,It seemed to be abandoned as there was nobody there in charge of entrance or anything. It is a fascinating piece of architecture and the steps would be quite dangerous if you attempted to go down them.  The water is covered in algae but you could imagine what it was like when it was fully operational.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Wen-D K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,A Sight to See,"I had read about the amazing stepwells of Rajasthan- but these go way beyond any written description. Truly something to see - incredible architectural fete and a brilliant concept used in the past to gather water. As the water level dropped, you would simply walk down to the next level. Used in the past for both water and social gatherings."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,luka,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,IT'S  NOT GOOD..,Stepwell it's not good because of To Dardi better than you can go another stepwell in this town another one step well it's so beautiful he is 400 years old anther  stowell 
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,reefdiver702,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,One of India's Classic Stepwells,Walking distance from Amber Fort. Easier to take tuktuk or have own driver.Can't go down stairs. Worth the effort to find and visit.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Kanchan M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Beautiful !!,"This place is not well known hence is not yet super crowded. Very beautiful architecture, going down the steps is not allowed but one can still easily admire the beauty of this step well. If you are visiting Amber Fort, this place can be easily visited. No designated parking area, No entrance fee."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,MartinG1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Interesting,"Historically fascinating but you are not allowed down the steps. If you are heading to Agra, Chand Baori is better."

Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,sturains,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Stepwell with Indian Moments,We visited this Step-well as part of our Golden Triangle Tour with Indian Moments (see separate review ) and then visited Amber Fort both well worth the visit Indian Moments provided a guide who was very informative 
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Jacqal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Fascinating insight into the past,"This is one of those sights that deserves a stop but only justifies a few minutes because, as others have pointed out, one can only view the stepwell from the top. Nonetheless, it is a fascinating insight into the past and we are glad are guide made the effort for us to stop for those few minutes."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,curious_and.curiouser,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Beautiful stepwell but you can't go down the steps,"Beautiful stepwell! Unfortunately, unlike in Jodhpur where there's a similar stepwell (Toonwar Ji Ka Jhalra) that's been cleaned up and opened to visitors, the government of Jaipur is unable to appreciate this beauty and doesn't seem to be maintaining this place. Visitors can only view from the top and are strictly not allowed to walk down the stairs, there are guards to enforce this. Pity!"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Myrna R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Mesmerizing,"Almost felt like I was trapped in a Escher painting.  Couldn't take my eyes off the dozens of stairs that make their way to the emerald green water.  Compared to other step wells  in India, this a small step well at the foot of Amber Fort.  It's a nice place to sit and contemplate on what daily life may have been like hundreds of years ago.  I would not venture down the stairs...can't imagine what's growing in the water, best to appreciate from afar."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,DDBTrip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Picturesque symmetrical staircases,Panna meena ka kund is a historical stepwell and rainwater catchment. It's located on the way to Amer fort. There are temples near this kund. The guards there don't allow to step on the steps due to safety reasons. But you a get view from top. Also it's not much crowded. So you can have nice pictures. A song from Salman Khan's film Dabbang 3 is shot here.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Dan B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Amazing site but a let down also,Such amazing architecture and idea of how to keep water from 100's of years ago.  Worth a visit on the way to the fort.  Two things: 1: can't walk down the stairs anymore because they're too slippery 2: dirty and water smells because it's not maintained at all.They have 'guards' that prevent you from walking down the stairs now.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Oz22,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Loved this stepwell ,"We were so pleased to visit this stepwell, it’s an amazing piece of architecture. We found it was very quiet, with only a few people around (us), we literally were the only ones there. Our guide suggested this and it’s near the Amber Fort."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Savvy Fernweh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Worth a visit to this ancient criss-cross symmetrical stepwell,"It is also known as Panna Meena ki Baoli. Baoli basically means stepwell. More popular in western India, in ancient days, these  step wells were used to do water harvesting..This Baoli was built in 16th century where people would gather for evening chit chat as it would be cooler by the water tank in hot summers. On the way to Amer fort, one can visit this place. There is a temple right next to it. Well, this 450 year old heritage site is not too popular among tourists yet..Unlike other baolis I visited recently, this was more restricted and no one was allowed to go down those stairs . Well, that might be because it was during rainy season this year. ."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,silverspectacles007,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Unique Well Structure near Amber Palace,"Do not miss to visit this place on your way back from Amber Palace. Uniquely constructed during ancient times. It's not well maintained, water is dirty and green. You cannot get down to the water level since it is restricted by the authorities. Good for a photo-op. "
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,beadfreak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Worth Seeing,This stepwell is really nice and quiet to visit. I went here with a textile group from the UK. It is only 240metres from the Anokhi Museum well worth the short walk. it was featured in a short scene from The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.Go before the bus loads of tourists find out about it. It's free.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Memoirs-Sachin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Beautiful step well close to Amber Fort,A beautiful step well close to Amber fort. The design is intricately done & needs to be maintained. Ask locals or guide for this place. Can be missed easily.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Quinonostante,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,No Stepping Down (unless you tip the guy!),A wonderful looking step well. BrilliantTo see it in such incredible state of repair.Boorish and rude guards are very OTT and not frightened to refuse anyone an opportunity to step down who isn’t prepared to bribe them. Lovely old temple adjacent too 
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,John H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Must see.,Right by Amber Fort and beside the road with a temple adjacent. Very old and abstract design. Very unique.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Shonil_B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Small and simple but worth visit,"We never get a chance to visit step wells. Though nothing great, still its a nice visit. Very near to Amer garh. Many people / tourist cab drivers dont know about this place. So you need help of Google Maps !!"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Im_ sarah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,superb step well,You may consider visit here before the Amber fort. You are not allowed to go down the step well uNess you get permission from the guards there.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,JayVind,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Incredible step well in Jaipur,Incredible location for photoshoot. Located not far behind Amber Fort and our taxi driver know some short-cut to reach there. It wasn't crowded as we were the only one over there at about 10am. Have all the time for photoshoot and the security was kind enough to let us walk down everywhere or maybe it was our lucky day. Astonishing structure made by men. Don't miss to put it on your itinerary when headed to Amber Fort. 
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Dahlia Q,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Lovely place,"Lovely historical for symmetrical pics around the stairs and around the surroundings you can take great historical picsthe only downside that the guard wont allow you to climb down the stairs to take pics, i guess it's a safety thing!"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,WimJAR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Must see step well!,"This beautiful step well is a magical miracle of stairs and steps. You just keep looking at all the stairs, wondering bout this fabulous and also simple piece of architecture."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Charvi_Shah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Very Nice place to visit and a Picturesque location,"This place is nicely maintained by the authority, so you are not allowed to go down in the well but still, you can visit this place and take pictures from above, if you are visiting amber palace then do visit this place."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,CharlesMcCall,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,funky side trip,"It's right down the street and a 5-10 minute walk from the entrance to the Amber Palace, and if you have time it's worth a visit. It's really beautiful and interesting to see"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Prathamesh Sawant,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Small step well located behind Amer Fort!!,Located behind Amer fort and close to Bihariji temple. The step well is a good attraction to visit but needs some more maintenance.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Rajesh B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Step Well behind Amber Fort,Do make it a point to see the Panna-Meena Kund (stepwell) while sightseeing Jaipur. A not to be missed attraction and so is the Bihariji Temple nearby.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Amolak Rattan K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Exciting but badly maintained step well,"When you visit Aamer Fort, this place is right near the road. You can go down a few steps but guards there are watching and keep an eye on you. This is because a few unfortunate accidents had taken place. Maintenance is really bad.Amolak Rattan Kohli Former Governor of Mizoram"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,kekelism,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Small but memorable,I went to 3 of stepwell but this little stepwell is quite memorable as its color bright.Unfortunately we cant go down to the water as this stepwell was guard by 4 policeman each in corner.Surely worth to come and see this beautiful place.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Lazaro B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Step well,"People have been stopped from entering the step well now, supposedly because someone fell into it recently and died. So worth the vist because its a great view from the top and the surrounding area is covered in ancient temples."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Sam Garrett,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Don’t Waste Your Time or Effort,not worth the uber ride or time there. photos on the internet are more interesting than in the real. it’s a un-maintained area with locals harassing you to purchase things.guards around the stairwell blocking access. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WALK ON THE STAIRS (without of course paying a 5000 rupee fee) another idiotic money laundering indian scam. they really do know how to shoot the tourism sector in the foot
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,773ami1000,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Interesting stepwell,"Interesting stepwell located very near to Amber Fort, Jaipur. The well is not big but is well preserved. Could be a fair subtitute to people who can't visit the stepwell in Chand Baori."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,pbhPlymouth,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Fascinating,"Visited this on the way to Amber fort. Easily accessible and not crowded and I was able to take lots of photographs from various angles. The water level was low, so I was able to appreciate the structure of the steps."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,rjpriyanka,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Stwp well,"This is a 16th century step well, beautifully built and maintained. You can enjoy this from the top and not allowed to climb down"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Umang A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Step well.,A beautifully constructed step well. Currently in ok condition but needs further maintenance and can be turned in good tourist spot.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,One_of_the_BOFs,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Interesting stepwell near Amber Fort,We were pleased to stop here to see our first stepwell (we unfortunately missed the one in Jodhpur) ahead of seeing the more famous one in Abhaneri.An amazing piece of engineering design and reminiscent of Escher.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,asrisalleh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Experiencing MC Escher,"This place is a must visit if you travel from Jaipur to Delhi, you must stop here. It is like you experiencing MC Esher painting in real life. Great architecture & engineering. Worth to pay Rp100 to the guard if you want to step down."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Vinod N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Good time spent,"This place is really nice to spend about 15 minutes, or if you want to rest, there are benches provided to sit. However, they didn't allow us to go down and take pics of the place which was very sad. I totally understand if you don't want couple photoshoot to be done there, but if I can't take pics of the place well, as a photographer I get disappointed. Hope there can be measures to allow people to take pics as there are not many people at a given time. As for the stepwell itself, it is fairly well maintained, but the water doesn't seem clean. You can pay a visit as it is very close to Amber fort, but with not so high hopes. "
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,EHinOz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Probably the nearest step well to Jaipur,"I had long wanted to see a step well and Panna Meena ka Kund more than fulfilled my expectations. The delightful gentleman at the entrance smiled and added to the experience too. But, unfortunately, we were not allowed to descend the steps at all, let alone to water level. A pity, as we'd come a long way to see and experience it. However, as you'd expect, it is very photogenic and well worth a visit to soak up the sheer excellence of the ancient architecture."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Sam M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Unusual Well,"After our trip to the Amber Fort we were taken to the Step Well. Our conception of a well is of a hole in the ground with a winding mechanism on top, we were not expecting to see the magnificent construction of the step well. All the steps were perfectly symmetrical and all the angles of the construction spot on.It seemed to be the size of a football field and very deep. How did they build this without the instrumentation that we have today.A word of warning; don't sit on the top step for a photograph of you will be severely whistled at by the guards.If you go to the Amber Fort be sure to visit this step well."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,psomrang,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Incredible Engineering and Architecture,Located in small town near the Amer Fort. This stepwell is much more colorful than the bigger one Chand Baori. There is no entrance fee with a rumor that if you pay the guard you would be allow to go down the stair. Which is no one allow.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,AyushiPatni,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Testimony to Rajasthan’s incredible architecture! ,"A picturesque backdrop to get a nice shot for your Instagram feed... HAHA. Well, it’s one of those places which is a testimony to the incredible power of Rajasthan’s architecture. This is the miniature version of the Abhaneri, also in Rajasthan. So if have time, you might as well want to go the deeper and the bigger well. The idea is basically to witness symmetrical staircases which is built around a well.A one time visit for sure, if you are in the desert state."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,TheVijay Raj MJ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,One Interesting place.,"It in indeed an interesting place, when you listen to the local telling history about panna Meena ka kund. The steps people use for going down should not use same for coming up. In the times of King, all the locals were coming here to take water. It was a gathering place for locals. This was one nice visit."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Satnam Singh,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Nyc engineering.Great concept,It's a place where u could spent little time.its amazing as well as a great concept or idea used in historic time.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,reeceyb,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Stairs to water ,This is a nice place to see especially as they made it so more than one person could collect water at a time it’s quite a sight and a feat of engineering great stop before the fort well worth the 20 or so mins it takes 
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Bobbi S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Very Cool Sight,"We did not have the time to see the stepwell in Abhaneri during our drive from Agra to Jaipur, and this was a good stand-in. The engineering and design is SO impressive and, although we were not allowed to walk down any of the many, many steps into its depths, we could visualize what a great concept it was and may still  be for collecting water for the nearby homes. Too bad that this year the rains were not sufficient to fill it up more. Make this part of your Amber Fort visit."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,AndyHaitch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Amazing step well (as seen in marigold hotel),"This was a five minute drive from the Amber Fort and on route if you are approaching the Amber Fort via the winding, narrow streets that lead up to the fort.While being taken by our guide to the Fort, we mentioned it and were quickly surprised when he stopped the car and took us there to spend time looking at it this amazing architecture and practical design.Well worth a visit."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Jittima P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Step Well,They do not allow to walk down but watching from above is already satisfied. Just 5-min drive from Amber Fort.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,daemir,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Geometric Perfection,"This is the stepwell of Jaipur or maybe of the whole india which exemplify geometry and arts. This place should not be missed when youre going to Amer Palace. No fee is collected in this site however you can ask permission to the police/security force if you want to have a photo in the stairs. The place needs to be rehabilitated and preserved by the government,trully an Indian heritage treasure. "
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Rupesh Anand,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Not to be missed...,Panna Meena ka Kund is a very beautiful step-will and not to be missed if you visit Amer Fort as it is just one Kilometer from the main entrance of Amer Fort.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,BelBelBel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Beautiful Well Not To Be Missed,Me and my husband were taken to this well on an impromptu visit on the way to see the Amber Fort. I happened to mention to our tour guide that I would have liked to have seen Chand Bouri and he said I can't take you there but I can take you to another well. And I'm so glad he did it was beautiful and this well is also in the film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Mangesh J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Nice structure,"It was just at footstep of Amber fort, good to see the whole structure of water well. Little risky with children, road to reach there is from narrow and dirty road. "
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,TheNayzer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Stop on the way to Amber fort ,"Stepwell is on the way to Amber fort. I would say it was worth stopping. It looks really good for pictures. In the old times, instead of going to the park or coffee shops, people hung out at Stepwell. Noted: you cannot step down into Stepwell. The police will always be there to stop you. "
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,NISHANTSAINI,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Best Architect of Kund,Best place to visit which is very close to Amber Fort.  So don’t forget to take a look at this Kund. Excellent architect and good place for photography. 
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Mimimizer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Good place to drop by with Amber fort,This place is not big and you don’t allow to go down anymore. Very close to Amber fort so it is worth visiting. It will take maximum 30 mins here.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Jay Torres,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,A beautiful sight - great place to visit quickly!,This ancient stepwell is something I Önder and it’s an interesting sight. You cannot step into the stepwell so do not try or the police will whistle at you. Beware guides offering to help you as they’re mainly trying to scam (sorry but it’s true)...the police officers are working with some of them to be honest and you can seem them telling professional guides to leave and then huddling and encouraging their 1-3 non-professional guides to go and chat you up and they don’t say anything. In any case that a simple and small thing but the place is great and you must really see it. I think the state should invest a bit to clean the place (the stepwell) but as there is no entrance fee I can understand that it’s difficult so enjoy your free entry and visit to this cool place!
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Supriyo R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Quiet little find tucked away in Amer,This place is relatively lesser known compared to the amer fort which is nearby. The architecture is great to look at especially knowing how long ago it was built. Good for a quick photo-op

Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Kayleigh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Great little fond,This is a lovely little find just outside of Jaipur. Not very many tourists and it’s a good opportunity to walk around a less busy area of Jaipur and enjoy the quiet.The step well is very interesting and so is the little temple nearby. 
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Jerry-HXO,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017,Fascinating step well,"Stoped by on the way to the fort as part of a tour so helpful t have the guide with us to explain the history. Nothing to do other than take photos and be amazed at the construction of the site, especially considering its age!!"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,FranciscaVergara,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,Beautiful site,"I went to Jaipur in December and, even though I didn't like the city so much, I loved this place and, in general, the places around the old city. I totally recommend it, plus it's 100% free."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,OldJailhouse,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Better than Bundi,"Gorgeous step well. Clean and tidy. They do not allow you inside, that is probably why! But you can walk around the top and marvel at all of the steps.And it’s free!We were so surprised to find this as we did not know about this the last time we were here visiting the fort.Definitely worth stopping and looking at!"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Kaushik G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Ancient step well,"During my vacation in Jaipur, we had visited the beautiful Amber Fort and this beautiful ancient step well was located close by and so we decided to check this out too. This place is well maintained with flight of steps from ground level leading down to the bottom of the well which holds the water. Security guard prevents tourists from going down the steps unless he is tipped. Nice place to stand on the steps and get clicked at. There is no entrance fee for this attraction,"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,17chinmaym,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Step well with temple,"Earlier days step well were used to reserve water and used for later. The steps you see are to access till the deepest part of the well. This step well is with a temple , and the access steps create an interesting space. The chattris is an integral part of the design like the Rajasthani palaces. Amer fort palace can be seen from the complex."

Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Berry,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018,good to visit,we stair temple its out of the city Jaipur but good to visit entry fee is free we went there by the local bus its really fun. 
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Sinziana M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,Ask any tuk tuk driver to take you,"Worth a visit if you also go to the fort(s). Ask the tuk tuk driver to take you here, otherwise it is complicated. Not many visitors. No fee. You can't go down the stairs - at least the policeman watching the site kept shouting at tourists, but for a small tip, I guess he'd let you."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,jdash_01,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Cool to See!,"Definitely worth checking out after seeing the Amber Fort. It’s right nearby, and really unique! Our driver suggested it, I’d never even heard of it, and I’m glad we came!"
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Marie-Hélène M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018,You need to see this!,"Beautiful step well, only 5 minutes away from Amber Fort so I recommend to see it on the same day. Free entrance. There is also a little temple next to it."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Aneesh S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Step-well and more...,This is a place which people tend to miss as it lies on the backside of the Amber fort which is the approach for cars(even then it gets missed as people are unaware)..also the people who walk their way up to the entrance of the fort tend to miss this.But it’s a beautiful piece of architecture..symmetrical and stunning.You are not allowed to walk deep into the well by security guards present over there.But do take your time to visit this place..its well worth the trouble.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Paul R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,A gem which many travelers miss,Situated about 1 km from the Amer Fort is a wonderful example of a step well.  It is on the one way system to the car park for the fort and we had passed it without realizing when visiting the fort.  Fortunately I was able to get our driver to retrace his route and we found this quiet oasis.  A highlight of our two days in Jaipur.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Mina Bosimin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,"Beautiful, Serene, Exotic","We walked for about 1 kilometre to Panna Meena ka Kund and we loved the experience. Signage were clear and accurate. We also loved how serene the entire area. Taking photos was fun. There was a security officer who guarded the area. I certainly wish there were information sign or boards that could tell us the story of PMKK. Otherwise, we did enjoy our visit."
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,RedLichtie65,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Stunning architecture,Beautiful example of a huge step well situated right next to the Jagat Shiromani Ji Temple. Incredible to think it was made in 16th century and must have been a lifeline for the population. It is 8 floors high and fills up depending on rainfall. We saw it empty. Well worth visiting as part of trip to Amer Fort. Fascinating!
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Ruben,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Beautiful and quiet,Nice to visit in your way to fort amjer. Quiet surroundings and nice place to take pictures. Impressive architecture.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Nilindy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Extraordinary ,"We enjoyed dropping in here en route to the Amber fort and were taken by the symmetry and construction. Our guide did not adequately describe what this was and erroneously described it as a ""Hindu  temple"".  "
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Onleaveagain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Stunning,Situated nearby the Amber Fort this is an imposing structure which is really impresses. The numerous steps lead down to the water whatever level it is. Only allowed a fleeting stop due to the narrow road and parking is very limited. Probably the best step well we saw whilst touring India.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,travellergirl2000,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,It is lovely but ruined by being painted yellow.,It is such a shame to see this ancient step well defaced by the local governmentwho have seen fit to paint it yellow.I cannot understand what imbecile would agree to this.Stepwells in India are a wonderful heritage thing and many need some maintenance.This involves making sure  they will not collapse.Then they should be left as natural as possible.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,JMGeneva,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Very. Interesting,This will only be a short stop on the way to the fort but it is absolutely worth a quick  sight. These geometrical stairs descending in this reservoir are beautiful and fascinating. Very original sight.
Panna_Meena_ka_Kund,Abhay Mehta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,"Nice Bawri in Amber, Jaipur","Though not as big as Abhaneri Chand Bawri but worth visiting place in Amber, Jaipur. It was rejuvenated and is very picturesque. You van visit at any time in the day. "
