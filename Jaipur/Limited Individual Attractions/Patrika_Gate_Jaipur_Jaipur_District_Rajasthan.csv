Patrika_Gate,Amit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,The Gate of Cultures ,"One of the most photographed spots be it by travellers or Pre wedding shoots, Patrika Gate has become a crowning jewel of Jaipur. Located approx 10-12 kms from the city center, the gate serves as an entrance to Jawahar Circle Garden. The Patrika Gate has been named after a local news company publishing a newspaper named Rajastan Patrika. It has been built as a unique conceptual platform that showcases the architectural and cultural heritage of Rajasthan with vibrant colors to leave you awestruck as you go through the details. The tourists walking underneath through the Symmetrical corridors in the shape of archways are left speechless by the immense beauty of the well designed and decorated walls, pillars and ceiling. Must visit once and enjoy the hospitality and culture of Jaipur/Rajasthan. "
Patrika_Gate,Rishi S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Picture perfect,Very good place for taking pictures. The photography crowd however will make you wait for your turn. The pre and post wedding shoots are a real nuisance to general tourists.Wish the government does something about it.
Patrika_Gate,singhasam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Stunning paintings,"IT'S amazing how Fate can take a hand in your holiday and let you down on one site only to give you something amazing at another just a few metres away.So it was when I went to one set of gardens only to find they were very small.My guide said why didn't I take a look at the Patrika Gate Gardens and I agreed.The result was a chance to enjoy possibly the most stunning entry to any gardens I have been to anywhere in the world.The painting work in the arches of the Gate and its internal corridor are absolutely beautiful and I was lucky enough to get there early before all the pre-wedding photographic shoots began for Indian couples planning on getting married.There were a smattering of people and couples there but I mostly had the place to myself, wandering into first one arch and then another to enjoy the brilliant colours and paintings.The main corridor down the centre of the Gate was wonderful and it was a genuine pleasure to be there.Still there were the gardens beyond to come and I happily wandered around them for a while.Interestingly Indian politics isn't that different from British politics. One party installed coloured lights at a pool and fountain area.....and another party took them away!Elsewhere I saw a striped squirrel chase a large rat away trying to join it at a feeding point and there was also a lovely elephant fountain. This was dry, part of the Indian government's attempts to combat covid, but it must be quite a sight when the water is flowing. Hopefully it will be restored soon.All in all, these were lovely gardens with a world class entry gate, the best I have ever seen. Don't miss a chance to see it yourself."

Patrika_Gate,SJ88,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Pretty for a quick stop,It's a modern gate which is away from other attractions but I thought it was fun to visit. I'm sure there are lots of Instagrammers here at other times but I got here around 7.30am which gave lovely soft light and no other photographers. I took a walk around the gardens and could watch the locals doing their morning exercises! It's only a quick stop and might be better on the way to or from the airport.
