Rajasthan_Small_Scale_Cottage_Industry-Amer,Inspire782517,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,SCAM ALERT,"A consummate scam that starts with your driver and tour guide. You are told that this is a government run fixed price cooperative directly benefiting village craftsmen and weavers whenit’s nothing but a private store with no labels or price tags attached to any product. It’s supposedly a fixed price shop but variable prices are obviously quoted to different customers.You’ve let your guard down thinking that this is a state cooperative enterprise. The store is full of overpriced quilts, jewellery, carpets, textiles, handicrafts and various other items. They show you a set of items, you select something and then you are quickly taken to some other counter to be shown some other products. They then replace the selected products with defective/ inferior duplicates, cover and pack them and send them directly to the payment counter. They also quoted a lower price when we were selecting the item and inflated the price when putting it on the final bill. You are charged GST but given a handwritten bill, the reverse of which has terms and conditions saying that no exchange or refunds are given.Then comes the biggest scam. A so called renowned astrologer, whose only purpose in the shop is to play on your emotions (read gullibility) to convince you to go and buy a precious stone that is supposedly the cure for all the problems that you or your family members might be facing in their lives. In our case, it was supposedly an emerald worth Rs. one lakh. At the last minute some good sense prevailed on us and we refused to buy the gemstone.We had in any case by now,  run up a bill of close to Rs 50000 for products that you could buy elsewhere for half the price. A lesson learnt the hard way unfortunately for us. It was only on arriving back at our hotel that we opened the  packed items and realised that we had been sold very poor quality stuff. Go in with your eyes wide open if you do choose to shop here and be aware of the organised scam that’s being run by the drivers, guides and shops offering all Rajasthani/Indian souvenirs under one roof and adopting names similar to government run enterprises."

The guides in the forts will set the stage and they will give a feel like its an authentic handmade products selling shop.In this  shop they says its belongs to Rajasthan govt and it is not.There is no price tags in any of the products.Bills are written by hand and still they put GST.Please visit this place to feel the scam play and never buy anything from this place."

Rajasthan_Small_Scale_Cottage_Industry-Amer,Suchi,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Couples,FRAUD ALERT! BEWARE!,"I hope this serves as a warning for all my fellow tourists and they don't suffer the same trauma we underwent. These guys sell substandard products at 2-5 times the actual price. This is a big group of people trying to scam tourists, starting from the cab driver to the guide. Please do your research and save yourselves the time, effort and money and visit Johri/Baapu bazaar instead. Trust me if you visit this place, u will be CHEATED. Just SKIP this, I can't stress enough. Nothing that I bought from here was worth the price we paid (and we spent a lot of money!) You would not want your trip get ruined just because of this one mistake you made by visting these scamsters. Just don't visit. Oh, and there are similar fraudulent stores near other historical monuments in Jaipur. Adding the RED SIGNS, their terms and conditions on the bill, just so you are aware. The bill that you would be handled at the last monent and that too folded, will mention that the goods won't be exchanged(even if damaged?) You wouldn't have the time to exchange anyway! Also read, that there is no guarantee on the colours of the garments, but they were confident that their vegetable dye would never bleed! Also, they call themselves a government established fixed price shop. But their products do not have price tags so the sales person just makes up a price. This is a well planned, multi level trap to cheat tourists. BEWARE!"
