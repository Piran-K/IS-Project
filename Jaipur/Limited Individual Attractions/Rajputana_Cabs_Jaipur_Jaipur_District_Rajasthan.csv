Rajputana_Cabs,Olaf D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Best choice for a taxi in Jodhpur!,"When we planned our stay in Jodhpur, I randomly googled a taxi company to arrange a pick-up at the airport. Later, when it became clear that we would stay in Jodhpur and drive to the wedding in Pali each of the two days, we got in contact again and arranged also those trips. As we had to buy some local dresses for a wedding, our driver was also available to pick us up at the hotel and organize all the places we wanted to go to. We expected a taxi, what we finally got, was a very motivated and friendly driver who did not only drove us around, but a go-to person that took care of all the small things and questions we had as India newbies. I warmly recommend the company and especially the driver Digvijay. So, when you are in this area and need transportation plus perfect service around in Jodhpur, Rajasthan get in touch with this company."
Rajputana_Cabs,Vikas P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Jaipur to Delhi travel,"Had an excellent experience with the ride I took with family. The driver Firoz was professional, the car was clean and comfortable, and the ride was smooth and efficient. Highly recommend!"
Rajputana_Cabs,Anurag T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Very nice,Rajputana cabs provide a good Innova crysta and a very good driver Mr Varinder Singh. He was very flexible with the time and places for sightseeing and was also knowledgeable about local traffic situations that helped us plan better. Ms Divya from their sales team was helpful. I paid extra amount by mistake and Mr Tarun from their transport team immediately refunded back Overall good experience.
Rajputana_Cabs,Ravneet singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Wonderful,We had a wonderful experience with rajpurtana cabs. Specially the guy RAGHUVEER SINGH who dealt with us so politely and patiently.
Rajputana_Cabs,utkarsh m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Jodhpur to Jaisamer taxi ride,Driver was very polite and friendly. He came on time and even waited for 45 mins very politlely while we came down. The pricing was also very reasonable.
Rajputana_Cabs,Francisco Garcia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Excellent.,"Very good service from Delhi to Agra, we were at all times safe and comfortable! The driver was amazing."
Rajputana_Cabs,eztravel394,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Poor experience,"We took two trips. One was a 5 day multi-city trip and another was a one way drop. If we had only taken the first trip my rating would have been 2-2.5 stars.Pros:+ They are one of the few cab companies who responded when we asked for a quote 2 weeks before travel during peak season. + They are not the lowest priced (some aggregators beat them) but they were somewhere close to the lowest quotesCons- Terrible response after you pay the advance. For Trip 1 they asked me to call back 2 days back. After multiple calls/whatsapp the driver contacted me the previous day evening. For Trip 2, the driver called me 1 hour before and I was relying on this service to drop me at Delhi airport to catch a plane!- Cars that were assigned were bad. The cat assigned to the first trip was bad. The one assigned for the second trip was terrible. It has more than 250000 kms broken rearview mirrors and severely dented back. It was stinking of cigarette smoke. - Drivers weren't very professional. Issues included  sending whatsapp messages while driving, giving excuses to take the car inside busy parts (driver asked us to go by auto), etc. Summary: If you want something on the cheaper side Rajputana cabs is an option, but you may find other aggregators. If you are looking for good service, clean cars and professional drivers look elsewhere."
Rajputana_Cabs,Nivedita A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,Shimla-Manali trip,Our cab driver Pawan ensured we had a very comfortable journey - he was very knowledgable with the sightseeing hotspots and navigated hill driving very well. He played a vital role in ensuring our holiday experience was a memorable one.
Rajputana_Cabs,Mkhan,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Dodgy behaviour for a top rated cab company,"Dealing with a highly rated cab shouldn't come with hassles.. My cab was assigned by a Dashrath Godara.. It was not a licensed taxi but a private car. The driver told us to say this was my brother's car in case the cops stop us. The driver was not very confident and even lost his way on the way to Jodhpur.Towards the end of the trip it turned out that Dashrath had provided the wrong drop date for the tour and the driver insisted that we were to end the tour a day early..this was despite my having confirmed the dates on chat (screenshot attached).Dashrath said he'd provide us the drop the next day but he didn't, instead asking us to get a taxi from the hotel and reimbursing it. Following up with Dashrath for the reimbursement has been met with radio silence.Overall, i would not recommend them at all and would say it's better to go via a trusted Travel agency or aggregator."
Rajputana_Cabs,Isaac,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Superb experience,"The car was arranged in advance, and we even got a better car than expected. The Driver Lal Singh was also very friendly and provided a smooth experience. Highly recommended"

Rajputana_Cabs,Rahul D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Wonderful experience,Quick cab service provider. Stick to his commitment in peak time as well. There were no cabs available during Christmas season but Rasputin cabs managed the show well.
Rajputana_Cabs,Globe_trotter_20221,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Excellent service!,"We booked cars through Rajputana cabs almost on a daily basis during our trip to Jaipur recently.Mr. CB Singh organised the bookings smoothly for us. The drivers were always very polite and punctual. The service charges were also very fair!We had a trip to Agra organised by some friends. On the day of departure, we were informed at 6am that the program had been scrapped. We were left to organise our own transport and had big bags to compound the problem.I called Mr. Singh at 8am and requested a last minute booking for the trip. He managed to organise the same very quickly. We had a car at the hotel at 10:30am, as desired! The driver was very polite and the car (Toyota Innova) was excellent! The entire trip was very pleasant!I'd like to thank Mr. Singh for his services and also make a special mention for the last minute rescue for Agra trip!I will be using his services for all future trips, as well as advising family and friends too!"
Rajputana_Cabs,Dustsettler,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Business,Irresponsible and unsafe,"They will lure you in with cheap prices, contract your trip out to 3rd party and not take any responsibility for anything that happens on the trip. They squeeze both the customers and the contractors hard to make money. Avoid and rather pay more for a more responsible and safe operator"
Rajputana_Cabs,Simon33715,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,"Excellent, professional taxi and guide service","We arranged a 9-day tour around Rajasthan with Rajputana Cabs (run by Mr Singh and Mr Singh), with a car collecting us at the airport in Udaipur and taking us to Jodhpur, Jaipur and Agra (UP), ending with our departure from Agra airport. The days not travelling were used for sightseeing and, for each destination, Rajputana provided professional guides for the sightseeing days, each of whom was excellent, and that worked extremely well.  The car, a Toyota Innova Crysta, was large and comfortable and our driver, Peekay, was very competent, professional, punctual and friendly, his skills being very important with some of the road situations one encounters on that route.  This all meant we had a fantastic time.  If there were room for one slight improvement, it is that the Mr Singhs are men of few words, which led to a bit of unnecessary confusion on a couple of occasions, but did not adversely affect the overall service in any significant way. Without hesitation, I would thoroughly recommend using this company."
Rajputana_Cabs,Deepak Patel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Clean and neat car with excellent drivers,Very Neat and clean cars. Driver are very cordial and on time.

Rajputana_Cabs,Neeraj,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,Misguided information over cab timing,"I was interested to go to chowki dhani and decided to hire vehicle. At the time of booking, the personnel said that chowki dhani timing is from 5-11 pm and taxi will be available for us till we intend to stay in chowki dhani. I make partial payment of Rs 500/- as Booking charge . The vehicle came at about 5.30 and since i was travelling with kids, we got late and started our journey. Surprisingly, the driver told the moment we sat in vehicle that we can spend only 2 1/2 hr only in chowki dhani and 1/2 hr can be added further. We reached at 7 pm and driver keep calling us at 10 to come out. Really frustrating. Definitely not up to mark . They say they are govt registered but need to review their staff behaviour and false commitments."

Rajputana_Cabs,Srikanth Adhyatmabhattar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Excellent service,We booked a taxi Swift desire on 8th November 2022. Driver Sultan Singh was alloted to us by C.B Singh (owner of Rajputana cabs). He was on time during our pickup from the hotel where we were staying. He also gave a brief overview about each sightseeing we visited which helped us a lot and suggested to visit places which were not in our itinerary. In short very good service.

Rajputana_Cabs,srirammiyer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Visit to Jaipur,I was exploring cabs for Jaipur city tours and Pushkar and came across Rajputana Cabs through Google. I called them and they gave me a good package for my tour. The best part is they give you a complete package inclusive of parking and toll charges which I did not find in others cabs  companies with whom I had enquired. One the day of arrival they sent me a Toyota Etios (me and my mother were travelling). Our driver Roop Singh was very courteous. He showed us all the places and also guided us throughout the 4 days . He also advised us where to take guide and where not too as at some places tour guides were not required. He also took us to the shopping places which were the local shopping places and we got good stuffs. Overall Roop Singh was a great help to us in guiding us over the tour. I recommend Rajputana cabs for your tours in Jaipur

The local guy demanded higher price then the pre agreed one !!! Had to escalate the issue and waste time to resolve it while on trip. They then sent a car with inadequate trunk space. Inspite of sharing pics they did not accept their mistake neither did they refund deposit money. Had to book another another cab - luckily got one else would have missed my train. Pathetic experience

The service offered was excellent. We were driven around for both inter-city travel and within the city site-seeing. The driver was always on time for picking us up and was also very knowledgeable about the sightseeing places guiding us where/what to see. All through the 9 days the family felt very comfortable with the driver and did not have any issues.Overall I would recommend Jodhraj as a driver for anyone visiting Rajasthan through Rajputana Cabs.

Rajputana_Cabs,Soni Jose,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,What a tragedy,"Booked cab for Shimla visit with exact hotel name and itinerary and paid 500 Rs as advance as requestedWhen requested for driver number, they can share it only evening before the travel date and agreedAnd number was shared evening by 8'O clockBut when contacted driver to share the hotel details for pick up, he was confused and requested to contact RajputanaSo again called the lady in charge and the reply was hotel is not in the location as they expected, should charge Rs 2000 more and agreed to refund if no service required. I was travelling with family of 3 kids and no choice to reject , so agreed with half heart under standing they were cheating as all the details were shared when cab was booked. I was not convinced that they will send the taxi, so some how managed another  taxi as it was almost 10'O clock evening. They refused to pay back advance saying they arranged  another taxi."

He gave us many historical information prior to our guide. He indeed is talented. He helped us when we lost our phone. Fortunately we got the phone back. He is simple. He is a down to earth man and jovial. I will recommend if anyone is hiring rajputana cabs in jaipur for sight seeing, they should take Mr Bhupinder."

Rajputana_Cabs,megha r,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Terrible,"We booked a taxi with rajputana cabs in jaisalmer with a drop to jodhpur.We spend almost 4 days with this taxi operator. It was one of the most horrible experience we had, I asked for a sedan but they gave an innova saying they didn;t have a sedan due to peak season and i  agreed for the innova with X amount, which was a bit high , i agreed as i was travelling with my mother in law and daughter. When we reached jaisalmer we were welcomed with 2 Dezires mentioning that their innova met with an accident , once we reached jaislamer town we were forced into one car , i was assured that from the next day innova will be ready. Come the second day there came a ETIOS that too late by more than an hour the driver had some excuses when i asked about innova a new story was given to me and i spoke with their representative via phone who was telling some other reason .The driver all through the journey mentioned that they will not be able to provide innova for the local tours and will provide one during our return to jopdhpur.The driver was mostly on phone and was mostly interested in commissions he gets and was asking for bills from where we shopped...etc...Come the third day a Dezire came that too late by 90 mins gave some lame reasons.Yes more thing i had to pay tolls and parking charges but these guys told that they rates are inclusive.Come the fourth day ETIOS came that too a bad vehicle and once again late by 120 mins.This impacted our program in jodhpur as we reached jodhpur late .Finally when it came to settlement he was asking 2k on top of what was asked for innova, i had to fight with the person and settled for a lesser amount.I was messaging and speaking to him multiple times all through the 4 days and everytime he was only telling lies.Very bad service , pathetic cars , unprofessional service and over priced.Better avoid this cab service as they seem to tell only lies and extremely unprofessional."

Overall er spent a good 3 nights at Jaipur and Sultan made it extra special for us."
