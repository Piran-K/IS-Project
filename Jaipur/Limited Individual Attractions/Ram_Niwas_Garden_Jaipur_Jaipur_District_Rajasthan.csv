Ram_Niwas_Garden,KLE2013,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Disappointing and poorly maintained garden,"The area surrounding the Albert Hall Museum was once a lively, verdant public space but now a rather barren space that hardly qualifies as a garden.  Visit the museum and then move on to other worthwhile Jaipur sites."
Ram_Niwas_Garden,ddevarshi,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Friends,"""Graveyard' of a Garden","Though the place is know as garden but you will hardly find anything that can make the place qualify to call it a garden. However, things were not all that since beginning. There was a time when this place was a happening place of Jaipur. The garden was really green with a lot of old trees. People used to spend evenings here in summer season and days during winters. The Union ground adjacent to garden was always packed with players. There was a cluster of fast food shops among which Kiran Cafe and Kiran Kulfi (local ice cream) shops were most popular. Middle class families used to call prospective brides and grooms to meet each other at this place. The place was also last resort to students and applicants who needed a passport size photograph in hurry as there were 4-5 box camera owners who would give a photograph in matter of hours. This was the fastest service in those days (prior to invention of digital cameras and printers). Then there was Ravindra manch (theatre) which was the only theatre for cultural programs and peopple had to plan their evens according to availability of this place. Later an open air thetre was also built. An art gallery in the basement was second home for local artists. The venue for all the circus and fairs in olden times was a ground on backside of Albert Hall. Things have changed a great deal. Now the place is visited only for Albert Hall Museum, Zoo and a parking. You must be a mad person to include this on your itinerary even if you dont intend visit to Zoo or Albert Hall. Since it may fall in your route so may be you will get to see it briefly and that much ention it deserves."

Pitiful maintainance. Best avoided. If you must go, then go in winters. Keep away from all forms of beggers around."

Ram_Niwas_Garden,vickydelhiindia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2013 • Couples,Exit after the museum,"This place is not worth visiting. I don't know why it is still even called a garden. There is hardly any grass worth sitting on, no shade at all and cars plying right there. Only footfall it receives is from people who visit the museum and are told of this garden."
Ram_Niwas_Garden,BradJill,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2013 • Family,Not really worth the visit other than the Albert Hall Museum,"We visited the area referred to as the Ram Niwas Gardens during our trip to Jaipur in early January and were surprised at the state of the once famed garden area.  What we found was more of an aged and dilapidated city park area with too much traffic, pollution and people.  The Garden itself was not in great shape. However, there is one attraction there we found worthy of visiting. The Central Government (Albert Hall) Museum, which is an intriguing of curios, some artefacts and other items of interest.  The Albert Hall is also an interesting architectural feat blending English and Northern Indian styles from the late 19th century, which might strike an interest in those who enjoy architecture.  There is a zoo that can be visited in the area as well.  Overall, we were disappointed in the Ram Niwas Gardens and wouldn't recommend allocating your holiday time to visit this area unless you are particularly keen on curiosities museums and or architecture in which time you might want to spare some time for the Central Government (Albert Hall) Museum."
Ram_Niwas_Garden,Sumit Jain,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Family,Nothing to call it a graden anymore,"Earlier One of the finest places in  Jaipur for a morning walk if you live in the city. I would say this is still the same. But as soon as the day starts to progress the agony of this place starts badly. Though it has two of the highly visited attractions of Jaipur - The Albert hall and the jaipur ZOO, but the traffic which starts flowing from here actually makes it a place not to be. Highly poluted in the day due to high traffic"
Ram_Niwas_Garden,Rajnish P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,No more garden left....,"Ram Niwas garden once used to be a 'Pride of Jaipir'. In earlier days this place was out of walled city; but  with a spread of the city, it is now a centrally located garden.Albert Hall Museum, Zoo, and Ravindra Manch (a theater for drama, and dance performances) are located within this vast area. You will find thousands of pigeons on the grounds in front of Albert Hall Museum. This museum has rare unique collection of Curio given by Maharaja of Jaipur.This garden once used to be so green and cool that local families will make it a point to pass their evenings here. Children will play and elderly will take a stroll....But, Alas, with poor maintenance of it, with traffic allowed to pass through, and with coming up of multi story parking lot in it, the charm has gone........."
