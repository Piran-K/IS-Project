Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,beckynmax,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Solo,Beautiful,"Very beautiful memorial cenotaphs in a quiet setting. If you come, hire your driver to wait as it is a bit off the tourist trail. Spend .5 or 1 hour."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Eileen G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,A quiet and lovely spot,"As others have noted, this is a lovely and quiet spot in Jaipur. It's a bit off the tourist track. Even our tour guide hadn't been there before. The architecture is beautiful with stunning sculptures."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Shakeer K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Business,Best place,Amazing place with only few people in side.You should definitely go there. If you are in Jaipur.if you like photography then that’s the place for you.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Gl0balCitizen2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Beautiful architecture in a serene place,"The Royal Gaitor Tumbas are beautifully serene, set in a quiet locale, far from the bustling crowds. They were so quiet and bereft of people, that I felt a bit scared because we were two women, with a child, wandering through the Tumbas. The buildings are so beautiful, that one forgets that these were the places where the royals of Jaipur were cremated. The tombs marking the death of children was quite poignant. One can hear the calls of peacocks from the surrounding hills and see the walls of the fort. It is well worth a visit, but I recommend going with a tour operator, rather than on your own. There is an entry fee, but you don't get any ticket- so you know who is pocketing the money! Also there is Shiv temple inside, and we were asked to visit by an old person, who was also shooing away donkeys that had strayed inside. We didn't and given the interest of this person and a younger one in us (probably for tips or donations), we chose not to go deeper into the Gaitor Tumbas either.But still, I regard it as an enriching visit."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,MamaT23,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Somber yet very peaceful,"Extremely eerie how this area is so tranquil, to a point I actually hearing birds chirping in India for the first time. Standing in the garden area feeling the warm breeze while listening to the amazing sounds of all different kinds of wildlife was so peaceful.I came here to show respect to Maharaja Jai Singh  and Gayatri Devi."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,elsarge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Lovely Oasis away from the bustle of Jaipur,"This was a little gem, having come down from the Nahagarh Fort right above we were looking for something to while away 30 mins before lunch and took a punt on this as recommended by the guide books. It was really lovely, the cremation pavilions are beautifully carved and the whole site was clean and tidy and virtually empty. Entrance fee was about 20pence"
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,loztm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Beautiful quiet oasis in Jaipur ,"My favourite place in Jaipur. We went at 10.30 in morning. It was so beautiful I can’t believe it. Very few people here, easy to take pictures without others spoiling them. Peaceful place surrounded by hills and fresh air. Also walk the stairs next to this location to the temple for some exercise and good views of Jaipur. "
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Brun066,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,"Evocative place of the ""soul"" of Jaipur and its territory, like other, much more visited, attractions.","This place, which in my opinion has an extraordinary charm, can be read as a site of concentration of funerary architectural practices also widespread outside Rajasthan, but which find here one of their highlights, thanks also to the pleasantness and relative loneliness of the place.The key to the complex is the architectural element, widespread in early modern Indian architecture, called ""chatri"" or ""chhatri"", basically a circular, square or polygonal canopy, supported by columns, which in turn are present in different numbers (starting from from a minimum of four) and shape. Here it is presented in particularly elaborate and sumptuous forms.The chatri are also present without reference to funeral memories: those who visit the Mughal monuments of Agra or Fatehpur Sikri will remember them standing at the corners of large buildings, which is intended to further ennoble by this decoration.How were the chatri interpreted in Rajasthan? Melia Belli Bose, a scholar of the University of Victoria (BC, Canada), in her book ""Royal Umbrellas of Stone: Memory, Politics, and Public Identity in Rajput Funerary Art"" (2015), states among other things that gradually ""Rajput rulers came into contact with the Indo-Islamic courts and understood the legitimizing messages their tombs conveyed"", so they adapted the pre-existing element of the ""chatri"" for the purpose.This practice, extended not only to the dead rajahs, but to all noble persons, causes Rajasthan to be dotted with funeral chatri. But I doubt that such a large set of equally ornate chatri exists elsewhere; and therefore there is another ensemble so scenic that it can be compared to this.These chatri are designated as ""cenotaphs"", that is, empty tombs, due to the fact that funeral practices provided for cremation, so there is no corpse to be stored. This would not in principle prevent the ashes of the deceased from being stored under or near the chatri; but I don't know if this happened in the case of the Royal Gaitor.Overall, this seems to me an evocative place of the personality of Jaipur and its territory, in the same way as other, much more visited, attractions."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,switchedoff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Tuk TUK drivers brought us here  well worth it.,Would have been great to have more info on the people whose ashes are there.  Really beautiful structures and a peaceful place away from the hoards.  
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Travellinggoalgent,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Very impressive and picture perfect ,"A wonderful spot a little on the outskirts of the old town but certainly worth the drive. Stunning and impressive architecture in all its Indian glory. Marbles with sculptures , small coves, domes with reliefs and a fairytale like atmosphere. Simply wonderful. "
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,PKfamily,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Peaceful place to visit,Recommended to visit by a local and pleased we did. Very peaceful gardens with 3 temples to explore. Don't need to spend long here but worth adding to your itinerary.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,jazsacher,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,a nice stop,"I enjoyed my brief visit to the Royal Gaitor Tumbas in Jaipur.  We visited the grounds briefly and observed all 3 temples in order.  What I enjoyed most about the visit were the incredible monkeys with black hands and black faces which were long and lanky and lovely to view and play with.  I got some incredible shots of the monkeys up close and personal felt we observed something pretty unusual and special which most tourists don't get to see.  As for the temples themselves, I guess we've seen so many during our visit to India that they don't seem so special anymore.  These were small and not as impressive as others I've seen in India.  However, I enjoyed the stop.  There were hardly any tourists and we had the place pretty much to ourselves."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,ThenWestwardHoe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Very peaceful place well worth a visit,"Taking an Oto from Jaipur pink city to Amber Fort, I stopped here, because it was a destination on my compilation ticket to City Palace in Jaipur. I had no idea this place was so impressive. It's off the beaten track and very peaceful. A nice change of pace from the crowds at Hawa Mahal and City Palace. The exquisitely carved marble tombs and pillars and the whole architecture of the place are amazing. You also get a great view from one of the terraces."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Orchid4841,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Really beautiful ....,"This was not on our original itinerary, but our driver though we might like to see it and I'm so pleased he included it. Very peaceful, tranquil place, full of beautiful monuments, all intricately carved and decorated. Unlike many monuments we visited in India, this one is well kept and was immaculate - no rubbish strewn about or graffiti. This place felt restful and there is much more to see than one might expect, so spending time looking round was a pleasure."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Valisa,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Beautiful,Beautiful architecture.  Beautiful art work.. Great photo station.  Very quite place.  Not so crowded.  After all its cemetery.  
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Chubb,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,potentially interesting left us disappointed,"There are little to no informative stories about the detail, the gardens are really well maintained and the buildings are not, so it all felt a bit tired and shabby which is a shame because it should be fascinating and interesting"
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,raj b,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,ROYAL GAITOR TUMBAS,The marble structures are very beautiful and well preserved. Definitely not the most popular in the jaipur circuit but definitely worth more than what is being perceived.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Sawat-dhi-kha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Incredible exploration,"One of our favourite visits. There was barely anyone which made the wander around all the temples great, the temples are beautiful, very nice view on part of the city. It is located in a calmer part of Jaipur so if you are looking for a place to escape the noise and pollution for a little bit, to recommend. "
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Prathamesh Sawant,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Tombs for the royal families!!,Its a worth a stop while on the way to Jal Mahal and Amer fort. Place houses tombs for many kings and the members of the royal family.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Richard G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Not a must see but worth a detour,"Royal Gaitor is not far from the centre of Jaipur so is easily visited but few people visit it.  This is a pity because the various memorial buildings are beautiful and well worth looking at.  The architecture and the carving is interesting and a visit complements visits to the ""big"" attractions of Jaipur."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,rjpriyanka,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Tombs,These are royaltombs where the founder of the city Raja Jai Singh is buired wirth other members from royal family.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Umang A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Tombs,A peaceful and not so famous spot among tourists. This place is tombs of many Kings from Jaipur royal dynasty and they are built beautifully 
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,gemlovestotravel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Nice place to go away from tourist traps,"Would put this on a must see list. Not many tourists go which in a way is a shame but equally what makes this place worth the visit as it’s so peaceful and not at all crowded. Fab views of the city fort walls.The founder of Jaipur is buried here and the marble carvings are gorgeous.There are people waiting to guide you including park employees who expect a tip but give you some good photo tips, in return for a tip of course.Beautiful tombs to rival those in Delhi but only 30 rupees to enter."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Primestop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Off the standard tourist track,"I was pleased my driver took me here, as it's a peaceful spot and impressive in itself.  Combine your visit with a climb to Surya Mandir for great (if hazy) views of Jaipur."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,April S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Hidden Gem,"After a busy day of touring Jaipur we stopped here to visit. It's so very beautiful and not busy at all. We took 30-45 minutes exploring the area and learning the history from our tour guide, when I wasn't busy taking photos of all the beautiful scenery. It's a very peaceful and beautiful area."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,rapha_y_nici,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Our highlight of Jaipur,"This place is definitely a hidden gem and we just got here because of our tuktuk tour from our hostel. This area is a must and can be perfectly combined withe Nahargah Fort.. before getting up there ask the tuktuk driver to stop here, for about an hour. It was the most peaceful spot we visited here. Not to be missed, highly recommended!!"
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Captainbob542,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,A lovely quiet place,"We visited here after spending a few hours in the nearby fort, it was quieter, cooler and so much more relaxed. We were brought here by our Tuk Tuk driver ‘Lucky’ and were grateful for him showing us this lovely place."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Kuno W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Hidden gem ,"It is a peaceful and beautiful place, no crowds, no honking. If you have the time take a break from hustling Jaipur, stop by and enjoy. "

Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Amolak Rattan K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,An architectural beauty and nothing else,You can go there out of curiosity . You will certainly admire the structure once you reach there . What else to watch remains a question which no body can answer .Governor Amolak Rattan Kohli
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Cloud_Matt,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Worth exploring,"I don’t think you will need more than half an hour here. The intricate stonework in marble is something to behold. Make sure you explore it all - for example there is a staircase that goes up and over the entrance giving some great photo opportunities.The best bit is there are no crowds, there’s a chance you will have the place to yourself. "
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,George N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,A 1 hour visit,"An interesting place to visit, it is quiet and peaceful.  The stonework is amazing and well worth seeing."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Conor W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,A definite highlight,Was not expecting this. We were on a typical scam taxi tour of Jaipur but this was a nice surprise in an otherwise endless list of unwanted jewellery and clothes shops. The buildings are really nice and provide many opportunities for great pics. 15 minutes by car from amber fort/the step well so could all be dome together for a cheap taxi ride. 
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Rajiv Bajaj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Hidden Gem Of Jaipur Away From Crowds,"This one turned out to be a hidden gem of Jaipur. What is surprising is that it is not a destination actively promoted by Rajasthan Tourism, or at least I have not seen it being advertised. This walled complex is the final resting place of the Royals of Jaipur, well not literally, but it is the complex where the royals have been cremated in the past. For each royal family member cremated here, there is a Chhatri or Cenotaph constructed as a commemoration, spread out in a garden. The complex is a little away from the main city, in a peaceful area, and it is neat, clean and well maintained, unlike some of the other monuments we have visited in Rajasthan.  The chhatris are beautifully constructed, and the marble work is fantastic. There is even a temple within the complex. The Aravali Hills in the background lend a beautiful backdrop to the Cenotaphs.Overall, a good experience and definitely worth one visit, especially if history and architecture interest you."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Laura G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Peaceful,We stumbled upon this place randomly and were very happy we did! A very peaceful and beautiful place. Would recommend if you have a spare half an hour or so in Jaipur 
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Suez1956,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,"A very pleasant location, away from teh crowds and the chhatris of the earswhile Jaiur Maharajs are really very beautifu",Would suggest all visitors to Jaipur to take time out and visit this site..gives an insight into thee various architectural elements from different areas coming together. very well maintained by the trust  Each of the cenotaphs is built in a different style with extensive carvings and a very refined woek. A must visit place in Jaipur.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,George,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,"Tombs, Temples and Cenotaphs",Nice tombs and temples. Not much to see. Entrance fee 30 INR. If you have time spent 15 minutes to this sighseeing.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,CAROLE N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,"Off the tourist trail, a peaceful place that is full of stories","After the continuous hard sell of the hawkers at the Amer Fort and other tourist places in Jaipur, this was lovely and peaceful, even as the temperature rose well above 40 degrees. The charming guide took us around and shared some great stories for about half an hour.  Great place to see the city wall and some royal history without being mobbed every minute."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Umang A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Heritage...,These tumbas are beautifully built with detailed carving on marvel... Beware of monkeys in this area..

Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Melanie E,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,Peaceful and serene,"Kings of the Royal family of Jaipur were cremated here. An off beaten tourist area where each building is built on the burial ground of previous kings and queens. They are currently still working on the tomb of the last king who died. A few beautiful carvings. Only 20 rupees entrance fees and is located 10 km from Jaipur. Glad my driver took me here. Worth a visit for a few photos.Visit if you have time in your itinerary. Not many tourists visit here. I felt safe as a solo traveler. It was definitely peaceful and serene. "
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,rajibk95,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Royal Gaitor,"Though the Gaitor is less known it should be part of the itinerary. There are two sections here, the one you enter from the then the portion at the rear end. The sculptures are intricate with a mix of different styles and a must see. There are two different types of interlocking systems used for the roofs / ceiling. Only one thing to be kept in mind is that these are samadhi and due respect needs to be paid when visiting."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Louise 🌍TRAVEL BLOGGER🛫,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Stunning temple but beware of monkeys ,"This temple is well kept and stunning. It is only 30INR pp and therefore well worth the visit. At the far end of the site there are lots of monkeys. There is a man who gave us biscuits to feed them which was fun at first, however once we ran out of biscuits the monkeys weren't impressed and made this quite clear. To the right of the temple there are LOTS of steps leading up to the top of a large hill. This is a very difficult climb but when when you get to the top the views are out of this world!!!"
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Ricardo R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Hidden gem,"It is about 2 km from the Pink City, na easy walk or take a rickshaw. Very  few tourists visit this place, many people even know about this. That´s why is very calm and pleasnat a visit to the Gaitors, be one of these lucky tourists.Entrance fee is only 30 rupees, in my opinion it is best to visit in afternoon, the sun shines direct in the façades not in the back. Near the entrance we find a way that leads to the Ganesh temple up hill."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,anjuanjali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Couples,lovely place of marbel,great place with cheap entrance. only 30 rs entrance.  Its a Royal Palace with carvings on the walls and marble tombs. This building is also a historical building. good to visit
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,LostAndFoundTravel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,"""Empty"" Tombs - Full of Amazement",If you have seen Best Exotic Marigold 2 - this is the location that Bill Nighy pretends to be a tour guide at. If not - this is one of the quietest places in Jaipur. The tombs were never intended to contain bodies so these are more like GIANT tombstones in a way. Go on Sunday if you can as even the staff is gone. Take lots of pics.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,tinkertu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Well worth the visit,"This place is out of the way but great fun to get to, viewing everyday life from the back of a tuktuk. Be prepared for a bumpy ride!Very cheap to enter (30INR) and I took a guide inside the small  complex (there isn't a set price, you tip him at the end).It's such a peaceful place, set below Nahargarh, and a welcome respite from the busyness of Jaipur. Many royals are buried here, some are very recent, and the older cenotaphs are the most beautiful, intricately carved out of marble or sandstone. Personally I found this well worth the visit and a surprising highlight.Highly recommend the visit and the effort to get out here (I combined it with a drive out to Amber, my driver was also Lucky!)."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Deepak A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Resting place of Jaipur Royals,These are all tombs or chharis of Jaipur royals. Architecture wise this place is good. but not more than 30 minutes to spend here. Also you need to go out of the way to reach there.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Shaf B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Couples,Historical Place!!,This place is a very old place maintained in Jaipur. Its a Royal Palace with carvings on the walls and marble tombs. 
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Alan R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Couples,Monuments to the Royals of Rajasthan.,We nearly overlooked this collection of buildings that mark the Kings of Rajasthan at the end of their life. The carvings and spectacle of this site are quite amazing. The site also houses a temple dedicated to Ganesha. A worthwhile visit.

Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Northern_Baggie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Well worth a trip,Not on the usual tourist trail - we arrived by tuk tuk which waited for us.For R20 each this is the biggest bargain in Jaipur currently. It consists of several intricate tombs set back from the entrance. We were told Italian marble was used in their construction. Very intricate detailing.Some preservation work ongoing when we visited suggesting that the authorities care about this place. Only spent 30 mins there but well worth it.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,edmerich,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Beautiful & Peaceful,"This is a must place to visit, especially for individual travellers as it does not look to be on the circuit of big groups. Enjoy the beautiful marble carved tombs and the peaceful surroundings"
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Flladi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,"Very enjoyable, not so turistic (yet) destination","I actually liked this place a lot (and also a lot more than some of the other very turistic destionations). It had a relatively low entry fee (around 200 rupees) and the best part of it was the absence of crowds. When we went there, there were only 10 other people in total in the place. There are lots of monkeys around, jumping from tree to tree and sorrounding the temple. Quite nice to watch, didn't try to get any monkey too close to me. Some guys around said the monkeys could get aggressive :)"
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Pece_77,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,A place to visit... no doubts,"This is a very nice area, including several royal tombs.It is quite away from the crowded areas and so it is possible to have a completely different experience here.The entry price is very low, and I also suggest you to get a guide that will explain you the different buildings, and their history. You will not be disappointed !"

Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Tracy E,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,beautiful,"we had visited the Taj earlier in the week and were kind of disappointed in it- the crush of touts and hawkers, the poverty, chaos, and pollution rampant outside of this pristine monument to power, the noisy crowds and their tacky photos- and this was the antidote to that experience. it is quiet, cool, and lush with greenery, set at the back of a neighborhood. reverential would be a good way to describe it. the architecture and carvings are just beautiful, and it is larger than it appears at first glance- there are three areas of tombs, and you can walk up the stairs on most of them to get a nice view of the city. there is a small entrance fee, i think 30r each, and we were warned ahead of time about being overcharged, but we didn't have any problems. really a must visit in jaipur."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Digby_Traveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Surprise around a corner,Do not miss this on your tour of Jaipur. Hidden in an out of the way part of the city but we'll worth a visit. Ridiculously low entrance fee. Very quiet and tranquil but the monuments are amazing. The detailed carvings in the marble are very impressive. All laid out on some nice gardens
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Nikita B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Beautiful architecture ,The details of the architecture are amazing how in those days they paid attention to details and everything was manually done. The spot is not very well kept though. 
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,dvcanter,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Spiritual Calm,Well worth finding your way to! Our driver studied the Google map location but still insisted on asking a couple of times from passerby to be sure. A series of small empty temples set amongst steep hills. They are slowly being renovated so have a nostalgic feel of bygone days. Up above is another temple to Ganesh. It took me well over half an hour to walk up the vertiginous flight of stairs and a good quarter of an hour to come back down. The reward was the great view of the Gaitor temples below and out across the town of Amer. The temple building at the top (it was closed when I was there) is quite unprepossessing. It could have been a small car park building from the stairs.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Daniela M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Nice but not too great,"Average good place. It offers a good 30-40 minutes time of great pictures among the different buildings that conform the tombs. Despite the entrance fees, it is obvious the management of this place doesnt invest in maintaining this place, there is a bit of trash or grafitti. In general it is a nice place to visit if you have extra time but keep it among the last of your list in Jaipur..."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Smart_Traveler_333,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,A hidden treasure ,Took a while to get to but what a find. Beautiful structures great for photography and walking around. Make sure you keep your transport as it's hard to find a taxi from there. 
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,izzie1963,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,Nice side stop if going to Amer / Amber Fort,"Jaipur is chaotic, noisy, jostling.  My driver suggested stopping at Royal Gaitor on way back from Amber Fort.  It was a quiet and calming place.  It's not big, so doesn't require much time.  There was a section under construction which I later learned was the construction for the last king's tomb."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Pedal2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,Stunning - has an undiscovered feeling to it.,Beautiful site to visit. Almost no one was there when we went which gives this place an undiscovered feeling. A pleasant change for many tourist spots.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,SESH MANI SINGH,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Worth the Detour !!!!!,"Can be visited in half an hour but has some spectacular Chattris, divided into three parts. The place is mostly empty and can be visited at ones own pace."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,dekalbill,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,"Quiet, Peaceful, Beautiful",What a pleasure to peacefully walk among the beautiful marble architectural structures without many other human visitors or hawkers.  There are lots of dogs and monkeys but I steer clear of the wildlife.  A group of photographers (complete with a drone) were photographing a wedding couple in the picturesque setting.  Enjoyable half hour.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,PendlePictures,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Resting Place for the Kings of Rajasthan,"Our Tuk Tuk driver took us here, as it was not frequented by tourists, so it was perfect to while away 30 mins, the entrance fee is 100 Rupees, and the guard will take you around each tomb which the family members are buried in, great for photos, but it gets hot! Good to see."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,kelsbelles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Peaceful space,Not very touristy is a lovely way to see the heritage of jaipur whilst escaping the crazy busy streets. Very cheap to enter I think it was around 100rupees to enter and a Grossman showed us around and explain all the tombs to us for a small donation 50rupees or whatever you like
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Krupali S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,tombs of jaipur kings,It is the place where former king was cemented. The chhatris (cenotaphs)was built in memory of the king. They made from white marble which is the  distinctive Rajput style of architecture. 
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,CandyCritic,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,Surprisingly Excelent,"By the time we visited the Royal Gaitor Tombs we had already seen a lot of other Indian tombs, so we weren't expecting too much. We were completely wrong.  This was what you really want when you visit a place like this.  The site was fairly clean, at least in comparison to many other tombs and sites we had visited before.  It seemed like the site was also being well maintained since we saw one of the areas being worked on while we were there.We were asked by the guard if we wanted a tour, but with little convincing we managed to make it clear we didn't, and we weren't asked again for our entire visit. For the most part this site doesn't feel like a tourist destination as it does a site to explore.  While we were there we only ran into one other pair of tourists.  I'm sure if more people discovered this place it would be overrun with guides and tacky souvenir shops, but for now it's really quite and beautiful."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,JohnDC499,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,Don't miss it!,"A quiet and reflective place with an ethereal feel, beautiful architecture and a sense of calm. The sights of Jaipur are many in number, but don't miss this."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Ayekila,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,A tranquil place.,"It is a nice and clean place.The stone monuments are beautifully and intricately carved. It is a very well preserved; when I went there, there were no tourists around but there were lots of monkeys! :) It is worth to visit."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Mohammad M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,Very bad....,When I was go there people are flow all the time amber fort is good but I don't like this and people that try to sale something I m nor recommended not this....
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Bubblesrgood,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Interesting without many tourists but beware....,"Our driver dropped us off here for a 30 minute look around which was plenty. There was a small 30 rupee entrance fee and then we walked around the lovely marble buildings and carvings. It does not take long to cover the place so we started to explore and went towards the rear of the complex. At the back there is a raised building with one set of steps going up.The moment we got to the top a troop of very aggressive monkeys cut us off. We each had a bag and I am sure they were after them assuming there is food inside. We managed to get out but not without having to beat a couple of them off with the bags and we suffered a scratch from one. We had it checked out with a local doctor and he confirmed it was not a bite otherwise it would have got serious and need hospital treatment.So beware, this is interesting and worth a visit but be very careful about monkeys as with less tourists they are very aggressive,"
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,359Pat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Off the tourist track,Read about this on tripadvisor and the comments are spot onThe first tuk tuk drivers did not know where this was.We eventually got a Jaipur born driver who did know of them.Superb tombs of the Maharajas of Jaipur including one under construction for one who died 4 years ago.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Olivier R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Interesting monuments at very low fee,"Our tuk tuk driver took us there before going to Amer fort. It was a great stop to have a glimpse of the maharajas opulence even after their deaths. Some of the monuments are really impressive, with fine marble carving, while others are less interesting. Can be done in 30 minutes."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Charles C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Nice place to chill and wander around ,"Off the main tourism circuit which is nice, lots of ornamental Temple type buildings and all made or marble. Really quiet and cheap to enter at 30r each! "
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Teun J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Not so touristy complex,Nice and quiet place to walk around and view some well preserved temples and have a view over the city. Entrance is only INR20!
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,James H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,"Hidden Gem, Study Before and Skip a Tourguide","This attraction shows up on google maps only as ""gaitor"".  Absolutely worth a small detour.Tour guides on site will try and show you around for 100 rupees.  I would recommend skipping that since the whole site takes up less than an acre of land.  If you pay decent attention at the City Palace and Albert Museum you should have a decent understanding of the Maharajas and the most powerful ones in that dynasty.  The architecture on the mausoleums is beautiful and the site overall is very peaceful."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Anushka c,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015,Another jewel in Jaipur,These are royal cenotaphs of ancient kings and queens of Jaipur. All monuments are beautifully curved. Located in a calm and peaceful location near the Jaipur city. View our photos to feel the beauty of this place.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Clevlander,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Impressive,There were notorious when we came to visit. It is an impressive place with three different areas all part of the same most of them. All the buildings are made of marble and is the resting place of all the kings of the area. Worth a visit.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,davevs42,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Beautiful and peaceful less visited area,"Our tuk-tuk driver took us here on the promise that it's just as beautiful - if not more so - than the more frequented tourist attractions in the centre of Jaipur, but at a much lower price. The entry fee was just 30 rupees, and though it's quite a small area it's absolutely beautiful. The mausoleums are wonderfully constructed with intricate designs and artwork on them. There were only 3 or 4 other visitors when we visited (in the middle of the day) so the perfect place if you want some peace and quiet."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,niranjan r,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Good for those who are into heritage,"I went there with my friends, the work of stone is really good in the tombs. If you are into heritage then it's a good place to visit. "
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Rohan L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,Beautiful Tombs,This is a less travelled attraction in Jaipur. Nice & creative structural tombs are the part Royal Gaitor. Many tour operators skips this attraction untill N unless you specifically ask for. Personally I will check it as must visit attraction in Jaipur.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Parwathi H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Couples,Nice Place for Some Peaceful Moments,This place is basically the site of mausoleums of the Royal family of Jaipur. You can find some beautifully made chhatris of marble. The best part is of course that this place is not as crowded as other popular tourist attractions of Jaipur. We found the place to be peaceful and serene and thereby lies its charm.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,SC499,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,Beautiful and Peaceful,Wonderfully quiet place in Jaipur - we sat and listened to the birds and saw monkeys in the trees.  Very calming and only a handful of visitors while we were there.  Very cheap to get in and worthwhile.
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Freckle_Eye,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Stunning Marble Structures,"If your an avid photographer this is a stunning place to go and take some amazing shots, the architecture and the marble statuses and carvings are truly beautiful.Best time to visit is in the evening at around 17:00, much more quite and starts to get a little cooler at this hour which makes it much more enjoyable :)The one thing that put me off this place was the wild monkeys, be wary! Do not engage with them and walk away if they start gathering, I was surrounded and had to leave at a run, quite a scary experience from that point."
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,SkinnyLauren,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,beautiful. quiet,very pretty. quiet. clean. nice break from the city. highly recommend! 30 rupees entrance fee. plan to spend about 30 mins here. 
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,sanket b,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,Most less visited place in Jaipur ,During my solo trip to Jaipur. My auto driver took me to this place. There is not much info available on net for this place. I found this place very peaceful and quiet. Best way place for photography 
Royal_Gaitor_Tumbas,Harry_Roseblade,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,A surprise,"This was a delightful surprise amongst the honking horns of Jaipur. As a previous reviewer has already stated, the 2 guards on the gate charged us IR60 and did not give us any tickets. Our loss! However, don't let that put you off. 20 minutes is enough time to allow to see this place but if you sit somewhere in shade then sit back and listen to the birds."
