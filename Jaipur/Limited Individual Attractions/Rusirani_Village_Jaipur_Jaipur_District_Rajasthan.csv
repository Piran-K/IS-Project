Rusirani_Village,Sangram Singh Rathore,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Trip to Rushirani village,"Fabulous trip to this historical place of Rajasthan. Visited the famous Lord Shiva temple which changes its color twice in a day, an awesome experience."
Rusirani_Village,Daan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Rural life with history!,"We were lucky enough to visit Rusirani village and get an idea of life in a Hindu village. Giri was an excellent and very welcoming guide that took an obvious pride in his history. We had an excellent lunch, got to interact with the curious and open family that hosted us and got a very positive feeling about this community project. It was interesting to develop a deeper understanding of the contrasts that exist on our globe. I highly recommend this experience and would rate it as one of the highlights of our first-time India trip."
Rusirani_Village,jeffpeters,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,A great way to get off the beaten track and do some good,"If you're looking for something different then this is for you.  From my first chats with Giri I knew he was going to look after me.  He organised my travel from Jaipur, my visit to the village and then my onward travel to Agra.   The drive was long and the roads a little bumpy (but not really that bad), but by the end of the day I had had a wonderful experience that will live with me for a long time.I believe some or all of the money goes to help fund a school in the village so even better.  Thanks Giri for a wonderful day."
Rusirani_Village,Giedre R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"Favorite experience, but please reconsider transportation","We loved our day trip to Rusirani. We learned more about Rajasthan rural area, people and nature. We had a delicious lunch and had a pleasant relaxing stay. I do recommend if you are in the  area. One thing I would have done differently is to use our tour company car to drive to the mountain road and then reach the village in the provided Jeep. We road Jeep from Jaipur (4 hours) and it was not safe and uncomfortable. I would not advise to do that. Ask your driver to drive you to the closest meeting point near village and asked to be picked up after you are done."
Rusirani_Village,Claud,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Brilliant stay in wonderful rural village,"This was one of our favourite parts of our trip to India. Staying with local families, eating amazing home cooked food and watching village life go back. A unique chance to learn more about India's rural communities, ask questions and have interesting chats with lovely Gupi, our guide and understand village life and traditions. A must do if you're visiting Rajasthan.Thanks you!"
Rusirani_Village,BBW150,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Real India Off the Beaten Track!,"We visited Rusi Rani on a tour three years ago -- on our recent trip to India with friends, we made sure to include a second visit for our group! We love the experience of sitting and visiting with people of the area, sharing a meal, visiting the ancient Hindu ruins and also seeing the sights on the way to the village. We made a stop at a Hindu holy site built around baths and also in the middle of a little village for chai tea on our way to Rusi Rani. Our group of 10 traveled in two jeeps, one open air and one closed. I will say that the roads are awfully bumpy and it is an all-day trip from Jaipur. Giri, who we met on our previous trip, was also our guide for this trip and he is so knowledgeable and speaks excellent English. We were pleased to notice improvements in the village infrastructure -- restrooms with running water and solar panels -- that had been added since our last trip. Giri said that the money received from the tours (usually one a week) was being used for girls' education and village infrastructure. The villagers were very friendly, especially the children. You might want to think about bringing some bubbles, markers & paper or other small activities to play with the kids -- they enjoyed my pathetic attempts at drawing animals! I would highly recommend this tour if you are on the ""Golden Triangle"" tour and want a day away from touristy sites and vendors and also want to improve education for girls at the same time."
Rusirani_Village,danielabedandview,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,The real Rajasthan. Off the beaten track: wonderful experience Rusirani Village,"Rusirani is a traditional village, more than 2000 years old.  A place situated around 130 km. from Jaipur, so put it in your itinerary if you are travelling from Jaipur to Agra and you will have a different, more real experience over this incledible country. Rusirani is simplicity, there is no use of money in the village, there is no proper supply of electricity , network connection and transportation. I was really looking for a place like this, when I was building my itinerary in Rajasthan, Agra and Delhi and now that I have been there for a day with my husband and our 10 years old daughter, I feel that this experience has been the most fullfilling of the entire trip. Our wonderful guide, Mr. Girdhari (Giri), that I contacted at rusirani.village@gmail.com, had told me: this is not a touristy experience, so I don't promise anything, nobody is going to do anything special or fake for you. It was true, nothing was done to sell us a carpet or a juwel, but the people that we met had a lot to give, they warmed our hearts with their pure smiles and our communication went beyond the difficulty of understanding each other!We paid some money, yes, but this money is for the jeep transportation, for the guided tour of the ancient temple and ruins and..the beautiful thing is that most of this money is for a great cause: for the solar panels that they are installing and for the family of a young girl of the village, so she can go to school. In Rusirani children can only study until 14 years old and most of the times girls would quit school instead of going to study in the cities around, unless supported by people like us. The family (that changes every time) prepares your lunch and together with the rest of the village, offers you what they have: simplicity and love. Our 10 years old daughter loved the experience too! THANK YOU MR. GIRI!!!"

Rusirani_Village,Sarthak J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,A look back in time.,"We loved our overnight stay and days in Rusirani Village. We met Girdhari at Abhaneri step-well and went via jeep to the Village where we received a friendly welcome from Raju and the group of families living in her area. We had 4 meals during our stay, all were local recipes, filling and delicious. Our itinerary was nicely filled, allowing us to spend time with the community in the beautiful quiet countryside, soaking it all in. We watched the sunset from the fort walls with three of the local girls and that evening talked with the locals around the fire pit. Dancing and playing with the children is a memory I cherish. The next day was lovely as we had gotten to know the family more and they kindly showed me the views from the rooftops before picking berries and coriander in the fields. After a hearty breakfast we walked the local landscape, exploring few of the 352 beautiful heritage sites of Rusirani Village with Girdhari before lunch then a drop off in Jaipur. It was the hospitality of Raju and her family and Girdhari and the company of Chandni and the villagers that made our experience so happy and special. Plus the quiet nature of the village and clean rooms meant that it was the best night sleep we had our whole trip! Arrangements were easy as we got quick replies and Girdhari’s easy going nature filled us with confidence. It was clear to see that the money was going to a good place. Thanks again to Raju and her family for a brilliant stay. "
Rusirani_Village,Glenn M,,,,"Rusirani Village - 2000+ years old, this village take you back to the ancient time. A place situated around 130 km. from Jaipur, near Sariska National park. Here in this village there is no proper supply of electricity , network connection and  transportation. People here cultivate crops like wheat, bajra, etc. To meet their daily requirements and an NGO name INSPIRE is helping the village by educating the kids, giving money to the village through tourism and in the year 2011 this NGO helped rusirani by providing small solar panels and contributing towards the development.Thanks to Girdhari bhaiya and rusirani village poeple to make a greatful day and giving us the best ever food for lunch."
,,,,,"I visited the village as part of a small photographic group and saw the marvelous 2000 year old temples that are being preserved for future generations and also spent several hours visiting one of the family compounds where, as a photographer, you can photograph the local people as they go about their daily tasks that have barely changed as the outside world has modernized. The family prepares a lunch from locally grown produce as part of the package and were happy to pose for photos when asked. The fees charged for the visit are used to enhance the community so it is a great way to contribute to the village whilst being able to take amazing photographs. The visit to the village takes around 1.5 hours in the back of a jeep from the nearest large town and there is no cellphone coverage in the village or surrounds."
Rusirani_Village,Umang A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Roadies...,"If you love to travel to old villages, live with them,know their culture... This is the place... They have ensure their 2500 old culture is safegaurded years after years..."
Rusirani_Village,Mohan Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Awesome four hours with villagers,We had an amazing time. With my two other friends I liked the cultural part of the visit. We enjoyed the local homemade lunch and the time we spent with local school kids. The old ( very old) ancient remains also worth a visit. I liked the local community very much.
Rusirani_Village,sharon D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Hi Light of our Golden Triangle Tour,"Our trip to this small farming village was an enjoyable day trip ( couple of hours four wheeling in the back of a jeep) from Jaipur and away from the noise and pollution. We enjoyed the gracious hospitality of a village family who fed us and shared their farming home and children with us.  We stopped at a village school,  helped distribute school supplies and the fun and laughter was reciprocal.  Our guide Giri was very knowledgeable and accommodating and was a great translator and mediator between us and the village people and families.  His love for the region and the culture was very evident and he was more than willing to share his own story with you which we found very inspiring. And the best thing is knowing your visit assists the village girls in obtaining higher education.  It really is a win win.  We are so glad we took a day out of our golden triangle tour to visit this village. We agree 100% with the other reviewers- it was a beautiful experience.   You won't regret a day with the lovely people of Rusirani Village."
Rusirani_Village,Milanovic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Rusirani & Sariska national park,"Me and my friend went here in july (don't worry about the rain season) and it was amazing. We met the locals, visited the village that was completely surrounded by nature, and afterwards we went for a trip into Sariska National Park. The host family was heartwarming and welcoming. We brought some Belgian cookies (they seemed to like it) and dipped it in chai tea.The money is well spent on girls education, and the guide Girdhari is a very pleasant man.Absolutely a must for everyone!"
Rusirani_Village,Suruchi J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,A Beautiful Must Have Visit / Experience Rusirani Village!,"Rusirani Ka VillageRusirani village is about 5000 or more years old village near Alwar ( 35 KM approx.), Abhaneri step wells, Bhangarh fort, and Jaipur ( 130 KM approx.).You can club a visit to any of these places (preferably only one), while also visiting the hill top Rusirani village. The village is literally on a hilltop and it is best to take a jeep / other vehicles ( if you plan to go on your own) that have good ground clearance.I have been personally wanting to visit the place since the last 2 years. I first heard about them 2 years ago on Tripadvisor and every time I used to mention their name to anyone, no one knew about them yet there was a village somewhere in Rajasthan that everyone warmly talked about on Tripadvisor. This last weekend, the 8th and 9th July, I decided to visit it (Full Moon). I called up the number I had with me of Mr. Girdari ji ( Giri) and he told me that of course, he remembers talking to me earlier ( many months ago). I had already spoken to him a couple of times now and he had already me an email with all the details of the visit. Giri has an excellent attitude of accommodating visitors' needs. Like in my case, I wished to go on those dates and he managed those days for me. Rusirani village folks are very nice, sweet, welcoming, caring and they will do everything to make you comfortable. I remember mentioning about lemon when I was feeling not so good, and next day one of the village bhaiya got desi lemons... :) I halted their overnight and talked with the ladies until midnight, enjoyed biddi ( very light ones because of the company of them) and slept in a charpai under the sky. I danced with the kids, took a shower under the hand pump, saw the real village life and eat the delicious humble food. Rusirani village is a complete experience in itself. I haven't yet even started talking about its history, temples, forts, and architectural places around the village. There is Neelkhant Mahadev Mandir ( temple), fort ( about 8-9 KM from the village), and other structures worth exploring.Rusirani village started being called as Rusi rani because once a queen ( Rani) got upset with her husband and she came to this village. After spending two months, the raja ( king) asked her to come back but she decided to stay in the village itself. Her husband made the palace for her in the village, made the village gate that you would see upon entering the village and other structures too. If you like to visit Rusirani village, I would suggest ( as a group or solo), to speak with Giri ( 097845 41515 | 09829900120) and tell him about your date of visit. To ensure right sustainability and proper experience of every visitor, they plan the visits. If you are looking for an Indian paid companion during your India travel, then Giri is one of the best persons too. He listens well and he is a decent person so ask him and he would be more than happy to translate conversions, details, add value to your India visit."
Rusirani_Village,SyibliFakih,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Great experience again,"Another great evening with the people here. Great place to have a rest and escape from the busy life of the cities in Jaipur. If you are in Jaipur do visit this place. Make sure you contact them early since its not a tourist spot and not many people know this place even for local people in jaipur. Thank you for your hospitality, continue your great work on developing this village in the right way not spoiled by the tourism and money."
Rusirani_Village,Kathyandfamily365,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015,A must do experience whilst in India,"Our family selected this activity so that our teenage children could experience farm life in India. We had seen the bustle of the cities and wanted to see how many of the India people live. We were not disappointed. The village is in a fairly remote location so life there is still surprisingly simple.  We traveled over bumpy terrain to a small village on the side of a hill. We were greeted by beaming faces and shy children peering around their mother's leg to see us. We felt so welcomed. We were invited to sit in a raised mud sleeping area and offered fresh tea. The villagers don't speak English but our guide translated back and forth for us. The village is home to an extended family of about 100, but when we first arrived only the young children, women and an elderly man were home. The children were fascinated by our digital camera and delighted in seeing their image on the screen. We enjoyed a traditional lunch and given gifts from the village. We also explored the village with its school and temples. Very little money is used in the village, only for petrol for a tractor and for clothing. Everything else is bartered for.By visiting Rusirani village some of the cost goes to the families. In exchange the families must send their girls to school and support them.Without this type of program most rural girls would not attend school.Our visit to the village has left an amazing impression on all of us. I recommend a visit to Rusirani Village to connect with the rural people of India and to learn what is truly important."
Rusirani_Village,Miklos F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Couples,Glipse of traditional village life,"A traditional Indian village which has retained the customs of many many generations. No electricity, no TV, planting crops, herding animals and close family ties.People are friendly yet they continue their traditional routines. You get a view of the real life of the villagers. You can talk with them and just as you are curious about their traditions they are curious about yours. Thus a real exchange. Only one smalll group is accepted each day and each group visits a different fanily  so there is no possibility of Rusi rani becoming a tourist trap. As the vast majority of Indians still live in the  vllages I found it really insightful to learn about their daily life. Giri our guide is Universty educated and speaks English very well. He facilitates rhe echanges with the villagersAs a bonus the village is located on the grounds of an ancient civilization possibly over 2000 years old with a still funtioning Hindu temple ( great carvings), a ruined Jain temple and the remnants of an old fort built about 600 years ago. A very worthwhile visit which is in stark contrast to the raging tide of humanity that you see in the cities. You will get a more balanced view of India and its many faceted civilization"
Rusirani_Village,Margaret B.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Couples,Inspirational and Educational Experience,The journey to the village was simply amazing...a jeep ride up the side of a mountain on a one-lane rough rock road!  Meeting the villagers and interacting with them was inspiring. It was humbling to meet them...to learn that their daily lives consist of working to just sustain themselves yet they are smiling and happy and gracious.  We were offered lunch and tea. We also toured ruins of a past civilization. This is not a tourist trap and not your typical Indian village visit...it is unique and definitely worth your time to take a detour to visit.
Rusirani_Village,garlandcasgrain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,got a new experience,"Came here with our guide as I always wanted to experience Indian village life. This village is quite close to Jaipur and the best delight was the food and the tea, will there is no comparison between Indian and European tea, Indian one is sweet milk, but tasty.Stayed here do 2 hours and its good to meet some local as you can learn a lot about a nation pride from villagers. So do visit rusirani village when you are in pink city"
Rusirani_Village,Anjalichandra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,A Perfect village,"Though I have been first time in any village but I had such a nice experience their . The peaceful environment, the culture and the people all were so nice that I felt really great being their. If anyone wants to visit any peaceful place then he/she must visit RusiRani village at least once."
Rusirani_Village,AvineshPVS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Solo,Awesome getaway!!,"A perfect place to escape the city life and go live the simple village life with no traffic noise and phone signals. Russirani village is located on a hilltop surrounded by Aravali mountains. It is roughly 100km from Jaipur which comes before Alwar. It is popularly known for its Abhaneri step well (8th century marvel) and 10th century Harshat Mata Temple. The village was named after the queen of Alwar. I found this place here. I was quite surprised to see mostly 5 star reviews for any organisation. I was quite curious and read the reviews. I instantly liked it because of two reasons: 1) The money they collected from the guests was used to sponsor a girl child’s education in the village 2) I was quite curious how they were conducting village tourism.The road to the village is easily located in the map but the road isn’t that great. The road from Jaipur to Dausa (NH11) is really nice after that the state highway is quite bumpy for 30km. The hospitality of the villagers was really nice. We had some interesting debates about tattoos, child marriage, village life, education etc. After an awesome lunch we went to an dilapidated fort. An awesome adventure: hiking to the fort and jumping across the fort walls to enter it. The fort seems to be of the historical importance. Strange that it has been left in ruins. The panoramic view from the top of the fort is just amazing. I have never seen a fort surrounded by mountains with a terrific view. Overall sleeping under the stars and enjoying the peaceful village life was the best part of the stay. Thanks Mr. Bhagirath and villagers for an awesome hospitality."
Rusirani_Village,strouthos,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Couples,Step back in time 200-300 years.,"One of the best experiences we've had in India. Rusirani is an eyeopening trip back in time to a few centuries ago. There is no running water, no electricity, no modern amenities. Sheltered from the modern world, most people have lived here their entire lives. It's amazing to watch them interact, go about their daily tasks, tend to their animals, cook, hang out etc. We were invited to lunch that was cooked over a fire, basically the same way our grandparent's grandparents did ages ago. The villagers were very warm and welcoming. They showed a lot of interest in us as we did in them. Our guide (born and raised in the village) was one of the very few with a college education, and did an incredible job explaining and translating everything.I highly recommend a visit - one of the highlights of our trip to India. It's also for a good cause. They use the proceeds as a community to help children get an educationPut this on your itinerary. You will not regret it. An experience that will last a lifetime."
Rusirani_Village,SyibliFakih,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Friends,PEACEFUL & BEAUTIFUL,"If you feel that India is to busy, go here and feel the relaxed, calm environment of Rusirani village. Although the road here is a bit tough, but we really enjoy our trip there."
Rusirani_Village,msydes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Absolutely incredible - can't recommend it highly enough,"The village tour was honestly the best experience my wife and I had the entire time we were in India. The people were lovely, showing us their amazing village and sharing some excellent food.I truly wish I have a chance to return in a few years. The people were kind, the sights were incredible, and the village was fascinating. 10/10"
Rusirani_Village,Heiko S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Solo,Amazing Experience - the real India!,"I did read about the Rusirani Village on Tripadvisor and actually this was the main thing I wanted to see when travelling around Jaipur. A big thank you to Girdhari, who did support with translation in the village and did lead me around. I enjoyed especially the time in the school (to interact and play with the children there), as well as the time we spent at a local family's place. It was a wonderful and unique experience for me. Can definately recommend."
Rusirani_Village,klorigan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Couples,Awesome experience with the kids!,"On the way from Agra to Jaipur, we stopped about 2/3rds of the way to go on this village tour - a small, cooperatively-run set of communities in the hills. They said that the don't have many families, so especially appreciated seeing us with our 11 and 13 year old sons. Part of the tour fee sponsors girls continuing their schooling past 8th grade, a no-brainer for this US teacher. The 30 min jeep ride from the junction point is where the adventure begins (and helps explain why the villagers don't easily/frequently leave). Guests' arrival is always a surprise to a particular community within the larger village bc the organizer, who grew up there, wants it to be a normal day, with whatever happens to be going on. We had some time to chat, asking one another about our daily lives (mostly with the men and kids bc the women were cooking a meal for us). Then we got to watch the chapati-making (and attempt to roll out some ourselves -- we failed and laughed a lot in the process). Our sons connected first with the five year old local kids by sharing names, goofy faces and playing hand clapping games. It broke the timidity we were all experiencing. I highly recommend this trip as a way to connect with people outside of the cities. "
Rusirani_Village,drl_smit-may,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Family,Traveling 2000 years back into history,If you really want to do something special while visiting Jaipur this is a must. You need all day in order to get there over back country roads as well as have enough time to interact with the village people. There is a fabulous 2000-year-old temple in the village and the people are wonderful. They have been living the same way without electricity or running water for more than one thousand years. They took us in their homes and treated us like family.we had a wonderful opportunity at lunch to interact with all of the family members. I was even able to smoke a hookah with homemade tobacco.The translator assured that all our questions were answered. It was a truly enriching experience. One of our best cultural experiences in India.an absolute must for someone interested the real India.
Rusirani_Village,SandraRodriguesBR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,The Best of Jaipur,"Tired of busy Jaipur with the horns, the traffic jams, the pushing sellers and old forts? Treat yourself with a day to a rural visit and experience the true hospitality of the people of Rusirani village. Yes you can go by yourself and save a couple of bucks, but no, it will by far not be as rich as it can be. I strongly suggest you contact two social entrepreneurs from the region and let them take you by the hand and help the process of interaction in the local tribal language and their good English. While these youngsters make a living out of it, they do have this commitment of seeing to it the community benefit. One visit a day, with maximum people, to preserve the authenticity and  avoid disturbing the daily life too much. Their focal point is girls education, one of the selection criteria of your host family.They will take you for a full day (or more) and will give you that kind of memory that every time you think about it provokes this peaceful inward smile for the rest of your life. See this beautiful valley with an ancient temple and archaeological sites, irrigated wheat, mustard, or maize. Smell it, listen to the sounds. Feel the genuine and unconditional joy of the children, the diminishing shyness of the women and hesitant curiosity of the village elders. Do bring some photos on your phone or tablet so you can share about your family and your land if asked by the villagers. Special care is taken to assure food is safe so no Delhi Belly to be expected. Treat yourself to this experience after visiting city after city. You will love it, your teenage children will love it. And bring some additional money as in the end it will be hard to resist to donate something extra to this community. You can contact Baghirath or Girdhari by phone +919784541515 or rusirani.village@gmail.com"
Rusirani_Village,rakeDelhi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,traditional Village to be seen,"Situated in between Agra & Jaipur a village expressing the real traditional India,the school ,the small market ,i hope the Govt. gives it some extra attention and certainly can be a great spot for all"
Rusirani_Village,Hilda A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2014 • Solo,A must! - Warm welcome with real village hospitality,"I read about the village on Tripadvisor and decided to check it out by myself, since I wanted to have a more authentic experience watching life in the countryside of India.  I can say that I am very grateful I did!  Being a lone woman traveler, I was always worried about my safety, but as soon as I got picked up at my guest house in Jaipur, I could see that I was in good hands.  The driver/guide, Ghirdari was extremely courteous, respectful and friendly, and had a lot of information to share.  We had a nice chat during the 2-3 hour drive up in the hills, and he kindly stopped at interesting places, which allowed me to take wonderful pictures.  The village itself was sparsely populated and very basic, yet refreshing to see after all the hustle and bustle in Jaipur, and the villagers were quite interested to talk and socialize with their new visitor.  Communication was a little difficult at times, but Ghirdari helped out translating, and even without his help, it was not very hard to get a point across.  He showed me around one family's household and surrounding areas of the village, including a temple and some ruins.  Some hired workers with heavy machinery were trying to bore a new well for the village when I arrived, unfortunately without success that day.  After a good home-made meal at one of the families' homes with THE BEST sweet mawa (milk solids) I have ever tasted, I went for a walk with the village women through the fields, and ended up at a larger gathering at the local school. Even though these people had just met me and we were not able to speak a common language, they were quick to invite me to sit down and share their food once again. I found their hospitality quite warm and pleasant.  After the visit, Ghirdari was ready to drop me back in Jaipur late that afternoon, and went out of his way to drive me to the local market when I told him I was looking forward to see it (unfortunately, it was already closed, but I appreciated his efforts), and to help me buy a replacement for my broken cell phone.  I arrived safely in Jaipur that evening.  All in all, I would say if you are looking to see something different and REAL, how other people live day by day in a remote place, go ahead and visit this village.  Do not go if you are looking to have a touristy experience or expect the people to do something special for you (dance, presentation, etc.).  This is just for you to get a glimpse of rural life in this part of the world.  I was particularly glad to see that the organizers (who are members of the village themselves) did not seek to commercialize the village experience, and tried to keep it as authentic as it gets, the goal being to collect all the earnings towards a local fund to improve education of the village's young girls. A good cause indeed!Tips: Wear a hat and sunscreen if you visit during spring/summer. Bring your own toilet paper/hand sanitizer as well, as there are no western toilet facilities. If you wish to bring something for the villagers, do not give clothes or toys, or the like, as the organizers do not wish to create material expectations in the villagers/families from every visitor they have (which I found to be great).  If you must, take school supplies or books that can go to the school and be shared by all the children."
Rusirani_Village,WorldWidePlayer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Friends,Interesting Village Life,"I've traveled to several villages in my life, but I found this Village to be very organized! By my experiences, this means it is becoming commercialized. By all means, as of now, this is still a meaningful Village to experience. A few things that I found out: (1) I thought it was no communication in the mountains (Found Mr. Bhagirath using his phone frequently) (2) The guide (Bhagirath) is a well educated young man, but he is lying about being from this Village. He has his Business Degree and is making money from these tours... Don't get me wrong, he has it well organized, but why lie? Mr. Bhagirath suggests to not leave money in the Village, however, we did! We gave it to the family that cooked for us, it's only right. We gave them the food and they had no idea what it was (US Money), then I quickly let them know the Rupree currency amount. I spoke with Mr. Bhagirath about why not telling visitors that he isn't from there, but declined comment. Enough about Mr. Bhagirath, the Village is a must if you are looking for a Village that is kind of cut off from the conventional Indian Societies. The whole has a lot of Peacocks and Black Faced Monkeys to see along with historical monuments! The kids and families are fantastic! Very nice and inquisitive.

I'm sure they'll love it and you'll make a difference in the life of them.:DIn case you want to know more information visit the blog of Rusirani:http://rusiranivillage.wordpress.com/"
Rusirani_Village,Jackie C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Solo,"A wonderful ""must do"" experience of village life","One of the highlights of my trip to India was spending time at Rusirani. I was not sure to go, but I'm really glad I did. The village is around 2.5 hours from Jaipur on the way to Agra, and has a challenging road up and over the hills. My guide, Giri, picked me up in Jaipur in a jeep. He and some colleagues have started a NGO to facilitate local kids going to school, which is where the money raised from village visits goes. We went to have chai with a family who were warm, welcoming and curious about me, as I was about them. We looked around the village, which is more like small family groups spaced around the fields. There was a lovely old temple and some other fascinating ruins and lots of wild peacocks. I had a delicious lunch with the family, and we had great fun taking photos of each other. I was staying overnight, I saw where people usually stay, in large tents next to a wetland. There were toilet facilities there. Permits are needed for foreigners to stay there, but the people needed to write them couldn't be found so rather than stay there without a permit, we drove to another family in a different village, who had been asking Giri to have visitors come to stay. It was the first time a guest had spent the night with a family. It may be a challenge for some - no toilets, the light is on in the room all night (!! In case the children get up apparently), and I was woken at 6.00am to get up with the family routine. I didn't get a lot of sleep, but it really didn't matter. The children of the house were very surprised to see a foreigner in their bedroom (we all shared a room) as I had arrived after they had already gone to bed. In the morning we huddled around a fire outside to keep warm, and the mother of the house made lots of chai for all the visitors who came to meet me. Breakfast was millet chapattis with homemade buffalo yogurt with a mix of chilli and garlic in it, absolutely delicious and something I'll try to make at home. Afterwards I visited a couple of other homes, and looked at the site where they want to build a school, walking around with lots of villagers. It really was a special, unique time with lovely warm people, and a chance to cross the cultural barriers. If you have time, do stay overnight. I did some other village visits during my stay in Rajasthan, but these were short and lacked the element of a warm cultural exchange experience that my visit to Rusirani was. Give it a go, you wont be disappointed."
Rusirani_Village,EmmaGrew83,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Couples,A life changing day,"I can't put into words how incredible the day spent at Rusirani village was. The drive from Jaipur took just under 3 hours but half way there we changed from an AC taxi to an SUV. On route, we stopped at local baths and temple. The journey was bumpy towards the end as you climb through the hills but the views were incredible.Upon arrival at the village we were welcomed with traditional offerings and a lovely, refreshing drink. The villagers ask questions and are so welcoming. The children and adults were fascinated by my iPad and taking photos and videos of themselves. Whilst they don't speak English, you will be amazed at how much you can communicate with body language. Gidhari, the tour operator translates questions and answers as well as keeps you in the mix of the political discussions going on (we visited during election time!). We were well looked after, enjoying a delicious lunch and dinner and mineral water is provided (food is also prepared for guests using mineral water). Lack of toilet facilities are not a problem- there is plenty of space behind bushes to relieve yourself!!We were fortunate to visit the village temple, an extremely old temple and ruins. We also took a 30 minute drive the ought he village to a magnificent fort. The views on this cliff top, abandoned fort were breathtaking (as long as you have a head for heights!)Gidhari told us that he hopes to develop the opportunities for visitors to spend longer at Rusirani, volunteering their services, so this might be worth considering.This truly was a highlight of our travels in India. I view my materialistic life somewhat differently now and thank the people of Rusirani for reminding me what happiness is."
Rusirani_Village,ibay8103,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Family,Hidden Gem,"Rusirani village is not well marked in the map but I think it is located at north east of Jaipur, Rajasthan where we (me and wife) stayed in.  It takes ~3 hour driving each way, but stops at few interesting places like old temple, local market, etc. which make trip feel a lot shorter than it actually takes.Rusirani village is not that far from near bigger villages as I thought but still there is no running water, electricity nor bathrooms.  Few families are grouped together to form sub-villages.  Village people are from infants to old men like any other societies, even though women are more easily seen.They share kitchen, cattle shed, and the court yard as a main gathering place.  Basically they work together, eat together, share happiness and sorrow together.  When you see them through their eyes, you would feel that they have never seen outside of world before.  They are very curious of you as you are to them.  As I find them very fascinated in their lives, they also have many questions to ask about us.  I can not forget their face expressions about curiosities.  I can even feel the pureness through their eyes.You may have to prepare to spend long hours on the road and just few hours in the village.  Activities are quite limited though, which include sightseeing on nearby ruins (awesome!), dancing with local if you wish and having a lunch.  Nothing much, however, you will have interactions with their people.  They do not speak English, nor we speak their language, but we spent hours of communicating with our bodies and souls.  We gave them something we had as a gift, in return I received the beautiful turban and thread bracelets, which signify friendship.  I respected the way they live and they did the same way to us.  This was a truly amazing experience.I also have to note that this is not just typical business oriented tour as you may find all over the India.  Girdhari, the tour operator, is actually from Rusirani village himself and also a member of NGO.  He is thriving to help and improve educations for the village, specially for the children.  If you would like to seek Disneyland like amusement, then forget this experiences.  If your heart is set on appreciating their cultures and helping to preserve their thousands old heritage, then you are right on.I appreciate Gerdhari for his dedication to the village in heart."
Rusirani_Village,beckywager,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Family,India showcased,I have been to so many places in india showcasing the culture but nothing as vibrant or pleasing as this. the kids are so very sweet and so are the adults who want to show you their little village
Rusirani_Village,DarinRodrq,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Couples,Reflects Indian Tradition,"Rusirani is a beautiful village, which is located in the heart of Rajasthan. I visited this village a year ago. I was surprised by the warm welcome with a song and dance. The beat of Drums will surely make everyone to dance. Children in the village are very playful. It was full of green crops all around us. The people of the village were very friendly and treated me as a guest. I visited many temples and monuments in the village. The food was very delicious. I can feel the love of the people. I recommend everyone to visit this village to know the unique culture of village."
Rusirani_Village,Chris10023,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013,My amazing 3 days - a different kind of life,"Last year I visited Rusirani village for a day and absolutely loved it. Back in India again this year, I decided to stay in the village for a few days. This time I travelled there directly from Agra, rather than via the Pink City as I had seen enough forts etc. on my previous trip and was anxious to get back to village life.IBhagirath picked me up in the jeep and it was great to see him again. He is an excellent guide and goes out of his way to build a communication and rapport between the guests and the villagers. We had lunch with a family whilst Bhagirath explained various options and experiences open to me during my stay. I decided to make myself useful by painting a classroom in the only primary school in the village (great fun) and to spend time making door to door visits interacting with the villagers. I also learned to make and cook rotis over an open fire. The village is self governing and I found it  a really wonderful and educational experience to be able to converse (through Bhagirath) with such friendly and welcoming people whose lives are so different to mine. I highly recommend Rusirani to anyone who wants to see and be in the middle of real Indian village life, which I feel must be pretty much the same today as it was hundreds of years ago.   I loved the food and whilst the facilities are basic, I found them to be totally adequate. If you haven't guessed by now, I absolutely had the best time and highly recommend a visit!!"

Rusirani_Village,Tansy44,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2013 • Friends,Our best cultural experience in India,"This was an extremely special day for us both. It was a beautiful insight into a real living Rajasthani village community. Bhagirath was the perfect guide, he was very thoughtful and attentive and spoke fantastic English. The trip showed us a different side to India and one we hadn't seen at all on our trip and didn't see  after! The village community is almost entirely self sufficient, growing all their crops and looking after their livestock. It is beautifully situated deep in the Rajasthani countryside. The village elders spoke with us and welcomed us and at the end gave us gifts of Saris and jewellery! They also provided wonderful mint tea and a traditional lunch. The village children were extremely friendly and playful and we ended up singing and dancing with them in the fields! We had such a great day and I would recommend this trip to anyone who wants a unique cultural experience while in Rajasthan. Bhagirath was fantastic and provided a very interesting insight into his culture and village life while also talking of the contrast of him being a university educated man living there. Altogether a fantastic day and one I would love to repeat! xxx"
Rusirani_Village,Rachael C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 • Couples,"Incredible experience,a highlight of our trip","We had a very special day at Rusirani village, which was incredibly illuminating and showed us a completely different side to India.  The villagers completely welcomed us into their community, cooked us fantastic homegrown food, gave us fresh chai and local mint drinks and talked with us and shared their community with us.  We were fortunate to see some of the fantastic local temples.  It was fascinating to spend time in such a rural community.  It was an amazing experience to be able to sing and dance with the villagers and we were truly humbled by their kindness.  Many thanks for a wonderful day.  I will email my photos to you soon."
Rusirani_Village,K0l0,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2013 • Friends,Amazing cultural experience with villagers,"Completely different experience from other places. An old and hidden village near Abhaneri Stepwell. Everything is managed by local villagers in a genuine Indian way. Very clean, far from crowd but little far from Jaipur. I was picked up in a local village jeep from my hotel in Jaipur and drop back as well. Dancing with local women, organic food with amazing unique taste, community discussion with villagers everything was such a fantastic experience to feel the past like hundreds of years ago. Be careful there isn't any toilet available.  Another advice -do it with Abhaneri Stepell and book with villagers  they will be available, as well as waiting for you."
Rusirani_Village,Crutzen902,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Friends,Fantastic Experience,Book with local villagers for the transport and food. If you still want to make it more cheaper go in a group. Be ready for the bad road rest all would be unforgettable experience. Go to see historical buildings (ruined) and to experience Indian culture. You will cook and eat with villagers and they will drop you back to Jaipur in their Jeep.

Rusirani_Village,Peter383,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Friends,Responsible tourism,"I like talking and taking pictures. Rusarani village is good for both. I reached there with three other people. After lunch, Bhagirath ask if we could talk on child marriage to the villagers. We all became agree with little hesitation. We were taken to house after house and we had a good fun. It was like volunteering in the village for awareness. Bhagirath is a very good translator. My stomach was already full as we were offered chai  everywhere. We enjoyed cooking in the evening and left for market. I saw the village culture by participating in the discussion with villagers about child marriage… and offcourse my card was full with pictures at the end. A good cultural experience as well as I felt like a responsible tourist …at least for a day."
Rusirani_Village,loverboy31,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2012 • Family,Don't miss this indian village,This local village near Jaipur is not to miss. Villagers in the village offer a very good cultural experience. I went there with my friends. A young man gave us choice to chose a family. We were offered chai there. One of the girl in the family speaks good English and translated our discussion with villagers very well. The family took us to the local village where we enjoyed rural shopping ( incredible cheap!) We came back and had delicious lunch. After lunch we were taken for a tour to the village. It was like a walk to hundreds of year back in the past. When we came back to the family they organised dancing on local songs. Women were singing and we were offered to dance ..... hard job for me but one of us did enjoyed it a lot. We left after dinner with an unforgettable experience.ye review
Rusirani_Village,utsavdixit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Friends,"Utopian village!! ""a must visit""","Indian village life is a different world- different to the Indian towns and cities where visitors will spend most of their time in India, and different to village life outside of India Come and experience the village we visit- Rusirani- full of lovely, modest and proud people. And enjoy meal with local villagers and beautiful countryside at the same time"
Rusirani_Village,kd0123,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Friends,Fantastic Experience,"The village and its atmosphere itself is very amazing. People living here are friendly, always ready to help and guide in the most possible way. Local market here also has some unique collection of art work."
Rusirani_Village,pirates_m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Friends,Interesting neighbourhood near Jaipur,The village is neither old nor new but villagers are amazing. We saw many surprising things like villagers still use little hand grinder to make flour out of wheat.
Rusirani_Village,momotdelho,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Friends,unique !,"Certainly a place to visit. You may see a village during safari and you can interact a little with them. But in Rusirani village you become a part of the village for a day. You cook, dance, visit local market and you have many interesting discussion with villagers about what you see there. A few young villagers speak little English. We were a group of eleven backpackers who visited the village. The interesting part of our visit is to see a house in the village. The big house has almost a hundred rooms and eight families live there."
Rusirani_Village,caddy325,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2012 • Friends,Try it out! It’s different,A local village near Jaipur not to miss if you like to see the colours of India. We had a good time in the village. One of the girl knew little English which was quite helpful. We also went to her neighbours and had a fun time there. The local market was really cheap and the shopkeepers were very good (not like Jaipur. In Jaipur you always have to be careful about the price and material both) You can eat lunch with a local family if you want and I would suggest you to d;o it would be a fun.
