However, we visited again later in the day and were surprised and delighted to discover that the place was nearly empty.  We quickly took advantage of our good fortunes by taking some amazing photos.  And we absolutely loved the stunning garden adjacent to the Hall of Mirrors.

Sheesh_Mahal_Hall_of_Mirrors-Amer,Ralph Wilhelm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"One of a kind; truly spectacular, must make time for this","The Sheesh Mahal in the Amber Fort Palace is worthy of being called out by itself; totally unique and special.  This Hall of Mirrors was constructed on its own inside the Amber Fort Palace and stands as a memory that you will always have.  A guide is essential here to understand the construction.  But note that the small mirrors attached to walls and ceilings throughout the structure allow for unique ""magnification"" and multiple light and reflected images to be reproduced and highlighted throughout the structure.  Hard to imaging the complexity of the methods used to construct this structure.  Note that this Hall was constructed/begin in the 1500s and was completed in the 1700s."

Beautifully ornate and gives fantastic feeling of space . This is probably the best ‘room’ in Jaipur’s tourist sites.

Hire a guide who can show you how the light was reflected by the mirrors and appear as stars."
Sheesh_Mahal_Hall_of_Mirrors-Amer,S B Khare,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,A magnificent architecture,It is situated inside the Amer Palace. By far it is the most eyecatching buildng in the palace. The building these days can be seen only from outside from a distance as it is now surrounded by iron railing. It is covered with glass pieces and preceous stones. The reflection of light is what makes it so enchanting. There are paintings on the wall and roof which have survived the time. The Rajsthan Government has maintained it well.
