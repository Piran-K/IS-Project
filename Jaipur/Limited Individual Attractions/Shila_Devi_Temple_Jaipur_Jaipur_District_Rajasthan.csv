Shila_Devi_Temple,KLE2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,The Silver Doored  temple in the Amber Fort,"On the right side of the main entrance to Amber Fort is the Shila Devi Temple with its ornately carved silver doors.  Open only to worshipers on the day of our visit, we were not able to view the interior with its silver oillamps, pillars carved to look like banana trees and the famous stone image of the goddess Kali."

Shila_Devi_Temple,vivek k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Couples,Must know the history before u visit this place,"A great temple to explore. It is inside amber fort and u dont hav to pay anything to see this. Beware of the monkeys as u go up towards the temple door. And u hav to leave all your leather stuff outside the door, like shoes, belt, wallet etc. we went inside around 5pm and were lucky to see the evening ""aarti"".. U will be amazed when u see the entry doors of the temple made of silver and many more things inside all silver...like those big drums"
Shila_Devi_Temple,KARAN AHLUWALIA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Solo,Temple with immense historical value,"The temple can be very very crowded during festive periods like Navaratri. However during non-festive periods, the visits are very peaceful and you can enjoy the holiness and spirituality of the place. The temple was the private temple of the Jaipur royal family. It is inside the Amber fort premises only and to visit it you don't require a ticket (ticket would be required for seeing the fort's other areas though). The temple is at a height and you would need to climb some stairs. You would need to leave outside the temple premises any items made of leather (including your belt), cameras and shoes (luckily they allowed wallets). It can become a problem for someone who is visiting alone (like I was) but the guard at the door promised to look after my belongings for a small fee. If you have interest in history and religion the temple is a must visit."
Shila_Devi_Temple,bizbull,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2013 • Family,Goddess in full Avataar,"Shila Devi (Goddess) Temple is right in there in Amer Fort Complex. A visit to the temple just cannot be avoided specially if you plan to visit Amer Fort (and why would n't you go there if you are on leisure in Jaipur). Goddess - a form of 'Kali' is one of the nine incarnations of the supreme Mother.  My Guide ""Bunty"" told us that this temple still belongs to the Royal family of Jaipur - not sure whether that is true but temple inspires a myriad of feelings. He also shared that this is a temple where a goat is still sacrificed around 4:00 AM every morning after which goat meat is distributed amongst priests and some portion is sent out to the royal family. Again, I cannot vouch for the same; could just be myth. At the entrance, I confess, I noticed some foreign tourists, in a bit ""not sure whether to go in"" mood but believe me whether you are a local citizen or other wise, step-in to a wonderful view of the goddess who is claimed to have trampled upon the Lord Shiva in fury & rage. As soon as you sttep in, a lot of history and character of the place almost seizes you. Remember, photography may not be allowed. Preferably try to have your head, legs and arms covered. Goddess' statue is divine; temple complex has statues of other Hindu gods as well including Ganesha. It almost feels like a dip in Ganges in Haridwar or Varanasi; believe me or try out yourself.
