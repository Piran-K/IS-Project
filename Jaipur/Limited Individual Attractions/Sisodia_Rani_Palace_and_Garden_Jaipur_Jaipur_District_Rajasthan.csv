Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Nandini,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Interesting,"Tucked away, we decided to go here . The staff at the counter were very cordial and we were informed that till 31st October, it is on a 505 discount of entry tickets. On entering the garden, we thoroughly enjoed ourselves but it hardly takes much time to see the multi layered garden. What we found more interesting is on coming out of the garden, on the walls opposite to it, the paintings are still visible and given the fact, that there were on time tested palace walls, it mage it more special."

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Leslie L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Nice gardens," I visited Sisodia Rani Palace and Gardens during my day tour of Jaipur City with Royal Majestic Tours and an excellent guide, Mukesh who provided an excellent account of the history of the Rani Garden. The garden was lovely, but not very large with lots of frangipanni trees exuding a beautiful fragrance."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,jazsacher,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,beautiful garden,"I enjoyed my visit to the Sisodia Rani Palace and Garden.  There was no one here when we visited in the afternoon and was ideal for taking a nice stroll, enjoying the sites, and taking scenic photos.  However, the garden and palace seemed a bit generic and ordinary for me compared to the ones we had already visited.  I don't mean to detract from the review but there were so many others in Delhi and Jaipur that were simply 'out of this world' that I need to rate this place as ordinary compared to the others."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,sanjeevkdass,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Beautiful ,The Sisodiya Rani garden depicts the kind of love the king has for his queen. He built this garden for her exclusively and it’s been made beautifully. The garden is in levels and I loved it. Do visit once.

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,JillyKent,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Green and peaceful garden,"We visited this garden as we are keen gardeners. The garden is a multi - tiered paradise garden , very green and peaceful. We were disappointed that the fountains were not working and there was no water in the channels so it missed the effect of being a true Paradise garden. Nice change after the noise of Jaipur."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Aveek B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Bit on the outskirts of Jaipur but not very far and wonderful place,The Sisodia Garden is very well maintained and is on the city outskirts. One might get Ola from the garden post visit or need to rely on local transport like Auto. Its not in the itinerary for most travelers but the garden is well maintained and is a stepped garden. Its surrounded by hills all over and its serenity is the best feature.
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Tish A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018,Beautiful Garden and Palace,Its a beautifully maintained place. Not crowded as it has an entry ticket and few tourists are aware of this beauty.Its a stepped garden with a palace sorrounded by mountains. Must visit.
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,M9000,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Not worth the entrance fee nor the time,"The place is about 10km away from the Jaipur city center and we book a taxi via Ola to get there. The entrance fee for foreigners is 200INR which I thought was way overpriced for what it was. The palace which is overlooking the garden was under renovation (as of Feb 2019) and thus not accessible The garden were nice but nothing spectacular at least not in winter. The ""canals/fountains"" did not contain water - not sure if that is season dependent or not. In the evening there should be a fountain show which we had to complain (they said there were not enough people to do the show) in order to see it. The ""fountain show"" was also underwhelming. To see the gardens and pictures we took like 20min. The place is quite far away from any other attractions in Jaipur. Considering the location/entrance fee and the fact there is really not much to see I would say it is not worth the visit."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Jccj49,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Lovely quiet Oasis,"What a pleasant surprise to find this small garden hidden away.  It was so quiet and peaceful, the toilets and grounds were very well kept.  Unfortunately as in most places we visited the fountains were not working.  But I would recommend a visit."

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Kishanu Karmakar,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,worst because of officers behavior,"I heard about place and decided to go there, after reaching the address one of officer said me camera is not allowed hence other regular visitor bringing camera as they feel like home. place would be good, because i did not enter just because of their officers who sited on ticket counter shop. never thought about this kind of worst services i got in jaipur."

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,vmtrek_travel,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Passable,"Rupees 50 as entry was unjustified as access to the main palace was restricted due to renovation. Even the fountains in the garden were switched off.The garden was decently maintained but more greenery than colourful flowers.On return from Galtaji temple we spared sometime to drop in. Surely, it could have been avoided."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,ddevarshi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,Not essential but picturesque,"This is not extra ordinary garden and if you are hard pressed you can skip this garden. However, if you have included Galta temple in your itenarary then you can see this Garden by sparing 10 minutes on your route. This time I did not find a little change. The palace was being renovated, doors were being painted and their wire gauge, which did not allow view of inside has been replaced with Glass panes. I am not sure whether the palace will be thrown open to public or not? I have found it closed on my earlier visits. Entry ticket is Rs 50 for Indians which is a little expensive for this small Garden which has nothing unusual to offer."

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,travelpassion,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Clean and peaceful,"The gardens are very well kept and very clean, which was not the case for many of the places we visited; ironically it was the only place we saw a rat during our 11-day trip in Northern India and the place I least expected it! We had the place to ourselves when we visited and the clean contrast compared to the ""Monkey Palace"" that we had just come from was marked! Worth a visit."

Drive to this place is also quite scenic . Would totally recommend it if you are going to jaipur . If you are not too late in evening then you can probably go to galta ji temple which is on the same road ahead . There is police and security everywhere so security isn’t much of a problem . You can go there with a book or to spend some good time to relax .

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,traceyquick,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Peaceful and green,This is a beautiful garden that provides some respite from the crowds of Jaipur. I walked around taking in the lovely well cared for gardens filled with chipmunks and birds and enjoyed its simplicity. The women who are maintaining the gardens are doing a fabulous job. Although the fountains and watercourses were not in operation I was able to imagine what it was like in the past. Take a visit here it is a lovely place. Shame the restaurant is no longer operating because a cup of masala chai or  coffee in the gardens would have been perfect.

The garden is beautifully maintained and one will feel relaxed and fresh just to roam in it. The view of majestic mountains adds sparks to it. The garden has beautiful plants and trees and greenery all round. After roaming to forts and museums we found the place very relaxing and calm.

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,abunasar786,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Great cool ambiance,This is one place away from the eyes of tourists. We thought of skipping it initially. Who wants to visit a garden. Then we bought the composite Jaipur ticket at Hawa Mahal. We had paid for Sisodia garden. And what a good choice. We took an auto rickshaw from Albert museum. We let our car be in parking. Its at a strange place. On the road to Agra. Very few visitors. The ticket is Rs 50 therefore no lovebirds. Its actually a mahal. The backdrop is aravali hills. Just beautiful. Architecture is mughal like. Very little building and lots of garden. Gardens at three levels. You need to visit to absorb. Must visit.

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Rahul P Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Family,Nice and peaceful Garden,"The royal garden of Sisodia Rani Ka Bagh is 10 km away from the Jaipur city and lies on Jaipur-Agra highway. It was built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh in 1728 and dedicated to his lovely second wife Sisodia. Elements like the beautiful wall paintings of Radha-Krishna love story further beautify the garden. The paintings on the wall and the narrative details represent the eternal love. The garden is abundant in flowerbeds, foliage, beautiful water fountains, pavilions, galleries, iridescent water channels and murals making it all the more appealing. History says that the garden used as an ideal getaway for the Queen. This multi-tiered bagh that has been breathing life to the desert soil of Jaipur is a wonderful picnic spot. you can walk in the gardens overlooking the Aravalli hills in the background. Many temples nearby. The place is not very touristy and this makes it an excellent choice to escape hustle bustle of city and enjoy some peace. Place is Ideal for a picnic or just to spend time. The garden is beautiful, very well maintained.•  Visiting Hours – 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM •  Entrance Fee – Rs. 25 (Indian)/ Rs. 50 (Foreigner)"

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,welcomeumesh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,Good garden but no activities,"I really felt cheated when I had to pay Rs. 50 as entry fee per person in the name of this garden. Only good thing is view of mountain from garden. The garden was clean. There were no specific variety of flowers and plants. No boating, no fountain kind of activities at all. There is provision for fountain. An average place only for locals."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,SHDD,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Couples,lovely garden,"We visited this garden on our way back from the Galta. This place consists of   tiered multi levelled gardens with fountains, water courses and painted pavilions. This palace garden derives its name , Sisodia Rani Palace  and  garden from the queen (rani ) of whom it was built, Its a nice quiet place to relax, as we found  many young couples hanging around there. It a pity when we were there  renovations were taking place and the fountains where not in operation. Its a good place to visit if you have the time in Jaipur. It has good architecture as well."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,drnaveenbp,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,The Love This Garden In Jaipur!!!!,"Many Package tours do not take you here.

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Amanvari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,Must visit this secret gem,"We really enjoyed the tranquility and bliss of being here. Virtually no other visitors make it a wonderful way to see beautiful architecture and gardens.Using mainly Plumerias as sculptural elements in this formal Mughal styled ( char bagh) garden gives a great formal tropical feel. In the mid afternoon when we visited the fragrance was intense, really showing how gardens are used as oases of escape from the arid geography and heat that is the rest of Rajasthan."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Eldestein,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,A garden fit for maharajas,"This elegantly designed garden is a beautiful place to be, in case you are traveling in that direction.It is maintained very well and is pristine clean with the guards keeping a hawk eye for anyone playing mischief.

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,ddevarshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Couples,A well maintained garden from period of maharajas,"Though it is not a huge garden like Vrindawan Gardens but it is located in a very nice place and is very well maintained. There is not a great variety of plants. Mostly Cycas, Lantana, Thuja, Wild Date, Plumeria, a variety of Tabernemontana with small leaves (T. orientalis?) have been planted but the plants and lawn was in very good condition when we visited here. I believe the species of Cycas here is Cycas revoluta (King sago). I observed only female reproductive structures and seeds in many plants but male cone in none! Both species of Frangipani i.e. Plumeria rubra and P. obtusa can be seen here. There were fountains and light but were not operating when we visited here. The places is also rented for holding banquets. There are toilets available here but no facility of snacks or food available inside. There is a shop near entrance gate that sells basic eatables like biscuits. There is entry ticket of Rs 50 for Indians and 200 for foreigners which is slightly higher side. Thankfully there is no charge for camera. It is on way to Galta temple so you can visit this place by sparing 15 minutes. It is on route of Agra too but to touch this place while going to Agra you need to avoid the new long tunnel that has been built recently and take the old route of 'Ghat ki Guni' which in itself is a road worth seeing."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,curlylynn,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Couples,Would not recommend,"Very average gardens that could be a lot better. All water fountains and canals were empty of water and very sad looking. It would be far prettier if these were functioning.

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Zexi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014,A nice quiet garden to end a crazy day in Jaipur,"After weeks of travelling India, my girlfriend and I found that at some point each day it was great to just go to a garden and relax.  It got us away from people and noise and the general craziness of India.This garden was typical of many, built on a hillside it had several levels.  Some places to sit and some art work could be found at each level as well as lots of flowers and trees and the reflecting pools.Maybe not the best kept, but it suited us great as we were the only ones so we could spend quiet time watching the birds, squirrels and just enjoying some peace and quiet to end a busy day in Jaipur.Make sure you have travel to and from as we saw at least one tourist get dropped off by a taxi and get stuck there because the taxi took off when he went inside."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,SAJIDNOW,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014,Majestic Garden and a Palace,Sisodia Rani Palace and Garden is a few kilometers away from the hustle bustle of the Jaipur city and that what makes it so splendid.  Its quiteness and calmness lingers on the mind. The palace has a beautiful three-storeyed structure and is a novel in itself.
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Devesh G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Family,A neglected Palace worth a visit,"Sisodia Rani Palace is in depleting condition with almost zero maintenance. However, this has been the residence of Sisodia Rani and therefore has immense nostalgia attached. The furniture mostly is getting worn out due to unkept maintenance. I have visited this palace as a teenager way back in 1983 when it was in good condition. I am therefore pained to see the poor maintenance of the palace now.The surrounding garden is beautifully maintained. The outside of the palace walls transforms one to a different pleasure altogether from the depleting condition of the palace.I have visited Sisodia Rani Palace and Garden many times with family, friends and visitors. Without an exception everyone likes the garden and outside of palace walls but feels so sorry for the palace itself considering that other properties in Jaipur are well maintained."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,ND1910,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014,A beautiful combination of a Palace and garden,"The name of the garden is derived from Sisodiya rani(queen) for whom it was built. It is situated couple of kms away from the city on Jaipur Agra highway.This place consists of tiered multi layered gardens with fountains, watercourses and painted pavilions. A double storey palace occupies the top terrace of the garden. The palace has many galleries, pavilions and beautiful murals depicting scenes from the life of lord Krishna."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Alex M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Solo,"Lovely little garden, away from the bustle of Jaipur","This is a lovely little garden, east of Jaipur. It's pretty small but when combined with the nearby Vidyadhar garden, it'd easy to lose a couple of hours. Although I couldn't find the cafe, toilets were available, the grass well watered and everything looked very pretty. Sadly it is right next to a busy road, and as such there's the ubiquitous sounding of horns which breaks the spell a bit."

A calm and peaceful place to sit and enjoy the architecture. The gardens are big and beautiful. If you have spare time and don't know where to go, you can go here and enjoy a peaceful moment from the hustle and bustle."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,KLE2013,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,The country palace and gardens for a royal wife in the 18th century,"On the way back from Galta to Jaipur we passed this garden and made a brief stop.  Built by Sawai  Jai Singh II for his second wife so she could live away from the palace conflict with other wives, this terraced garden and two story country palace is now often the site for Indian films and wedding ceremonies.  The exterior walls are decorated with colorful murals and the gardens are nice, but not outstanding."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,GautamChakraborty,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,Sisodia Rani Garden - 31 Dec 2014,This is outside the city. We had some free time so thought to give this a visit. NOT WORTH. We expected some nice garden where kids could possibly play a bit. But it was not that. A very ordinary garden where arrangements were being made for 31st night party.
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,PNRao,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Family,Beautiful Garden,"Sisodia Rani Garden and Palace was built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in 1779. It is about 6 kilometres from Jaipur, located on NH11, Lal Dungri. It is a beautiful garden and is well maintained. It is not in the main tourist route but is really well worth a visit. It is on the way to Galtaji temple."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Mayur S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Couples,Good to the eyes,This formal terraced garden is 6 km from the city on the road to Agra.  The gardens are in front of Sisodia Rani Palace whose outer walls are decorated with murals depicting hunting scenes and the Krishna legend.  Open 8 am to 5 pm.  Entry fee Rs.10.  Worth the effort to get there.
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Ruth C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Couples,Confused,"Reading the other reviews it seems we missed something... a lot. Stopped by on the way to the Monkey temple, drawn by the beautifully painted walls on the roadside and the free entry on the Composite ticket.  However, inside it was a rather underwhelming poorly maintained garden with broken fountains.   Night time pictures look more impressive and maybe I'm doing it a disservice. "

The walls of palace wear the mesmerizing paintings of lord Krishna and his beloved Radha. The stunning galleries and pillars are clad with the pictures depicting love of Radha-Krishna. The garden gives the feeling of Mughal presence as it is made according to the traditional Charbagh or paradise garden style popular with the Mughals. Many hindi movies have been shot in this palace"

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,MountainloverKolkata,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,A great place to visit,"This is a great place to visit. The garden is beautifully maintained with lots of flowers in bloom. The ""chatris"" are exquisite. The place is very peaceful. When we went to the garden, we were the only tourist there.  We enjoyed the beauty and serenity of the place.We had bought a combined ticket for Jantar Mantar, City Palace, Albert Hall,Amer fort (I guess so, saw so many monuments), Sisodia Rani's garden and one more garden. The ticket is valid for 2 days."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Sasanf,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Couples,Serene but boring,"This place is not really on a tourist map. We certainly didn't see any other tourists there. In fact at about five pm, there were hardly anyone at all. It's a serene place. However it is sadly also kind of boring, there really isn't much there to do.Go there if you feel you have plenty of time or if you are looking for some peace."

Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Ajay Kala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Family,It's a Royal garden,"Park,garden, lawns are normally plain grounds with lot of greenery. This Bagh(garden) in 3 levels situated in a surrounding of small hills. Typical Jaipur architecture with big walled gates and covered from all sides with painting on walls gives a sense of celebrations. Security and privacy in walled city for womenfolk has always been the culture of Jaipur.It's a good sight seeing place but limited activities during the day for a tourist. The Sisodia Rani Bagh is best in night. Lighting makes it entirely a different place. Few big fat marriages have taken place in past and place is still a preference for exclusive parties and get togethers.It can accommodate 1000 people in four lawns.  Fountains in the passage gives you Royal treatment.Generally maintained lawns by govt. deptt gives a spirited  feel of Jaipur Royalty. After low ticketed entry you feel it should  have been  maintainted better. The constructed palace can't be visited being a heritage property but outer looks is reflection of good old days of tradition and culture of Jaipur Royal family."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,ChrisJ45,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Couples,Less known but truly beautiful,"The Sisodia Rani Garden, I felt, was a less visited but an extremely lovely location of the city. I may be wrong about the less visited part but there were no other visitors in the entire 30 minute period we were there. The gardens are a lovely multi tiered creation which are very well maintained. Makes for some lovely photo ops!"
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,murali8121,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Family,"Rani sisodia garden, Jaipur","Around ten km from the city centre it's a beautiful garden surprisingly well kept. With not many visitors, you can spend a very peaceful time strolling around watching peacocks and other birds. The terraced layout of the garden is nice. If all the fountains are working, it would be a real treat. Unfortunately, only a couple of them were working when we visited."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,Jaikishan D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Good place,"The Sisodia Rani Bagh is a little away from the main town. Though the name says garden, it is not that big. It is a small garden with a nice lawn and picturesque surrounding. I would have expected it to be better maintained knowing that there is a entry free for visiting this garden."
Sisodia_Rani_Palace_and_Garden,A K S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Best lawns in town,"This place has probably best lawns in town. Recently renovated, its terraced gardens and view of surrounding hills is unparalleled in the city. Very unique. Very quiet and calm. Must visit ! Do carry your own water and food as nothing is there in the vicinity."
