The positioning of the various constellations of the zodiac also needs some explanation!"

It’s smaller version works to 20 seconds. Other structures relate to the zodiac and point to the relevant constellations. One of the best surprises to date."
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,Andrew T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Incredible ,This is a real must if you visit Jaipur. The park is absolutely fascinating but I would recommend a guide as it’s really helpful to understand the multitude of astronomical/astrological devices

The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,Lv2Travel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Tips for visiting the observatory,"- Have a guide take you around and explain the importance of the different items to the Hindu culture.  Horoscope is very important, and you’ll get a much better experience than just reading the plaques.- Take water and a hat, as it is all outdoors.  - Go in the early daytime to avoid the afternoon heat.- You can also see the backside of the Palace of the Winds from this site."

If you are a photographer, you will love this place too"
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,ashrafazrol,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Overpriced open museum,"Don't get me wrong. The scientific aspect of the place is totally awe-inspiring. However, the price ticket of I think 1000-2000 rp is just too much. Not worth it for the space and actual scientific learning that could be done inside the vicinity."
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,Deblina B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Science lover must go.Guide must,"This place is at heart of the city, and you can cover hawa mahal, jantar mantar and city palace in one shot as those are nearby.Guides are available to cover these 3 places.This place is a symbol of Scientific  awareness of ancient Indian royals.

The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,cisco289,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,If You Like Astronomy and Astrology....!,"Our tour guide led us through this expansive astronomical and astrological site and described the many structures with their relation to the days, months, and years, i.e., it is an astronomical clock. Many structures are also labeled to fit the 12 zodiacs. The precision is so very impressive for people who had no hi tech equipment several hundred years ago!"
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,"Bromewood, flowers",5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Surprised,We visited because it was on the list of things to see. Pleasantly surprised by the precision of these instruments conceived in the late 1700’s. Best to hire a guide.
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,Sabbitan B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Hire a Guide ! ,This place needs a lot of explanation don’t miss it because it’s very interesting and the guides here are very knowledgeable. Hire a guide and let him leave you astounded with the knowledge the Indian ancestors had possessed 
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,TrevB56,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Really Interesting....,"..... if you are into astrology, science, astronomy or mathematics  or just cool things that are quite interesting when explained. You need a good guide to do this place justice and if it is sunny (which happens quite often :-)) then you can tell the time with the sun dials and check against your watch (adjusting for the local time difference caused by Indian Standard Time). If I have sent you to sleep already then this is probably not the place for you but if you are still awake then believe me some of these constructions are impressive when you consider some of them are over 300 years old and are more accurate than some watches I can mention."
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,RoamHere,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Amazing place,"To think that this was built in the early 1700’s is extraordinary and that this the 5th observatory built by Jai Singh II is remarkable. There’s a lot to see here but best to avoid midday if you can as there is little protection from the sun, but obvious reasons! But there is a cafe with a shaded area where you can have some refreshment."
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,RonM,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Fascinating,Amazing history of India. This place show how far advance ancient India was. I highly recommend this place and suggest you spend some time understanding the structures.

The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,pherbert1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,truly amazing,"this is one of the most fascinating places and the accuracy that these devices achieve is incredible, 3 seconds accuracy all year, the different measurements are fascinating and on a huge scale, well worth a visit"
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,Cous Cous J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,Great if you love or work in STEM,The Jaipur Astronomical Clock was recommended to by my Father who visited it 30 odd years ago and when my guide on a grouo tour suggested it as an optional activity I jumped at the chance. The sundials are acurate to within seconds and the guides explain the mathematics involved to covert time from local Jaipur time to standard time. There is also the clock or machine used by the vedic astrologers to calculate horoscopes and the actual horoscope sundials themselves. Each horoscope's sundial is based on meridiand of lattitude and also where constellations sit in the sky. The wonderful guides will explain it all to you and I think a guide is included in the small entrance fee. There is also the opportunity to meet with Astrologers to have your horoscope mapped and written if they are available which I missed as I visited too late in the day close to closing time. 
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,Geo G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Must have a to guide explain.,This is the Royal Astronomical Observatory.  Fascinating astronomical instruments from the 16th century.  Guides are available and I believe they are included as part of the entrance fee.
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,Sandy S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Fascinating!!,"We were blown away with the ideas and concepts that the ancients used re Maths and science. Well kept open air museum with a lot to see and learn from. History recorded, at its best!"
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,Annnyy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Friends,QUITE UNIQUE!,If you believe in Astrological science this would be a good place. Apart from the astrologers there is a beautiful museum you can visit in..
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,nrm77,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,Mystical,"I was taken here by my husbands cousins, as just because they said it is really good experience in Jaipur and that the vedic astrologers are really accurate. Well only time will tell whether it is or it isn’t, but as far as the experience goes, the astrologers were quite keen and quite expensive. Will only recommend if you have time and money to spare in life."
The_Vedic_Astrology_Experience,Kobus69,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Couples,So fascinating,"At first, we thought we can give this open air museum a miss because of the heat, but we are so glad we went.  It is amazing how the astrological clocks and ancient sundials were developed and used.  A real eye opener in terms of India's contribution to science."
