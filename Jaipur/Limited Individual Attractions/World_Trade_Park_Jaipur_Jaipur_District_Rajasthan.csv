World_Trade_Park,Anand D Nanavati,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Huge mall near Patrika Gate.,This is a huge mall with many shops including a section known as dubai bazaar on the top floor.  This has two sections.  We could only finish one section it is that huge a mall.For shopping of ladies garments dont shop here.  Shop from the bapu bazaar shops.This is a good visit in the middle of the day.
World_Trade_Park,inderpal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021 • Family,Nice shopping mall,Good Shoping place with neat and clean facilities. Many options for food lovers.Kids zone is there and good showrooms for electronics purchase.
World_Trade_Park,WICK 亗,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,TOILETS ARE HELL.,"What is wrong with all toilets, they are extremely used and you can see toilets in super bad condition, cleaner, housekeepers they never clean these toilets. Those are commodes (english toilets) so you won't imagine sitting on them at all. Those toilets are complete sh*tholes. Do not visit if you like hygiene free environment. I repeat do not go there, Toilets are hell, and you can't even visit there with kids or toddlers, no clean place to take care of them."
World_Trade_Park,Eagle eye,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2020 • Friends,Mask or scraff,Wtp guys  why you guys are not allowing people whose mouths are coverd with scraf .  Covered mouth  is mandatory but it's not mandatory that you are allowed only if u wear mask. .Secruity not allowing people with scraf covering there mouth why ?Even our senior politicians uses the gamcha or scarf to cover face .In other malls people are allowed with scrafs
World_Trade_Park,Philip P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Futuristic monument, luckily outside of the city centre.",Only viewed from the exterior: little to add apart from the title. I like this style very much but it integrates difficult with the majestic historical buildings.
World_Trade_Park,John H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Escape the madness of Jaipur,It's a western style shopping mall which is great for westerners looking for a little respite from the madness of downtown Jaipur 
World_Trade_Park,LostMySelfTraveling,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Solo,Couldn't find my favourite brand powerbank in that big mall. ,"It was a huge complex or mall with lot of stores that include electronics, that include small to big stores and even Reliance Digital. I tried for power bank few brands at Reliance. The prices are too high. And couldn't find the wanted brands like Asus or Microsoft. So couldn't buy the power bank. So just roam around and finally felt hungry and had pastry.. There was an exclusive store for cakes and pastries. The chocolate pastry was tasty. Shopping experience was OK. But not satisfied with shopping experience particularly about powerbank. "
World_Trade_Park,rohit arora,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Trip to world trade park jaipur,"World trade park is one of the best shopping malls in Malviya Nagar Jaipur . You can have great shopping experience as well as it has great food court .

Lenovo Exclsusive store , Asus Exclsusive store , dell exclusive store a great digital experience with digital dreams Jaipur "
World_Trade_Park,dipesh k,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Huge property,Huge property but needs to be maintained and there is not much clarity of why and how the mall has been done. Thats fact
World_Trade_Park,Shutterbug_Iyer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A Mall like any other,"For tourists to Jaipur, there is nothing interesting here. What attracted us was the unique architecture and the nearness to the airport. We had one hour to spend on the way to the airport and we decided to visit the mall. Inside it was like any other upmarket mall with some prestigious brands and food court and cineplex."
World_Trade_Park,Sagar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Best mall to visit in Jaipur,"As I live in Jaipur. Oftenly, I visit to WTP (World Trade Park). It's the only mall in Jaipur that looks good and gives you a pleasant vibe. You may find rush on weekends but you wouldn't find this as difficulty. Mall is too large in width than any other mall in Jaipur. You can find multiple shops there to fit your shopping needs. However, this is not a grocery shop. So don't expect D-Mart alike shops. There are good clothing shops, food shops (like pizza, kebab, KFC, etc.) at food court. There is good capacity of parking with complete security at most of the entrance. Mall is equipped with automatic doors, security cameras, detectors, clean public restrooms, clean floors, lifts, elevator, Cinema Hall, Food Court, Toy shops, Gaming mania, Luxury electronic devices showroom, Branded Wears, Cafe, Restaurant, Book shop, Artificial Jewellry, etc. However, near WTP you can find other malls such as GT, Central GT, etc. But you may find too much rush there on weekends. Also, parking is not free. What might be annoying are beggers trying to sell Rose. You can also hire cabs, rikshaws, bikes,etc. to visit this place."

World_Trade_Park,Manoj Agrawal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Modern Jaipur,"Jaipur being a culturally rich city with lot of royal heritage attracts several tourists, lot of businesses groom here as well.

World_Trade_Park,1Anurag,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Casual Visit,"Was visiting Jaipur on some work and was staying close to the WTP. Visited the place one evening and was impressed with its design and huge spaces. Fountains and selfie spots was nice to sit around.The highlight of the WTP was the huge Food Court with plenty of sitting options. Variety of food is available from local cuisine to Kebabs, Street food and South Indian snacks to Pizzas and Milk Shakes etc. The Dubai market side of the food court is where I bought some cheap but very nice shirts and tshirts.Go in the twilight time and spend the evening there, its a nice place to go."

World_Trade_Park,Andrew F,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Disappointed ,"Went their with my wife who is a wheelchair user. Not particularly user friendly, lifts very small and no clear indication in lift as to floor numbers. Ramp we had to negotiate was quite steep. Many small shops with familiar brands but nothing to shout about. Had a snack in Food Hall which is on top floor. Was OK. If you are in India for cultural visit, it’s not worth coming here. We visited more out of curiosity than necessity and won’t be returning. OK for wet or cold day."
World_Trade_Park,manish J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Wow..,"A mall which is having all tha things a tourist wants in jaipur. Full shopping , masti and food with so many options.  Neat and clean , well maintained.  Probably one of premium malls in India."

World_Trade_Park,Gerard,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,A touh of modern india,"Interesting architecture with two towers of shopping ( 4 floors each).  A good respite away from  bazaars.  Prices were reasonable. There wasnt much  human traffic inside when we visited - which made it a welcome change from the tooting and pushing, outside.  Worth a quick visit."
World_Trade_Park,rjpriyanka,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Nice nice ,"WTP at JLN has almost all branded outlet, food court , Selfie corners etc . .

Ordered a Chicken Biryani with Mutton Curry , Naan and dessert . It came in a small Thali tray but it was a very substantial helping . The Chicken Biryani was delicious and the mutton curry was out of this world ! At Rs370/- it was a meal worth having ! Highly recommended."

World_Trade_Park,Peregrineri,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,"Modern mall, not particularly interesting","I wouldn't bother unless you happen to need something you can only get in a big mall like this. It's certainly not what travelers come to Jaipur for. When there are so many wonderful bazaars in Jaipur, it's hard to see why you'd go here. There's a mediocre food court and a movie theater."
World_Trade_Park,Luigi X,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Great variety,"This big shopping mall is also nice to see from the outside, it offers a variety of both local and international products"
World_Trade_Park,Smit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017,Only lifetime of Jaipur,What to say about this place. this is the only place in Jaipur where you can go to spend time every Saturday and Sunday and daily if you are from Jaipur. this is the place which comes to the centre of the city. this place is full of all the brands that are sneaky these days but to be honest they are much expensive also.
World_Trade_Park,Vipul G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Too much expectation ,"Well I went to mall with huge expectation,  I mean in a city as diverse as Jaipur something on 19th no. To do . Well despite huge building shopping area is way too small. There are two different block connected by food court. It is cumbersome specially if you have a wheelchair.  There are not too much option for shopping.  For food there is just one food court with limited option.  Only silver lining is dubai bajar which trades in local stuff n with reasonable price. Rest they have named different market .  Roman street , fantasy bazar.  But that all is merely names n little . Well this is an average mall ."
World_Trade_Park,bg23121995,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Gaint mall and a must visit place,I have been to jaipur many times but once i have visited this extremely big mall and i think whoever go there must check out this.All is available from locals to international brands.

World_Trade_Park,Mohmmad S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Awesome ,"This is Jaipur’s pride. And a delight. A mall with a definite personality of its own. It has everything that all malls offer, but it has its own unique contributions too. Such as the Dubai Bazaar, the Fantasy world, it’s food court, and a local curios market done up in a special setting. It has become a tourist attraction more than just a shopping place."

All popular food outlets , best shopping brands, best movie experience , leisure out just everything including best selfies locations... you can spend hours without getting bored. Not costlier than outlets in city, ample parking (40/- for 4hrs for a 4 wheeler). If you are short of time dont waste it searching a nice place to visit. Just be here and you will not regret. Dont forget the 10-12min full body massage @120 on 3rd floor , outside north end of Dubai Bazar. You will thank me for that."

World_Trade_Park,Himanshu Doshi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Huge mall with limited shopping options but a great food court.,"I visited this mall with my family on 28th April 2018, Saturday. I was told this is the most happening place in Jaipur, but honestly, I was disappointed.It is situated on JLN Marg (Malviya Nagar) near the airport and near another happening place, the GT Mall.The mall has 2-level basement parking and there are adequate number of parking personnel to aid you in parking the car.The ground and first floor of the mall has showrooms of various brands like Zara and Marks and Spencer, to name a few.There is also a market on the middle floor where we can buy footwear, clothes, decoration items (we bought a few keychains and a wind-chime) and mobile accessories at reasonable rates. The top floor has a section called Dubai Bazar where there are numerous shops selling garments, watches, fashion accessories, mobile accessories, bluetooth speakers, bluetooth headphones and other electronic items.The part of the mall we loved was the food court. It has food options for every palate; veg, non-veg, Indian, Punjabi, Italian... you name it.We had our lunch at Yellow Chilli restaurant. The food was exceptionally good and authentic punjabi taste. The complimentary pan was a delight.This mall is best for people who wish to spend a few hours shopping for first-copy electronics items and cheap home decoration items. Food lovers will not go anywhere else, considering the various options available."
World_Trade_Park,Shruthi P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Average place,Was told it's the best mall in Jaipur. . But turned out to be below expectations when compared to malls in other places like Bengaluru. Not that many shops and very little to choose from other than Marks and Spencer. The air conditioning was close to non existing and the escalators especially the ones going up weren't functioning. Food court ..OK I'd say. Better restaurants could be tried at the same price. Could be avoided unless you have nothing else to do .
World_Trade_Park,zorabeekhan59,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,visited this amazing park with myraid if shopping brands,met sheraz khan. lazeez foods had real value for money...amazing taste of chicken paratas and just 520 rupees...highlight of our meals in jaipur

World_Trade_Park,Adnan_Chowdhury67,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Shah Rukh khan's mall,"Well, that's what we were told. By the way, those who are unfamiliar with SRK, he is one of India's biggest actors.Anyway, regardless of SRK's connection or not, the mall is worth a visit.Our hotel was close by and so we decided to give it a visit.First, it's huge. It has some famous brand names like M&S, etc. We went to the food court and had breakfast at a South Indian restaurant. Very inexpensive. But there was a lot of other variety so you won't go hungry. We bought perfumes and attars at the Dubai Gold Souk and got some great deals. Worth a visit if you are in Jaipur."
World_Trade_Park,Leena K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Indeed the Biggest and the Best!,"During our 2 nights short stay at Jaipur, we spent 1 whole day at this mall. With a baby in hand and the real hot weather, it gets difficult to enjoy the beauty of Jaipur which lies in all its forts and architectural marvels. This mall really satisfied our thirst of having fun in a real hot weather.You will find most swanky brands at the ground level, and most local favorites from level 2 onwards. I personally didn't expect to pay only Rs. 250 for a pair of sandals that i bought from a small shop at level 2, and a non-branded UV protected sunglasses at only Rs. 100. This was however possible only with a committed bargain with the shopkeepers ;-)The food court was massive, and had stalls of almost all kinds of food ranging from western to traditional Rajasthani cuisines. We had a Rajasthani Thali at around Rs.600 and it was more than enough for 2 adults.For a foodie like me, a whole day can be spent here to relish various kinds of world over cuisines. A MUST visit for all travelers and localites."
World_Trade_Park,Kunal_Bhowmick,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Largest Mall of Jaipur...😀😀,This is the largest mall in Jaipur...It is spread up in eleven floors...This mall opened in 2012 and is located at Malviya nagar...There is a four screen plex maintained by Cinepolis...All the floors have different themes a part of different countries...The food court is something to watch out for...There are many options to choose from...Also there is an outlet of Barcelo's at WTP...🍗🍗

Good colourful fountains installed on the entrance and look especially a clock hanged on the road side feels like western city. Good building architecture and elevation. i liked the Food Court especially. its one of the best in Rajasthan."
World_Trade_Park,Sanjay S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,Awesome ambience but High pricing.,WTP has become a brand among the youngsters in Jaipur. It has become a tourist destination which is good in terms of tourism. Needs to work on the pricing & the fixed rates which is very high. Otherwise all good.. 
World_Trade_Park,maninderkaur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,One of the best Mall in jaipur,"Its a nice place to hangout, consist of variety of major brands outlets.So many Dining options are available in Food court."
World_Trade_Park,JainManoJ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,One of Major attraction of Jaipur.,"It is a good place to visit to World Trade park ( Basically a Large Mall) at Jaipur , having Food Court , Multiplex , Traditional Market , specially main attraction of DUBAI BAZAAR. You will enjoy. You may also go to G T Bazaar for purchasing and enjoy with Food Corners , which is very close to it."
World_Trade_Park,BeowulfReviews,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Business,Average,"Barcelos was the first restaurant that we went to when I was in Jaipur. My Manager was very vocal about this place as he liked the food earlier when he was in India. It is in the WTP which is the happening mall in Malviya Nagar.We ordered very light as we had a heavy breakfast which was for almost all of us. We had Virgin Mojito, Falafel Wrap, Veg Pita Wrap and Veg Trinchado, Stir Fry Vegetables and Fattoush Salad. We quite liked the dishes that we ordered. The last dish that my Manager ordered pretty much ruined for him and us as well. This is supposed to be their Signature Non Vegetarian Dish.The food was fine but what irked us and my Manager the most was the bad Service. They took a lot of time to serve him a dish and which turned out to be undercooked. This could have been easily avoided. Overall i would say that it's not that a bad place. It's got the nice ambience and lighting. Comfortable seating. The service is too bad and the management in not that attentive either. Hope they will work on it."
World_Trade_Park,zahrashakeri1370,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Nice and big!,"We went there two times and ate lunch and shop. the foods were delicious specially the pizza. there is a bazaar which is called Dubai bazaar where you can buy many things, shirts, dress, jewelry, souvenir, ... but don't expect a very good quality there."
World_Trade_Park,PK Das,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Biggest Mall of Rajasthan,Probably the biggest Mall in the state. The huge facade gives impression of Commercial/Office building type not at all a Mall.The mall hosts many outlets of brands local & international brands. The inter connectivity of the mall is little awkward. You can travel from one part to other through top floor food court area only  not convenient at all.Similarly food court also has wide spread of restaurants

From inside one building is made on traditional pattern and other one is on modern theme. You can find almost all top leading brands here, a big food court and theater also. Must visit if you are a mall lover."

World_Trade_Park,TravelDiaries_Pulkit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Great mall !,"This mall will give you a different experience of shopping. They have a market area which is similar to the market in Dubai - shops are small and you get almost everything here. Items which you would typically not get in India easily can be found at this market - fruits, spices, etc. They have a good food court area as well which I recommend but it is crowded mostly."

World_Trade_Park,acerockolla,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,"Escape The Heat, Enjoy The Shopping & Food Hall","Our visit to Jaipur had been a major culture shock. Being based in the old city area, we were confronted with noise, unbearable heat and some very bad smells! We headed for some civilization and we found it in this stunning modern building and it's welcoming air conditioned atmosphere. A good selection of shops and a fabulous food hall with a few really good options. It also has a multi screen cinema. Oh and also this place has some lovely clean restrooms."

World_Trade_Park,Shubhamk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Loved it.,"Well, this place for starters is really beautiful, i mean for the first time ypu see it, it's obviously gonna catch your eye. The towers look just amazing. Now that aside the place is basically a mall, yup a mall where you can buy stuff, eat, play games or watch movies basically spend a day pretty well. The place has a number of stores for shopping which includes a number of big brands like Casio, Vivo, Wrangler, Pepe jeans etc. The cineplex is in contract with Cinepolis and well obviously you have the food court. The food is awesome but at times a litte expensive. The minimum budget for two people to eat satisfactorily is around 500-750 rs. Next time i go I'll sure to add some photos too. Till then ""Be Advised to Enjoy The Life"" . "

World_Trade_Park,Anuj Garg,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Half Of the Mall is Under Construction ,I visited it on Aug - 2017. It's a Good Mall but Almost half the Mall was Under Construction. Maybe Someday in the Future it might become Better but Right now there aren't many Shops to Surf around at this Time. Not Sure How google and TripAdvisor is Saying its the best Mall in Jaipur.
World_Trade_Park,w0w007,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Modern but learning,"Visited recently, lots of latest stores and world class amenities which are destroyed by blaring music which is so annoying that you are forced to leave. Compare all elite malls worldwide, nice and quiet, if you wish to play music make it soft and easy, take care that there are young children or old people who get disturbed. Why play loud music to satisfy your personal needs????. Check the malls in Delhi and compare, need I say more "
