To find the webpage, simply Google ""virtual tour of Victoria Memorial Hall."" You may also download the Google Arts & Culture mobile app.To being with, the entrance had a grand garden that was well-kept, and I noticed that it provided free WiFi. After that, I entered the museum. It provided a lot of information on the artistic history of Bengal. Its huge walls, mind blowing architecture, statues, and manuscripts caught my eye. It had priced paintings that were eye-catching, especially the ones that depicted the yogic postures and artworks of famous painters. I liked the rare photographs that reflected India in British times.I found an arsenal of artillery to be very attractive and has been showcased throughout the entire interior. They displayed British rule and architecture precisely and beautifully, even in black and white.To conclude, it was very informative, and the virtual served the purpose. This virtual tour will surely leave you wanting for more!"
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Saurav Mitra,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,PRETTY BAD BEHAVIOUR AT THE DEPARTMENTAL CANTEEN AT VICTORIA MEMORIAL PREMISES.,"Very ill behaved staffs at the departmental canteen, we entered the canteen to ask whether the canteen is operational or not, the person replied that can't you the see the board outside!This is the way , you all reply! No sense of hospitality. May be they are aware that Tourism Ministry is not bothered, no actions would be taken! Can they reply such a way to foreigners too?!A successful tourist attraction is actually a blend of everything elements of hospitality."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Sounhakan M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,#newage #Virtualreality,"Experience The Virtual Tour To Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata.I was always fascinated about the evolution of the internet and I'm amused by thinking what all can be done while sitting at the comfort of our home. With this I have decided to make a visit to the Victoria memorial hall.Come with me as I walk you with my narrative to the virtual experience.Queen Victoria's marble statue had got all my attention directly from the entrance. As a person with lot of love and interest to arts and paintings, my fingers on the mouse started to automatically scroll to the top inside of the central hall with a variety of paintings giving an idea about the Britain courts in the tombsComing to Antiques....I quickly imagined myself as a person who was living with those armoury and the legendary cannons stored in the memorial, wahh! That would have been great if it was real. But let's come back to realityThe photos of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa along with his student Swamy vivekananda brought peace with in me, and this also reminds me of a famous quote “Talk to yourself once in a day, otherwise you may miss meeting an intelligent person in this world.” - Swamy Vivekanada.After this virtual experience, I’m sure that I’m going to make a visit to The Victoria Memorial Hall directly. Will also urge you people to experience the virtual worlds."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Akanksha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Victoria Memorial Hall Virtual Tour,"I came across this spectacular Victoria Memorial Hall virtual tour, which has a stunning collection of western paintings, rare photographs, Indian paintings, and manuscripts. I could literally see the details of amazing paintings, many of which were made by Indian queens, which I could even zoom into. I could see the beautiful architecture, and I could feel that I was literally in it. It was thrilling. I could even see fine details of the swords that were used by our great kings, and it gave me chills. I could see the western sculptures, which were finely made. And I could experience the great, breathtaking richness of Indian architecture just by looking at the amazing photographs. I appreciate this wonderful technology that allows me to see and feel these heartwarming creations from the comfort of my own home. This is a must-see!

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Dolly,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,""" A truly Memorable Monument""","I finally got the chance to visit Kolkata, and when I did, there is no way I would have missed visiting this astounding memorial, which is known for its majestic British architecture and beauty that attracts thousands of people from all over the world. This memorial truly reflects the standing record of the history that was made in the memory of the deceased Queen Victoria. The statue is built of white Makrana marble that is eye-catching and worth looking at. The walls of the museum also had various scriptures written in different languages, including English, Sanskrit, and Urdu. It also had a lot of valuable collections, such as artefacts and cultural and historical paintings, including those of freedom fighters like Subhas Chandra Bose. This place is so inspiring, and everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Sunnywin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Amazing building and grounds,"The building is stunning as are the grounds but I was a little disappointed by the content, not a good museum. "
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,KNKD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Couples,A monumental memorial,"Kudos to the authorities for the maintenance of this mammoth structure and the calming well maintained gardens and water features around it. One can purchase a ticket to enter the garden area only and enjoy the duck ponds, shady trees and benches. The flower beds are beautifully maintained as well. The structure looks fresh and almost brand new, the inside exhibition was well put together and in theme (we visited around 15 August). Pick a map of Kolkata and postcards from the seller, to send to family and friends on your way out of the gardens."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Iconic,"The Victoria Memorial is an iconic structure & is synonymous with Kolkata! Even the rain couldn’t dampen my excitement of visiting. For the Victoria Memorial, two kinds of tickets are available – one for the gardens (INR 10) & one for the gardens + museum (INR 30).The pathway is flanked by gardens on both sides. A statue depicts Queen Victoria in her later years sitting on a throne.I absorbed Netaji’s life stories, ideals & beliefs in the Irrepressible Subhas gallery. You'll ponder how less we know about Netaji.The Royal Gallery on the ground floor consists of oil paintings from the British Raj. The other set of paintings I liked were by the Daniell duo; they traveled across India & documented what they saw in their paintings.As you exit the Victoria Memorial building, go to the first floor to see Biplobi Bharat Gallery. It contains aspects of the Indian freedom struggle that haven’t been given their due importance in the mainstream narrative (Revolutionaries & Armed Resistance). Take your time reading through contribution of Naval Mutiny, formation of significant associations etc.Drive around the Memorial at night; it looks even more marvelous with its illumination."

Its rich heritage history has got it all in this one masterpiece. Structured with white marble, this beautiful monument has a lot to reveal. While doing a virtual tour, I felt that it has some of the finest architecture of all the historical sites in India. The paintings on the walls are so attractive and the carvings on each pillar are so detailed. It is adorned with different sculptures and the dome in the centre of the hall is really astonishing. Its premier art gallery is wonderful. Having a virtual tour of the Victoria Memorial was really a treat to the eyes. I had an overwhelming experience and am really excited to revisit this place again in the near future."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Shriram Saini,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Alive and Vivid,"Exploring Victoria Memorial Hall was like going back hundreds of years back and living in there. Once I started reading history with respected paintings, it becomes more alive and vivid. The environment all around the hall made it more real. For me, it was heartwarming to see how people were living in the past. Audio and visuals didn't leave me alone anywhere. Sculptures surprised me each time I saw a new one. Thomas Daniell's illustrations of history were fascinating to see and imagine from his point of view. Not just inside, but the outside garden was also beautiful and well managed. Regardless of whether a person is a history enthusiast or not, moving around will certainly be a pleasant experience."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Vidisha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Virtual Tour,"Today I had the opportunity to sit comfortably on my sofa and visit the Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata. This was made possible through the virtual tour offered by the website. At first, it took me a few minutes to understand how the virtual tour works, but once I got the hang of it, it was one of the most interesting and unique experiences I've had so far. Even though it was a virtual tour, I was able to notice the beautiful white marble structure and how the architecture was a mix of British and Mughal styles. The massive museum building is divided into sections, and even though it was a virtual tour, I was able to visit different sections. Each section has different exhibits with statues, portraits, national leaders, and weapons. In addition, it contains rare and original works by William Shakespeare. For me, this virtual tour was one of the most enriching experiences of my life."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,DozierAbroad,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Was history of Calcutta; now ode to Netaji & colonial assassins,"In the past few years, the exhibits here tracking the history of the city have been removed, and a history of Indian revolutionary figure Netaji have been installed. The very last room, tucked away upstairs, is an ode to assassins and would-be assassins of British officials. It seems calculated to stir not only national pride, but a seething, lasting and present-day resentment at being invaded. Next to the memorial to one young would-be assassin, a plaque poses questions like, ""Would YOU have the courage to do what this young man did?"" As the only (visible) foreigner visiting, I noticed that people were glaring at me by the end of it. I fled."

There are many things present in the hall which must have been used for decorations during the living of Express Victoria in the Memorial.A lot of photographs from the era when Kolkata was Calcutta.

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Karan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,My first Virtual Tour- Victoria Memorial,"I graduated from Kolkata, and  Victoria memorial was our perfect escape from the chaotic and hectic college life. Whenever we wanted some peace, it was our ‘’adda’.But in the last three years, I have not been able to visit Kolkata even once, and hence my wish to visit the Victoria memorial one more time was escalating day by day.And I am not here to just share my grief, to be honest, I have something really interesting to share with everyone who has been longing to visit a place for a long time.What if I tell you that you can visit that place from the comfort of your home.Yes it's possible, Today morning one of my friends sent a link to me that was supposed to provide a Virtual Tour of Victoria Memorial.At first, I got so excited and went back down the memory lane, cheering all the time I had spent applauding the beautiful galleries and the soothing garden, with birds adding their melodies, ahh it was all perfect.But then I thought that no, a “virtual tour” of my favourite place, how will it be able to match all the beautiful sights that are still in my head,  will the experience be any good?I took a shot and ended up spending two hours virtually visiting my old ‘adda” and I can't emphasise enough how refreshing it was.I never believed that a virtual tour of a place can give you such a detailed and enriching experience of the place, and now since my hands are already dirty, I am gonna visit so many more places.So that was my first and definitely not the last Virtual tour experience, so you too go ahead visit the websites of your favourite place and sit down and visit."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Gazal Chawla,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Had an amazing virtual tour of this historic property.,"The VICTORIA MEMORIAL can now be browsed online through Google Arts and Culture website and the best part is it gives a 360-degree view of the museum to virtual visitors. The moment I got to know about the virtual tour, my historophile heart had to watch it.I started off with the entrance hall and I was in awe of the attractiveness that lies within the museum, it is made in the memory of Queen Victoria, and her broad sculpture was at the onset itself. There were two more figures in the left and right corners themselves. The most promising part about the tour is that it gives its virtual visitor an arrow and the cross sign to navigate throughout the museum, and also a compass to revolve around the property. The entire hall is made of white marble and a floor of white and black patterns gives a similar structure to that of the Taj Mahal. There are various galleries in the museum showing different sculptures, and paintings of old times(including paintings by Abanindranath Tagore and Gaganendranath Tagore), antiques of armor and arms, etc. While noticing the museum I saw lush green laws encircling the memorial which could be the finest place for a morning walk.If you are a person who admires artifacts and has an emotional connection with the historic culture and want to advance your familiarity with history you should definitely have a virtual tour of this memorial made of white marbles consisting of an extensive art collection."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Preeti uttam chandani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,My visit to one of the best architectural designs.,"This was the first time I ever visited Kolkata and Victoria Memorial Hall. I have fallen for this museum. It is one of the best architectural designs I have seen from the British era which was built in the memory of Queen Victoria. It has a wide variety of western paintings and Indian paintings. I was hypnotized by looking at the black and white photographs, as they were surprisingly very clear and it was a treat to see them in real life. There were several volumes of manuscripts from Buddhist texts to Sanskrit texts. It also has a collection of old royal dresses, swords, guns, and shields. For this one and a half hour, I lost myself in this beautiful museum while discovering something new at every corner."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Nikita L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Virtual Tour of Victoria Memorial Hall,"It was challenging for me to decide where to begin and where to stop because I have never visited a museum or taken a virtual tour. I made the decision to explore this area of Victoria Memorial Hall virtually, so one morning, with a cup of tea and a book by my side, I began roaming across the hall—of course virtually.I landed in the hallway, where the wonderful architecture and abundance of things to investigate made me feel a little intimidated. With a sigh, I began dragging my cursor around. Huge windows that provided a royal treat for your eyes allowed you to enjoy the spectacular ceiling views.I struggled to find my way through the hallways and eventually found the rare photographs and paintings section, where I saw a dozen images that had a different feel and showed Kolkata at the time it was governed by the British administration.The museum takes us back in time and helps us recall the struggles that our ancestors faced with some of its paintings by eminent, well-known artists like Abanindranath Tagore and Gaganendranath Tagore, and images that tell us stories about the people of Kolkata.We become emotional and more concerned about our country as a result of our love for the architecture and the beautiful work of the British government, as well as our fascination with art and our curiosity about how people lived here during the reign."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Fit n Smiles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Please do not miss this place when you come to Kolkata. Place to remember forever.,"I live in kolkata. As a calcuttan I have visited Victoria Memorial Hall several time since my childhood. Then we would come here from school. When I grew up, I used to go with friends or family. But every time I go, it feels good and the same kind of interesting. The Victoria Memorial is a part of Calcutta and a masterpiece of British architecture and sculpture. Calcutta cannot be imagined without it. Yet the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata is the first destination for any foreigner. The collection has also increased over time. Recently, I have been fascinated by the collection about Subhash Chandra Bose. I asked everyone to visit here at least once in their life."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Shivam Mathur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2021,Worth Visiting,"Victoria Memorial Hall is a very interesting place to visit. I am not a historic lover but this place is just incredible. The lush green gardens as themselves very beautiful.Inside there is a museum with a lot of paintings, a display of armory, guns, and other things which are of great interest to anybody. It took me an awfully long time to really look at things and to crown it all and the magnificent statue of Queen Victoria takes your breath away.The Victoria looks even more beautiful by the night and the special sound and light show is held every evening at the gardens of the memorial.The only drawback of visiting this place is, that the hall is very far away from the other main gate and you'll have to take a walk to the hall.So, It is a worth visiting place for the ones who are looking for a historic tour."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Banshidhar S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Victoria Memorial Hall,"The Victoria Memorial is a monument to Queen Victoria, located at the end of The Mall in London, and designed and executed by the sculptor (Sir) Thomas Brock. Designed in 1901, it was unveiled on 16 May 1911, though it was not completed until 1924. It was the centrepiece of an ambitious urban planning scheme, which included the creation of the Queen’s Gardens to a design by Sir Aston Webb, and the refacing of Buckingham Palace (which stands behind the memorial) by the same architect.Like the earlier Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens, commemorating Victoria's consort, the Victoria Memorial has an elaborate scheme of iconographic sculpture. The central pylon of the memorial is of Pentelic marble, and individual statues are in Lasa marble and gilt bronze. The memorial weighs 2,300 metric tonnes (about 2535 U.S. tons)[1] and is 104 ft wide. In 1970 it was listed at Grade I."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,mayu k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,A virtual tour worth visiting.,"First things first, excellent job done by the Indian Museum and Ministry of culture by including the virtual tour of this lovely monument. The page is quite user friendly and is available in 2 languages that is English and Hindi. I feel they also could have included Bengali as another language because Victoria Memorial is the Pride of West Bengal, and the native language being not included on the website is a letdown for many people of West Bengal. Apart from this, the pictures they have added are very clear and descriptive. You can also view individual pictures of different artifacts separately in different tabs to get a detailed view. The menu option in the site is not be visible until and unless you press the button, which I think should be corrected as they can make it more user friendly by making the options visible throughout the virtual tour. You can very easily navigate through the virtual tour and experience the beauty of the monument while being seated at your home. The 360-degree view helps you experience everything available in the monument and leave no stone unturned. This is the third museum in the country to go virtual and is being run by the ministry of culture. Victoria Memorial has a vast collection but only 13% of the collection is displayed in the museum due to lack of space but with the help of virtual tour we can also see other artifacts and collections which are not available even for the visitors of the monument. Visiting this website was a wonderful experience for me, you must also visit if you haven't yet, you will have a great time."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Mrunmay Arbune,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,virtual tour to Victoria Memorial hall,"Victoria Memorial Hall is one of the most beautiful museums in Kolkata. The museum building is a masterpiece of British architecture. The building was erected in memory of Queen Victoria during the reign of Lord Curzon, the British Viceroy. The Victoria Memorial is a spacious hall built of marble called Valhalla  (concept of heaven in Nordic Culture) of India. The gallery's galleries feature masterpieces from the colonial period and photographs from the same period. As Calcutta was the early capital of the British Government, many Viceroys of India lived in Calcutta. Some of them are beautiful marble statues of Viceroys such as Lord Curzon, Lord Robert Clive, Queen Victoria. The arsenal in this museum is also very beautiful. It has many swords like Samsher, Pulvar, Zafar-Takiya, Dhop, Firang, Goliya, Udepuri, Khanda and so on. They have Mach-Lock, Flint-Lock, Cap-Lock as well as British guns like Mozzer like guns to beautifully carved cannons. If you want to experience the art of the Colonial period, you need to visit this museum at least once."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Rishabh Tulsani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,"A euphoric tour to- Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata","Firstly, tbh I did the virtual tour of the museum site, and as I roamed in the galleries with clicks of my mouse, it led me to visualize the events I know in technological and historical space in chronological order. In almost every hall, there were statues of great people like Late King George V and Late Empress Victoria, and also many rare pictures and paintings of our history's great people and their stories. In this as well, I was envisioning where we have come from paintings and sculptures to Social Media and now moving towards NFTs. This virtual tour in itself is a perfect example to envision how far we have come from traveling to far different places to visit their memorial sites to now visiting those places at our homes only, that too with so immersive experience which makes it seem indifferent from actually visiting it.The site had a tonne of information on the region surrounding, and also the places and people that are relevant to it. From the history of Bengali Art to the British Rule, it was all packed with euphoric feelings and let me think critically about what is the purpose of preserving things of history and its stories. It let me connect dots and put perspective to my thoughts as to where technology has taken us so far and where it is headed now.Tbh I didn't find any answers about the future part, but I have gotten to the conclusion that certainly our history will always be going to be a part of what's about to come as the saying goes, ""The past is never dead""."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,VINCY F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Virtual tour of Victoria Memorial Hall.,"I visited one of the iconic monuments, Victoria Memorial Hall, which is located in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. A memory dedicated to Empress Victoria now turned into a museum. On entering the museum, I observed that it had a collection of swords, shields, and weapons. The piano and boat were worth taking a look at. The museum had huge statues of Late Empress Victoria, Late King George V, Late brigade surgeon Henry Elmsley, and Late Mary, Late Robert Clive. It had captured stories of the beginning of independence that showed up in museums on its walls.The museum provided a lot of information on the history of Bengal artistically. Its huge walls, architecture, statues, and manuscripts caught my eye. It had prized paintings that were eye-catching, especially the ones that depicted the yogic postures and artworks of famous painters. I liked the rare photographs that reflected India in British times. They showed British rule and architecture precisely and beautifully, even in Black and White. The buildings, bridges, vehicles, and life, in general, were captured elegantly by Bourne Shepherd as well as Johnson & Hoffman.I loved touring Victoria Memorial Hall and would recommend it to people who are either planning to visit West Bengal or who want to visit a historic place. This place will surely leave you wanting more."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Ghumakkad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,"A virtual tour of Victoria Hall, Kolkata","As the name itself screams, a visit to the Victoria Hall will give you many glimpses of Kolkata from the Victorian Era. The virtual tour starts in a hall. The first thing that caught my attention was the hall’s architecture. Everything, starting from the pillars, gigantic window openings to polished floors speak the language of castles, the kind of accommodation Empress Victoria must have been living in back in 1921 when this masterpiece was constructed. But, the fact that the British were the people who were running our country back then, was reminded to me as soon as I took my eyes off of the admirable architecture.On the right, was a nicely sculpted statue of Robert Clive, the first Viceroy of the Presidency of  Bengal, Rest in Peace. Right behind the sculpture was a door that opened up the view to some rare photographs from the era when a camera used to be a luxury.A lot of photographs from the 20th century capturing the spirit of the joyous city of Kolkata caught my attention. The contrast in those photographs was brought out in a manner that was like none other I had ever seen. On one side there were the rich aristocrats from Britain and on the other side were the people of India who worked hard and earned their bread every day.Moving on to the other side of Robert Clive, Rest in Peace again, was a huge collection of paintings from India and the West as well as the manuscripts. The attention to detail in these exhibits was just impeccable. I kept on getting awed as I moved from one painting to another.That is all I can accommodate in the current situation. Stay tuned, though. There is lots coming your way related to the virtual tour."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,VIJAI KUMAR,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,The disgusted visit to Victoria memorial,"awesome historical building and its surroundings. One feels proud of the architecture.  However there is nothing done on this premises , to facilitate tourists. No car parking facility near the premises. That means that the local tourists also have to hire taxi. There are no guides around to tell about the monument.  The foot paths, laid with pebbles,  are very uncomfortable. Overall the place seems to have been neglected from tourists point of view"

Tickets come in two forms. One is intended for only the garden tour, costing only 10 rupees, and the other one is with the additional entrance to the Victoria mansion, which adds 20 rupees more.GARDEN VISITThe garden itself is about 64 acres of land, as the memorial is situated on a vast area, and is adorned with various seasonal flowers, creating a wonderful ambience to roam around in. This is a common place of hangouts for families, couples, or the youth. There is also a very eye-catchingly big pond and a beautiful fountain on the premises.MEMORIAL MUSEUM VISITAs you approach the mansion, you will see some statues depicting motherhood, at the top of the porch, one being very prominent, along with some smaller sized ones. Despite being around since the early 20th century, the marbled building is still well managed and well organized in its appearance."

Once past the bronze of Victoria Emperatrix , one steps into a vast echoing hall surmounted by a galleried cupola. The first sight is a beautiful statue of the young queen. The ground floor is full of loot, portraits of the dignitaries of Victoria’s India, watercolours by her sailors, cannon, a wonderful black marble table mounted on four bronze howitzers, weapons of the period of British rule.Upstairs I found an exquisite exhibition of Indian miniatures that took me a full hour to see properly."

Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,SubhankarAD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Huge Cosmic Energy flowing at this place,"Mobiles and footwear not allowed, hence better to leave them in your car or any shop at the 'Dala arcade', from where you buy dala or offerings for Kali Maa. Security is now strict and people then have to queue up to enter the temple premises. Once we enter the temple our mind changes to go up in sync to the Energy, left behind by the many eminent monks that continuously stayed/visited this place. They include Ramakrishna, Bijoykrishno, Vivekananda amongst others. Initially there will be Radha Krishna temple on our left, then the main Kali temple. There are two queues to have darshan of Kali Maa. Better to take the one that sees Maa from the front. On reaching Maa face to face, need to keep eyes open and take in everything. Darshan will be short unless one is a vip. Next come down and from the 'Natmandir' (now under renovation) sit, close your eyes and speak with Kali Maa whatever you wish to. There are 12 Shiv lingas besides the Ganga. Before or after visiting them, have a wash in the cool waters of the Ganga. There is also the room where Ramkrishna Paramhansa stayed. It is a must visit as this is the room great men visited and great teachings/discussions took place. Next to visit is Sarada Maa's home. Also need to visit 'Panchabati' where SRi Ramkrishna had meditated."
Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,K. Srinivasa Rao,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Couples,A divine experience - a visit to Dakshineshwar,"Divine experience  - Maa kali temple at Dakshineshwar is a highly revered holy place to visit. Despite lingering fear of coronavirus, the abode of Maa Kali is administered well with separate counter for depositing mobiles and shoes. When you enter the precincts, you will fond to your left crowded offices housing shoe and mobile deposit facility. There is orderliness in queue formation in general for both activities. Even carry bags can be deposited. These are prepaid counters and hence you should hold coins or small denomination currency note to avoid delay to others in queue. Once you deposit them, to your left is a passage to enter the shrine. Ladies and gents are separated near the entry point for security check. Announcements are made in Bengali, Hindi and English about Covid protocols. After entering the temple, the main Maa Kali temple building is the middle  tall one with multiple temple architectures  commonly found in these parts of India. There 3 queues for Darshan - two for having darshan straight and one where Maa Kali is visible from the side. Stand in  the queue and your turn will come. Have darshan peacefully, pray while waiting for your turn. You cannot get to see the deity for a long duration due to people waiting after you. As a devotee we should cooperate. Not much offerings are allowed but who ever brings prasad offering, the priests are nice to return major portions back to devotees. Walk back and can have darshan of 12 Lord Shiva lingas lined up opposite the temple on the banks of holy river ganga. There is temple of Lord Krishna next to the main building. There is a building facing the main temple for devotees to wait, pray and meditate. One can even take bath in Ganga and then have darshan. There is no pushing and over crowding. One can have darshan at their own pace. Once you exit temple building you can reach the same building where mobiles and shoes were deposited. One should visit the shops lined up selling eatables and temple related items. Trade and commerce thrives near temples and we should ensure that their business and livelihood too is important. Do your bit by buying some items as a memory of visit to Dakshineshwar Maa Kali shrine. The experience is indeed divine and people cooperating with one another is worth emulating. A must visit shrine when in Kolkatta."
Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,gpradeepshenoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Solo,Good temple,The easiest way to reach Dakshineswar temple is through metro. From exit of Dakshineswar metro station take skywalk to reach this temple. The walk from exit of metro station will be about 7-10 minutes. Footwears and mobile must be deposited (two seperate counters) at counters near entrance of temple for a small charge of Rs 3. When I visited the temple it was under renovation. Since the crowd was very less i got darshan of Godess very fast. When it rains the places inside this temple become very slippery.

Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,KennethEast,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,An unusual experience,"This is a major pilgrimage site for Hindus.  The complex has a major temple that houses a revered incarnation of the goddess Kali.  That's what the pilgrims come to see.  Our group of four visited with a guide.  Frankly, without her I doubt we'd have had the steel to force our way into the crushing queue to get a glimpse of the shrine.  Our guide practically pulled us behind her into the throng--trying to keep us together and moving forward. It was insane but also oddly exhilarating. In a country where men and women don't even line up together at airports, they were together here in much more intimate circumstances.Keepers of the shrine kept people moving.  They had a challenge indeed.  On their way out of the shrine, some pilgrims prostrated themselves on the stairs in worship.  It's a miracle no one was crushed by the others who were being forced to descend the stairs below the shrine by the crowds behind them.  All this on a weekday afternoon visit! I can't imagine what it would be like on a busy weekend.After we survived the ""main course"", we had a relaxed walk around the dozen smaller auxiliary temples in the complex.  It's an appealing complex to look at.  But that's not what I'll remember.  I can still feel my heart racing as we pushed and shoved our way through the crowds to catch a view of a shrine that meant so much to so many around us."

Since I have to board flight to Mumbai at 22:25 hrs,  I was having ample time to visit my paces of interest at Kolkata.Whenever I am at Kolkata, I love to visit two places viz. Belur Math and Dakshineshwar Kali Temple.  Since I had visited Belur Math twice/Thrice on my last visits, I had a strong desire to visit Dakshineshwar Kali Temple. Accordingly, booked Car and reached the Temple. After depositing Mobile phone, Luggage and Shoe against token at nominated counter, entered the temple.My first interest was to visit the Room of the Ramakrishna Paramhansa. The room in which Shri Shri Ramakrisha Dev use to live is in the vicinity of the temple itself. The room is kept as it is for the DARSHN for the devotees. On entering the said room, observed unique piece and highly positive vibrations. The devotees were entering to the room and  bow down to the portrait of Shri Shri Ramakrishna Dev kept on the  Chowkey (Bed) and sit for a while doing meditation etc. The atmosphere there at found pious and charged. Thereafter, I had visited the Kali ma Temple which is also a unique place.  There was a long queue to visit the main temple. On spending few minutes in the temple, roam around the temple and have a sun set view from the Ghat (Bank of the river Hubli/Ganga.)This to be added that in my earlier visits say during 1980-1990s, the vicinity of the temple was completely congested by the local vendors selling Pooja Materials etc. There was a complete chaos as regards to cleanliness. However, in my this visit,  to the surprise, it has observed that the all the local vendors are accommodated in the permanent structure opposite the temple and the entire area of the temple is kept very neat and clean. It may be noted that though the temple administration has no where displayed the charges for depositing Luggage, Mobile and other Valuables, Shoes, the person at counters ask one to pay the charges.The  Dakshineshwar temple is highly recommended  and must  visit place in  Kolkata."

It is also a place of pilgrimage for the devotees and place of beauty for all.It is quite interesting how the temple got constructed. The temple was built by Rani Rashmoni who was apparently quite rich. She wanted to go to Benaras on a pilgrimage in a caravan of 24 boats. One night before her departure Goddess Kali appeared in her dream and said you don’t need to go to Benaras. You can build a temple for me on the banks of Ganges and I will appear there.She cancelled her Benaras trip, bought 30,000 acres of land (massive) including 20 acres from an Englishman. After many years of construction the temple was inaugurated on 31 May 1855. Its first priest was Ramkumar Chattopadhyay. After Ramkumar’s death a year later, his younger Brother took over as the priest. That priest became the world renowned Ramkrishna Paramhans. The temple consists of the main building 46 feet x 46 feet - 100 feet tall with eleven spires. The Deity is called “Bhavatarini Kali”There is large courtyard around the temple which has 12 Shivlingas. There is also a Radha Krishna Temple. By the side of the temple is the Ghat by the side of river Ganga..The temple is built in “Bengal Style” of architecture. It’s a truly impressive structure. If the temple complex could be kept spotlessly clean, it would increase its magnetism many times over..The whole area Dakshineswar- Belur Math can truly become an eye pleasing soul satisfying (for the devotees) tourist hub if developed with passion and vision.."

It’s an unbelievable feeling once you are there in the temple premises. It’s always advisable to plan early and go early in morning. We went on a Friday morning at 8 am. There was hardly any crowd and we had a wonderful Darshan of Maa Kali. We had planned to visit Ada peeth by 10 as the Aarti starts there at 10.30 am. Well a wonderful experience.The only thing that has changed over years is more security and blockage of mobile ph cameras inside the temple, I personally don’t like it and wish the system changes on this aspect.

So there were some people roaming there who ask for some money for giving people VIP entry directly inside without waiting. And then too when we take the special entry people are pushing each other and breaking the line for getting out. It's located inside a lane and many small outlets are there beside them like to buy sindoor, photos of God's, books, Bangles, bangali sweets. N many pandits roam behind people for doing this or that type of Pooja. Don't ever believe or trust them. They just want to manipulate people and bribe money from them. They think that they are God. Don't ever come into their talks. Nothing happens. Just prey to God whichever you believe in. Remember P.K movie of Aamir Khan. It's the same."
Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,Sujit C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,An Amazing Visit to Dakshineswar kali Temple!,"After initial hiccups, I finally managed early morning of Nov 24th., 2019 for darshan of Dakshineswar Kali Ma's temple from Belur where I had entrenched myself for attending one of my childhood friends Son. The Steamer (Ferry) experience from Belur Math to Dakshineswar on the early morning hours was amazing. Also there is a provision to walk down on the Skywalk which connects right upto the temple premise, but for older people it could be quite tiring. Hence, early morning Steamer / Ferry ride is much more pleasant and enjoyable. The Steamers start right from 7:00 AM and available every half an hour interval and just a paulty fare of Rs. 22.00 (To & Fro). Also, please remember, steamers are available from Hooghly,  and other Ghats in Kolkata, so kindly check the availability from other places. Start early, when you don't expect too much of rush, and avoid if possible on weekends, i.e., Saturdays and Sundays!!! Huge number of devotees visit on the weekends and it's quite a mayhem as usual at all religious places in India. Inside the temple premises there is a Bazar from where you can get all items for offering, though I generally avoid such rituals.  To have a glimpse of the main Maa Goddess Kali enter from the extreme right, may be there could be ques, so standing for few jealous minutes could be worrisome and a botheration if it's sunny and hot in the open. There are three Temples side by side and 12 Shiva Linga temples on the opposite side. The middle temple is that of Maa Kali!!It's was a wonderfilled experience, quite overwhelming, in an serene atmosphere. Clean and tidy. If anyone intends to offer private Puja then he or she may do so, but then you have to contact their office for a priest before 9:30 AM. for performing the religious discourse."

It carries daily traffic of over one Lac vehicles and countless pedestrians and is as historic as it is grand. The beauty of the bridge, however, comes alive in the night time when it is all lit up. The view of the city from the ferry, which runs between Kolkata and Howrah from the launch ghat especially in the night, is awesome.Howrah Bridge was the third longest cantilever bridge at the time of its construction, but now it is the sixth longest one of its types. It was renamed as Rabindra Setu in 1965, after the name of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. There are total of 8 lanes of strand road on the bridge for four wheelers, bicycles & pedestrians.

The famous landmark of the city, the Howrah Bridge, constructed by the British during 1940's, is one of the busiest cantilever bridges in the world. It carries a massive daily traffic of approximately 100K vehicles and more than 150K pedestrians every day.Some interesting facts:1. There is a famous belief that the bridge does not have any nut or bolt. But in reality, Howrah Bridge does have nuts and bolts, but just a few.2. The first ever mode of transportation that was used on the bridge was a solitary tram. Trams used to operate on the bridge till 1993. After that period, they were banned due to vehicular traffic on the bridge.Tips for viewers:Best time to view the best of this remarkable bridge is early morning during sunrise or evening during sunset. But we visited here at around 7:30 in the evening so that we get a view of the bridge with the famous purple/blue lighting. Reach to the starting point of the Howrah Bridge (from Kolkata towards Howrah Railway Station). Take the stairs down towards the flower market which can be seen from the bridge itself. Ask anyone the direction towards Mallik Ghat. You can sit in the concrete seats built in the ghat area.

Built way back in the yesterday years, Today also it stands solid like a rock as if constructed recently. It connects the Howrah station to the city and a ride through it is very enjoyable especially in the mornings when it's not so crowded. You can enjoy the rays if the rising sun reflecting on the Ganga. It's really beautiful!! It's a long stretch over the Ganga but you don't want the ride to end soon. Because the ride in the morning is ecstatic. You can see the fishing boats down below already out for their early morning catch. If you want to enjoy the evening view, it's best not to ride on it because it's overcrowded and may take you hours to get out. Best option is to take a ferry ride across and enjoy the view of evening lights amidst the night sky. It's an enchanting sight ferrying over the Ganga and watching the recording Howrah Bridge."

Mother_House,EmkaySriLanka,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Mother House of  Mother Theresa of Kolkata,The Mother house is where Mother Theresa lived the latter part of her Missionary life and she is buried here.  .Situated in a house off a busy road it is an oasis of calm and  quiet. There is a small chapel and a museum which gives  many details of her life and vocation . There are religious Sisters who are happy to give details and direct visitors - luckily  no touts to harass visitors. One could see that the lace had a spiritual impact on the visitors . Wash room and related facilities are very clean.There is a small cafe just outside which sells religious items and books on the Saint' s life ; one can also have coffee and snacks here.
Mother_House,SDas1203,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Mother's House,"It is very easy to find while searching in google map and is right on the main road A.J.C Road; barely couple of hundred meters from Park Street crossing, while going towards Sealdah.A very peaceful place with Mother's tumb, a small but interesting museum with her personal belongings & Nobel certificate. On the first floor above the kitchen, is the simple room where she used to live.If you are in Kolkata, this is one of the must visit."

Mother_House,tamminh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Deserving #1 Ranking!,"This sight is currently ranked #1 of 234 things to do in Kolkata, to which my husband and I cannot agree more.  It was a small, simple place but kept perfectly spotlessly clean; even the restrooms were completely free of odors.  This was shocking for us, when comparing to the many public sights we had visited in India.  Rules were posted clearly and simply about what was permitted.  Otherwise, we were left free to look about.  There was no solicitation whatsoever;  in fact, we had to ask a sister on how to make donations.What made this place so touching and so inspiring are the simple yet clear exhibitions of Mother Teresa's devotion to the service of the poor.  Her words are profound, but her actions spoke much louder and deeper than her words.  The effects last much longer afterwards, causing us to do some more research about her even after we got home."
Mother_House,RameshKN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Real divine place,"The tomb and room of mother teresa is a must visit place and create nostalgic memories about the divine lady.

Mother_House,Bodhi Pujari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Traveling in india,I had planned for some time to visit this place . Being an Albanian  by blood always Mother Tereza ( Gonxhe)  has been an inspiration for me . You can read about what she has done but it’s nothing like been there and see this for yourself . Just around the corner from this house you still can see how people live  still today . Very touching place 
Mother_House,Johann R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,In The Presence Of God.,"Kolkata is a noisy place. You can't escape that fact. Every vehicle uses its horn - constantly, continually. Just step into Mother Theresa's home, which is by the side of a busy road, and the noise is somehow quietened. A sense of deep, deep peace reaches out and engulfs you, soothes you, calms you. Sit on a bench, by the side of Mother's Crypt, and you know you're in the presence of the Holy. Words cannot truly capture the experience. So I'll stop trying."
Mother_House,Companion32331321681,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Visit to sisters of charity,Reverred place where Mother Teresa served the destitute with love and care is worth visiting.

Mother_House,Ansu Thankam J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Soul searching,"Missionaries of Charity is one organisation I have heard and read about from childhood. Visiting Mother's house was a great opportunity I had ever been looking forward to. I knew all the stories of mother from my schooldays. Seeing it all for real was beyond words.Indeed I got this chance while working on medical procedures in leprosy patients. Found it a great coincidence. The little museum was heart touching. I reached after 6pm so couldn't see mother's room.Sisters start their prayer at around 7pm. Fortunately I could attend the prayer. Calm, peaceful and was a great blessing.One of the sisters showed me a prayer written for the healing hands.It was a great eye opener when she said the poor sick and needy doesn't need our sympathy but treat them with dignity. "
Mother_House,Yijing Gu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Volunteer for three days,"Photo is strictly prohibited.Most volunteers stay 10 days to 3 months. Some for years. But you are totally welcome for volunteering even just one day.I spent 3 days volunteering with Mother Teresa’s charity, which has been my dream for years since I learnt about her work.First day I was sent to take care of women with mental illness or intellectual disabilities. Some of them were born with disabilities and got abandoned. Some were tortured before that they got severe mental illness. A few of them had some abilities to work, and were also helping around. Most of them weren’t able to take care of themselves at all.We did laundry, bed making and feeding. I could see the light in their eyes when I fed them.When we were on our way to the place and back, many children and some women greeted us warmly, which gave me lots of courage.It’s always a good feeling being able to do something for others, even just a small thing, not to say the great respect you get from it.Second day, I was at children’s house and hospice house. A blind kid wouldn’t want to sleep in bed, but lay on my body, maybe because I’m plump and soft :) A granny who can speak English asked if I gonna come back tomorrow. I said sorry going back home. She was a little sad, asked me to quickly come back so she could see me, because she will die soon. Didn’t know how to respond, could only give hugs.Third day, many women and children came for free medication. I didn’t know how to read prescriptions, so couldn’t really help. If you had some medical experience, you could help a lot."
Mother_House,EndlessCaravan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Holy and Quiet,"Mother House is the the home of Mother Theresa and her final resting place. Much like her, it is small and unassuming, yet very powerful. It is not the easiest place to find as the signage is small and you could walk right by it. It has a small museum with photos and artifacts from her life.You can also see her small spartan bedroom and the room that contains her tomb. It is very holy and quiet with nuns on hand. No photos are allowed, other than of the tomb. It was a very moving place. About an hour is the right time for this site."

Mother_House,Peter F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Spiritual,We had not done our research properly so the museum and Mother Theresa's room were closed. Nevertheless the simplicity and calm of the chapel and her tomb was humbling. There is a story card of her life in the courtyard outside the chapel which my wife and I enjoyed greatly. There are some sisters around and I would encourage you to talk with them as I found that quite moving. Through them Mother Theresa lives on.In our hectic lives we all need a reminder from time to time about leaving a good life and this is somewhere where all of us can remember that.

Lots of gratitude and best wishes to those who follow her and keep her fellowship going.
Mother_House,somersetmackem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Visit to Mother House,"Whilst not religious, more Spiritual, it is impossible not to be moved by a visit to the  resting place of Mother Theresa and wholly inspired by the selfless life she gave. It is wrong to define this as a Tourist destination, and yet that is what it is, but if you are in Kolkata you should visit and maybe you too will have a steelier resolve about helping those in need. "
Mother_House,BeenaDmello,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,More about Mother,A place where you will know what service is and to what extent one can go. Such a quite peaceful campus. You can see Mothers tomb and a museum on Mother's journey. Very heart touching and a bliss to visit this place. Mother's room was under painting so we could not not see. There is a religious article store may not be associated with mother house. Prices bit high as they outsource from kerala.

Mother_House,MizzyUmz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A must to visit !,"My family and I were happy that we made an effort to visit Mother House. An absolutely heart warming experience to read all the humbling achievement Mother Teresa has done and to see the simple life that she lead. We met a volunteer in the house who shared her experiences of growing up in one of the homes. Donations can be made in the upstairs office where receipts are issued or you can drop them in the donation box displayed in the room where her tomb is. There are notices around the house that informs us not to entertain anyone outside claiming to be guide but we still got trailed by a lady who tried guiding us to the nearby children's home and even helped to get us taxi. She then requested for some money which we gladly gave, hoping that it would help her in some ways."

It was a bit noisy on the day I visited , as there were prayers going on in the same room as mother teresa tomb. The adjacent room takes you through her journey from albania to kolkata and beyond. Skeptics would say its selective and propagandist...nevertheless i found it informative. ..then there is the room upstairs from where Mother Teresa supposed to have lived and operated. Touching and a humbling experience to reflect on a person's unrelenting effort, pursuing unwaveringly, a life based on her beliefs. Happy that i  made time for this during our short kolkata visit.  Overwhelming but Inspiring "

This house was one of her creation to serve destitute people. It's peaceful, and it gives inner strength. The room Mother Teresa lived is small, simple and without any facilities of cooling. Everyone who ever gets a chance and a little time in Kolkata should visit the place to learn about simplicity and love for human beings who are marginalized and excluded in society.

Probably better to visit in the late afternoon when it is less humid. We visited the 7 wonders of the world with our young children and found it to be a nice evening stroll as we imagined ourselves travelling around the world to see these UNESCO heritage sites. The surrounding offers some green space with some play equipment for the children. There were a few carts and shops that offer food and drinks. The toilets were gross so be prepared to bring toilet paper and lots of hand hand sanitiser.

Eco_Tourism_Park,atulya_sinha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,KOLKATA’S OWN EIFFEL TOWER,"Re-visiting Eco Park after a gap of four years, my wife and I were amazed to see the new developments that have taken place. Apart from the infrastructure, the upkeep and cleanliness were far beyond our expectations. We entered from Gate no.1, having crossed one of the largest parking lots in the city. The tickets at Rs. 30/- per head seemed a bit steep, but as soon as we entered the Park we told each other that the rate was justified. As we took the curved path along the lake, our first impression was that the lawns were maintained very well. Many visitors were seated on the cast iron benches facing the lake, while the more active ones were boating or riding tandem bicycles. We soon came across a Japanese Garden, with a pagoda and restaurant – which we did not enter, as we were keen to see the rest of the park. A little later, we found ourselves in front of a miniature Eiffel Tower. We could not resist the temptation to take the elevator to the first floor of the little Tower, where we got excellent views of the lake on one side and the green belt on the other side. We continued walking along the path, till we came to the island resort and the guard told us that we had reached the end of the Park. We retraced our steps and took a coffee break at Ajante Café. The ambience was warm and welcoming and the staff were very courteous, but they tested our patience by taking about  forty minutes to serve a plate of chili toast and two cups of coffee. By the time we left the café, it was getting dark, but we continued walking along the lake. We came across the jetty meant for boating and also saw the toy train; apart from a Bengali Village, the Artist Cottage, many life size sculptures of sportspersons, a musical fountain, a herbal garden, a wide choice of restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets, and many other attractions. By then we were quite tired and we exited from Gate no. 3 to find a great choice of sweets at Mishti Hub. Driving along the boundary of the Park, we realized that we had seen only one of the miniature  monuments inside. The others – including Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids and Christ the Redeemer – were all clustered together at the north end. A good reason to visit the Park again very soon!To conclude, your point of entry should be decided by what you intend to do. If you want to take a leisurely walk in the least crowded part of the Park and see just the Japanese Garden and Eiffel Tower, enter at the southern end from Gate no. 1, as we did. If you want to go boating or cycling, it would be best to enter from Gate nos. 2 or 3. Finally, if you want to brave the crowds and see miniature versions of the Seven Wonders (but excluding the Eiffel Tower), you should enter from the north, i.e. Gate nos. 4 or 5."

Thought process behind the development is commendable and well maintained park. But the fun is ruined with huge crowd, most of them were shouting at their high volume without any reason, some have got stereos which were on their full volume and passage of remarks to other visitors. Would be better if some monitoring happens inside to control the loud shouting, unnecessary volume of music system. Presence of considerable number of police personnel will help to stop passing remarks by some visitors and enjoyment of the space by others. General security is good and did not feel any issue."

They have lots of theme areas within the park and its an enjoyable park , if the weather is good. We travelled in a nice weather and the park was teeming with visitors. Preferably visit the park on weekdays as the crowd is a lot on weekends and it becomes little difficult to navigate around.There are golf carts for senior citizens which are absolutely not available on weekends as they are very less in number compared to the crowd. We stood in line for nearly an hour and there was no word when will be get the cart..the officials would not give any information on anything.I wish there was an information booth for tourists like us who would have questions. The other problem was the language. The officials could not answer any question as probably they only understand Bangla..so there was lot of chaos actually as we were traveling with senior citizens. Finally we put them on the AC mini train which goes around the exhibits but this train didn't cover the seven wonders of the world which has been put up near Gate D..For ppl who can walk, its a walk of about 4-5 kms and one can cover everything.. So absolutely avoid weekends and enjoy the park !!!"

The park is huge with an awesome water body adding to the beauty. Replicas of Eiffel tower,  Taj Mahal and Leaning Tower of Pisa give the shutterbugs lots of time to spend.

On three floors, there are approximately 35 galleries.It has almost every historical and cultural detail about India that anyone would want to know. Starting with Hindu Gods, Indian kings and their cultures, different rulers who conquered this country at some point in their lives, and various sculptures and discoveries from various eras of Indian history, there is something for everyone.If you have a desire to know about the historical aspects and cultural values of India, I suggest you visit the Indian Museum in Kolkata at least once in your lifetime; you will not regret it."

However, I credit Kolkata for changing my perception.From the outside, the magnificent white pillars standing tall appear massive and spectacular. As I enter the museum, I notice that it has three floors and 35 galleries. Each floor has a minimum of 1000 years of history. Art, Archaeology, Anthropology, Geology, Zoology, and Botany are said to be the six major sections. The Indian Museum has everything from Egyptian artifacts to Buddhist relics and stores carvings from southern India. It has a Zoological Garden with very unique well-preserved specimens of animal species that are more than 100 years old, which astounded me. Every floor introduces us to a new era in history. There is something for everyone. The fascinating artifacts and relics left me speechless. If you want to go back in time and relive history from prehistoric to modern times.

And I must say anyone and everyone who is interested to capture the rich ancient Indian culture into their hearts and minds should visit, either physically or virtually. For me personally, Mythological tales spark a curious tickle in my senses. Therefore the hypnotizing depiction of Krishna Leela took my words away. There I saw coins of the Greek Kings in Bacteria and India. There were some mesmerizing statues of Sadasiva, Dancing Siva, Goddess Parvati, and Buddha. A panel dedicated to Radha Krishna and more. Apart from the above, I was immensely fascinated by the intrinsically carved structures and handmade Kantha textiles with enormous detailing in them.  Exciting, isn't it?

Mainly Google Arts and Culture tour me only 4 Galleries. •	Gandhara•	Archeology•	Bharhut•	CoinsGandhara.Gandhara gallery was full of artwork on stone. It's a totally breathtaking scenario, knowing and seeing your ancient culture from so close. Gandhara is the origin of the Gupta dynasty. During the Gupta period, he actually worked on art and culture. Ashoka Pillar is proof of their fine artwork. They demonstrated the richness of Indian artwork.ArcheologyMahisasuramardeni, Budha in Dhyanmudra, Bacchanalian Scene, Vishu, Sadasiva, Chariot scene from Mahabharat, Sindhu-Saraswati Civilization, Bodhisattva Maitreya, and many other artworks are there. Seeing all these pieces of art your mind gone ask more than enough. It has a serene atmosphere and a rustic sense. The majority of the relics are enormous and medium-sized statues. The museum features a lovely lawn with some pillars found during the excavation of the remains. You will be welcomed by a sizable model of the city as you enter the museum.BharhutBharhut is a village, famous for relics of Buddhist stupa. This museum's Bharhut Gallery is a portion of the well-known and preserved Buddhist Stupa. It vividly displays many statues and the majority are Buddha. There are also lovely statues of the Buddha, Nataraja (the dancing Shiva), and other gods. Indian Museum has Buddha idols and shattered scriptures of gods revered during the period of the Buddha can be found. Including sculptures of the ""laughing Buddha,"" paintings of Shri Krishna, Ganesha statues, and statues of Buddha and his disciples in various poses, including sitting, standing, and meditating. At that time, idols were really lucky, lovely, and the best artwork imaginable. The room is full of sculptures of Buddha and other Indian mythology gods. Coins.In my favorite room, curving someone’s face on metal without any technology is the next level of skills. I came to know a fact about coins, that in ancient times no coins looks similar to each other, reason when making coins they hit the coin with the hammer. Hard hit on hot coin print the design on the coin, but every time coin maker has to aim for the perfect print. That’s every coin look different. Indian museum has a large number of ancient coins of India. It is described that they have more than 50k coins. They have mentioned how the barter system was invented and developed time by time. Indu-Euro coins, Coins of native states of India, and coins of eastern India, are on display. You can see how skilled and talented our ancestors were. They have done so marvelous work."

All thanks to Google Arts and Culture, I was able to experience a staggering virtual tour. after landing on the Indian Museum page, there was a short introduction to the museum. There they described the history of the museum that was founded in 1814, in the cradle of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.They classified them into three main wings—Archeology, Anthropology, and Art—which are filled with various objects ranging from idols, caskets, mummies, and textiles to the collections of zoological, botanical, and geological surveys of India. They demonstrated the richness of Indian artwork: ancient civilizations; Buddha sculptures; ancient coins; and the various deities with their different ways of worship. They circulated the museum in eight different galleries to explore every corner, so it was easy to understand. The first thing I saw was the Buddha gallery. I have a Buddha statue at my home. I follow him and also read about him. There were so many statues of Buddha in their temples, which explained the story of their lives. It was fascinating to me. I felt like I was actually there. It was so real. There were statues of our gods. Our ancestors used to wear ancient coins, different types of textiles, and dresses. I zoomed into the images and enjoy the details of every piece of art with crystal clarity and without any physical disturbance. There were a variety of items on display, including 292 Indian items, 219 Kolkata items, 213 Dharmatala items, 66 textile items, and 52 fiber arts. They have categorized them so well in different colors with different time agesThere was a small corner where a small model of Taj mahal was placed, which was surrounded by some home décor, utensils, and hand fans. The second thing I liked was the ancient gold coins and how they were used to portray faces or symbols to be used as currency in ancient times. I liked the ancient paintings of gods, the fictitious art with messages, and the paintings of specific people. Engraving the human faces in bronze statues without any modern technology with such perfection is incredible. and some amazing textile work.I'll highly recommend it to those who want to explore these types of places but, due to their problems, can't move out. This is the best option for you. I enjoyed it, and it was an incredible experience for me. Yea, if it was real, then it'd be much better, but I still hope to do more virtual tours in the future."

The 360 degrees view feature effectively compensated for the restrictions that we posed due to me not literally being there. However, it would have been better if we could properly look at each of the pieces and read what is written alongside them. The museum itself looks like a piece of art. It has a rustic feel with a tranquil ambiance. The three main wings- Archeology, Anthropology and Art are filled with various objects ranging from idols, caskets and textiles to the collections of botanical, zoological and geological surveys of India. Even the lighting was soothing and the walls, albeit devoid of any colour, added to the minimalistic yet beautiful layout of the museum. My personal favourites from the displays there include The Bharhut gateway and railings, The Kantha and The Mahisasurmardeni idol. Although, it was a virtual experience, I liked it a lot.

The deities were ""laughing buddha's"" sculptures, Shri Krishna paintings, Ganesha idol, and Gautam Buddha with his disciples in various postures such as sitting, standing, meditating. The idols of that time were really auspicious, beautiful, and the finest work that could be imagined. Clothes paintings, designs were also there which somehow deciphered the clothing pattern, occupation of the people at those times. Barter system was also described which may be the transaction medium like the money today. The significance of human life is depicted through the various paintings, idols which denotes they believed human birth as a way to liberation. The coins of various dynasties such as Gupta, Kastrup, Votive metals were shown which emphasize that India had the well-developed Metallurgy science from the very beginning around the Buddhist period. Various paintings showed music, flute, dance images which denotes our cultural richness.I also come across various technical devices like Filigree Work that seems like cigars but couldn't understand their usage. Sindhu civilization, the drainage system is also described in the writings and paintings. My visit to the Indian Museum was full of learning and excitement which is impossible to get from the books.

Many unique and rare things are preserved and displayed in the galleries of the sections.One of my eye-catching experience was an exhibition titled Indian Buddhist Art,  showcasing masterpieces of Buddhist Art from different parts of the Indian subcontinent. It has shown the life of Siddhartha, better known as Gautama, the Buddha, through sculptures and paintings. One of the sculptures was named “Maya’s Dream” in which Maya Devi(Siddhartha’s Mother)had a dream where she saw a white elephant entering her womb. In sculptures, this theme is presented by a lady asleep on a couch with an elephant hovering over her.All Siddhartha's life stages are preserved as a form of sculptures, from ""Siddhartha's Birth"" to ""First Sermon"". These sculptures carry emotions within themselves, one thing I will like to add from the last sculpture of this exhibition ""Last Stage of Buddha's Life"" Siddhartha's last words were 'Decay is inherent in all living beings. Work out your own salvation with diligence'"
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Sakshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,A must visit place in Kolkata,"I did a virtual visit to the Indian Museum, Kolkata on Google Arts and Culture platform. They provide almost a real-life experience with a 360-degree tour, which includes everything you need to know about an antique. They found the Indian Museum in 1814. It is not only India's oldest and largest multipurpose museum but also the world's largest in the Asia-Pacific region. Its collection has over a hundred thousand pieces and is built into three main wings: archaeology, anthropology, and art.Being a history student, the collection that I was most excited about was the archaeology and art section. It has a collection of artefacts that describes the inspiring story of Lord Buddha and how people ‌preached the lessons and learning of lord buddha. There is an extensive collection that ranges from Standing Buddha, Stupa, Ganesha, Lord Shiva etc. you can see that it broke some of these pieces from one edge which makes you realize that time waits for none. My favourite art piece is of Lord Buddha’s head. The plaster head of the Buddha is a stunning example of Gandhara art. While they kept the top knot and wavy hair, the upward treatment of the brows, half-open lotus bud shaped eyes, and a sense of inner serenity on the face make it less rigid than the traditional Gandhara rigidity. It’s a must-visit place if you’re in Kolkata!"
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Akash negi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Great,"I enjoyed the virtual tour of the museum so far, even though it might be more informative because Kolkata is a culturally diverse city. 1814 was the year when the museum of Kolkata was founded.There is no museum older than this in India. Sections, such as Art, Archaeology, Anthropology, Geology, Zoology, and Economic Botany.Each section has its' own gallery. Many unique things are displayed in the gallery of each section.There is a huge collection of Armors, Sculptures, Mummies, Fossils, and Fibers. Some of the main attractions are the sculptures of Devi Durga, the Egyptian mummy, skeletons of dinosaurs, footprints of Buddha, and different types of fossils and fabrics.They beautifully displayed the clothing of the people of our country India. In addition, there is a section with masks and weapons from medieval India.Having a tour of this museum was overall a worthwhile experience for me. I recommend visiting it to everyone."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Akash mumbai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,"Indian Museum, Kolkata. A virtual tour","I visited the Indian Museum of Kolkata while I was at home. In the museum, several sections offer the visitors to experience medieval statues, paintings, fish species, rocks section, different kinds of civilizations in the medieval ages, etc. The part that struck me was the Antiquely sculpted medieval statues of gods and goddesses. Being someone who is a firm believer in God this place is something I could not have missed. Most of the statutes were broken as they are many centuries old, which gave me an insight into that era. The bronze artifacts froze me because I was surprised by the amount of detailing done on them. An entire section depicts a scene from Indian mythological stories like goddess Durga killing demons, Lord shiva dancing, and lord Krishna playing the flute. A separate section is dedicated to Antique buddha idols which look marvelously beautiful. There is one section that has a replica of diverse fish species.I also found antique shawls used by the monarchs. Handicraft items with handmade detailing were something I felt like taking with me and having on my tea table.  I was fascinated to revisit the story of evolution in this museum. As it has paintings of the universe coming into existence, depiction of the entire series of human evolution from Dryopithecus until now i.e. homo sapiens. The fact museum has a dedicated section for a variety of antique coins used in the world. it was lovely that I was reminded the fact of the barter system in the olden era just to realize how digitalized things have become now. If you look out for beautiful and raw historic evidence of civilizations, mythology, or Human existence this is a must-visit and can be done virtually while you are still home."

Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Anjan Sengupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,Needs urgent attention,I had a second opportunity to visit this museum in March 2021 and I was saddened to see the deteriorating condition of the building at many places.The museum has lots and lots of different antiques starting from the skeletons of extinct animals to fossils of different objects. This place even has a Big Ashok Stambh and an Egg of a Dinosaur.But the thing that makes this place unique in India is a 4000 year old Egyptian Mummy which is the only Mummy present in India.The building of the Museum needs urgent attention for repai  renovation. Overall a nice place to visit.
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,The Shots Of My Life,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Oldest Museum in India,"The building is in pristine white and exudes a class of its own. It is the oldest and biggest museum in India, founded by the Asiatic Society of Bengal.It houses a brilliant plethora of antiques, fossils, paintings, war time weapons, armours, skeletons and a wide variety of flora, fauna, art and handicrafts displays. We especially liked the Egypt gallery, the underwater world and fossils, as well as the marvel, the moon rock."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,atulya_sinha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,INDIA'S OLDEST AND BIGGEST MUSEUM,"The Indian Museum (established in 1814) is the oldest and biggest museum in India. It is older than the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC established in 1849, as well as the Uffizi in Florence, which did not become a museum till 1865. American author Mark Twain, who visited this museum in 1895, described it as “an enchanted place of Indian antiquities.” He further wrote, “Indeed a person may spend half a year among the beautiful and wonderful things without exhausting their interest.”The Indian Museum has been extensively renovated and re-organized during its bicentenary celebrations. The exterior has been painted yellow, instead of the original white (however, the walls surrounding the central courtyard are still white). There is a separate ticket counter which can be accessed without entering the building. A cloak room is available alongside where one can leave one’s belongings before entering. Tickets cost Rs. 50/- for adults and Rs. 20/- for children, with additional charges for cameras (however, photography is not permitted in some of the galleries). Since the ceilings are quite high, one must climb about 50 steps to reach the upper floor. There is a grand staircase in front, and two lesser staircases at the far corners of the building. There is a large grassy central courtyard, where many visitors like to rest. There is a lift, but it is meant to be used only by senior citizens and the differently abled.Well-maintained washrooms are located beyond the staircase in the right-hand corner of the ground floor. It is advisable to use them before proceeding to the first floor, since there are no washrooms there. The major galleries are located on two floors. The ground floor has galleries devoted to archaeology, sculptures, coins, anthropology, geology, etc., while the first floor has the Egyptian and Painting galleries, apart from the botanical and zoological ones. A very fine Roman-style marble statue of Queen Victoria, donated by the Maharaja of Burdwan, occupies a central location on the first floor. A marble bust of “Rai Omrito Nath Mitter Bahadur 1847-1908”, trustee and treasurer of the museum, is displayed on the right landing of the main staircase. Since I had reached the museum at about 3pm and it was to close at 5pm, I decided to visit a limited number of galleries. I spent a few minutes in the Siwalik Vertebrate Fossil gallery located to the left of the main entrance, where a remarkable pair of elephant tusks is on display. Since the day was pleasant, I spent some time viewing the sculptures displayed in the verandah surrounding the courtyard. Next I visited the Egyptian gallery on the first floor. It turned out to be quite small, and most of the exhibits were replicas. However, the presentation and upkeep were quite good. I spent more than an hour in the Paintings gallery on the first floor. This gallery is lined with old wooden cabinets along balconies located near the ceiling, accessed by winding staircases. These are not in use now and they have been sealed off. This gallery also has magnificent windows facing the road, which have also been sealed off while artificial lighting has been installed. There is a rich collection of paintings on display, including miniatures from Mughal, Rajasthani, Pahari and Company/Patna schools, along with water colours and a few oil paintings from the Bengal School. There are several paintings by Abnindranath Tagore, who served as the vice-principal of the adjacent Government College of Art in the early twentieth century. While the presentation is well organized, the lighting leaves much to be desired. The illumination level is good, but the bulbs are mounted near the ceiling, creating the effect of the harsh sunlight of noon. Secondly, the paintings are framed behind regular instead of non-reflective glass. Hence if one tries to photograph any of the paintings, there are multiple reflections on the glass. There is a small gift shop located near the exit, offering a small selection of picture post cards and replicas of sculptures, in addition to books. There is much scope for expansion and diversification here. I would also welcome small books and pamphlets which can guide visitors as they pass through the galleries. In addition, there can be audio guides which are a standard feature of reputed museums nowadays, providing information for the visitors and bringing revenue for the museum."

I loved the masks display on the 3rd floor (with special hidden access from the fish exhibition on the second floor). I also enjoyed the Mughal miniature paintings. This hall is beautiful.

Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Sea Dweller,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,One of the oldest museums in the world.,"The Indian Museum was founded by Danish biologist Nathaniel Wallich in Serampor, near Calcutta in 1814.From 1814 to 1878, the museum’s funds were located in the premises of the Asian Society in Calcutta, but later moved to their own premises. The museum mansion contains: the Egyptian mummy, a Buddhist stupa from Bharut, the ashes of Buddha, the Ashoka column, whose symbol with three lions has become the official emblem of the country and is present on the coat of arms of India. In addition, the museum stores fossils of prehistoric animals, stuffed animals of India and other parts of the world.Unfortunately, the museum building, as well as the exhibits themselves, are in rather poor condition. For storing stuffed animals and skeletons of ancient animals, as well as for storing works of art, special conditions of humidity and temperature are required, which, unfortunately, are not here."

I fully realize that is a third world museum with limited resources, but there is so much you can do with what you have.  The painting are displayed with no the thematic or historical context.  There is no educational activity in the museum to make average Indian become acquainted with the important painters of Bengal.  Everything becomes a backdrop for people taking selfies.  As an Indian who left this country, I was saddened to see its culture and history languishing in the background.  Interestingly, it is not easy to figure out where most of the great Bengali paintings are located in Kolkata. There are a few scattered paintings at Jorasanko Thakur Bari, again without any descriptions or context."

It was started in 1814 and so the ninth oldest museum of world and unmatched in Asia Pacific region.3. There are 35 galleries and display includes antiques,fossils, artefacts and paintings.4.The magnificent building is in Italian style and comprises of three floors,each spans across approx 930 sq meters of area.5. It is famous by the name of Jadu Ghar or Magic House among the locals as most exhibits are not less than the wonder for us.6. It has such vast collections which makes it impossible to be throughly covered within time span of one day.7.The building itself is very beautiful but at the end the poor maintenance of most of the area makes the whole experience  miserable.8. The campus including Toilets is buzzing with staff but no one is concerned about their duty else all have arrogant body language and unconcerned attitude.9.After visiting this museum and finding it full of treasures an obvious feeling towards the authorities comes which is a request to proper supervision and due maintenance.10.A museum shop is also there but mostly of no use though has great potential."

Apparently it is the oldest museum in India and ninth oldest in the world.  It dates back to 1814.  It has a new gallery full of Masks from different regions and traditions in India.  These were absolutely lovely, but then I specialise in mask.  For others the galleries of fabrics and art work, including some painting by famous Indian artists, were fascinating.  There were large amounts of big boned skeletons, fossils and, apparently, mummies somewhere but I was less interested in those.  I was there for 3 hours and only saw a part of it.   Be aware that you're not supposed to take food in - I had 2 bananas which I was allowed on the grounds I wouldn't eat them while inside - they caused the guards some amusement! There was plenty of space to walk around slowly even though there were a lot of visitors.  The Victoria Memorial and St Pauls are a short walk away if you want to cover all three on the same day.  The building has a faded grandeur and is clearly in need of investment for its upkeep.  Well worth a visit.  Closed on Mondays."

You have to pay for photography on entry, but everything you want to take photographs of is restricted. There should more English translations and the glass screens all need cleaning, and items on display need dusting. It is very difficult to appreciate anything. There also needs to be some proper a/c.

South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Dr. Parikshet Sirohi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Reminder of the Raj!,"It was one of the earliest non-church cemeteries in the world, and probably the largest Christian cemetery outside Europe and America in the 19th century. Opened in 1767 on what was previously a marshy area, the cemetery was in use until about 1830 and is now a heritage site, protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The cemetery was opened to relieve the pressure on the old burial ground in the heart of the city. The road leading to the cemetery came to be known as the Burial Ground Road, but was subsequently renamed as 'Park Street' after the park around Vansittart's garden house. By the year 1785, the burial ground had been extended on the northern side of Park Street, and by 1840, a vast new cemetery was opened to the east of the Lower Circular Road. The Europeans started to disuse it in the year 1790. It has been confirmed by a marble plaque at the gate which reads ""South Park Street, Opened:1767, Closed:1790""."

South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Padmini15,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Out of sheer curiosity!!,I had heard so much about this place and hence decided to visit it on a winter afternoon in December. The cemetery became functional in 1767 and closed down in 1790. Well maintained they charge an entry fee and walking around we had a lot to explore. Henry Louis Vivian Derozio has been buried here. Longevity was a major issue with all those who had been laid to rest here as most of them did not cross forty and needless to say they were mainly Europeans. Probably they succumbed to the heat of the Indian subcontinent. This peaceful environment gives you time to ponder over so many things. One particular tomb was a comfortable bed for an old woman. It was a wonderful experience being here.

He has a special place in his heart for a certain Henry Loius Vivian Derozio - poet, teacher, educator, radical & free thinker - all this before he so tragically died of cholera at the age of 22. We managed to locate his grave & just stood there in silence, thinking about the man who started the Young Bengal movement at the age of 17, brought about social reform and inspired so many young Bengali youth to open themselves to free thought.

Thousands of large mausoleums bear witness to the personal wealth of European (mostly British) travellers in the 18th and 19th century who made Calcutta a home far from home. Many died young, very many only in their 20s, but the tributes recorded are both touching and remarkable for the ambition they represent. We enjoyed a couple of hours picking through this little oasis of quiet and times past. Thoroughly recommended if you enjoy a bit of history and personal tales."

It is not a fixture on the tourist circuit. Located on the fashionable Park Street, the entrance to the Cemetery is so nondescript that it is easy to miss it.  Once inside, the visitor is transported to a different era. There are numerous mausoleums and they are like the pages of a history book. The stories of individuals making requisite reading and tell us of lives that form the fibres of the tapestry that is India. Many of the structures are in a state of repair and will probably be destroyed by the assails of the weather or the roots of the vegetation that abounds the cemetery. The spot is serene and it is not difficult to spend an hour or two in the quiet surroundings of the cemetery. The architecture of the mausoleums ranges from simple structures to elaborate European designs.  A few have incorporated elements of Indian designs (e.g. Kalinga). This place is definitely worth a visit."

It's ticketed and quite well-maintained (from a tourist point of view).It was a serene and somewhat peaceful experience walking through this place. It's an old cemetery, so you expect to feel spooked or little fuzzy (it's supposed to be one of the most haunted places in India), but during the day, the illusion is broken by the many visitors, a few couples trying to steal some private time and the tall modern buildings on the horizon of this place. We kept reading many of the epitaphs, surprised to find that so many those buried here died very young. There were even whole families buried together, some who died within a span of few months or years. There must be so many stories here to tell.There are a few tombs of note - the one of Hindoo Stuart (adorned with many Hindu deities) and Sir William Jones (probably the biggest tomb), the great philologist who ""discovered"" the link between Indian and European languages."

My only problems with Science City (which is why I haven't given it four or five stars) is that some parts could be better maintained and cleaned (especially the eating areas), and that in some attractions, there is too much emphasis in giving the audio-based information in Hindi (without any subtitles or audio in either English or Bengali) which means that it is not particularly ideal or inclusive for foreign tourists (I am one of them, as while I can understand bits of Hindi, I can't speak the language) who are visiting the area or even some locals who want to hear the information in Bengali. Apart from these issues, it was a relatively good experience overall."

Science_City,Janet B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Visiting Science City,"This is a highly modernistic complex with lots to see and do. The entrance gate brings you into a well-tended garden with pools and animated sculptures driven by water. A cable-car ride takes visitors over the whole complex. One of the buildings, dealing with life sciences, was not open, but in the time we had we got to see plenty. We visited the space and technology building and found the displays extremely informative and well put together. The demonstrations of physics and mechanics using hands-on installations were a lot of fun, and informative too. One great surprise was an up-to-the-day exhibition of the Corona virus, which in mid-February was only just revealing its potential as a pandemic. There were two staff posted at the display to answer questions. This exhibit alone indicated to us the devotion and interest of the museum staff. The upper part of the building was laid out in a descending spiral where the exhibits were based on powers of 10 - magnifying upwards to the entire universe and downwards to the sub-atomic world. We can highly recommend Science City and hope that the building we couldn't visit will soon be open."

Science_City,Sadhana yadav,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Rude and rough behavior of a staff who takes the tickets allows entry,Well. Yesterday I took a trip to science city very excited with my husband and five year old son.  There was a long queue and as it was our first visit so there was a bit confusion about the 3d shows. Their cost and timings. We waited patiently and even the man who was giving out tickets was very patient and gave full information to us about show timings. As we advanced with tickets to the gate of entry the middle aged man who was dark complexioned and half bald without giving me any instructions started to scream so badly about the lever that is supposed to be pushed before entering the gates. Actually my five year old son had bent and entered the premises and I was trying to take hold of him. He screamed so loudly and continued it for two three minutes. I was so horrified that I couldn't say anything. But is this the way a staff a gatekeeper who just allows entry talk with a lady. I was very embarrassed and depressed my husband was furious about to argue but it was in vain. We saw the three d rides and behavior of all staff member s was very very cordial. But I must say this man at the entry gate should be taught a lesson of politeness as we r also paying for his service. How can the behavior of the staff inside the premises especially the life of treesWas so cordial and decent whereas at the entry gate such kind of rude frustrated person s there whose only job s too allow entry at the gate after checking tickets. Please let me know how can I file a written complaint against this man because I don't want other ladies to face the same embarrassment. Sadhana yadav

Science_City,Sumit Kasera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,A good place that could have been much better,"Located bang opposite the ITC sonar and very close to the Mirania Lake is the Science City – a hub to satiate the curiosity of the inquisitive mind. Its website states the goal of the place to be presenting science and technology in a stimulating and engaging environment that is truly educational and enjoyable for the people of all ages. An entry ticket of Rs 50 plus an additional ticket for ropeway of Rs 48/- (really 48?) let us in. Essentially, the Science City consists of two parts, the Science Centre and the Convention Centre. -	The Science Centre complex comprises Space Odyssey, Dynamotion, Science Exploration Hall, Maritime Centre, Earth Exploration Hall and a sprawling Science Park. I-	The Convention Centre complex comprises the Main Auditorium of 2232 seating capacity, one Mini Auditorium of 392 seating capacity and a Seminar hall complex consisting of 11 halls ranging from 15 to 100 seating capacity, an indoor (270sq.m.) and an open air exhibition ground (20000 sq. m). The auditoria’s and the seminar halls are fully air-conditioned. We are told that the Convention Centre of Science City is a major destination in the city of Kolkata for conventions, conferences, AGMs, trade exhibitions and cultural programmes. Not being far from airport and being very close to some top luxury hotels My visit spanning few hours was limited to only few parts of the Science Centre. May be much more time was needed to see the city in its entirety. So coming back to the ropeway, it was a short journey within the large expansive science city. The ropeway seemed old and in dire need for a refresh. It was crowded, and one felt that visitor delight was not a priority for the administrators. The few minute ride left us close to the Dynamotion hall.  One of the good parts of the visit was the “Science on a sphere” a 30 min show that was held in a fairly largish circular auditorium. It tried to explain how the earth looked from far above. Apart from this, there were plethora of interactive exhibits on physical science. I found that the place had somehow not kept pace with the improvements in modern science. Outside the hall, there were some sub-standard eateries. There was lot of litter left by numerous visitors to the place. The large place offered lot of opportunity to walk around – in the nice January winter of Kolkata. Overall, while the intention was good, I felt the place could become a bigger tourist attraction through innovation, modern technology and better upkeep."
Science_City,Rinku B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Great with kids up to 13,"This is a fun thing to do with younger children. The grounds are clean and grean, especially during cooler weather. There are plenty of interactive exhibits and you can usually catch a themed movie. The complexity of the exhibits however are best suited for younger children. Although the shows would engage older people as well. The grounds are good to walk around. I think it is a good way to spend half a day doing something educational in the city."

After the show at 7:15 pm, when we were out the staff and security started swiching off the other sections and exhibits. When we asked them they recklessly told "" this is like this only and we close one by one sections from 7:30 pm itself. But when I insisted and increased my voice about the closing time mentioned at ticket counter as 8 pm they are simply laughing and making fun of us in the local launguage. Very very disgusting.

There are 3D shows and movie shows that can be watched for few rupees. This is a family hangout place and kids will definately be in love with. No nearby railhead is there so one can reach this place by bus or taxi only.
Science_City,kamakshi2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,The novelty of the theme park,I came here after a friend recommended it . Far away from the city - The traffic was very bad and the only attraction was the rope way . It is good for 5he families with kids - could be a nice  outing . The ticket of the rope way was high and not worth the trouble . Ample parking and generally not crowded .

Science_City,Kathy T,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Bad choice ,Such a poorly organised and maintained place. No maps or signage explaining the way around. It's pretty much guesswork. You enter after a serpentine queue only to come in and find out there are more queues for the 3D shows. A place with potential but terribly managed.Only thing we enjoyed was the ropeway (cable car ride). Again there was no indication of wait time etc.Traveller tip - don't take the ropeway ride into the facility. You're better off taking the one out as this is practically empty.

Comparing to where I come from it was really disappointing. Most of the attractions were not working properly, people used and treated everything really badly. The toilets are disgusting. Didn’t have a chance to see the shows, maybe If I would, I would like a little bit more."

Science_City,TravbuddiesIndia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Love it or hate it—the city will always amaze you,"Never mind from where it came—there are several explanations about the etymology of the name Kôlikata (Bengali: কলিকাতা) [ˈkɔlikat̪a]. What matters is it’s a name of a city whose existence can be traced back to over two millennia as indicated by the archeological discovery in Chandraketugarh—a place several kilometers away. Since then, this city of joy, love, passion, desperation, protest, and revolution is breathing. Maybe battered and bruised by many historical and social upheavals, but the city and its people are relentlessly in pursuit of living—realizing their dream of what they think is the best of life.History of modern Calcutta started with the advent of British Raj in the form of East India Company appearing in these parts of India and established Fort William. It had been an astonishing journey from a fishing village to a great city of pomp and grandeur. That was one of the earliest signs of colonial British intentions. They came and indeed contributed to the skyline of the city—it became known as City of Palaces. When you travel today, in the midst of modern and recent buildings, you can still find vestiges of colonial India in lanes and bylanes of erstwhile Park Street and Theatre Road and many other places. Travel on foot and there is no dearth of interesting elements you will encounter with. Life is flowing in this city in its own pace. Some says it’s dying; some says it has already culminated to a state of no-return—even then no one ever succeeds to avoid its charm, the vibrancy, and exceptional variety of Calcutta.While traveling, your experience will range from a cultural sojourn to a culinary experience. Walking down the memory lane itself is a worthy tour here. History has evolved in many dimensions; every building and road and roadside shop has a unique story to tell. Love it or hate it—the city will always amaze you."

Science_City,tumbleweedchris,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Kitsch Abound,"Science City has probably seen better days. There are enormous, cavernous buildings in the complex that are closed (such as the dino building). Because of the giant scope of the attraction, that still leaves plenty buildings and attractions open to poke around at. Of the existing attractions, they are not necessarily in the best shape, but for people that are fans of roadside attractions, it has a high level of kitsch appeal. There are also a few upcharge attractions. I recommend checking out the evolution dark ride. The rest of the upcharge attractions can be skipped. If you like polished, award winning museums, skip Science City. If you like cheesy, kitsch, give it a try."

All the scientific installations are age old and outdated the place is not well maintained and most of the best screenings are non operational due to renovations. The panorama show was abruptly ended due to lazy government employees and overall it’s not an inspiring place atol for kids or adults. Science has gone way ahead then what’s been displayed 😂

Perhaps two decades ago when its gates first opened this was an attraction that was entertaining as it was informative.

If you're hoping for disappointment walk the gates of Science City. "

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,Dr. Parikshet Sirohi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Spectacular,"Located across the Birla Planetarium, the Cathedral is the seat of the Diocese of Calcutta. The cornerstone was laid in 1839, while the rest of the building was completed in 1847. Said to be the largest church in Kolkata and the first Anglican cathedral in Asia, it was also the first new-built cathedral in the overseas territory of the British Empire. The edifice stands on Cathedral Road on the ""island of attractions"" to provide for more space for the growing population of the European community in Calcutta in the 1800s. The architectural design is ""Indo-Gothic"", which is a Gothic architectural style designed to meet the climate of India. Following the 1897 earthquake and the subsequent massive earthquake of 1934, when Calcutta suffered substantial damage, the cathedral was reconstructed to a revised design. The cathedral complex has a library, situated over the western porch, and a display of plastic art forms and some other memorabilia."

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Magnificent!,"Saint Paul’s Cathedral is an Anglican Church & was the first of its kind within the erstwhile British territory, outside of Great Britain. The cathedral was damaged twice in earthquakes.Lighter bricks were used to build the Cathedral but these bricks also could withstand extreme temperatures & natural disasters. After paying an entry fee of INR 10, I walked down to the white facade which looked absolutely magnificent.The moment I laid my eyes on the tall structure, my jaw dropped at its surreal appearance. The interior has a high ceiling, carved pews, frescoes & reliefs. A number of the memorial reliefs were dedicated to soldiers & officers of the British Army who had fallen in the two World Wars & other battles.Seeing the chiselling of marble done so finely was a treat to my eyes. I wish I could have clicked a few pictures but photography was prohibited inside."

It was around 11.30am, we went in our car to see this beautiful Church. There is a parking space available inside the gate.When we got down of the car, all we could hear is nothing but the birds and the peaceful atmosphere. Since, it was the very next day of Christmas, there was a beautiful and a big crib still available for people to see it.We entered the church, and ensured we put our phones on silent and also, ensure not to click any photographs as per the instructions mentioned there. There is loads to read to understand the history of the church. The church is so big and so beautiful, your heart suddenly feels the peace and the positive vibes coming from it. Those old benches to pray are simply extraordinary. When you go right ahead and see the setup you will simply be mesmerized.The church is huge and has an extremely high ceiling. When we came out after praying, we noticed there were few counters to make charity and one small stall was put up to buy rosaries and other things.We did go with our 1.5year old and it was not bad at all. But, if you wish to go please ensure that your child is not cranky, as you may not be able to enjoy the peace and place.To summarize, do visit this once atleast once, as it's only 10mins walking distance from Victoria Palace and 2mins by cab.Don't miss both the beauties.

It was also known as Tollygunge station until 25th August 2009 when it was re-christened to Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro Station, after the name of the great actor.But currently this place is good for regular travellers but not for people using this as a shelter during daily commute.

If AC not working heat and sweat. There are seats saying for older people but not necessarily for pensioner old people . Therefore with little touch of white in hair can be classed as old men  and allow  one to sit and also saw women with head and face cover would sit , no way of knowing if old. People now depends on this underground for everyday travel,and number increasing massively for  low fare ,hope for travel fast, ,but other forms of transport like tram almost non existent ,once tried to stop a tram in college street ,didn’t stop ,saw one man running and somehow jumped in, though song about tram went on everyday again in again in underground platform . About Bus ,no double or three tire bus are running, few fast bus just pass by ,no time to see even where those are going to. Private bus don’t stop to let people in, one have to run and jump in. Saw one young man tried to run, his mobile fell on street, bus still didn’t stop. Minibus ,if can get , only other means but again have to jump to get in. Best is walking if have time but pavements are all taken over by traders  and not continuous , road crossings dangerous. For this big city underground metro needs massive improvement and regular maintenance works, And alternative mode of transports .but in general in almost all cities world wide underground trains are overcrowded and are more expensive ."

Not to mention there can be some weird/dodgy people in the market (I visited the market last week with my family and there was an old shopkeeper who followed us around even when we told him we didnt need any help - people really need to learn not to pester people if they know where to go or are not interested in seeing a particular shop - and it's best to also take care in case there are pickpocketers).Its a shame because this is a market/shopping centre right in the central part of Kolkata and so it could have easily been a great indoor shopping mall/market (I have visited a few indoor shopping malls in the outskirts of Kolkata and they definitely put this place to shame) catering for all but lack of investment and maintenance have both let this place down (I'm just surprised there’s hardly any plans in place to improve it)."

The central area where there was a canon...our meeting place of convenience. Nahoums run by the Jewish bakers. Flurys giving it stiff competition. Spacious. Shopping was a rare pleasure. They used to say if you show the cash you can get tiger's milk here at midnight. Today? Today I weep. The place reeks of urine. The ceiling may collapse on your head.

New_Market,Jayanto_mohanto,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,The New New Market,"I visited New Market quite recently to remind me of the old Calcutta I knew. However to be honest its too crowded and doesn't at all resemble the Calcutta I wanted to see. There is a sea of hawkers on the streets and its almost impossible to walk on the road without bumping into people, hawkers, their wares and the occasional rough biker you come across. The place is too noisy and there is hardly anything which is expected from a major market. Prices are exorbitant and the shopkeepers seem hell bent on fleecing you. There are a few branded shops which are generally invisible due to the flow of hawkers on the streets. The adjacent Lindsay street is full of branded shops but then its is equally crowded and to make matters worse, there are vehicles honking non-stop on the road. The only consolation is the eating joints which still serve good food and there is a Mumbai style Khao Galli right in between the (erstwhile) Lighthouse and New Empire cinema halls.Also the New (New Market) building still has walking space and has variety of choices for the shopper. Do not expect great bargains as the shopkeepers seem uninterested.  "
New_Market,ValquiriaMar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,I hoped more from the New Market,"The way the vendors' approach tourists is a bit scaring.

Instead, you can enjoy the sights and sounds, indulge in some street food and shop to your heart's content.Tip: If your Kolkata trip revolves around shopping, I would suggest you book a hotel near new market.

New_Market,Shireen S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,The Essence of Kolkata,"This venerable Kolkata institution is also one that evokes a lot of nostalgia in NRIs such as myself and is a great place to find unexpected little treasures and great bargains if you know where to look and how to haggle. My recommendation would be to go with a local if you do not wanted to be ridiculously cheated as almost nothing comes with a price tag and on the spot verbal quotes are given by the shopkeepers or their assistants depending on their lightening fast assessment of the depths of your pockets or gullibility. However I still choose to negotiate its warren of passages and narrow corridors not to mention the constant chant of the shopkeepers to step into their respective cubes to find various items that are either not available in the multiple glitzy malls that have mushroomed across the city and/or are hugely overpriced at those places. During my last 2 visits I was especially impressed by the quality and variety of merchandise at the haberdashery stores that are located in New New Market ie the section that was rebuilt after a part of the market was destroyed in a fire a few decades ago. I almost can’t wait to go back to stock up on all kinds of laces, appliqués, ribbons, embroidered panels and other goodies. Of course there are lots of other sections that specialize in antiques and handicrafts, gold, silver and stone jewelry, costume jewelry and especially colorful glass bangles, food, cheese and confection, clothes and unstitched dress materials, shoes and leather goods and near the front entrances on Lindsay streets a row of florists specializing in some of the most magnificent and breathtaking bouquets and floral decorations that I have ever seen. Definitely worth checking out this pretty, pulsating if somewhat overwhelming commercial heart of colonial and contemporary Kolkata."

Even after adequate parking facilities were developed, driving a car to the parking space or coming out becomes a nightmare most of the time. The situation has been worsened by encroachments of peddlers and hawkers on the street, thereby clogging and choking even the pedestrians. Be that as it may, it still is an attractive place to shop, with different types of products available here in wide varieties."

Birla_Temple,Sumit Kasera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Beautiful temple to see the legacy of Birlas,"The major business family of India including the Tatas and Birlas always had a rich tradition of doing lot of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities. These families have created plethora of beautiful temple, hospitals, schools and other activities. The Birla mandir in Kolkata and in many other cities made are extension of this rich tradition. Wiki tells us that “A national chain of the ""Birla temples,"" temples of grandiose scale and design, have become major landmarks and part of the cityscapes of Indian urban life in the late twentieth century. The Birla temples exist in conjunction with other large industrial and philanthropic ventures of the wealthy Birla family, including major institutions of technology, medicine, and education.” Birla Mandir exists in many cities of India including Varanasi, Delhi, Kanpur, Kolkata, Jaipur and many other cities. These are typically made in white marble or sandstone. In Kolkata, it is easily reachable in Ballygunge area. Since we used Uber, was not sure about the parking. The temple opened in morning from 5.30 A.M. to 11 A.M and at 4.30pm in the evening till 9pm. We went in the evening and a small crowd gathered around. As soon as gates opened, it dissipated pretty soon. There was small room at the entrance that kept our shoes for a small fee as shoes were not allowed inside the main temple. The sanctum sanctorum was richly decorated, and temple was dedicated to Lord Krishna and Radha. There were other deities in the temple as well. While there were no fees, the mesmerizing experience was mildly soured by constant demand for some money by the staff working there for the security and upkeep. For sure, the temple is a beautiful place to go and fall in awe for an hour to see the legacy of the Birlas."
Birla_Temple,rajarshi2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Is the story behind the Temple true?,"Impressive when you see it from outside, though does not look very grand once you view it from close quarters. However, what intrigued me was the story I heard from a friend of mine who knows the Birla family well. It seems that construction at the temple will never end, because apparently the Birla scion (GD Birla) who began constructing the temple in 1970 had a dream that the Birla business empire would collapse the day construction at this temple ended. Hence, there is always some work or the other in progress at the site.Worth a visit if you in the locality and have nothing better to do."

Dad had come to Kolkata to attend some conference, I guess-Lions if I am correct. We undertook this visit then and the experience still resonattes inside me. I had the same feelings rush in when I took my elder son to this temple. Immediately my memory cells began to function, and I recollected my thopughts when I visitied with my father. That time, I don't remeber keeping our shoes  in the shoe counter. The place is very very clean and very well organised. The  sight of too many Security men was a sore point, which was not there earlier. But, I think, changes in societal norms and behaviour necessitates that.The feeling of divinity was still percolating. I felt glad that I could replicate what my father did to me, to my elder son, though it was absolutely unintended and came as a divine surprise to me."

The entire effect is magical.James Prinsep pioneered the idea of building a tunnel to drain swamps & decoded the Brahmi script. His Memorial is in the Palladian style – six sets of Ionian columns holding a 40’ white roof.Due to increasing graffiti on the walls, the administration has cordoned off entry inside the Memorial.Sit in the Memorial lawn & then visit the riverside. To get to the Ghat, you've to first cross railway tracks of a railway station called Prinsep Ghat Station. On the other side, stone steps lead to the Ganges.Walking along the Ghat, you can see it's a popular place to meet friends, chat over bhelpuris & watch the Ganges flow. James Prinsep Ghat is a splendid place to evoke – nostalgia, old world charm, life’s calling, spirituality…No entry fees."

Prinsep_Ghat,Anjan Sengupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,An emotional connect for me!!,It was December 1992 when my father took me and my brother to show the then newly built Vidyasagar Setu in a bus from my Maternal Grandparents’ place in Norh Kolkata and we were stopped at the entry of the Bridge as pedestrians were not allowed. My father then had discovered the tiny Railway Station at Princep Ghat on the Kolkata Circular Railway to take us back to Dum Dum Junction and then back home.I had an opportunity to visit the same Princep Ghat and the Railway Station after more than 28 years in March 2021 and my mind was full of the memories of that day and my deceased father.Sitting on the banks of the Ganges just adjacent to the Railway Station has an extraordinary feeling altogether. very nice place to spend some time in Kolkata.

Prinsep_Ghat,Srikanth_Sudhir,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A walk and a row,"A well maintained walk with views of the two iconic bridges across the Hoogly. One the the landings afford you the option of taking a boat ride which gives you a better view of the bridges. The boat ride is a bit disappointing though. While it lasts 30 minutes as committed (costs INR400), the distance traveled is negligible, so you are basically shelling out the money to float on the Hoogly for 30 minutes. It still does afford gorgeous photo-opportunities though."

Prinsep_Ghat,KennethEast,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Wonderful walk on promenade from Prinsep Ghat along the Hooghly,"Fodor's pitched the walk on the Prinsep Ghat-Babu Ghat Promenade.  Thank you, Fodor's!  It was a wonderful Sunday morning walk along a nicely maintained riverside path where mostly locals were taking a morning outing.  We saw few other non-Indians.  Important tip!  Take a taxi, uber or tuk tuk to the Prinsep Ghat!  We tried to walk through the parks to the Prinsep Ghat.  Looks doable from tourist maps. But the roads along the river are major, elevated, and confusing.  We finally grabbed a cab.  You'll come across many people taking their morning bath in the Hooghly.  There are many small boats for hire along the route.  We didn't hire one, but wish we had.  We later took a river cruise instead, which was a disappointment.  The small oar boats looked more interesting.  There are several places where you can exit the promenade.  We walked past the Eden Gardens and then explored the old colonial area near the General Post Office.  It was a delightful walk and served as our introduction to Kolkata."

I waas excited to visit here after travelling from all the way from Darjeeling.The behaviour of the museum's security guards and staff was so rude that I refused to even enter the museum. It was difficult to navigate the museum so by mistake we entered a gate where there was no notification or barricade of ""NO ENTRY"", the security guards screamed and insulted us thrice even after we politely apologised to them. After that they also asked for our mobile phone to check the gallery , we co-operated and showed them, but even after then they insulted us in front of the public over there. They have no rights to touch our phone and go through our phone's gallary. They have absolutely no manners to talk to a women.I have been to other museums in Kolkata and heritage site, never faced this issue.

There are no photographs permitted inside Tagores house. If you ask a security personnel, they don't know the reason but vehemently defend the rule by shouting at anyone who dares to feel inspired by Kobiguru's words and paintings and wants to retain a bit of it through their cell phone camera.4. The premise is patrolled by numerous roaming security guards - who seem jobless most of the time. The museum closes at 5:00 pm, but these normally lethargic guards become active and start shouting at the guests to leave by 4:45.5. Once inside the house, the atmosphere is great with a faint robindro sangeet playing in the background.6. Kobiguru's personal belongings are unkempt, not lighted and moth balled. I could see tears on his robe.What an inspiring place this could be but .... I was saddened to see all of this. Overall a very unwelcome place, that has so much potential."
Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Suzanne F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Very worthwhile,"Set aside hours for this museum. Rabindranath Tagore was an amazing man, and you'll learn all about him here., along with his family. His nephews were revolutionary visual artists, as well. "
Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,atulya_sinha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,THE HOME OF THE TAGORES,"Jorasanko Thakurbari features prominently in the autobiographies of Rabindranath Tagore and his nephew Abanindranath. It was known as a centre of vocal and instrumental music, acting and stage décor, poetry and play readings, sketching and painting, and much else. Above all, it was the home of the illustrious Tagore family. The Thakurbari consists of three interconnected structures built in different centuries. Ram Bhavan, the earliest building at the site, was built by Nilmani Tagore (1729-91) when he shifted there from Pathurighata in 1784. The triple-storied main building, which forms the main façade that one sees while entering from Rabindra Sarani, is Maharshi Bhavan, named after Mahirshi Debendranath Tagore. Finally, the smaller building on the left is Vichitra Bhavan, constructed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore in the 20th century.One enters the complex through a long passage starting from an arch on Rabindra Sarani. The Thakurbari, with its red and cream walls and green woodwork is a magnificent sight. You buy tickets near the gate – Rs 20 per head. In case you intend to use a camera or camera phone, you need to buy another ticket for Rs. 50 from the Museum office, but you are still not permitted to take any pictures inside the buildings. Incidentally, the tickets are aesthetically designed and worth preserving as souvenirs! You take off your shoes and pass the tiny reception/ sales counter, go up the main staircase and find yourself in the modest suite of rooms once occupied by Rabindranath, including the chamber where he breathed his last in 1941. You turn left at the end of the corridor, where you find two galleries of paintings: the first contains works of the Bengal school (mostly water colours), while the other has western style portraits of several generations of Tagores. A replica of the Nobel prize medal awarded to Rabindranath Tagore in 1913 is also on display. Next, you enter Ram Bhavan, the oldest structure. You see the room where Rabindranath and other family members were born. An alcove in the wall and some simple furniture from the original room has been carefully preserved. As you proceed further, you find four galleries which commemorate Tagore’s travels to America, China, Japan and Hungary respectively. These galleries have been sponsored by the governments or academic institutions of the respective countries and their displays seem quite ostentatious after the stark simplicity of the earlier galleries. You return to Maharshi Bhavan and reach Vichitra Bhavan through a small flight of stairs. It turns out that Vichitra Bhavan – true to its name – is a double-storey building which was constructed without a staircase! Later, a small wooden staircase was added, which can be seen in the reception chamber on the ground floor, but it is blocked off on the first floor. The upper floor of Vichitra Bhavan contains one large hall with a few smaller chambers, where pictures and other memorabilia associated with the Tagore family are on display. The lower floor contains the library and research centre, which are not open to public.Despite the grandeur of the buildings and the fabulous wealth of the Tagore family, one finds no trace of opulence in their lifestyle – just compare the simplicity of Jorasanko with the extreme flamboyance of Mullick Thakurbari (also known as the Marble Palace) in the same neighbourhood. It appears that Prince Dwarkanath Tagore (1794-1846), the poet’s grandfather, had rejected European culture in his home and organized a great sale of his household goods – including china, clocks, marble-topped tables, mahogany chairs and pianos – as far back as 1841! Later generations of the Tagore family were to become leaders of the Bengal Renaissance across diverse forms of art, including painting, drama, poetry and music. Highly educated individuals volunteer to work as guides in Jorasanko – we had the honour of being escorted by a young lady with two post-graduate degrees, including one from Rabindra Bharti University itself. Such learned guides combine deep scholarship with much adoration for the institution. They are fluent in multiple languages – including English, Hindi and Bangla.A visit to Jorasanko Thakurbari is highly recommended."

Entry Ticket: Rs. 10 pp Indian                            Rs. 50 pp for ForeignersC. Location : Jorasanko, off Chitpur Road, Kolkata North    One of the iconic Heritage place of Modern Bengali Cultural History, this place is the Family Residence of Famous Thakur aka Tagore family. One of greatest poet and philosopher of all times Rabindranath Tagore was born here and grew up and stayed here till he shifted to Shantiniketan World University. He breathed his last also in a room in this building, on 7th August 1941.There are 3 sets of buildings and the oldest part was built in the year 1784 and is known as Maharshi Bhavan(Debendranath Tagore). Unfortunately, the place does not get the kind of respect and footfall that it deserves. I visited the place on 29th Nov'19 ( Shame that being a outright born and brought up resident of Kolkata, it took me 60 years from my year of birth to visit this place, that too being a out and out Rabindranath follower). The entrance is from Chitpur Road. There is a sonnet lumiere show from 5.30 in the evening as well. Once you enter you see the e storied barrack styled red brick house with iconic green wooden blind. You must avail guide service which is free and being conducted by young student and Tagore Researchers. A young lady student accompanied us as a guide. You need to remove shoes before you enter the Building known as Tagore Museum. The first part is the oldest one known as Maharshi Bhavan. Here you find the bedroom of Rabindranath's father and other rooms with lot of furniture, artifacts used by the family. The newest part Bichitra was built by Rabindranath in 1901. Here you find a large hall where the poet himself performed his own creations and was attended global luminaries from all over the world. There is an anti room where the poet used ad his study. You can find the small table sitting where he wrote the famous letter quitting his knighthood in 1919, post the infamous Jaliwanwalabagh Massacre. In the third section, you can find the bedroom of the poet, kitchen used by his wife Mrinalini Devi.Two most iconic place in this entire building , is the family birth and postnatal care room, where the poet was born on 6th May 1861 and the room where he breathed his last on 6th August 1941. Throughout the entire Building in separate sections you can find things, dresses used by the family. I was amazed to see things used by Pandit Iswarchandra Vidyasagar also kept in a room. A denture used by Vidyasagar put me in the Tryst with History. You can find number of paintings by various artists here. Art materials used by famous painter Abanindranath Tagore are kept in a room. There are three separate galleries Chinese, Japanese and European. You can find lots of displays and Tagore's travel history to these places in these sections. You can see the car used by the poet displayed here. But I was shocked that it is covered with dust showing complete lack of attention to this famous piece from history.Simply amazing place. But sad to see very few visitors in such an iconic place. Must visit for a Tagore Follower"

In this confusion we missed on taking the Camera tickets (if they still allow one) If they do then please do get it.It's a beautiful traditional house with with gardens and verandah's inside. Its a huge set up upstairs and one has to take off their foot wear before that. It has a mix of display of his pictures of travel across the world, his clothes, furniture, memorabilia and the room where he breath his last. Its a must visit place if you are into history and keen to know about his works and India's journey to freedom. some of the rooms are air conditioned which is savior.

This is one of the most important tourist attraction of the City. This is place where Rabindranath Tagore born and his childhood passed. He also died in this house. This complex is build on a area of 35000 square meter. This site is open for visitor from 10:30am to 5:00pm. This is closed on Monday and Thursday. Ticket price differ for Indian, Student, SAARC citizens and other foreigners. For Indian it is Rs. 20, For SAARC it is Rs. 30 and for Foreigners it is Rs. 150. Photography is not allowed inside the house. But with a photography ticket of Rs.50 anyone can take photograph of the complex.  I didn't find the staffs deployed their is much cooperative and trained. They just poke guest every time and disturb their mood. I think for this kind of site stuffs should be more trained and gentle. It will take around 3 to 4 hours if you visit the house in details.

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Ayub Q,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Fascinating,"For visitors to Kolkata, specially those with a little interest in Bengali culture and history, a visit to the Jorashanko Thakur Bari is a must.Built in the 18th century, this is the ancestral home of Rabindranath Tagore, the great poet and the first non European Nobel laureate. Tagore was born in this house, spent much of his childhood here and died in the house in 1941.The Thakur Bari has been turned into a museum, showcasing Tagore's work and the life of Tagore and the Tagore family. It also showcases other stalwarts of Tagore's time.The Jorasanko Thakur Bari has been restored to the way the household looked when the Tagore family lived there. This gives us a glimpse into their life. The museum has 3 galleries, one dedicated to Tagore and his work and the other two to the Tagore family and other luminaries of the time. It is said to contain about 700 paintings and numerous rare photographs of Tagore and his contemporaries. Though one can take photographs of the grounds and the buildings from outside for a small fee, photography inside the house is not permitted. We found it interesting that young locals thronged the grounds, happily and noisily taking photographs and virtually having a picnic, while those inside the museum were mostly visitors from outside.We also found it interesting that a caretaker came up to us and lamented that "" Tagore's Shrine"" was not treated with the respect it deserved. He opined that the youth of today had no respect for history and tradition. The eternal complaint of age against youth."

I was in awe of the whole place and especially Rabindranath Tagore's last days.. There are lots of exhibits and one will need 3-4 hours to see the whole place. Mind you, the second floor is not very well kept and things are dusty as is full Kolkata !! I wish they could have more funds to look after the place more better.. I think about 40% of the house is what we get to see and the rest of the building is not maintained and is shut down.I must add that the volunteers have done a great job of the light and music show in the evenings which ONE SHOULD NOT MISS... its a must watch and I was so delighted to hear Gulzar's voice. The house lights up so well and the yesteryears come alive with the beautiful story rendering done by talented artists which is famous in Kolkata.. the show is an historical wonder and I just feel they should add some fans for mosquitoes. The show generally starts at about 6.15 pm as daylight is now longer.. so maybe it may be delayed as summers' set in.. The people are wonderful and the visit to this house is a must.."

In fact, some are even presented telling the story in reverse. There is almost nothing displayed of the original life. Furniture mostly gone. Lots of concrete. They charge additional to take pics of the outside of the building. For what. It is a construction of minor architectural  interest other than to show how the few lucky privileged lived walled off from the squallor and filth outside. They dont allow pictures inside at all. For what? There is almost nothing worthy of a pic inside and virtually nothing original. A waste of time and money.

The first room at the entrance depicted the then “Baithakkhana” with an attached kitchen.   The next room was of Rabindranath himself and it was here he breathed his last.  Through his room, the inner corridor and other rooms (Andar Mahal) are accessible. The other rooms on first floor are dedicated to Rabindranath Thakur’s various visits all over the world.  Rabindranath himself was no less a traveller in his times.  He visited 36 countries.  The halls are dedicated to his visit to Japan, China, USA and Hungary.  The hall of China is turned to a miniature Chinese monastery with similar ambiance- with hanging Chinese lanterns and Chinese paintings on the wall,  a miniature Buddha in the adjacent hall,  followed by a seating hall with scriptures and porcelains from China,  giving way to the last hall with Chinese books.  The entrance to the hall is itself a lookalike of a monastery entrance.  The stairs to the second floor led to the Hall of USA and Hungary with features depicting the places.  The hall of USA has a mini Statue of Liberty, one would also find the famous frame shared by Einstein and Rabindranath here.  These are all situated in the Andar Mahal and the trail through the house is made comfortable by air conditioning, the trail through the inside veranda is shaded by typical the then matted curtains (madur-parda).

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,FootstepsofMaitri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Abode of Kaviguru: Jorasanko,"Tagore’s birthplace is Kolkata and not Shantiniketan! Located in Jorasanko, North Kolkata, his ancestral home is better known as ‘Jorasanko Thakurbari’ (scripted on the entry gate as well). Built by the poet’s grandfather, Prince Dwarikanath Tagore in the 18th century, the entrance plaque reads ‘Rabindranath was born and breathed his last here’. Though the building has been recognized as Rabindra Bharati University, a part of this 217 years old erection is a museum (Rabindra Bharati Museum) to Tagore’s family culture and customs. The poet spent most of his childhood days and his final days in this house. Tagore family was always highbrow and ahead of their time. The museum held galleries dedicated to Tagore family with their photographs. It showcases emerging of Tagore into a world famous poet and finally a Nobel laureate. Along with the poet’s works and paintings the galleries display works of other distinguished family members like Maharshi Devendranath Tagore (poet’s father) and Abanindranath Tagore (poet’s nephew). Every year Rabinndra Bahrati museum celebrates Bengali New Year, poet’s birthday and other such cultural programs."

Right after the entry you have to buy coupons if you want to use camera. Though that can only be used in the grounds area. So first we went for upstairs. The woman in charge of the top most floor was very friendly, we had good conversation. The other floor incharge were cooperative too. Most of the gallery been modernized so I usually didn't get the old vibe. Now after coming down to the grounds area & taking few shots the guard started shouting no you can't take more pics, you can't take pictures by posing like a model!! Bla bla. He literally pushed us out of the courtyard area. So yeah, the overall experience was very bad for me. Not gonna going back to this way too commercialized place ever."
Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Gavster Bedlington,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Overbearing staff ruin the cultural grace of the heritage property.,"There's no escaping Tagore when you arrive in Kolkata - his writings our etched on the airport roof . So you would think the museum opened in his family home would elicit the importance of his standing but sadly no. The exhibitions are dry and the layout confusing , signage in Bengali not useful to international visitors and parts look a little tired .A sheer lack of creativity in exhibiting his belongings and furniture. Most bizarrely is the strict lack of photography but ok that's the rule and heaven help you if you happen to use your mobile for a non photographic duty . We wanted to remember a quote and were busy typing it into our notes and where castigated by a surly guard . We tried to explain what we were doing , we asked to speak to a curator and she came over with a mobile phone - but hers was an official phone. We then asked her to write the quote down on paper for us and she wouldn't . We asked if we could buy the quote in the shop. The shop was shut . We were then given permission to record it on our notes on the phone but under the beady watch of a guard. It just seems so pompous and ridiculous of preventing the works and recognition of Tagore to be unknown except for intellectuals an ethos living in Bengal. And certainly far removed from the man himself was trying to promote in the sharing of idea. And don't get us started on the abrupt guard who deals with taking the shoes. The staff here need some serious and urgent training in customer service and welcoming visitors as without them they won't have a job when it goes under."

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,tunai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,An Illustrous House of Culture!,"Tagore is Bengal's greatest 20th century poet, the first Asian to win the Nobel prize and this was the house where he was born in 1861 and where he died in 1941. Jorasanko Thakur Bari is inseparable from the cultural heritage of all Bengalis. It is also one of the grand mansions of Old Calcutta, built in the 18th century.  I was back after 10 years and glad to see that there are now exhibits devoted to Tagore's relationship with the US as well as China and Japan. And a whole new section on his final illness, surgery and death.  Although the house is well maintained, the signage needs improvement.  They will send you to  the third floor first and it takes a while to figure out that this was where Tagore's grandfather lived.  There are often  few clues as to  how other rooms were used and who were the residents. Instead, there is an overabundance of literary texts and artifacts. For Westerners, it can be a little perplexing, especially if you're not familiar with the history of the house, the family and Tagore's  work.  Some preliminary research is recommended. The best way to get here is to take the metro to Girish Park station. It's an easy walk from there."

You cannot take photos of the deities but you can take photos of the general temple and grounds.  I always recommend taking a headscarf with you even if you don't need to wear it.  If it's a working temple, you usually need to wear it.  Definitely worth visiting when in Kolkata."

Just watch out for the people that will act like your friends and give suggestions on what to do like a tour guide and then ask for money. There is a small gift shop here that is worth a look."

This one is closed from 12 noon to 3 Pm. Non Jains maynot enter the temple. So land up any time if interested only in architecture and not of the faith. You can take good photos through the railings. Fabulous shots. The durwans were really rough and shooed me and my friend who had come all the way from Delhi ( I did see  dogs inside the temple complex but felt I was treated worse)...but I still got the shots. Almost none of my Kolkata relatives and friends knew about these temples...just goes to show...I did not mind NOT being allowed to enter...but the way the durwan behaved still rankles...he needs to remember he guards a place of worship.The Dadaji temple next door was such a contrast...we were welcome and we wandered around at will (quietly...no loud voices please...this is a temple) and paid our respects at the main temple too.

We thought we did not hear correct so we asked what happened. He repeated that entry is not allowed. When we asked whether the temple was closed now and would open later. He said that is not the reason.....only Jain people are allowed entry!!!Well.....we were all super shocked, disappointed and did not know what else to say. Had to return back with no choice."

That way I can understand it to be only a private temple. But even then I wonder how can a religious place behave like this.

Jain_Swetamber_Dadajika_Temple,Shourjendra D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,More glitzy of the Jain temples,"This temple is located in the by lane of North Kolkata,and access is easier through Raja Dinendra Street. Vehicles go right at the entrance,and parking is available in the alleys,free of chargeI have been to this place many times before,when I was a kid, but went there yesterday again, with two young kids aged 4 and 10,and they were equally happy and I could actually re-live my childhood through themThe location has 3 temples,on either side of the narrow alley ,and 2 are easily accessible to general public,by foot,after you get down from your vehicle. The main attraction is the ornately designed temple built in 1910 by a certain Rai Budree Das Bahadoor,who was a Mookim to the then Viceroy.Main attraction is the finely handcrafted with colourful mosaic tiles temple dedicated to the Jain leader Guru Sithalnath Ji. Inside the temple photography is strictly prohibited and there are innumerable CCTV cameras to desist you. Inside the temple,it is calm and serene,and chants of the Jain priests can be heard in chorus.Designs on the wall and the colourful glass on the window,make a fine print on the floor,if you visit in the day time,like we did yesterday.Not much to do apart from pay your respect.Attraction for the kids remains the same,as 40 years back. That is feeding the fishes,whose number though has drastically deteriorated over the years. There is a small fountain on the premises whose water at the base contains small number of small fishes. My kids started feeding them small pellets of Atta (Indian wheat flour).There is also a larger but extremely dirty water-body at the rear,which contained many fishes when we were young. Now the water is so dirty and stinky,that you would hate to go near it. Fishes are very less,and due to the dirt layer,you can hardly see them,except exclaim at every bubbles you see at the surface,made by them.At the back of this premises,there is a gate which leads out to the alley at the back. That alley takes you to another Jain temple at the rear called the Shree Jain Swetamber Dadaji ka Temple. This one is a bit cleaner than the Sithalnath Ji temple.There is a large water body at the back here too,which has few swans and ducks,enjoying the relatively cleaner water. Here also priests were chanting on their own and people of Jain community,thronged the place to pay their respect.Overall a nice outing with the kids enjoying themselves,feeding the fishes and the ducks. See my accompanying pictures to have an idea of the place"

My friend had visited the Planetarium in 1982 and remembered it fondly.  It was just as good in 2018.  The show was narrated by Robert Redford, and you can't go wrong with Robert Redford.  The show was about cosmic collisions.  The planetarium was clean and had comfortable seats.  After the show, take a look at the displays. And there are clean toilets, a luxury in that area. You cannot take big bags inside and have to leave them at a booth outside.  I was a bit concerned about that but my backpack was safe."

Birla_Planetarium,saronichatterjee27,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,"""Up above the world so high""","we are habituated to look the dusky sky in Kolkata because of the increasing pollution. Birla Planetarium offers you to experience a clear view of night sky ( don't be serious, just enjoy). They conduct shows in different time schedule in Three laguages i.e.- Bengali, English,Hindi. You can easily follow the show(s) as per your choice. All the shows are quite informative .The shows are very much useful to the school students. Parents and teachers must come here with their children so that they can enjoy a live presentation of what they have learnt in their books. Show tickets are available for Rs.80 per head, but large group of students can enjoy discount also.The place is easily accessible  from Maidan Metro. It is very near to Victoria Memorial and situated just next to the St. Paul's Cathedral.The only negative point about the management according to me is that, they don't allow you to buy ticket from the counter in advance. They start selling tickets just half an hour before the show. Because of that (as I didn't know the rule), I have to wait from 4pm to 6pm to buy tickets for 6:30 pm show and was forced to take the unnecessary long queue to collect my tickets."

However, the planetarium has a 13:30 and 18:30 viewing in English which I would highly recommend (only 80 rupees). We really enjoyed the show and learned a few new things about our solar system. The chairs are comfortable enough and there is AC.After the show there are still a few galleries to view, which I would suggest not to miss out on. I found it especially interesting to see paintings of Hindi deities (and the explanations of their  connection to space) next to scientific explanations of our solar system.This was truly a great visit!"

Birla_Planetarium,Abhay Kumar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Needs Improvements,"My visit to Birla Planetarium was bit disappointing.The first disappointment was that there was no proper arrangement for seating people who are waiting for the next show. There was no eatery where one can get some snacks or drinks while they are waiting.Despite all the big talk about digital India, only cash was accepted as Entry Fee. This only shows that the management is not adopting new payment methods.There was no punctuality as the show started nearly 7 minutes late and the announcer did not even apologize for the delay. Not surprising that people ridicule Indians by calling IST as Indian Standard Time. On the whole lots of changes needed."

However, once the show started we were immersed in another world. The background narrative is excellent. We get to know our universe in a different light. Its great specially for kids. Added attraction is the displays about stars, planets, galaxies,etc which you can walk through before and after the show. Its a place to spend with the kids. However, there seemed to some technical glitch as one part of the space was completely black, maybe blackhole."

I have come here as a child with my father and now i have come again as a father. But the place has lost its charm. The projection is jittery, the associated lecture is stern cold and brief. The toilet stinks and you can smell it even inside the planetarium. The chairs, are uncomfortable and broken. I am shocked at the level of neglect."

Birla_Planetarium,Dhairyashil V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,An educative celestial experience.,"Birla Planetarium is a dome shaped single storeyed structure next to St. Paul's Cathedral. It conducts sky-shows for the public introducing them to astronomy and educating on subjects like the evolution of earth, mysteries of space, Mars and other planets etc. It also has interactive sessions for answering any doubts or myths about the space and the planets. The shows are very educative especially for the school going children who can get a glimpse into the cosmos through these sky-shows. The inside of the planetarium also houses pictures, busts of scientists, educative displays for the information of the visitors. The planetarium is a plastic-free zone.One thing we found strange was that our show was delayed by almost an hour as we were told by the management that as it was raining with lightening, the show could not be conducted as the lightening is causing disturbance to the signals ??The sky-shows are conducted in English (1.30 & 6.30 pm), Hindi (12.30, 2.30 & 4.30 pm) and Bengali (3.30 & 5.30 pm). The shows last for about 40-45 minutes. Cost of Entrance Ticket is Rs.80/person. Additional shows in Hindi and Bengali are conducted in the morning on Sundays and Holidays.Overall an educative experience on the celestial happenings."

But I hope in the future the authorities will provide online tickets to increase convenience for the viewers.In a nutshell its a pride of our city to have such marvellous destination in the heart of the city-centre..."

Gariahat_Market,Sumit Kasera,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Market that exists in Multiple Time Eras Simultaneously,"My very early childhood in late seventies and eighties was spent in a house very close to Gariahat. The place was famous for shops on both sides of the foot path including a market that existed right in the middle of the road. So when my nostalgic visit to Kolkata took me to the place about 30 years later, the place now existed in multiple time eras simultaneously. There were modern show rooms of Samsonite and VIP selling luggage worth 10,000 or 20,000 a piece. And when we brought some Bindi (decorative items for the women’s forehead) strips from a roadside shop that totalled about 700Rs, the man selling was jumping in joy – it was possibly his biggest single transaction sale till date. For us, it was getting stuff which was possibly 30-50% cheaper than ones found in Delhi.That was Gariahat market for you – a place that stood still –we saw blouse stitching centres as we had left about 30 years ago. Same old book shops selling second hand books in the world of Amazon prime – the Punjabi stores selling Pyjama & Kurtas – the road side tea stalls and plethora of knick knacks (e.g. buttons for kurta). So many things were untouched by time. The road side shops of Gariahat market had remained – but one market where I used to go to buy stationary had been subsumed by traffic and the Gariahat flyover had been built after demolishing it.Then there was that customary puchka wala whose mashed potato filling along with red chana was far ahead of the chopped potatoes of Delhi – the first gulp of the puchkas of the Gariahat streets made the money spent in travel worth it. Then there was that Gughni – a local delicacy along with Aloo dum to Gulp. It was customary that money change was seldom available from shop keepers as they kept hunting for their bouni (first sale). The foot paths though fairly wide were largely encroached by the street shops. And the political regime did not allow any change in order. City dwellers with little ambition and aggression were possibly more content than their richer counterparts in Delhi and Mumbai. Go to Gariahat market for the eclectic collection of stuff – food, footwear, cosmetics & clothes– cheap and possibly useful – thrown amidst a tinge of high priced modern gadgets and consumables."

I visited there with my didi yesterday, we were sitting by our selves near the lake amongst many other people. Suddenly two guys approached us started staring at us making us nervous and suspicious ( they were not wearing mask even though its covid time). We asked what was the issue since neither me nor my sister knows them. The crowd around us could see that we were getting scared, and when we tried to walk out of the place, the guys cane around and said it was a prank. A prank we were never part of, we did not spot any microphone or any camera around, then what exact kind of prank it was other than just disturbing two sisters having normal conversations at a lake? Although it has security around who would not let people take water and all with them inside of the area, none of them are bothered to check if things like this happen in daylight in a very public place. I was scared, my didi freaked out more than me to be honest, and i did not know what exactly i should have done at that point of time, because I don’t think that in this day such behaviour can be considered as a prank? I mean there is actually no women safety, and if we speak up we are being shutted by the people saying its a prank? Mind it, it was not at all funny, the way they stared at us blankly. I don’t know what should we have done at that situation so we left that place. But I would want mostly females to be prepared for this kind of behaviour there. Also i am 24 years old my ofcouse my didi is older than me, just so that you know the situation."

Rabindra_Sarovar,Sumit Kasera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Nostalgia at Rabindra Sarover,"Kolkata was my birthplace – place where I was born and brought up and where I lived for about 15 years. So when some reunion request came more than 28 years after I had left the City of Joy, I came back to the city. I used to live bang opposite Rabindra Sarover for about 3 years. The years were marked by a table-tennis centre at the Rabindra Sarover Stadium where I used to learn the game. There used to also run a very slow toy train that had disappeared now. There were possibly few boating options too –not seen again! The street food options were customary to the city – the puchkas (Gol Gappas as they are called in Kolkata), Muri, and host of other savouries. And last but not the least, it was the lung of city – a place where morning walkers and evening joggers used to run around.  About 28 years later, the place was almost the same as I had left it. Almost I would say! The growing plastic menace meant that I was not allowed to carry a polythene bag (even with stuff inside it) with no place to keep. Finally, I stuffed the bag below my shirt to carry it along. An NGT warning screamed that no puja, community event or social picnic could be performed at the venue. Inside there were muri walas selling muri (puffed rice with potato, onion and spices). The most notable change of 28 years was that the bank of the lake was converted into a big promenade for people to stroll and have some fresh air. We could see many people walking or sitting alongside. There were dust bins around but I could see trash here and there – overall maintenance could have definitely been better.The water was not too dirty – many years ago we used to swim in it. A pair of ducks were making merry in the water. It was sheer nostalgia at Rabindra Sarover – a place to stay alongside a vast expanse of water, a promenade to take a leisurely stroll and a place to allow the lethargy of city to seep in and a place to savour the mesmerizing beauty of nature."

Although we had good feedback ,the massive crowds during weekends was a put off. So we ventured to this lake area early morning ( and that too on Dashami, the culmination of the Durga Puja festival) for our morning walk. We went through the Southern Avenue gate after parking in the road( there was a temporary no parking sign , for the Pujas). When you enter you see Nazrul Manch, the auditorium , on your left. Then you see the Padma Pukur (Lotus pond)Park which is lake with a nice walkway all around.Yes there are some lotus but I would suggest take just one round and go further towards the huge lake called Rabindra Sarovar. Since it was around 5.45 in the morning the crowd was thin with some morning walkers and young couples relaxing surely after a long night of Puja hopping. You wonder at the large expanse of water which soothes your spirit after experiencing the madness that Kolkata is. There are at least three concentric circles of walkway around the vast lake. The place is quite well maintained given that there is no entry fee. It is open from 4.30 am in summer and from 5 am in summer. It is supposed to be a plastic free zone but we spotted odd scraps of plastic bag and even water bottles. The trees around the lake lends to its beauty. There are enough places to sit. We even saw a police car going around the road inside. There is a lovely garden at the far end of the lake. And you will see rowers from the adjacent rowing club.There is another seemingly private rowing club in the premises.There are thankfully no vendors inside.Do take time and admire the Kolkata skyline around the lake. Would highly recommend."

Most international reputed brands like Gucci to Calvin Klein are listed here. Make no mistake,that this is just another mall in the city,but way to expensive than anywhere else in Kolkata. I'll give my own experience when I went to buy jeans from Levis store situated inside the Mall. One jeans which caught my fancy was selling for Rs 3600 after discount. I found the price ridiculous. Hence walked away,simply saying didn't like it. Next day bought two jeans of Levis staruss,same model 511 from Mtero Cash and Carry for Rs 1400 and Rs 1600 !! So I got two jeans for the price of one,from the same Company ! Why spend more here ?You will if you want to splurge your undisclosed income !'Restaurants are expensive too. Parking space is huge but refrain from taking your S-class and 7 series as the access way up and down parking lot is a winding way,and you actually may get stuck ! I saw a S-350 getting stuck.The place is a hangout zone for locals. Hnece gets crowded in the evenings as well as on weekends. Frankly,I have been there.Probably won't visit again"

During visits with my parents, we used to feast at the great street food jamboree right in front of the Victoria Memorial – unfortunately very little of that was left now. What was intact however was the large playgrounds of Kolkata called the Maidans. Numerous cricket matches with friends had taken place here – and the place was largely unchanged in the last 3 decades.The place remains the lungs of Kolkata – and the place for future cricket stars like Saurav Ganguly to take shape here.

Netaji_Bhawan,Indradeep R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Couples,Meet our Netaji up close & personal ,Wish I could have visited this place earlier. As an Indian born in Independent India and growing up to tales of our freedom fighters used to give me goosebumps. But this man has always inspired me for his sheer love of the nation and focus to bring in Independence. Over the years I read a lot of book about him and the visit to the museum brought everything to a full circle. As you enter you encounter the vehicle which was used to flee from Kolkata when he was under house arrest. The ticket is minimal Rs 10/- and photography inside the museum is prohibited. Well I think this is a  stupid move when a mobile phone is the most powerful tool of communication & can promote this museum to far away land where the you tube channel of the museum cannot reach due to lack of funds and promotion.  A museum of Netaji should change with time and I hope the authorities can see what I am visualising from my vantage point. The museum is well maintained very neat and clean spread over 2 floors. There are no lift and you will have to climb the wooden stairs. The entire life of Netaji will be presented in front of your life. The first floor displays his and his brothers bed room and study room. The next floor has portraits and excerpts of his letter across his life. It also shows his escape route to Europe and back to Japan. One letter caught my attention where he writes his brother that probably they won’t meet again ! This journey across his lifecycle brought tears to my eyes and for a second I wished if it was possible to touch the feet of this legend by getting into a time machine. If you are in Kolkata and you love your country please pay homage this to this General without home we wouldn’t have got our freedom so easily

Netaji_Bhawan,atulya_sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"MEET THE ""WANDERER""","Netaji Bhawan was originally the town house of J.N.Bose, father of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It has been converted into a museum dedicated to the Bose family, especially Netaji Subhas. One enters from Elgin Road (just opposite Forum Mall). The ticket counter is located on the right of the entrance. Tickets cost Rs 10 for adults and Rs 5 for children. A small selection of books, mostly in Bangla, is available at the ticket counter. After you cross the ticket counter, you find a glass enclosure on the left, in which a car is displayed. This car, known as “Wanderer”, was manufactured by Audi and has recently been restored by them. In January 1941, Sisir Bose drove this car from Calcutta to Gomoh, which was to become the beginning of Netaji’s historic “Great Escape.”Netaji Bhawan is a triple storied building. The ground floor has an auditorium, which is not accessible to public. One has to go up a fairly steep staircase to reach the first floor, where there are three rooms open to visitors. There are two bedrooms, one of which was used by Netaji and some of his personal belongings are on display there. The third room is Netaji’s study, which has some original furniture. The third floor consists of a large photo gallery where you can see pictures and other memorabilia associated with Netaji. While there are many pictures and artefacts of INA and Netaji’s travels in Europe and the far East, there is just one photo of his wife and daughter. Netaji Bhawan has a great deal of material, but the display and upkeep have much scope for improvement."

What a great patriot Netaji was. No one must skip this revered place when in Kolkata as it is not only an inspiration to all Indians but also evokes respect from all visitors for the patriotism, valour, sacrifice and devotion of Netaji.

Netaji used to meet other estemed politicians in this building when he was elected Indian National Congres President. Other main attraction is the car which Netaji used to escape from the house arrest by British surveillance team. There are ample photographs of Netaji and his family, colleagues; audio recordings, INA emblems, his coats, hand wrtings, sword etc. for display.I would request the parents to bring specially the kids to Netaji Bhawan. I am sure our next generations will be enriched through Netaji's life and journey. "

It relates to the superhero of Indian freedom struggle, the genius great Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. This place is part of a turning point in history of Indian freedom struggle. Only thing that may put off today's visitor is the lack of ambience and sanctity in adjacent area. There also seems to be lack of vision from government to augment and sanctify the place."

Its also the house of Sarat Chandra Bose (his second elder brother). The place has a museum that displays good photos on Bose that gives a nice narrative into the role played by Bose incl. his INA days, flight from that very house to Germany and thereto Japan and back to India with the INA.

Tagore_House,Coastal820768,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,homes of Bengal,A must visit to delve into the era of Tagore. This is the house where Tagore breathed his last.

Location: Very much within the city and easily accessible.
Tagore_House,Brun066,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Museum to visit!,"It's difficult for non-specialist people - even if they are of good culture - to have an adequate knowledge of the literary work of Rabindranath Tagore; but also, simply,  of his figure. In this case this museum is an adequate means to deepen the knowledge of the character and, through it, of some nodes of cultural discussion in India in the last century.From the museum - which coincides in part with the house where Tagore was born, then finally died - it's clear first of all that Tagore is a representative of the classes not only more educated, but also wealthier, of India. If I have understood correctly, his family was part of the category of ""zamindari"", that is the major landowners, traditionally also charged with collecting taxes - on behalf of the central power - among the local population. Tagore is therefore undoubtedly favored by his economic means in acquiring the cultural depth that will eventually lead him - in 1913 - to be the first non-European obtaining the Nobel prize for literature.Through the museum reconstruction, the different phases of his formation and af his cultural interests emerge, often summarized in the formula ""universalism"". Used to seeking what unites Indian culture - in which it was born - with other cultures, Tagore constantly repudiates nationalisms (cultural and other), on the other he deepens the links between his culture of origin and the others. In the rooms of the museum stands out in particular - but not only - its long-term attention, for example, to Japanese culture.Particular space is also given to his travels, which brought him especially in the last decades of his life to visit dozens of nations.The esteem of writers, politicians, scientists (there is a picture of him with Einstein) is attested by the amount of contacts documented in the museum. I don't know which other literate can present - as in the museum you can see - pictures with three different US presidents.Overall, visit this museum: you will enrich your culture and your sensitivity."

The panther was panting as it made its rounds. There was a group of menacing wild cats which growled in anticipation. I caught a Monitor Lizard sunbathing, swimming and rock-climbing, and a couple of zebras sleeping in standing position. There were a lot of small, newborn tortoises in many compartments. An ill-tempered chimpanzee was seen throwing his excreta on public. But the best part of it all was the sight of a large number of flemingos, pelicans and swans bathing themselves in the waters, and then having  lunch . It was a day well spent."

Contrary to the infamous opinion about the lack of cleanliness and dearth of animals, we found this place quite neat and well maintained. Despite covering a big area, the appropriately placed signboards make navigation convenient. Abundant deers, giraffes, peacocks and a wild variety of birds make for a very pleasant trip. Yes there are just a couple of tigers and lions and placed at a more-than-formidable distance, however, that is quite a sight. By the time we finished watching the elephants and were considering looking for the exit, we found it right in front of us. Overall a very pleasant trip."

Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,ziniatalks,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Child Memory refreshed,"The day was nostalgic. Liked the ease of e-ticketing. 30 per head and 250 with movie camera. The entry gate is separate and no rush. But the lady in the counter did not check our identity, though the instruction says one need to carry id proof; which may be proved to be a lacunae if something serious happens in this day of terrorism. No security check also in this gate. Counter ticket and the entry was full of people.The status and count of the animals - is actually poor, but only because it is a place with one of my best childhood memories, I have marked average. in each cage you have one one animal, like one lonely lioness(no lion), one rhino (without horn), one sloth bear, 2 elephant kids (6 years and 8 years), one Jackal in miserable state, 4-5 crocodiles, 2 - 3 chimpanzees, kangaroos were not mature, 1 jaguar, 1 cheetah, few tigers in enclosed cage (old fashioned), 1 white tiger in the open arena but was sleeping, a couple of deer each of different categories in their concerned open enclosures, 1 hippo(again sleeping like a mass), Few Giraffe,few Zebras, 1 white peacock with it's lady,   one peacock with its family..... the collection of birds are really good, but again alone in the cages in most cases(though I am not aware of their habitat, but birds are generally lives in community, so also Lion and Elephant. Food stalls are there but options are redundant. I do not find the food courts (if they are at all termed so) are hygienic, lot of flies and open foods are sold; so better to carry your own food. though they say it is a plastic free (!) zone, but food stalls are themselves selling juices and lassy in plastic glasses or lab-based thermocol  plates! Otherwise small wraps made of ""newspaper"" with the beautiful and colourful newsprints!Drinking water again primitive supply system, not dependable. They are selling packaged drinking water of low grade companies. So again be self-reliant.Worst part is washrooms. Lot of urine units, half-level doors as they cater to same sex, so you need not to bother for privacy and you can't even lock from in-side (obvious reason is other can see your presence from outside)! Two-three closed doors are there but  to be used as latrine and condition is not usable as stools are visible, while urine can't be seen in plain eyes, so you are bound to use the half door ones. Water supply pipe-line is there but no mugs to apply. In short, filthy and no privacy. In the duration of 3 and half hours, I used once, I have not noticed any attendant to clean. My husband's feedback about the male urinals are also same. It's a shame!There is no arrangement of any activity for the animals in their enclosures, not outside for the kids (like toy trains, play tools etc). Lots of grounds are there where people are sitting and doing family picnics amidst dust. No cart for carrying aged people, so avoid if you have aged people in the group or expect walking. No parking owned by the zoo authority! So avoid personal vehicle.In short, in Kolkata, if you do not have to go anywhere and you have never got a scope to experience what a zoo is, come to Calcutta Zoo. Better to avoid. I have been to Darjeeling Zoo, Mysore Zoo, Bangalore Zoo, Vizag Zoo, Delhi Zoo, Nainital Zoo and on top of all Nandan Kanan in Bhubaneshwar; these all are gems of keeping the animals in Captivity. Hope the feedback helps others."
Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,Shantanu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Old memories....refreshed,"When I was a kid, I used to visit the Calcutta zoo with my dad, almost every month! The last time was in my high school years in the early '90s. So, it was a trip down the memory lane when I visited the same old zoo again a few days ago....after decades, and was pleasantly surprised to find it the same and well kept. In fact I found it to be a lot cleaner and better maintained than before. The glass covered viewing shelters at the tiger, leopard and kangaroo enclosures, provide an unrestricted view of the magnificent animals....the star attractions undoubtedly being the five bengal tigers (2 white and 3 natural) that we saw. The white tiger made a majestic appearance and leisurely walked past the glass separation a couple of times, could clearly see every movement at a distance of just a few feet. As mentioned before, the entire area is pretty well maintained, especially keeping in mind the kind of footfall it experiences, dotted with snacks/ice-cream counters all around. But I do need to say here that we as a race, need to be better mannered and be conscious about littering. There is an entry fee of Rs. 30/- per head (no time limit) and the zoo keeps open from 9am to 5pm, Friday to Wednesday (closed on Thursday). There are three entrances, the main one being on the Alipore Road. Among the other two entrances, one is on the National Library Avenue, just next to the crossing as you turn towards DH Road, and the other one is on Orphangunge Road, for people coming from the Khidderpore side. I'd recommend you to visit the website of the zoo beforehand.And of course, this is a ""must visit"" for your Calcutta experience to be complete. P.S. Avoid taking your own car, severe shortage of parking in and around the zoo."

It's Zoo Day,"I think this is the top of the places in Kolkata which is enjoyable equally by children and grown ups. One of the famous zoological gardens of India to get in touch of variety of wild animals, numerous number of birds and vegetation.If you manage to go to the zoo even every year, every time you experience a happiness in your mind, not a bit of monotony can touch you. My little daughter really enjoyed the real Tiger, Lion, Elephant, Zebra, Deer...and couldn't believed their existence as she used to look them in her books and television until she came to the zoo. The zoo is well maintained and staffs are really doing good. You are allowed to carry your own food ,but plastic bags are a big NO. But lack of proper supervision and security check, some people are still carrying plastic bags. I also noticed lots of people throwing plastic cups, ice cream cups, plastic spoons beside and in the main water body. Though there are many washrooms, some stupid parents made their kids to pee beside the path. These type of acts are need to be stopped by strict supervision."

Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,kingshukB25,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,refreshing experience and wide ranging species of animals.,"Unlike many other ""attractions"" in Kolkata, my experience of the Alipore Zoo was refreshing. I went with my two year old son who, like me, had a great time. I was very impressed with the different kinds of animals and birds. Wide ranging and very diverse. Some very fascinating like the ""Slow Loris"" - I have not seen a primate move slower then that. The animals appear to be well looked after. There is a sense of openness, which is comforting given a zoo by its very nature is restrictive. Not surprisingly, there are several royal Bengal tigers, all well built and healthy. I do feel the enclosures for the tigers, Rhino and hippo could do with some improvement/ enhancement. Signage is a problem, but thats alright as it adds to the fun and excitement. Its important that you get there early and be prepared to spend a better part of the day there if you want to explore the zoo in its entirety. With the lovely weather in Kolkata in the months of Nov-Feb, now is a great time to visit the Zoo. Be prepared to walk. The ticket booking system needs to be looked at. Especially the online booking side of it. I lost money because my online payment did not go through. Also, the security guards, all great guys, need to be a little more pro-active when dealing with errant and mischievous patrons. we came across a few and I was quite frustrated to see that they could get away with their tom-foolery and general bad behaviour, whether towards the animals or generally maintaining hygiene and cleanliness. Frustration was increased because the Zoo otherwise is clean and well maintained. Finally, a very nice feature about the Zoo is it gives you the option to adopt an animal. Its a great idea, which not only ensures funding for the Zoo but gives animal lovers the opportunity to care for the animals, albeit, vicariously. I am considering adopting the Slow Loris!"

While much effort has been made to improve the living conditions of the animals, the services for the visitors are just awful. On busy winter days the bins are overflowing with garbage and the staff are too overwhelmed by the problem. Visiting during the off-season (summer and monsoon) can be a better experience depending on the weather. For the sake of the zoo, do not bring your own food as it just adds to the garbage problem."

The Badridas Temple St has 3 premises, but only 2 are open to public mostly. The Badridas Temple St  Temple has exquisite ceramic mosaic art made over 70 yrs ago, plus a mirrored corridor made with Italion mirrors. The tank used to have lots of large fishes earlier which were15-20 kgs when I used to visit in my childhood about 50 yrs ago. We could feed the fishes then. Now there are just Lilantica fishes and one can feed them with Atta dough. The architectural splendour, is a must visit for all. Do pray to Lord PareshNath since it brings Good Fortune from His blessings."

Parashnath_Jain_Temple,Juliet C R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Friends,Two wonderful experiences in one location!,"Two sites in Kolkata, right next to each other, can elicit strong spiritual experiences, both very special and very memorable.The Jain Temple is covered with small mirror tiles which glow in the sun, giving it a surreal appearance.  Inside the temple is a ghee candle which has been burning for more than 150 years, and the space is inspiring.  The grounds are beautiful, with fountains and landscaping. We saw monks giving lessons to locals, many families with young children, and devout worshippers in brightly-colored saris.But, as though that were not enough - the Temple is also located along the Ganges River, so that you can walk a few steps and be right at the water!  Touching or entering the water is a personal decision - it is said to be very polluted - but you can sit comfortably and watch bathers in yellow loincloths, and watch this river, the heart of India, flowing by.  I personally stepped into the water, took some in my hand and poured a few drops on my head, the ritual we had been taught - then went back to the hotel and scrubbed!!  I was just fine - but many people chose to just watch.The Temple and the River - two not-to-be-missed sights!!"

Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,PaesFerns,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Fun for entire Family!,"If you can overlook the crowds and minimal standards of cleanliness- Nicco park is a fun day outing for kids and adults. During our time there we even saw grandmothers riding the merry-go-round and water slide!We booked our tickets online which saved us time and spared us the rush at the ticket counter. We bought the basic ticket which offered 13 rides for free. Since we went during the Christmas week, there were lots of people and we had to queue anywhere between 10-15minutes for rides. Inside the premises there are ticket counters and food kiosks at frequent intervals to buy tickets for rides that were not part of the basic package. Plenty of toilets around as well- but they are not the cleanest.We spent about 6 hours there and managed to complete about 7 rides. Kiddo enjoyed it so much , we have been told to go back there again! And this is a kid who has been on rides in europe and disneyland. So yes- go for it!"

This is very tiring and makes no sense to enjoy after standing for soo long. Buying online tickets is the biggest mistake. There are 12 entry counters out of which only one is dedicated to online tickets. Worst management, least customer attention, no one picks the call and no one assist to manage the crowd."
Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,akghosal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Small theme park but otherwise good selection of rides,"Small theme park but with a relatively good selection of rides for its size and also relatively well maintained. My only issues with this place although relatively minor are that some of the seating in some rides are not always suitable for taller people (there needs to be more leg space in some of the rides) and that covid rules were not strongly enforced in the park (even though there were announcements and notices that masks should be worn at all times in the park, I saw many people wandering around without masks)."
Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,Tausif,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Fun place for kids.,The options are limited in food court and very long queues for the rides. I guess we visit at the wrong time of year. Otherwise a very fun place for kids. Take almost the whole day.

Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,Sudipta Shaheen,,,,"Nicco park is located in the Salt Lake area spreading across the 40 acres land. A full package of entertainment is Nicco. It is best for kids and young ones, teenagers as well as adults. For a day out with family, one must not forget the name of Nicco park. It remains open from 10 am to 5 pm. The travel route is not very difficult. Friends can go in bike or a family can hire private taxi or cab. Beside Nicco is lot of food stalls too. How can one forget the rides! The best part of this amusement park is Wet-o-wild where we simply have fun in waters. Its amazing to visit there in summer. A lot of free rides are also there. Striking car, river cave, boating, flying saucer and roller coaster are simply brilliant. Another region of Nicco is dry which is also very nice. Lots of passes and offers are also available. Those who are heart patients must just avoid a few heartthrumping rides otherwise the visit is worthy enough with the charge it takes."

,,,,,"The park is for everyone. One can spend the whole day in the park.Usually it is very crowded in weekend and you need to have patience to cover all the rides. It is recommended that you book the entry ticket online to save some bucks. Also,book the entry ticket only as it comes with 12 free rides including MIG plane and Eiffel Tower. You can take unlimited rides. Once inside you may choose the paid rides as per your convinience as it is time consuming due to the long queues which will tire you. Overall you can have a fun time with your loved one's."

Birla_Industrial_Technological_Museum-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Beng.ht,atulya_sinha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,VISITOR-FRIENDLY SCIENCE MUSEUM,"Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, established in 1959, is the oldest science and technology museum of the city. The building was originally the residence of Raja Baldeo Birla (1863-1956) and it was donated to the Government by his heirs for setting up museum. Now a new wing has been constructed perpendicular to the original three-storied building and some exhibits are displayed outdoors as well. There is a well-maintained garden, where statues of great scientists have been installed.In addition to basic physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, astronomy, electricity, electronics etc., there are galleries devoted to technologies such as television, motive power, transport, metals, etc. A special feature is a mock-up of a coal mine. There is a dedicated gallery for children as well. There are several small auditoriums, where documentary films are regularly screened. As a mechanical engineer, I was particularly interested in the motive power and transport galleries, both of which have rich collections. The latter includes a narrow gauge steam locomotive and a vintage car which belonged to Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, the eminent scientist. The exhibits are generally well-maintained and efforts are made to improve them from time to time. For example, the interactive exhibits which were operated by touching a button are now modified to be activated without any physical contact. The museum is visitor-friendly and their website is quite informative. Parking facility is available inside the compound, but there is a separate charge for it. Washrooms are well-maintained"

Therefore, Mr. Birla handed over the property to Govt to set up  to set up the museum which took nearly three years to complete. BITM is also the pioneer of the Mobile Science Exhibitions with the first exhibition on wheels. With its galleries, diverse activities and the growing chains of the satellite centers, this museum is now the place where science manifests itself through means of interactive and animated models.

Birla_Industrial_Technological_Museum-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Beng.ht,Sumit Kasera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,An evening with science and technology,"Bengalis lay special emphasis on education, sports, art/craft & theatre in their life – it is no wonder that in Kolkata you find art/craft centres, sports clubs, theatres, science museum and the likes spread across the city. Birla clan have special place in shaping the countours of the city – channelizing back the gains from the business into making science centres, temples and museums in the city. BITM website states: established on 2nd May 1959 under the administrative control of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), Birla Industrial & Technological Museum in Kolkata is widely regarded as the mother of science museum movement in India. The idea behind this pioneering initiative came from Dr. B C Roy, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal who after visiting the Deutsches Museum in Munich was inspired to create a similar institution in India for public engagement with science & technology. His vision and efforts in this regard found instant support and patronage from the likes of Pandit Jawharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India, and industrialist Shri G D Birla. The latter donated the Birla Park, his sprawling bungalow and the adjoining plot of land in the upscale Ballygunge area of Calcutta, to CSIR for setting up an Industrial and Technological Museum. Pandit Nehru received this magnanimous gift from Shri G D Birla in 1956. It was possibly philanthropy at its peak.The BITM visit was very interesting due to multiple reasons – the key being a mock coal mine that taught us a thing or two about coal mining. In an artificial setting, the place appeared almost too real and true. Apart from this, there was live science show with demonstration on liquid nitrogen. Apart from this, there was a 3D show.Overall, it was a place recommended for children for few tips and tricks on science and technology."

Most of the model are in working condition, so take your time and read through and try out. There is a kids play area for smaller kids. It will be great if they put gallery on new technology areas like space research, computing, robotics, alternative fuel vehicles etc. Everything seems old which I have probably seen 20 years back here.There is a canteen at the terrace which serves bengali thali and snack items, which is cheap and good. There is a tea/coffee outlet at the ground floor. Enough parking available in the compound.Timing is 10am to 6pm and you can spend the entire day here. We went on a week day, so the crowd was reasonable."

The rest of the museum is a little sad - it certainly does not compare with all the hi-tech ""stuff"" in Europe museums - but if you/the children/grandchildren want to see how it used to be - it was worth a quick look and it is only a few minutes from central Kolkata"

They didn’t disappoint me . The upgrade and maintenance deserve applause.  The coal mine, the planetarium , magic shows  all are mind blowing. The 3 D shows need little brush up as all 3-D glasses are far from date of expiry. They ruin the experience of such great shows. There is no one to explain the science and technology part. There can be classes on science, history , geography , astronomy, mineralogy just like the other shows. The planetarium facilitators (few of them) need to be confident and a little more efficient. The play zone is wonderful. I prefer to go there again and again. But I guess a little more staff and few new ideas will help the place to gain more attention."

ISKCON has developed temples at may of the places and we try to perform darshan in these temples as far as possible. During our trip to Kolkata and north east, we visited the ISKCON temple of Kolkata. It is near monte park and almost in the busy area of this metro city. Hiring a local city taxi is the best mode of travel for reaching this place.ISKCON temples are known for the cleanliness, beautiful decoration and amazing murti of deities. Most of the temples are of Lord Krishna, but every where local touch is available. The other thing I like at these temples is the sincerety of the pujaris of these temples. I have visited nearly 6-7 temples of ISKCON and Juhu and Vrindaban temples rank on top of the list hence I have rated this temple as average as compared to these two; else Kolkata temple also offer you the same feeling.Later we took prasaad at Govinda, the restaurant chain of ISKCON adjacent to the temple.

The place as you enter, have  few pictures of old Kolkata on the landing of a staircase,but that is as close as it gets to the Kolkata of bygone era.Even the terrace allegedly where Swami Vivekananda was born have been covered,changed and decorated and thus all charm is lost. Go and have a look at Jorasanko Thakurbari,the ancestral home of the great poet Kaviguru Rabindra Nath Tagore,and you will understand what I mean.They have retained all older items,the building,the structure,the paintings,the memorabilia,everything,yet have renovated and well kept that place.Here Ramkrishna Mission have by their own volition,changed everything and have made a building which is an eyesore in the first place.It is reasonably neat and clean in the inside,but make sure you are not old or inform,as there are plenty of twists and turns inside to have a look at the museum of sorts inside. There are number of rooms,and you have to climb quite a few stairs here and there to finally see them all.Remove your shoes first as you enter,and again wear them as you exit.Pay Rs 10/- as entry fee once you have entered the main door.Photography is strictly prohibited inside (what on Earth for ?),and they threaten people who try to take few snaps (happened in front of me!)Overall a must visit place if you like the teachings and work of Swamiji but as I said,for me it is a once visit place as the main charm of the place has been irretrievably lost due to their over enthusiastic renovation of a timeless heritage place of Bengal"

The house remained Vivekananda's home throughout his childhood and early youth. This historical cultural centre was inaugurated by the President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.Narendranath Datta or Narendra or Naren was his original name. As a coincidence he was born on 12.1.1863 which happened to be a festival day for Hindus called Makara Sankranthi festival. His family was a traditional family. He was one among the nine children to his parents.  His father, Viswanath Datta, was an attorney at the  High Court in Calcutta. His grandfather Durgacharan Datta was a scholar both in Sanskrit and Persian.He was born in his ancestor’s house. After father’s death in 1884 his aunt, who was also residing with the family claimed the entire property by filing a suit against Narendra's mother (Bhuvaneswari Devi) and others.  He won the litigation initially but dragged on for years in appellate courts. However it ended a few days before his death in 1902. The judgment was in his favour wherein the court awarded complete and absolute legal possession of his ancestral house to him. So until his last breath he was forced to involve in unnecessary litigation. But he was not at all bothered about it. By the time the lis ended in favour of Narendra (by now Swami Vivekananda) it was in dilapidated and in a hopeless condition.It was in 1962 the Ramakrishna Mission authorities acquired the property to make it a museum. In May 1999 the adjacent land was acquired through the Government of West Bengal. A committee was constituted for this task. The said committee managed to collect several millions of rupees.  At present that ancestral home of Narendra houses a museum, a research centre, a memorial shrine, a library, an English centre, a computer training centre, and a charitable dispensary. They are organising seminars and conventions regularly herein."

The distance from Dakshineshwar kali temple is about 1.2 Km and 10 minutes by toto (battery operated taxies) for 10 rupees or by bicycle rickshaws which will cost 20 Indian rupees which is situated in DD Mondal ghat road. The main alter in temple takes a very unusual configuration three alters one atop the other Sri Ramakrishna at the bottom, then Mother Kali made of 8 metals in the middle and on the top alter murthis of Radha & Krishna known all over India as a divine couple. The main alter is open only between 10.30 to 11.30 a.m. and 6.30 to 7.30 p.m. Temple is open on 52 days of the year on specific days. So check the timings before visiting the temple. This is one the reasons why it’s not popular among non- Indians but it’s worth the visit if your religious minded even if you’re a non-Hindu.Tips for visitors: this is a holy place. So your dress code must be strictly maintained. No short trousers or skirts.no wearing footwear inside the temple and a counter is there for few rupees to keep your footwear safe.do not take photos inside temple and permission is needed from authorities to take any photos even on non-temple areas. Respect the rules set by the temple. They do a lot of charitable work helping the poor (see their website) and you can give a donation according to your means if you like to the office and collect a receipt. Do not forget to visit Dakshineshwar Kali temple which is world famous and situated only 1.2Km away.Good luck on you visit and may Mother Kali who has a great power over Kolkata bless you even if you’re not a Hindu."

I got the best shots here, not for the faint-hearted though, could be a culture shock, my mother is 70 but is a westernized indian, it was a little overwhelming for her but I say you have to see this, make sure you go up stairs and walk across howrah bridge in early rush hr and the walk to see howrah train station, largest in india"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,GeoBeetles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,A great place for photoshoot,"If you’re a photographer, writer, or heck, even a visitor trying to get a flavor of what ordinary life in this big city is like, then a visit to this flower market is a must. It’s safe and the people here are nice and accommodating, although the goings-on could be the cause for a slight migraine if you aren’t used to this kind of commotion. For me, born and brought up in Kolkata (then Calcutta), it was most welcoming. And no, afterwards I didn’t need any aspirin."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,FJHH24,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,COLOURFUL AND VERY BUSY,To walk through the flower market gives a great sense of how people sell their flowers and also how the flowers are delivered there.  You have to be careful not to be knocked into by the huge carrying baskets which are carried on the heads of the sellers!  A really interesting experience and one which shows how the people market their flowers.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Manish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Flower Galore,"I solely visited this place for the experience and it was undoubtedly a great one. I had walked all the way under the scorching sun and was tired by the time I reached, but the moment I entered the place it filled me up with energy from the crowd. The place was bustling with people and flowers being sold everywhere. The aroma from the variety of flowers here and there filled up the air with a unheard fragrance. It felt so fresh and the constant bargaining going around everywhere bought a smile to my face."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,travelon110,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Friends,"Bustling, interesting local market",Well worth a visit! Very colorful and interesting. I think we spent an hour there in total. We took a bus from Esplanade heading to Howrah and hopped off before it got on any on ramps. We still had to ask to be pointed in the right direction even though we knew it was under the bridge. There’s a part that’s more covered stalls and a part that’s open air near the tunnels that go under the bridge. It seems sellers leave once they sell out so earlier is better. We got there probably around 8:30/9am and it was still bustling. There is a pay toilet there in case you need one. It hadn’t rained in the previous few days so it wasn’t muddy. 
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Elizabeth V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Oh boy!  Found what I was looking for,"This was our final day in India and, at last, I found the India that I had been looking for.  Yes, I know I had seen the opulence of the 5+ star hotels, and the poverty, and the emotion of the Ganges, but I had not seen what I had been looking for.  Here it was.  The complete mass of humanity.  The hustle and bustle.  The noise.  The smells.  I had this vision of so many people, crowded into one spot, rushing around, minding their own business.  OK - you had to mind your head as it was likely to be clobbered by people carrying great loads on their heads.The colours, the designs, the garlands, the multitude of stores, the happy people, the madness.  It is difficult for your senses to cope with this onslaught, but it is so worth it.  If you are in Kolkata, even if only for an hour, you must not miss this.  You will have to adopt Indian customs - forget being polite, you will need to barge your way through, or you will stand still and see nothing.  It seems as though you are very safe here but beware of other tourists who may be pick-pockets - the crush is manor from heaven for them."

You will see how the garlands of flowers are made and wonder how all these flowers can be used every day.   Take time to just hang out at along the River too.  From here it is easy and fun to walk across old neighbourhoods and get a feel of this wonderful city.   Constant honking is part of the experience.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Penwyllt,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,"A fusion of colour, sights and sounds not forgetting smells!","The Malik Ghat flower market is a maelstrom of sights sounds and smells which assault your senses.  All set on the side of the river close to a wrestling compund and people washing in the dirty waters of the holy river Hooghly. The flowers are beautiful and made up into garlands and bouquets for religious and more mundane events. The place is full of colour and a buzz of activity as we witnessed people bathing and washing, clothes and pots and pans in the river close to the large and imposing  Howrah bridge. Well worth a visit!"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Annabelle S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,A microcosm of India!,"The Malik Ghat flower market is a microcosm of the delights and disgusts of India for tourists. I come down strongly on the side of delight. It is a wholesale market doing millions of rupees of trade a day and employing thousands of people in the process. The flowers are beautiful and made up into garlands and bouquets for religious and familial events. The place is a riot of colour and a paradise for photographers. It also reveals India's poverty with the communal washing of bodies, clothes and pots and pans in the river under the cold steel of the Howrah bridge. It's amazing, enthralling, upsetting. Like India."

Very muddy. Flowers beautiful, some not in bloom but overall tons of flowers/amazing colours. Walked thru Potters' quarter. Very artisic/creative people  with bales straw and mud from the Ganges making sacred statues for Hindu ceremonies. Ferry over Hooghly River to flower market but bus back. Lots of people washing at the Ghats. Again lots of tired, barefoot, people. Still an experience you are unlikely to get anywhere else."

Watching the sellers arriving with baskets full of flowers or garlands on their shoulders is really a magnificent scenery. The market is full of colors and floral scents and it is a nice location to experience daily life in Kolkata. But you can not only see the flowers, don't forget to walk all in behind. There you can watch all activities near the ghat. Bathing people, women washing clothes, children playing ...."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Lloyd Macklin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,overwhelming colours..,the wholesale market is huge and the masses of flowers on display overwhelm the senses. Walking through the crowded alleyways is an experience in itself. Don't get lost!Unfortunately the scents of the flowers is overpowered by the local pollution. The view of the bridge and the Ghat itself is average. Worth a visit.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,pagel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Such a buzz,"We did an early morning tour of the Flower Market and getting up before 6am was definitely worth it... the colour... the liveliness... and the energy of the market was a wonderful start to the day.   Our hotel arranged for a tour guide for us, Shekar, and he was a softly spoken gentleman who shared this wonderful experience with us.  He also took us through to the banks of the Ganga where the city was awakening - as others have said - the wrestlers, the families, the flower wholesalers.  This was my favourite part of our stay in Kolkata."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Allene W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,There is more than just flowers here,"Yes, there are flowers of many colors but don't miss the ghat just behind the flower market.  At dawn, it is already busy with men bathing in the river, brahmins performing rituals, barbers at work, and wrestlers practicing.  From here, you can also stroll to a beautiful old tiled structure that once served as the bathing palace for women.  The Howrah Bridge is a striking backdrop as are the people whose lives are woven into this market and location.  My favorite images of my visit here do not have a single flower in them!"

Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Paul R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,Colourful and vibrant,"I realise as I write reviews, that my liking for Kolkata mainly came not from attractions like temples and monuments but from wandering the streets and encountering places like this sprawling flower market in the shadow of the impressive Howrah bridge.The scents and colours of the millions of blossoms is woven in amongst streets and buildings along the banks of the Hooghly river and is a treat for the senses. The cheerful bustle of the traders and buyers creates the sort of environment I could happily wander through for an hour or two.And I did."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Eric G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Great Place to Visit Near the Old Howrah Bridge,"This was not on my ""to do"" list, I went there by accident and discovered one of the most interesting places in Kolkata. The flower market is huge and seems chaotic but at the same time it is somewhat organized by types of flowers. It was interesting to see the flowers that have been ""woven"" in beautiful different styles and shapes, probably to be used at temples or elsewhere. It seemed to be a flower trade center rather than a retail sale place."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Felicia D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,A treat for your senses,"The flower market is all hustle and bustle!  It is truly an example of a working enterprise.  You can’t buy any flowers individually, as these are sold only to wholesalers.Here you’ll see lots of marigolds, but also roses, lotus flowers and some others I can’t identify.  It’s loud.  It’s busy.  It’s crazy.  Everyone is ok with you taking pictures and videos. If you walk out of the market, you’ll find yourself at the Hooghly River and you’ll have a good view of the Howrah Bridge.  However, there is a bad smell at this river edge, and a lot of poor homeless dogs lying around."

Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Deryn H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,A hive of early morning activity,We visited this market with friends and a guide.  We s pent a good hour picking our way around the various vendors.  There seemed little or no order to where the traders could place their wares but the traders were all happy to have their photographs taken and not at all shy.   The market was in hyper-drive on this day as it is the Diwarli festival so flowers were in great demand.  There are some defined footways but there is also a great deal of rotting flowers and vegetation and I would recommend trainers or at least closed in shoes.If you like to get in amongst the noise and atmosphere then this is the place to see trading at its best.   Flowers are sold by the weight.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,DexterD2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,A must do in Kolkata ,Beautiful colours and street life of India.  May not be your thing if you don't like crowds but it is well worth it and offers amazing photos from overhead bridges.We caught the metro to the nearby station (the trains don't start until 7am so don't bother being earlier) and then wandered the streets until we got to the flower market - passing through a large fruit market on the way.One of my highlights of Kolkata. 
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,AmD,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Mallik Ghat Flower market ... about bloom and gloom,"In early September this year I visited Mallik Ghat Flower market. Not the best of times, to see flowers in bloom, but nevertheless it was exciting for me to experience the 'hustle and bustle' around flowers. Its a must see for residents of Kolkata, and for anyone who has a love for flowers (who is'nt?).Touted as one of the largest flower markets in Asia, while I was excited, but saddened too with the plight of the market. The vendors lined up street sides, and an elevated corridor. Practically no infrastructure for a thing of beauty and something that is so delicate.    The market starts early in the morning around 5am, and is done by early part of the day. Vendors from near and far bring their produce to sell to retailers who come from places far and near."

Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,MAHENDRANATHAN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,An Amazing Rainbow of Colours,"The Malik Ghat flower market can be found adjacent to the Howrah bridge with a multitude of flowers of various kinds and colours. The traders are seated side by side with their flowers in full display and you have a small walkway between these seated traders to walk through and make your purchase.Most of the flowers being sold are used for prayers in the temples and the array of colours displayed is fascinating.The sweet fragrance which emancipates from these flowers is also very captivating.You must also be careful of these vendors carrying these flowers in huge bundles over their heads walking along the same footpath and not stand in their way as the load appears very heavy. As you walk along,you will also see fruit vendors selling local fruits which are in season at reasonable prices.Fruits like mangoes, grapes, pomegranates were available in late Feb / March. This is a site not to be missed. Strongly recommended.Make sure you leave early for the market. Best time would be around 7.00am - 8.00am."

Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,RaghuRajMurmu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Friends,Wholesale Flower's Mandi (Market),"Right under the Howrah bridge's eastern side, this market is nestled tightly. If you are claustrophobic then maybe, this is not your kind of space to venture in. But if you can brave the crowd, do walk into this space twice in a day; first in the early morning to see a fresh supply of flowers coming in and being sold in bulk. Then again towards the sunset to view the hustle-bustle in the light of many lamps as well as small bulbs.Here you will get to see the most used Marigold as well as the exotic variety of flowers. The scent of different flowers should send you in a state of trance.However, be very cautious with the money that you are carrying on you because there are many pickpocketers, while it would be a good idea to flash out that huge DSLR of yours; only if you are getting into the market in a group.Do enjoy 'Chai in Kullhad' (earthen tea cup), while you are there."

Its dirty, noisy, bustling with people and is a huge market for flowers only. A visit to this place is not going to excite you if you are visiting this place purely for sight seeing. But if you have to get an essence of what a typical Indian market place resembles, this is certainly a must visit. The market runs along the banks of the river Ganges and is bounded by the river and a Railway line. Entering by road, it lies in continuation to a row of shanties. But as soon as it begins, one will be struck bu the size and volume of flowers this market handles. Flower of all colours and for all usage can be bought real cheap here. And the hustle and bustle adds to the feel of the place. This is a place to visit for getting a feel of it...... not for sight seeing."

This is colorful but a bit intense and you really don't do this on your own.

South_City_Mall,Satyajit Dasgupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo,Rooftop Food Court,"The post-fire newly constructed food court on the erstwhile rooftop is a visual delight with its wide expanse, generous seating and reasonably varied food/snacks/drinks on offer.The steep prices are perhaps an indication of the high rentals the food outlets have to pay the mall. The mall owners are trying to cover up the losses incurred due to the fire caused closure. The customers are paying the price.It is worth a visit just to enjoy the ambience of the food court and the air-conditioning if you have to visit the mall for some shopping.If you wish to eat, you can give the mall a miss. Better eateries have opened up within 3 square miles of the mall and they offer much better value for money."

South_City_Mall,stantp1916,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Welcome to the renovated south city,"We finally had a chance to visit the new and revamped south city mall. Well from the outside there isn’t much difference from the older attire except the entrance which seems different with a larger glass enclosure. Then comes the inside. At a first glance there is no change, then you start paying attention to the details and you will notice significant changes in the shop orientations, floor designing, interior decor etc which now looks much more upmarket than the previous attire. Also passages have been narrowed and space utilisation has been optimised which is good I think. The food court and movie hall are yet to open as on date. There has been substantial addition to overall lighting and therefore the mall looks even brighter. Overall you’ll definitely love this new look of the south city mall.P.S. Prices of most merchandise remain the same as before so no fear of price rise. And yes I did spot some very high end brands to find their place in this revamped mall."

No one had experienced a more beautiful and bigger mall in this city before and almost everything from good food to awesome clothes to books is available here. It's a little expensive if you want to shop the way you want but its worth it as the options available for any product are multiple and there is no compromise with quality. My favourite places on this mall are Pantaloons, StarMark and the food court. You have the Spencers Hyper Store as well so you have the chance to buy alcohol as well without standing in a queue on the road. A great place to hand out with friends any-day but back in 2008 when I was in college it hurt me personally for not having enough money to buy stuff-no regrets now ;) Finally you can also go for a movie date here[FAME] post which you can have lunch in the restaurants on the food court"

This place is our location of choice for entertainment (movies in the on-site multiplex), eating (food court and several restaurants) and shopping. In the last review done about two years back, had given a note of caution: the management needs to ""pull-up"" the maintenance of the toilets - several facilities have an ""out-of-order"" board/notice. And, now in 2017, from 1st February, a major overhaul is going to be undertaken for a period of about four months.Look forward to the renovated and rejuvenated ""New"" South City Mall."

South_City_Mall,bharatvaid6900,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Best of Kolkata,"Personally my favorite mall at Kolkata, it is designed in such a way that you get to shop all varieties of an item on one single floor. For example, if you wanna buy shoes - you'll find all brands on one floor. I think that's a great idea as it allows you to quickly weigh in all the available options and helps make a better choice. The food court here is good but, i would really recommend all the single restaurant outlets as they offer some unique cuisine and a great dining experience.Probably the best multiplex in kolkata is also at this mall - the Insignia theatre.On the whole there's a lot to do here and it would definitely be a good day spend."

South_City_Mall,Shireen S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016,BEWARE-DANGER AHEAD,"Who knew that one of the swankiest shopping malls in Kolkata has areas so poorly designed that they are virtual injury zones.Yes indeed, I recently fractured my foot when I tripped and fell in the hallway outside the 3rd floor toilet. I tripped because the floor was so polished and gleaming that I failed to spot a dip/step in the hallway. Since my accident quite a few others have told me that they stumbled in the same spot as they could not see the step up or down on the floor. Fortunately though, they did not suffer my fate. Anyway if this were the US then I would certainly file a lawsuit against the mall for faulty construction but seeing that this is the 3rd world I now have to bear my cross with forbearance.If however, you have had a similar experience then please feel free to share it with others and/or alert the authorities to the dangers of this otherwise upscale mall."

Part of the palace is still occupied by the royal family and this is not accessible for the public. No photography is allowed in the palace.You take off your shoes and you are getting a private tour with a guide. It seems that this place used to be very grand, but the time and weather has shown its impact. While it seems that the royal family tried to bring in any prestigious art from Europe, the collection is in very bad shape. The display is overcrowded and the building is not in great shape and it is definitely time for a renovation.It's a pity that if the royal family cannot preserve those valuable artifacts, they do not sell or contribute some of those art objects to the Kolkata Indian Museum."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Rasputin21,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,IMPOSSIBLE TO VISIT,"Like Rashtrapathi Bhavan in Delhi, the Marble Palace in Calcutta is an attraction that cannot be visited by a foreigner.  We tried to find the Tourist office at 2 Brabourne Street only to find the site a dirty, paan spat  spittoon hole of a foyer with no sign that the West Bengal tourist office was anywhere there.  Someone from the Tea Board at 6 GBB.  We went there and the the staff were merely talking to each other.  They had no map of Calcutta and the only brochure was on food - street food which if any foreigner was silly enough to eat would cause more than Calcutta belly!  They wanted us to return to 2 Brabourne road and search for the unfindable office somewhere in the building.  No foreigner is going to bother with this sort of running around.  The government obviously do not want anyone to see the dilapidated state it is in as is the rest of Calcutta.  Any wonder few foreigners come to Calcutta."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Sea Dweller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"It can be seen, that before it was a wonderful palace ...","Marble Palace is a palatial nineteenth-century mansion in North Kolkata. It is located at 46, Muktaram Babu Street. The mansion is famous for its marble walls, floors, and sculptures, from which it derives its name.     The house was built in 1835 by Raja Rajendra Mullick, a wealthy Bengali merchant with a passion for collecting works of art. The house continues to be a residence for his descendants, and the current occupants are the family of Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur.     To get inside today, you need to perform many formalities. First write down your name and citizenship at the entrance gate. Then you can take a walk in the garden. To get inside the palace, you must again write down your name, citizenship and full home address, remove your shoes and after that you can enter the palace. But even with all the formalities, taking pictures is prohibited, both outside and inside.     In general, I want to say that the building is rather poorly maintained."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Ajeet N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,A Wasted Masterpiece,"The marble palace lies in a corner which is desolate with narrow approach roads and vehicle inaccessible bylanes. Photography is not allowed which prevents popularisation. It is managed by unfriendly staff who give you an impression of being unwelcome. The upkeep is also poor which does not leave a good impression on ones mind. But inspite of these none too informidable drawbacks, the museum is packed with artefacts par excellence. There is wooden work, the highlight amongst which is a one piece statue of Victoria. There is marble, china, glass and brass in three roomfulls. The walls are adorned with reputed painters' works and india's own raja raviverma also finds a place.It is urgently necessary for the ASI to take this over and convert it into a well maintained museum of international attraction and repute."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Simon C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,An Absolute Gem,"This was a real surprise and if you are in Kolkata do visit. It does not really cater for tourists and is a little bit tired but the eclectic nature of the remarkable collection of fine art, antiques abd interiors is remarkable. No photography is allowed and you have to have a guide who will have minimal levels of knowledge about the art works but are pleasnant none the less.  In any other country this place would be packed but it feels like a reluctant heritage attraction and is delightfully quirky.  Minimal cover charge, no shop, no catalogue and they will turn on the light as you go around. There are two mirrors / pier glasses that have to be seen to be believed, they would not out of place at Versailles. "

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,swarup,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Revisited  the colonial era heritage of Kolkata,"Visited Marble Palace recently..Built byRaja Rajendra Mullick in late 1830s is a marvelous  combination of British and Indian architectural designs. Contains many bronze and wooden  sculptures of early 19th century British period apart from utensils made of China clay and wooden piano.The zoo (although  not a proper zoo of modern standards) contains many birds not commonly seen. This ""zoo"" is the earliest known zoo in India established in 1854.My only suggestion would be that please  reach  there by 1500 hrs as the mansion closes by 1600 hrs.Then only you can complete the tour properly.  Lastly,  I would say that  there is lack of maintenance of the place..otherwise the place is an marvellous monument of Kolkata."

Ignoring for a moment the nonsensical no photography edict, the ‘non-guides’ and the non-existent signage, this is still a remarkable place to visit. The marble is fascinating and the design bizarre; the chandeliers likewise and the Chinese vases vast and opulent. Most extraordinary was the birdsong: inside from the unfortunate caged birds and outside from their avian friends caroling freely. Bizarre and barking mad all in one place."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,atulya_sinha,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,PLAYTHINGS OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS,"Throughout the ages, those who had great wealth – especially the nouveaux riche, who acquired their wealth suddenly – have faced the problem of how to spend it! Mullick Thakurbari was constructed between 1835 and 1840 by Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur (1819-1887). The Raja was neither a ruler nor an aristocrat by birth – he was the adopted son of Nilmoni Mullick, a successful merchant, who died when the future Raja was only three years old. The young Rajendra was brought up single handedly by his mother Hiranmoyee Dasi, and went on to become a merchant, banker and philanthropist. He is said to have studied Sanskrit, Persian and English. It is hard to believe the claim that he spent his teenage years designing and supervising the construction of this extravagant neo-classical building, particularly because his mother was preoccupied with a legal dispute with his uncle. It is evident, however, that he was extremely wealthy and that he used his wealth to acquire works of art – somewhat indiscriminately. Later, his sons and grandsons also added to the family collection.The Thakurbari (later named “Marble Palace” by Lord Minto, then Viceroy of India) is a still a private residence where the sixth and seventh generations of descendants of the Raja live – but it is also a museum open to the public, albeit with conditions. You need permission to enter, but not from the owners – you have to apply in person and obtain a pass from the West Bengal Tourism Board, which neither owns or manages the establishment! As for the Palace/Museum itself, it has no conveniences like benches, luggage counters, washrooms or even drinking water for visitors. There is hardly any signage. There is supposed to be a whole galaxy of rules, but they are not displayed anywhere, leaving you at the mercy of the sentries on duty. There is very little information about the exhibits and no catalogues or souvenirs are available. The areas open to visitors are not clearly demarcated from the areas reserved for the use of the family and you might intrude upon their privacy by accident. As you approach the gate, you have to negotiate your way in with sentries in khaki uniforms armed with ancient spears. If you do not have the “mandatory” pass, you will be asked to write your name, address and telephone number in a register. Next, rules like “No photography” and “No parking” will be thrown at you – but as Groucho Marx had quipped, “These are my principles. If you don’t like them, I have got others.”Eventually, you manage to enter and feast your eyes upon the two pairs of stone lions occupying the four corners of the lawn. Then you realize that the grand façade you are seeing has no entrance for visitors – and so you turn towards the right to pay your respects at the statue of Raja Rajendra himself. (You may be tempted to take a quick selfie, but you are restrained by one of sentries who has been discreetly following you). Next, you walk into the long colonnaded portico along the west façade and confront a fresh group of sentries in khaki, who command you to take off your shoes and wait for a guide to become available. You are not permitted to enter without a guide and photography is just out of the question. If you are carrying any bags, you have to leave them on the steps. If you are part of group, expect at least one person to suggest quitting at this stage! If you are lucky, you meet a friendly sentry, who suggests that you can see the “zoo” while you are waiting for your turn to enter the building. You follow his advice and cross a lush green patch of weeds towards a series of enclosures, taking care to avoid collisions with sleeping lions or a bathing Venus! There you get to see half and dozen “chitals” (axis deer) and some unhealthy looking hornbills in cramped cages. The only healthy birds you find are the flocks of sparrows pecking on the ground. It is hard to believe that this was one of the earliest private zoos in India and animals and birds from its collection were donated to Alipore zoo when it was set up in 1876.Eventually, a “guide” appears and you realise that he is just another member of the khaki fraternity. He is polite and co-operative, but he has been employed primarily for keeping an eye on the visitors (the “no photography” rule is strictly enforced inside) – besides reading aloud the names of the exhibits. The guided tour covers three rooms on the ground floor. You begin with a room with two billiards tables (still used by the present day Mullicks and their guests) and a few sculptures. You turn left and enter a square chamber dedicated to Queen Victoria. There is a huge wooden sculpture depicting her coronation, and other statues of her as well. There is also a bronze statue of a strikingly beautiful woman – but when you examine it closely, you discover that her “crown” consists of tiny dragons and snakes! It turns out to be Medusa from Greek mythology, who had snakes instead of hair on her head. The ceiling of this room is adorned with elaborate wooden carvings in various colours.You enter the third room, which is known for its floor made of many different types of marble (estimates vary from 60 to 130). There are numerous sculptures in both marble and bronze, including two identical figurines of Napoleon. Then there are life-sized sculptures representing the four seasons and another pair representing Agriculture and Commerce. This hall also has Japanese porcelain vases. You exit this hall to reach the courtyard with a “Thakur dalan” or place of worship – perhaps the only Indian feature in this building said to be designed by an unnamed French architect. A Thakur dalan usually faces south, but this one faces west – some say that it was not originally meant for prayers, as there was a Jagannath temple at the north-western corner of the garden constructed by the Raja’s father, long before the Palace was built. The superb pillars supporting the roof catch your eye – technically speaking, they are “fluted columns with foliated capitals.” The corridors around the courtyard are occupied by antique wooden cages containing a variety of birds, including exotic macaws and cockatoos. The cages are quite small and you are justifiably outraged at this sight.Soon your guide ushers you up the wooden staircase and you find paintings displayed up to the very ceiling. You crane your neck, but cannot catch more than a glimpse of most of them. As you reach the landing on the first floor, there is large oil painting of the Raja Bahadur. The room to the right of the staircase has both paintings and sculptures on display. The walls of this room are inlaid with pieces of coloured glass. One hears the names of many famous artists – including Rubens, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Murillo, Gainsborough, and even Titian – but it not very clear which paintings are original and which are copies. The only one with a relatively well established history is “The Marriage of St Catherine” by Peter Paul Rubens, which was gifted by Lord Northbrook to the Government School of Art and eventually found its way here. In the absence of independent corroboration, it seems that most of the other paintings – some encased in glass and being spoilt by dampness – could well be copies made by art students. This room also has an elaborate grandfather clock which still chimes the hours, half-hours and quarter-hours.You step into the corridor, noting the oil paintings being exposed to the elements. A fine marble sculpture of a laughing satyr catches your eye.Your last stop on the first floor is the so-called Ballroom (translated from “Naach ghar,” which has a very different connotation). There are huge mirrors covering the end walls and heavy chandeliers suspended from the ceiling. Surprisingly, the floor of this room is made of plain grey cement. It seems quite rough after the marble flooring in the other rooms and is quite unsuitable for dancing of any kind. Your guide will give the lame explanation that the hall was carpeted earlier and show you a few moth-eaten rolls lying around. This hall has been filled up with furniture in various stages of disrepair – which remind you of the attics of Kolkata’s celebrated auction houses. You try to step into the balcony to escape the musty smell, but are called back by the guide as you are dangerously close to disturbing the family! By now you are feeling quite satiated. Your guide escorts you downstairs and you reach the billiards room again. You part amicably (ahem!) and retrieve your shoes and bags with a feeling of relief. If you search for Kolkata’s Marble Palace on the Net, you will come across numerous articles, gushing with praise, mostly written during the past ten or fifteen years. It seems that most of these writers were not casual visitors, but invited as guests of the Mullick family. On the other hand, the British writer Geoffrey Moorhouse says the exhibits look ""as if they had been scavenged from job lots on the Portobello Road on a series of damp Saturday afternoons.” Others call it “the height of kitsch.” A friend who specializes in the history of Kolkata dismisses the Mullick collection as “European trash” and the sentries/ guides in khaki uniforms as “the Mafia,” who are a law unto themselves! Despite the variety and the richness of the exhibits, one leaves with a sense of dismay. The obvious reasons are the poor upkeep and the attitude of the staff. But there is also a more subtle cause for the discontent felt by the visitor – the Palace is supposed to be a private residence, but nearly all the rooms one has seen were meant just for displaying opulence. Where did the Mullicks – especially the ladies – cook, eat, sleep or work? Well, they simply had another house – which can still be seen, in a state of disrepair, to the south of the Palace. Allow me to conclude with a word of recommendation: If you have included the Marble Palace in your list of 100 things to see/do in Kolkata, make sure that the other 99 are crossed out first!"
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Peter F,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Wasted Potential,"See Brun066's review about 3 weeks before this one. Everything he says is right.It is a brief escorted walk around a number of rooms, not a guided one. The billiard tables and some seats are covered up too so you cannot see them.The building is crying out for an audioguide or knowledgeable guides to show people round.The building and its contents are worth seeing but expect to be disappointed and if you are short of time this probably is a visit to be sacrificed to see other sites."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Brun066,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Demonstration of how a cultural asset should not be managed.,"As I understand, this palace was built in the 1830s by a wealthy Bengali merchant, whose family still owns it, and lives part of the premises.The rest of the mansion is open for visits, and this concession must be appreciated; but the appreciation ends here.In fact, entry is free in theory, but is subject to a permit from the Kolkata Tourist Office. However, the experience I lived shows that very few submit to this procedure unnecessarily bureaucratic, so the majority doesn't arrive with the permit; and this is an opportunity for the gatekeeper to ""grant"" the entry equally, against a tip.Not only that: when we reached the Palace, the entrance gate was flooded for monsoon rains. It would have been enough to throw two boards on the puddle to allow visitors to enter. But the gatekeeper doesn't do any of this: on the contrary, again, he ""grants"" your taxi to go beyond the gate and the puddle, in order to obtain a more substantial tip.Once inside, another tip is actually due, because the guided visit is mandatory.To be more precise,, the visit is accompanied, not guided: in fact the ""guide"" doesn't tell anything significant, apart from repeating something that is already written in the captions.The works of art (some outstanding) and antiques follow one another in the rooms without an apparent order: they seem to be piled up in bulk. Anyway, if there is an order, it's not given to see it. Everything is dusty and shows neglect.I would have gladly paid (as, I believe, many others) a real admission ticket, in exchange for a better collections' organization..This palace is however an interesting demonstration of the wealth of the family (and of Kolkata as a city) in the first half of the nineteenth century. But on the whole it's also a demonstration of how a cultural asset should not be managed."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Chris Ward,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Miserable Guide,"The Marble Palace is pretty amazing to look at, but the guide who walked us around told us little that wasn’t obvious and did the tour in about five minutes flat.

I am glad we never visited the menagerie."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Ankit B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Not worth your time,"I had visited this Palace after reading good reviews and pics on the internet, but was extremely disappointed. It was a visit in the evening and the place was not lit at all and quite dark. There are lot of art and showpieces in the Palace, but they are haphazardly placed in the Palace (as if it is a store-room). There was also some antique furniture, which was cheaply covered with cloth/plastic sheets. The Palace was also dug at several places, and definitely not a sight worth visit. You need to tip the housekeeping staff, who would just read names written on the artifacts without any description whatsoever and you're left wondering if they were actually a 'guide'. During our visit, we were accompanied by a Spanish couple, who also left with a distasteful experience like ours. So disappointed I didn't even click a picture. It could have been a worthy attraction, but its shabby maintenance currently does not justify a visit."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Go581028,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Quirky and atmospheric palace,"This Kolkata palace is a grand 19th century house, neoclassical on the outside but with elaborate baroque interiors.The way it operates is strange - it is open to the public most days but they don't make it easy to visit. For example the so-called tourist permit that a sign says is required. I didn't have a permit, ignored the sign and didn't even have to bribe the gate guard - just walked straight in and signed the visitor's book.I also don't understand why photography is strictly forbidden, even of the exterior. Apparently because it's private property? But I have visited scores of privately owned properties around the world and had no problems photographing them.The house is operated primarily for the benefit of the staff. The owner does not charge an entry fee but retains a large staff of guards and guides who live off tips from visitors. As many other reviewers have suggested, a proper entry fee could raise some income to conserve the house and art collection. Otherwise, without any maintenance, the palace will eventually crumble. It appears that the current owner has no interest in preserving the house.The guide appeared to be clueless and could add very little information or answer questions. This might be due to their lack of English. I had to constantly slow the guide down so that I could study objects in more detail - he wanted me through as quickly as possible, to get my tip at the end. He asked for a preposterous 500 Rp tip, I certainly didn't give him that much.It is crammed with an eclectic collection of (mostly 19th Century) sculptures, paintings and furniture. Some may be genuine and valuable antiques but much of the collection is neglected and in poor condition. Some is just kitsch. Many of the paintings are bad copies of original works. The ""Reubens"" may even be genuine but it's in such poor condition it's difficult to tell.Nevertheless, it's well worth a visit to experience a quirky, fascinating and atmospheric view of faded grandeur from 19th century Kolkata."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Colin H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Faded grandeur,"I visited the Marble Palace yesterday morning and thought I'd make a few points.I obtained a pass the day before from the Tourism Department of the Government of West Bengal office, which is located on the fourth floor of their building at 2 Brabourne Street (next to St Andrew's Church).  If you go to their office on BBD Bagh, they will tell you to go there.  It took only five minutes to get the pass, for which there was no charge.  You will need to take either your passport or a copy of its key page.The palace is fairly easy to find once you get to MG Road Metro Station (a five minute walk).  Alternatively, a taxi can drop you outside.There is no charge for visiting the palace, but the guide who shows you round (you cannot wander at will on your own inside) will expect a small tip (maximum 100 rupees, I'd suggest).  As many reviewers have remarked, the rooms you are shown, some of them very grand, are crammed with family acquisitions, some of which, I'm sure, are quite valuable.  I'd love to know if some of the paintings really are by the artists they claim they are by (e.g. Rubens, Murillo, Sassoferrato, Reynolds).  You are free to stroll around the grounds (including a small zoo) without an escort, though you will be monitored to ensure you don't take photos (which seems to be a big 'no'no' for some reason).  I'm afraid that I surreptitiously took a few when I was unobserved.It is definitely worth visiting the Marble Palace for a rare glimpse and fascinating insight into how the upper classes once lived in Calcutta.  The descendants of the gentleman who had the palace built still live in part of it.  However, I think they really ought to think about 'professionalising' the 'visitor experience'.  Either you open your home to the public or you don't.  If the former, then do it properly, by charging visitors a fair amount for interesting and informative guided tours and giving them something in return: a small brochure or information sheet, for example.  More anecdotes about the family and some of the items would be welcome. The guides should also be trained to provide much more information and to answer questions, rather than simply pointing to an item and saying 'piano', when it's perfectly obvious what it is!  The owners possess a magnificent asset and they really should be doing more to promote it and to enhance the experience visitors are given.  Despite my frustration, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Marble Palace, which is undoubtedly one of the city's great treasures.I should also mention that the guard on duty at the gate made a half-hearted effort to extract a tip from me.  He was not in luck!  He had provided me with no service whatsoever.  All he did was to bark, 'no photo, no photo'.It was also distressing to see some quite large hornbills kept in cages in the zoo which were far too small for birds of that size.  The bird cages in the main inner courtyard of the palace - dozens of them - were also far too small and very dirty too.  Disgusting!"
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Sukanya D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Well maintained Mansion and Semi- Museum,"Used to keep reading about this place in blogs so landed up at about 10.30 AM or so just like that on a Saturday (closed Monday and Thursday). The place was almost deserted...very few in Kolkata really bother with it. It took me over half a century to pay my first (and last) visit. The guard with a broken spear was officious but that was to be expected; we did not have a pass from the Tourism guys. They noted down the Aadhar Card number of one of us and entered. We roamed the grounds that was dotted with marble lions...all sorts (prowling, hunting, sleeping etc ). There is a coy Venus, a fountain and marble tables in leafy bowers. There was a Jagganath temple that only family members could enter (we were instructed to peep in through a window). It is old but not remarkable. A statue of the founder (an adopted son) is outside. There is a lake in front. Some birds are displayed in aviaries that ought to have been MUCH larger. Flocks of free sparrows made me happy. Animals? We saw only spotted deer in small, boring enclosures. NOT IMPRESSED...somewhat sad that the animals are kept like this. Guards strolling around kept telling us no photos...no photos...no photos.We were really under human surveillance and it detracted from the enjoyment of the lovely grounds. I appreciate that this is a private residence. The thought occurs to me that they should NOT allow ANY VISITORS. When we went up to the extremely well-maintained palace with mounted Moose heads on the wall...we had to take off our shoes (they provide shoe covers) and one guard kept us company all the while. He was polite, did not know much but was as officious as the others. No photos. No photos. NYET, NYET and more NYET...when one of us received a text message he was told...No mobile. What did I like here? The marble floor and wood ceilings. The two huge blemish-free mirrors (I almost expected to learn that the mirrors were forbidden to show reflections). The mirrors are so large that I was told (likely a tall tale) that these were installed first then the wall and windows of the hall were constructed. I kept imagining what beauties of the era would have been reflected in it; twirling and dancing....The huge Rosewood statue of Queen Victoria..a sad reminder of our colonial past where some curried favour with the English ..but anyway the art is to be appreciated. Paintings by Reubens. Raja Ravi Varma cheek by jowl with marble statues of all kinds....the four seasons, Night and Day etc. etc. Could have stood there admiring but the guard was merely walking us through the rooms. The rooms are massive. Stuffed as these are with exhibits these still have enough room for us to walk around and gawk.We were the only visitors at that point...we could have stood and stared.A 100 INR note to say Thank you to the guide and 50 INR to the guard with the broken spear for allowing us to park inside for free.Wish there were information booklets we could buy or photos.Checking the Internet I see good quality photos in blogs and wonder why I was not allowed to take some photos...maybe they should consider allowing photography for a fee. There is no toilet here that I could see and the animals really need to be housed better."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Marlis0707,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Bribes to enter - badly maintained ,"My brother in law insisted of visiting this place, was definitely an experience. In arrival the said you needed special permissions, we did manage to get in but were asked straight away for a payment and had to write our details in a book. They wanted a contacts number, which I thought was outrageous, got to be joking, why!!!! Told us not to take photos, was it because they didn’t want people to see how bad the place was looked after!!!!We were told to go to the side and to wait for the guide. Got told to take our shoes off, didn’t see the reason why as the place was not exactly clean. He showed us around the two floors. There is a large collection of paintings and antiques, which are badly maintained. They are covered in dust and dirt. Some pieces have been in the sunlight too much and showing neglect. The whole place needs a good clean, why have such valuable items and not look after it, this is beyond me. Obviously they have no bride in their place. After the tour obviously the guide wanted paying.We walked to the small zoo, which is in appalling condition, shame on them how the keep the poor animals. If that was in Europe, first the animals would be taken away and the would be charged.If they would clean up the place and look after it properly they could charge a standard fee and use the money to upkeep the place. The staff was only interested in getting a tip and you felt harassed by it. Perhaps the owners should read some of the reviews and take things on board "
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,abhigya m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,"Worth a visit (which is free) but for the guards shamelessly asking for ""bakshish""","The palace stands like a lotus in the dirty pond. As soon as we entered the premise, we were told where to park. There are parking spots inside the premise. Next, we were asked at the gate to NOT take photographs anywhere and to sign in our names/ address/ time of entry in a log book. We had to take our shoes off at one of the gates of the palace, and then assigned a guide, who showed us around the two floors. Rooms are full of beautiful but old and some rare statues, paintings, mirrors and other unique artifacts brought by the owners from all over the world. Though some rooms were closed for renovation on the 2nd floor, it was still an unique experience. After the tour, we generously rewarded our guide. Visit to the palace is ""FREE"", however as soon as we got in to our cars, the car windows were knocked upon by the guards asking for ""bakshish"". We were forced to dole out money to these assigned guards in brown uniform, even though they did nothing to deserve that. We are happy to reward people who deserve it. And all this happening in front of the eyes of the owners roaming in the gardens (owners were pointed out to us by the guide, and also the young owner who was sitting in the porch as the one who sings and has participated in singing competitions).The zoo has some nice species of birds. Beware of the guards when you go! Otherwise it is worth just one visit."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,David K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,"Visit to Marble Palace, Kolkata",The palace was well worth seeing both for the eclectic assortment of objects and for the building in its peaceful environment so different from the hectic city all around it.The guided tour would have been better if the guide had had more to say about the building but was otherwise just about adequate (focused almost exclusively on the country if origin of the item and what it was made of)The worst part was the entry system with no fixed charge for the guide (he was discontented with 200 rupees and we ended up giving him 400 rupees. The guard on the gate collected another 200 rupees per person making 800 rupees in all. Not a large sum by Swedish standards but rather a lot for a museum in Kolkata.I don’t pay a higher foreigners price if I know the mone is going to the museum but this system which allowed the staff to siphon off money didn’t feel good. They should replace it with proper entrance tickets.

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Tapan B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Gate closed on face,"Tried to find the location near Tagore university saw few lady students asked whereabout of Marble palace , they were busy eating puffed candy phuchka , said didnit know, as entered university saw a teacher asked if marble palace nearby told him heard within walking distance from Tagore house and university , he described the lanes where to pass for the palace, said to teacher your students didn’t know such historical palace , he rebuked me it was not possible to learn everything. True. After about five minutes walk through usual filthy dirty lanes came across a white building with a large ground in front. The gatekeeper with a spear in hand opened the gate for a car to reverse , usual Indian / Calcuttan notice no photography allowed.  when asked for entry the gatekeeper shut the iron gate almost on our face, pointed finger towards sky then asked very rudely to get permission from some unknown tourist office. however for us after visiting far and wide Europe almost all countries of South America North Africa south east Asia Japan Korea Australia seeing treasures in museums in Iran and Turkey looted from India , even after visiting forts palaces in India , we had no grief not being able to visit this house, we found the gatekeeper with spear more comical , took his picture ,if the palace owner did choose a guard with large moustache and head gear like in many hotels and mounting on a  white horse would have been more attractive guarding the vast wealth inside.  He  did not throw his spear towards us ."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,SuffolkLucchese,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,"Stunning house, but a bit bonkers too...","What a nuts place, you have to have a sense of humour and go with it. Firstly it is worth getting the permit, from the West Bengal Tourist Office, but not the main address frequently mentioned in guide books, the correct place to go as mentioned on a previous post is Govind Bhawan, 4th Floor, 2 Braborne Road. Their is no signage other than the board by the lifts as you enter, one of the party should have id, I used a UK driving licence. The staff there are very friendly and being govt employees would not accept any token of appreciation for their help, on the contrary we were offered tea whilst we had a brief wait.There is no doubt this is an immensely important house in the history of Kolkata and the fact that the family still own and open it up is to be applauded. However it is bizarre the way it is run, sure it  is free but at every opportunity the staff are asking for tips. The permit at least bats off the rude arrogant gate staff. For whatever reasons the family have in not formalising the running of visits it is currently a mess. The collection is interesting, at times odd, a mix between possibly very valuable pieces and some worthless rubbish, it is not well kept and the guides are really there just to escort you around the building, they offer no history or useful comments about any aspect of the house, other than one liners such as “Napoleon” for a bust of Napoleon. The “guide” is only interested in his tip, which being a free look around would have been bigger if not for the pestering. To be able to see such a building is a treat and a glimpse of some of the former wealth in the city.The zeal with which the staff try to enforce the no photography rule is comical, I fully respect the family not wishing photos within the grounds, but they also try to stop you taking photos of the frontage from the street.All in all its great place to visit, such a pity the staff are so orientated in looking for their tips, in that respect it was the exception in our entire visit to Kolkata and many other sites where everyone was friendly and welcoming. With a little thought and renovation this place would be stunning. Just have your happy face on for the 45 mins or so it takes to look around, but the “zoo” is in poor condition and not worth it, but I hardly think any one goes there to specifically see it."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,DurgeshRajadhyaksha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Lovely Palace with mesmerizing collection for art lovers,"The Grandeur of the Mullick family reflects throughout this lovely Marble Palace. A Permit issued free of charge by the Tourism Dept at BBD Baug is required for entering this place. But as in most cases in India, we were allowed entry without Permit, just by bribing the Security guy at the main gate Rs. 50 only. Another Rs 50 was offered to the Guide who took us around the various galleries of this Palace. Part of the Palace is still a Private property where the Mullick family descendants reside. It is not well maintained & needs to be brightly lit so that all artifacts displayed can be really appreciated. Its a paradise for art lovers. Its closed on Thursday & closes by 3 pm daily. It is just 5 minutes walk from the MG Road Metro Station & is located in popular Chittaranjan Avenue area. It can be clubbed with a visit to Jorasanko Thakurbadi ( just 5 minutes away ) & a visit to the famous College Street & Presidency College with a drop at the famous iconic Indian Coffee House for a cup of Coffee & Bread Toast Butter."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,DoiBedouin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,The Marvelous Marble Palace,"The entrance to the palace has two large deer-head mounts.  Entering into the palace will literally connote the name of the place.  The palace is flooded with marble effigies and indeed a paradise for the art lovers.  The reception hall has billiards boards and a notable Japanese bronze vase of about 4 ft.  Walking on, the guide took us to a dark room which when lighted displayed the 6 ft high Mahogany statue of Queen Victoria. Other statues included the Greek Goddesses; the ceiling of the room too was decorated with wooden motifs.  The “hakur dalan” has a marble fountain like structure in the centre, with the marble floor designed in floral patterns.  The central worshipping pedestal too is of Marble with the figurines of Rama and Sita made on the walls behind it.  The arched roof above the pedestal section too has cupids and floral designs plasterd on the edges. The corridors had caged macaws of different types and cockatoos.  The first floor was availed through the wooden stairs with the wall paintings overlooking the visitors.  The first floor itself is another grandeur with frequent black marbled statues of birds (ravens mostly).  Worth mentioning is the dancing hall with the ceiling long wall mirror of Belgian  glass on both sides of the room, that my friend is going to etch it’s place on your memory. Throughout the hall was other statuettes personifying the Greek deities four seasons- Spring Autumn, Summer and Winter, the statue of Commerce and Agriculture. The other hall had the oil paintings of the linage of the Mullick family. Other paintings are – the “Marine View” by Dutch painter Jan Van Goyen, “Madonna with Child” by Italian painter Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato, “The Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine” by Rubens and “The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian” by Piero del Pollaiolo, as also some paintings by famous Indian artist Raja Ravi Varna and The Last Supper. The first ever piano, the grandfather’s clock and the ivory tusk are the notable mentions. Other statues worth mentioning are the greek Goddesses of Venus holding cupid, Apollo, Moses etc.   Best time to visit: Anytime;  Timing:  10 am to 4 pm. Closed on Mondays and Thursdays;  Cost:  Free entry, however you may tip the guide on your wish. You might need a prior permission from the tourism board.  Nevertheless, if you don't have any, a government identity card would do."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,L7826XJjs,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,"Tourist trap with extremely rude ""tour guides."" Scam Alert.","First you've got to bribe the guard. He tells you this discretely on the way in; you must agree to a price but pay it on your way out.  No photos are allowed (not even ones from outside on the street; it's rather silly). The grounds and small zoo are worth a quick look and pleasant stroll but DO NOT GO INSIDE. This is a complete rip-off.  It's pay what you wish for a tour guide, and you can't go in without a tour guide. You should tell them you'll pay for it after the tour, not beforehand.  I agreed up front to an intentionally paltry 50 rupees thinking that if the guide was great I'd give him more, but he was a joke.  You see a piano and he points at it and says ""piano.""  Then ""billiard table,"" and then a bust of the god Jupiter, labeled Jupiter, and he points to it and says ""Jupiter.""  This whole thing lasts about 10 minutes.  I was the only one on my tour and as soon as the guide got me alone in a room away from the front guards, and with only one other Bengali custodian dusting something off in a corner, he asked me which country I'm from. I said US.  Then right away they started cracking rude jokes about me in Bengali of the ""stupid white American"" variety.  Imagine their shock when I started speaking Bengali to them and told them I understood what they were saying.   The guide tried to quickly smooth things over by asking me polite questions about where I was staying and how long I'd been in Kolkata.  The tour ended and I didn't want to give him anything, but I'd said 50 so I counted out 50 rupees for him.  He had the audacity after all of that to point into my wallet and ask for a larger bill.  I chuckled and said no way in hell and walked out.  there's nothing in there worth seeing and you don't need to pay to be insulted by thugs. Skip it.Once back outside, walking toward the gate, I heard a puja going on in the little temple on the grounds so I walked over to it. The door was wide open, there were two priests chanting and ringing a bell. I would have happily listened quietly for a few moments and made a cash offering as is customary, but instead a man stood up and shooed me out, saying ""Private temple!""  Then why's it on the grounds and why's the door why open?  Beats me.Oh, you'll get a taste of the local culture alright."

And that's a real pity in these modern times to not be able to share there with friends.  The gardens are pretty and lush the aviaries not so . The guide which it seems you have to take whizzes you around in 30 minutes and it's a pity you can't go back in to return to key pieces that you had seen. Some of the guards are very keen on trying to obtain tips for any old reason so beware, that's also a bit of a spoiler."

Well preserved aesthetics, architecture, some remarkable pieces of art makes the visit to this mansion worthwhile. Reminds one of the culture and way of life during the bygone zamindari era. There is also a well maintained garden, a small pond and a private zoo, which has a few herbivores animals and birds, in the area adjoining the building. Note: Since this is said to be a private residence, photography was prohibited and one was required to carry valid proof of identity at the time of visit."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Diplokeith,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Business,The Hearst Castle of Kolkata,"Part of my half-day tour brought me to the Marble Palace, about which I knew nothing. Turns out it was and is a private estate built and decorated by an extremely wealthy Indian businessman in the mid-1800’s.The building is very much in the Italian Palazzo style, all marble. It is filled...and I do mean FILLED...with a staggering collection of artwork.  Mostly paintings and statuary from late renaissance Europe, but also a sprinkling of Chinese and Japanese porcelain.  The huge Ruebens painting and the smaller Murillo were, in my mind, the gems of the collection.In essence it reminded me of the Hearst Castle in California. Another monument to a man with vast wealth and an inclination to collect.Unfortunately the Palace has not been maintained very well.  It is not at all clear to me what the plans are for renovations.  Apparently the owning family still live in part of the premises.  But, for 200 rupees to the guide and 100 to the security guard, you get a chance to experience a pretty amazing private art collection!Oh, do take a few minutes when you leave the mansion and see the few remaining animals in what used to be a pretty extensive private zoo.  Now just a few birds and varieties of deer, but still interesting!"

I regret giving him anything! Having said that the place is amazing with a remarkable collection of artefacts and art. I just wish I had got a guide who would have gone into some depth. Maybe others will be luckier."

It is worth visiting this place when you are in Kolkata.The guides expect tips but don't demand minimum amount and they all share it. There's also a mini zoo outside the palace with many birds. I felt sad for the monkey that was locked up alone in an enclosure and seemed to be depressed."

It is open on Sundays. The palace requires about an hour to walk through. It is one of the best preserved neoclassical 19th century mansions in Kolkata. The cast iron work on the front facade is beautiful. It has a great collection of sculptures, Victorian furniture and several paintings which includes two Rubens. The bird cages on the ground floor are messy and smelly and should be removed.. Without charging an entry fee - it is going to be impossible for the owners to continue to maintain or restore this glorious building and the premises. "

The entrance to this Palace is actually an experience. As we went on a weekend, we found guards at the Main gate who allowed us to enter and park the car in the parking area. It seemed a part of the palace is still occupied and at one end of the garden some family function took place a day earlier. We were strolling in the garden where we found a super mini zoo with dear and few birds.Mesmerised with the outer beauty of this palace we entered the main building where photography was a No-No. Nevertheless, we understood why photography is barred when we entered inside to see a full length Billiards board of ancient times surrounded by high rise seating arrangement. Amongst many statues and artefacts the best and the most amazing piece of work was a statue of a Queen (people to visit and explore) carved out of a single Rose wood.I consider this place a must visit for those who wants to see the hidden gems of the city of Joy."

I guess it helps to know one of the owners family. Wish they could get a professional team of restorators to professionally restore the art to its original glory.Overall a must visit while in Kolkata as you'll be amazed at the collection they have. Breath taking.
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,PaulGs_77,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"Interesting place, guards solicit bribes to enter","This is an interesting mansion to spend a few minutes if you're in the area. However, the way it is run is an embarrassment. There is a big sign at the gate that says ""open 10:00am-2:00pm"" and ""admission free"", but if you try to enter, the guard points to another says that says ""permission from the tourism board required to enter"" or something like that. The guard then helpfully suggests you bribe him instead of getting said permission. You're also required to get a tour of the interior and tip the tour guide.I didn't mind giving the tour guide a decent tip since the kid made an effort to show various interesting artifacts and features. But I decided to only give the guard at the gate a small amount on the way out, since he hadn't actually done anything except solicit a bribe. He then started arguing that the amount I gave was insufficient. Pro tip for the guard: if you're going to demand bribes from visitors, maybe try to get cash up front to avoid any misunderstandings.If they clean up their act this place could be worth visiting. However, it's not worth going to a separate office to get permission to enter, and it's also not worth the bribery hassle from the guards."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Brett G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"Must Have Been Breathtaking In Its Prime, But Now It Is Sadly Crumbing Into Dust","It's fortunate that this building still maintains some of its earlier grandeur, but, in its current state, being used for storage, collecting dirt and trash, and slowly decomposing into nothingness, this mansion may no longer exist in ten or twenty years unless the administration can find some way to renovate it and maintain it.  Sad to see such mismanagement.  Here's a proposal:  charge and entry fee and tell the guards to stop asking tourists to give them a bribe for the visit when the signs behind their heads say the visit is free.  In this way, the palace can have money for renovation and the tourists won't feel uncomfortable having the security guards fleece them for money.  A win-win situation.  The palace will look much better and we will thank the administration for their fine efforts.In other news:  a permit is no longer required.  I went today and, instead of receiving a permit for a subsequent visit, I was escorted immedialety inside the palace when I arrived."

First, the museum is free. We tipped our guide (you have to go around with one) but didn't give money to anyone else. As mentioned in other reviews, the money conscious guards said some malarkey about 'not registering' as we were walking out (you can't) but we just said 'nice try'.The palace has amazing marble floors, more Victoria statues and busts than you'd find in London, and plenty of Italian marble statues. Also a strange collection of noisy birds on the first floor. The whole place has an entertaining and dusty air to it. Remarkable that the place is as in good a condition that it is.Sadly, I don't think the works by Reubens, Titian, and Murillo are authentic. If so they have an amazing conservationist considering that the room is not temperature controlled and pigeons can fly in and out. But still fun! "

The palace is intact, but not very well maintained - the zoo is small, but nicely kept.

Being located at the middle of the ground we got perfect view of both sides of the field. The semi oval shaped 3 tiered stadium looks huge, bright and awesome. Being Derby day, the stadium was full with both the team's supporters gathering in large numbers with their favourite club colours and chanting club theme songs. Great experience though my team lost."

Competitive sports also takes a back seat in the city and for that matter in the country and as such a football stadium of this stature is being wasted.

When I reached the temple it was closed at 2 pm and was scheduled to be opened at 3.30pm. I came with my family in my private car and  to wonder you can't enter the temple and park your vehicle till it was closed. I can understand if the temple for the idol is closed at least the premises can be kept open for the visitors to enter and wait inside. The complex was very big but visitors have to wait outside the temple at the side of the most dangerous highway you can ever find with buses driving on a suicide mode. I had to find a less safe place to park my car and waited for 1.5 hrs outside. This is pathetic management rule. Other than that no doubt temple architecture is definitely praiseworthy.Parking is not free btw.And a word of caution if you are coming in your own vehicle and you reached after temple is closed then be ready to wait outside at the most dangerous highway you can ever find.

Called national library, it became the property of the central government which is as well, for the building  has been properly looked after over the decadesBelvedere House is a  beautiful house with typical English architecture of the 19th century with a commanding setting over a raised edifice, the rooms on the ground floor now being used to store the books. The smaller rooms are  let out to out of town scholars. The stately rooms with wooden floors  are both awe-inspiring and overwhelming.  These  are mostly used as the reading rooms. Reached by a flight of wide, majestic stairs, with curved balusters, it was the place where the famous film director  Satyajit Ray stood to receive the Commander of the Legion of Honour of the French government in 1989.Set over aesthetically  designed gardens,  it is transformed into a riot of colours during the winter season when dahlias, gerberas and chrysanthemums are in full bloom.Sadly there is no tour organized here , nor is there a tea or coffee cafe, to sit down in the grounds and enjoy the entire place over a cup of hot beverage."

However, it is a government institute and suffers from bureaucratic trappings, common in several government institutes in the State of West Bengal. Particularly, various facilities of the library do no operate on the Saturdays, which seemed to be a convenient time for many working people to visit the library. Furthermore, the instructions on their website regarding their working hours on Saturdays is old and misleading and might confuse many. I love their resources but the stuff and the work culture could definitely improve."

It is set-up in an underground area, however it is not really underground. All buildings situated therein are of a height of ground level and for the safety of place, it has been surrounded by artificial canal. The entry to the place is only with the permission of Indian Army authorities and general public is not allowed inside. Hence this cannot be called a tourist attraction. "

My only wish is that they will be more receptive to opening up the grounds and the structure to the public... to handle crowds better, they can limit the number of passes per month. As it is the sheer sight of automatic weapons manage crowds better anyways :)"

Earlier about twenty years back I did business with the Army. The changes are distinctly different and for the better. The Army is aware of the heritage it has inherited and taking care of them. The new museum gives vistors a flavor of the different wars it has fought  over the last 100 years. Every thing is good but this Fort is really notaccessible to the general public. If you have an army officer as a friend dont miss it."
Fort_William,theCraftyCamera,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Friends,The Raj experience,"This is not a tourist destination. Its the headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army.Unlike the Red Fort in Delhi which is also used by the Army, general entry is not permitted. You can't go in un-escorted. Period. Don't ask why - its a defense establishment.If you are a guest of a defense personnel (army, navy or air force) you can accompany the personnel info Fort William. Not all areas are super-secret and there are several officers who live inside the complex. But even inside, its best to be with the army personnel and not wander around aimlessly.Once inside, the full splendor of the British Raj is revealed. You are no longer in the world of civilians but in the regiment of the Raj. Raj-era buildings and customs transport you to another era. This is a must do if you know an Army officer. If not, you are out of luck :)"

We saw some film promotion event going on in an eating outlet on a Sunday afternoon"

It is filled with crowds and it is very tough to walk on the streets as you have to maintain pace with the crowds. I went here along with three other friends and stood at street corners to marvel at the architecture of the Old buildings like the LIC Building. Also we visited the Hogg Market [New Market] which was built during british rule and wondered why it could not be converted like the Central Market in Kuala Lumpur. Both are built around the same time.It's also home to all the old movie halls like New Empire, Roxy, Elite, Tiger, Metro etc and now what we see is most of them have been converted into Shopping places or restaurants.I hope the Bengal government which is instrumental in beautifying the New town area will also focus on this amazing place in Kolkata."

Chowringhee,Harpreet_Chd,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Business,An experience to remember by,"There is not one particular thing that you can label as a definitive sight seeing activity per se in this area, known by the ever popular name of Chowringhee. A popular place, immortalised in books, movies, stories and even history, Chowringhee became famous as an urban destination when the British started building residences around this area, which was practically a jungle infested with wild cats. It is to Kolkata what Piccadilly is to London.The main stretch of the area is the JL Nehru Road, but other popular roads like Camac Street and Sudder also fall in this area. For the locals and tourists alike, Chowringhee defines Old Calcutta, both in terms of the layout as well as the architecture of the buildings. This is also the Business hub of the city, and therefore almost always crowded and chaotic. You will find all modes of transport, all forms of shops, all varieties of things to eat, and all different types of activities happening around you. You can catch a bus, hire a rickshaw, travel by metro, ride a bicycle, take a walk...have any form of Indian/Chinese/Continental/American cuisine in some nook or corner of the umpteen streets in the area, and also find small to large shopping establishment either in the well defined shopping outlets, or as an unorganised setup on the pavements- don't be surprised to find full suits being sold right on the pavement. It is precisely this order in chaos that makes Chowringhee so special- be a part of the crowd, experience the madness in all forms and colours, savour the delicacies on offer, and live life the way it is on offer in Chowringhee. You will find your own reason to cherish some or all of it."

Has a relatively good selection of shops (even though a few have shut before and during the pandemic), most of the indoor mall and even the outside corridors are relatively clean and well-maintained (definitely puts New Market in Central Kolkata to shame in my opinion) and covid checks and regulations are followed for the most part. My only issue with this place is that the main food court (think it was called Hangouts) is no longer present anymore, having been replaced by a Burger King and a cafe, which is a real shame in my opinion as that was a place I loved to visit and eat whenever I went with my relatives here and its closure means that there are fewer eating options now, but apart from that, I still love visiting this area and with the new metro line now open, travelling there should be more convenient than before, especially when the full line to Howrah opens."

Its just below the City centre metro station and thus navigating from this place is quite easy. While this review is with regards to the mall, however I cannot stop mentioning something which caught my attention about 100 metres from the mall and which you might want to explore. There is a house which I covered which amazingly landscaped from the streets to the entire boundary wall as well the outer house walls and balcony with flowers. It just cheered me up and of course the pleasure to the eyes to the heart which is inexplicable. The mall is quite large but from the metro side it can be a bit claustrophobic. I almost got lost trying to find the entrance to the CCD though it can be easily accessed from the outside as well. There are enough Retail shop and food outlets to spend time and to shop your hearts content, I have given 4 rating for the location though I was not quite excited with the architecture of the place as I found it confusing"

Millenium_Park,Malcolm R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,"Brilliant, but not easy to get in!!","This is definitely one where persistence pays off - you will be told that it is closed and there is no access - or you will be told you have to go to the tourist office - if you can find it - to get a permit - or that it is now only open on Wednesdays or whichever day you are not there!! This all seems a bit daft as entry is free and the guides inside are delighted to see visitors and tell them all about the family, the art, the design etc etc. If you say this is your third visit to try to see it, you have travelled especially from Delhi, you are going home tomorrow, your newly married wife will be soooo disappointed etc etc you may get in - whatever you do, keep smiling!! If you make it, you will not be disappointed - it is magnificent!!"

Millenium_Park,JaideepBatabyal,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Hopeless visit to Millenium Park,Have heard of this place since long. So planned to visit during Bengali New Year.It has rs. 10 entry ticket. However your dreams will crush once you enter. The place is not well lit. The place is untidy. The quality of crowd is below average. If you want to enjoy Ganges...this is surely not the right place. Took tea from snacks counter which taste like coffee. Fish fry costing Rs. 70 when thrown after a bite was not even picked up by street dog. So beware of having food. Overall very dissappointing visit. Will never recommend anyone to go to this park.

Also, there is the Mayurpankhi ferry for a one hour trip on the hoogly. It has live band performing on stage while you enjoy the sight. It runs on weekends at a interval of one hour.

The park is generally not very crowded and is perfect for evening strolls. Entry fee is Rs. 10 per head. Kids will love to be here to enjoy the rides available for them. You can grab a bite  at the eating joint inside the park. Ferry ride is also available  that takes daily commuters on the other side of the river and therefore those rides are usually jam-packed. An ideal place to spend your evening with your close ones.

All of us had a great time. This was the second cruise for me and much better than the previous one. We went for it only because the private one managed by Vivada was not available. Tickets are Rs 100/- per head. Free for Children below 3 yrs. There are normally 2 cruises on weekend of one hour each. The 1st one is at 6 and next at 7. Advisable to be there at least 20 minutes before departure. The boat seats about 100 on the upper deck. The seats are normal plastic chairs that most people arrange in whatever manner they want. I would recommend taking a seat in the last row to get the best views! The Live band was surprisingly good. Both the singers Male and Female belted out a good mix of old and new Bollywood songs with an odd Bengali song in between! The best part is the lovely view of the monsoon sky and the cityscape!"

The entry fee is nominal at just 10 bucks per person. There is a walkway along the riverside and a few benches to sit and spend some time.....but for the stench from the garbage strewn along the riven bank. The government should take some serious steps to clean-up the banks and prohibit further littering. The good part about this place is the one-hour long boat ride (Mayurpankhi Nao) at 100 INR per person. Well....personally I'd prefer a smaller boat with a more personalized experience sans the live band, but then again......something is better than nothing!"

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Rahul,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Very poor art work. Not worth it.,"This place charges 250/- entry fee per head which is absolutely not worth it. The wax staues are horrid and have no finess. BarringRabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt all the statues are ugly. Its actually a disgrace to the real larger than life personalities. The rest of the concept and the place is designed well. The only thing  we liked was the tatoo lighting studio which was a different experience. The view of the Eco Park from from terrace is wonderful.Please avoid this place and instead spend more time in the Eco Park which is absolutely beautiful."

But have a fine collection of historically important figures from Bengal, which is to be appreciated. The fare of 250 INR per head for an adult might seem to be high for most people. When you finish the journey within the museum, which consists of two floor levels, you'll end up upstairs right into the terrace where you could get a beautiful if not a slightly breathtaking view of the adjacent Eco Park and neighbouring areas.There are restaurants situated in the terrace/rooftop where you can get refreshments after the museum trip. One restaurant even has a collection of Bonsai exhibits in their front area."

Miles away from the standard museums of the kind globally.

It will be a wonderful experience for everyone who visits this museum , especially for children . History might bore you if you read a text book but it will be a completely different experience when you visit such a museum and get to see these historical artifacts in front of you.I used to visit this museum regularly during my childhood days. Even now I love visiting this place with my family. This place is used by art students and archeology students a lot. We can see a lot of such students doing there research here. We can see them sit in front of sculptures and trying to draw or recreate them to learn and showcase their talents. Foreign travellers who visit Kolkata come in large groups to this museum to learn more about the culture, tradition and history of India. I am sure it would have been a mesmerizing experience for them as well.There are a lot of things in this which will amaze visitors but I would like to highlight a few major attractions of this museum.We must have atleast half a day to walk , cover and explore everything that is present in this museum. I really love this place and I think everyone should come and visit this place to learn more about our ancestors."

It has been a very long time i was back to kolkata the place has totally been changed , It totally has a new makeover the smartcity kind. The place looks serene with the eco park on to your right and the wax museum is also right in front of it. One can have the view of eco park from the corridor of the wax museum.To get into the wax museum one must pay an amount of 250 Per head as entrance fee. I dint fist much expect it to be so good but some statues inside looks so real.The wax sculpture were of People from the bollywood, sports , musicians , scientist , hollywood , revolutionist and many more.

I suppose the flowers would be a matter of which season your visit is.If you are visiting ECO Park, there is a subway leading to the entrance of Wax museum which is very convenient.

If you have seen other wax museum abroad then you would be a little disappointed but it’s a good beginning. Inside you need to pay an entry fee of probably  Rs. 250 per head And you could visit the museum. There are so many models some are very lifelike but some are not that good . To name a few, Rabindranath Tagore, Gandhiji, Mother Teresa, Newton and many more. It is definitely worth a visit and when in Kolkta visit it.

Dressed in their original attire, these well-done statues provide a great photo opportunity. It is divided between two floors...5th and 6th floor...Entry fee is 250/- INR per person ( above 3 years). Road Side car parking available. But  this Mother Wax Museum is actually quite average, though they have two floors full os wax statues on various celebrities & personalities.

Many of the statues are from west bengal prominent personalities plus others too... one shud be able to spend about 45mins inside to go through all of them. the entry fee is 250/- indian rupee per person ( above 3 years).few statues were not very convincing but most of them were.Mr beans was amazing. apart from personalities statues, they slso have horror statue section inside itself. we all loved being clicked alongside them with a little bit of fear in our heart, very realistic they were. moving ahead one vill also enter into a room of virtual reality walls... its about ok room but children do enjoy it. if havent seen any Wax museum in life , then surely a must try. Its worth it. "

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,SquashAddict,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Good museum - worth a visit,"Some waxworks are better than others - but overall it was better than we expected. We read there's a Donald Trump figure - but there isn't (no big loss there). But plenty of famous international and Indian waxworks.......including Ghandi, Mother Teresa. Some cartoon/superheroes too. Professional photos and souvenirs available for extra (at the counter at the end of the tour). The girl at the desk wasn't very helpful or enthusiastic about getting business, but eventually she called the photographer and he came - we were pleased with the photos he took, and within minutes we had framed mementoes."

The entrance fee is 200 rupees per person and I went there along with a friend. Some of the wax statues looked real where as some were horrible. Sharukh Khan and Salman Khan statues were real bad. The museum was air conditioned and it was good to explore. There is a Souvenir shop and also a cafe on the 6 th floor.

The architecture of the museum was very impressive and meaningful. The moment you enter, you'll see black figures and when you exit, you'll realize the meaning. The museum had a lot of WOW factors. As you keep on moving forward, the best of best keeps unfolding. It was a ""Paisa Wasool"" museum. Truly Refreshing!"
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Harish R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Not Bad At All,"I went with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of displays. While some like Gandhi etc are exceptional, there are a few like Bruce Lee which are a  bit shoddy. However, what I liked was the thematic fusion of many of the exhibits, for example, Einstein and Bose with a scientific theme and backdrop. Quite liked Audrey Hepburn and Johny Depp as well as Bengali/Indian icons like Gurudev, Satyajit Ray and Mithunda as Disco Dancer. Lots of photo opps. Go with an open mind. Its a nice experience after all."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Shubhomoy Mukherjee,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Best option this side of Madam Tussaud's,"This is worth a half day visit at least. Spread over two floors and eventually expected to grow further, the museum starts out unexpectedly by recreating people from India's freedom struggle, Bengali leaders, visionaries like Rishi Aurobindo, artists and poets like Nazrul and Rabindranath. Then you go on to ex-President Pranab Mukherjee, and eventually moving onto movie celebrities from Uttam Kumar to Amitabh and Salman.It seems there is a bit of a struggle to reproduce Indian skin colours and faces.It is in the floor Hollywood celebrities from Jhonny Depp to Mr. Bean that they have achieved perfection. There is a room with a haunted theme too. There is a room with projected geometric shapes that children love to pose in.There is a small canteen and from the balcony one gets an amazing view of the Rajarhat eco park across the road.Definitely worth the travel to Rajarhat."

One can almost feel that they are breathing. On the whole I liked the place very much. Interesting rooms like the ghost room or the cut outs for taking selfie or the tattoo lights room will be found entertaining by the children.  There are several cartoon characters as well. May be they can have more information about the people portrayed there.

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,jinshui,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,"Gross, disgusting, unkept temple with greedy touts","We are not worshippers. We chose to visit this temple as it was highlighted as one of the places of interest in Kolkata. This review is from a tourist pt of view. This temple has to be the most gross and dirtiest one among all those we have visited in India.  There were a lot of touts surrounding the temple singling us out to offer us ""VIP"" line. First, we were told to remove our shoes and then they wanted 500rupees pp to skip the line.  i looked at the ground and shook my head. You have to walk bare foot for at least 30-40meters to the so called VIP entrance. The problem is not the distance. it is the ground. It was semi dried mud, with traces of broken glass, garbage, faeces, etc  I had trouble walking that with my shoes on let alone in my bare feet. Sewer water flowed alongside while on going construction nearby added to debris piling everywhere, We walked around and found the ""VIP entrance"" . Some Indian tourists ready to enter that door told me they paid 100rupees each and left their shoes ""around the corner"", as told by their tout.  Reluctant to remove my shoes to step on those filthy earth- mud ground, we continued to walk around the temple and found the main entrance of the temple. There, the real line stood. We stood in amazement at the throngs of people, standing in a rough line. Every one, except a few, were in bare feet, holding their spot nearly skin to skin to the person in front of them, facing the shut entrance gate, waiting for it to be opened. One couple near the front of the line told us they have been waiting for at least 2 hours. They encouraged us to go queue up and forget about the vip fees. Eventually, we found our way to the back and saw the end of the line. There were at least a few hundred people. So, we decided to turn back and pay the 100rp. The touts were waiting for us. Except this time, there was a lady who created a shoe station right at the Vip entry. So, now, we are just a few steps away from entering the temple. I didnt think it was too bad to tread over the dirty ground for just a bit. However, by then, since it was near 4pm, the reopening of the temple, the VIP entrance is now swamped with about 20 people, all pushing and shoving with plastic buckets of offering over their head, fighting to be the first to enter the temple. As the flood gate opened, these people began pushing harder and one lady nearly fell over. There was a young Indian couple who look like a newly-wed. The girl in a pretty indian sari must look like she was 14? We were caught in the middle of the group, being shoved around as it inched towards the steps. After stepping into the temple, i was flabbergasted because the grounds inside was WORSE than outside. It was wet and slippery. There was a manhole cover seemed barely closed, emitting disgusting smells. Walls were old and paint peeling off, tiles broken or chipped. The whole building looked like it has not been maintained and  looked sad and neglected. We continued to be moved by the crowds from one spot to another. Our tout tried to find a back way ""up"" the temple but were stopped. He then explained something in Hindi to a lady in uniform who gave us a special access up the stairs. Many others were yelling and gesticulating, wanting to get in faster. Up the narrow steps, we found ourselves in a small platform, there another mob scene with about 10-20 worshippers were yelling and fighting to gain access to the front of the deity, whom we think was behind a window. Below and behind us, we saw more people whom i imagined came in from the ""proper public line"". I feel bad for them because despite waiting for hours, it looked unlikely they  could ever get up to where we were. A very old and short lady stood next to us, in a corner to avoid being squashed by the mob. On the other side, a beggar stretched out his hands begging... Someone from across the room saw our wide eyes and used two hands to motion the international ""wait, calm down"" sign. TBH, my son and i were more amused than frightened as we witnessed the fervour and frantic behavior of the devotees.  After a while, our tout used his arms to create a free spot for us to stand at the front so we could see what was behind the window. We had like 5 seconds max before someone pushed us out. All i remember seeing was a fire pit with a 2 feet tall fire by my feet and i didnt want to be pushed over it and be set on fire. My son said he saw the deity with 3 eyes and multiple arms. Then, we were urshered out - same way we came in. that's when i realized we entered through the ""exit"".On our way out, our tout asked, ""happy?"". We shrugged and he put an orange  paint mark in the middle of our forehead. We were hoping to see architecture marvel but we received a first hand experience of a religious frenzy.  Given the disgusting surrounding, we would not recommend this visit to any tourists, including worshippers."

I had been to Kolkotta twice , but this is my last visit to this shaktipeeth. Pandas (priest) will surround you and loot your all money in the name of kali and her shringhaar ( make up of the id) , even when you say you are left with no money , they will keep an eye on your wallet , if you appear well off, they will target you. Your money will be exhausted , and they will not let you go , then the same money is distributed among the gang . I came out furious . Not at all peaceful place like dakhineshwar . Will never visit in any lifetime . Forget this life"

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Shambu K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,Horrifying experience,"I visited this place in 2021, and have to say this is the worst place on earth. They just rip you off the moment you arrive there. Next, I saw the main statue of the goddess there were cockroaches on it and the priests were rude and abusive. Everywhere we went we were harassed. There is a river at back but that is only a sewage now. Then we heard that everyday the so called goddess gets many sacrifices of animals. I lost faith in this cult of Goddess worship. I would say no one should go here !"
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Sanghamitra Das,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Sinful nature of people in charge of kalighat temple clearly showed that the temple no longer remain a religious place.,"Yesterday me and my sister visited kalighat temple at around 5:45 p.m. with intention to watch Mother's sondhya arati.  After having darshan of Mother from the veranda in front of her garvagriha we were waiting quietly in the veranda at one corner for the arati to begin without disturbing other darshanarthis. At around 6:30 p.m. without stating proper reason two ladies on duty tried to pull us out of the veranda but as they failed to do so another person told us that he will arrange for arati viewing for us and based on his words we get out of the veranda. Very soon we realized he actually played a trick to get us out of the veranda so that people whom the temple pandas and committee members approve can only see the arati from front. Even one lady who claimed kalighat temple to be their private property told that she will decide who will watch arati and who will not according to her wish. All this arrogance, playing tricks for self-interest  and speaking untruth, of people who are in charge of the temple clearly shows Kalighat temple at present does not meet the qualities  that a religious place should meet. Hence, I took resolution not to visit Kalighat temple any more in my life time."

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Rahul,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Commercialised temple,"I did not feel like I was visiting a temple. Walk towards it and you are immediately confronted by pandas (priests or brahmins) offering you special access at a premium, touts selling flowers and pooja materials and eunuchs. The place too is unclean and one does not feel the bliss usually associated with temples. You dont pay, you cant make it inside, that's the problem there. No administration or police to make sure devotees are untroubled. Seems like one complete business set up. I would not recommend going there unless you are either willing to be extremely thick skinned and shameless or willing to shell out money as and when asked."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,gpradeepshenoy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Solo,Visit only if you're a devotee,"This sakthipeeth is situated about 15 minutes walk from exit of Kalighat metro station (please check the correct exit gate number ).   I went to this temple on a Thursday evening and it was empty . Had darshan of Godess Kali easily and quickly . The area surrounding the temple is not kept clean . Many people who claim to be pandas (priest's)will approach you when you are near the temple promising quick and easy darshan, plz avoid them. One bad thing in this temple is everyone including main priest's of the temple are money oriented and almost everyone in the temple will ask for money which is very bad.   Mixed feelings after visiting this temple. Temple surroundings must be kept more clean and people inside temple including priests must be taught how to behave with other's."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Sushant S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Bad experience. WB Tourism turning a blind eye.,Very powerful temple but unfortunately had a bad experience here. I have roamed whole of India but have never seen a more badly managed and unsafe temple.Being from out of town we were cheated by the touts pretending to be priests. They even threatened that ill things would befall us if we didn't pay money to one of the touts. Near the deity a tout will threaten you again and not allow to leave till Rs 500 is paid (which would never go to the deity or temple). Despite numerous complaints it is surprising that West Bengal Tourism is taking no action.If from out of town please do not visit without a local to give you company.
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Amit P,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Family,"Chaos, mismanagement and looting in the name of Godess.","This is one of the most poorly managed temple in whole india. Chaos, mismanagement, rampant looting of the devotees at every possible corners are  most common findings here. No covid protocol is being maintained here so take care of your own health. This place should be visited only by the true devotees of godess kali and by those people who have good quarreling and fighting skills, other people should avoid this place at all cost as they will be looted by every possible crooks present there masquerading as priests or pandas. First when you reach there, agents of puja offering shops will approach you to buy offerings from them. They will not tell you prices of all the items, most of the charges are hidden, it is that when you come back and going to pay them then they will demand exorbitant amount from you. So either enquire about the exact amount before hand or avoid their trap in the first place. Then if you enter the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctoram then the main priest will again try to loot you by telling you some fake stories or some emotional quotes and will force you to donate hefty amount of money in the name of temple committee but truly speaking there is no such thing as temple fund as you won't get any receipt of your donation, the entire amount will eventually go to the pocket of the priests so be careful inside the sanctum also. Then there are numerous pickpockets present inside the temple complex, if you go early in the morning then it is fine but if you go there after 9 am or in the evening when there is tremendous rush, there is every possibility of your purse, mobile or money being snatched from your pocket by pickpockets. So you have to keep yourself safe from pandas, priests, shop agents, pickpockets, beggers - all these people. There is no queue management method as well, during peak times, 3-4 lines from different directions will converge at the gate of sanctum, and there will be paid VIPs who will jump the queues and enter straight into the sanctum, there will be total chaos and nobody will know exactly what is happening there. Inspite of all these difficulties, if some true devotee of maa kali wants to visit the place then it is advisable to visit early in the morning or at late evening otherwise 3-4 hrs will be wasted and money or mobile can get snatched away by thugs. I will not recommend this temple at all because the main purpose of visiting a temple is to get some mental peace ,to be free from worries but sadly those will not bee possible here and after getting looted by crooks or pickpockets, peace will disappear and mental agony will loom large on you."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Bhaskar_10,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Joi Maa Kali : Save us from the priests,"Darshan on 11th Feb 2021 at 6.15am - MorningEasily accessible by Bus, Metro, Auto, Rickshaw, Taxi or by walk. Taxi's and Auto drop off point is Kalighat Police Station which is 200mts from the temple so be prepared for the small walk especially if you have any elderly member with you.The temple opening time of 6am and early darshan is probably very convenient as less rush at this hour. Beware of the touts and priests who will definitely line up to entice you for grand darshan starting from INR 50/- onwards but this is a free facility so why pay. Also while buying flowers please buy the fresh lots as they are very affordable - a 54 floral garland will cost INR 10/- while 108 floral garland will cost INR 20/-. For Prasad you can stick to INR 21/- or  31/- . Follow the queue to the sanctum sanctorum where the Kali Maa Deity presides and pay your offerings and seek blessings. the priests will ask for INT 100/- onwards, just be deaf and walk away.Cleanliness and temple maintenance can be better but no complaints.Security / Shoe racks / queue facilities if better provided then it will help in more inflow of pilgrims.One of the Shakti Peeth this is very pious place for Hindus. Anyone visiting for the 1st time specially female tourist or pilgrims are advised to go to a shop and take prasad and keep your shoes there. Request them to send one of their employees to escort you to the temple and then out. You may pay them INR 50/- for this service but it will be helpful, this is my personal suggestion only.This place provides immense peace and divine feeling upon the darshan of Maa Kali.Joi Maa Kali"

I took a metro and it cost me 5 INR from MG road. I would highly recommend not to talk to the touts or shopkeepers about the temple. If you are planning to offer flowers it's highly advisable to get it enroute and not near the temple Please take some time to stand in the queue and have the darshan. You will not regret it The touts make their way in thanks to the administrators of the temple.They really mess up things and are behind only money I felt very calm inspite of all the commotion outside.Thanks to the Almighty
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Arun K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,HOLIEST  SHAKTI  PEETHAM,"Kalighat Temple, located in Kolkata is one of the 51 Shakti Sthals of India & is one of the most visited Kali temples in India. Located at the spot , where the toes of Sati's right foot fell during Shiva's Tandava dance. It is said that Kalighat was where Chowranga Giri, a Dasanami monk, worshipped Maa Kali with great austerity and has thus been known as a religious center of Maa Kali  for centuries. This 200-year-old temple embodies the principle that only divine knowledge can subsume sodomized ego, akin to an Asura. Situated on the banks of Adi Ganga, the temple has a sanctum sanctorum along with a huge hall in the name of Nat Mandir. In the north-east of this sanctum, there is a Shiva Temple. There is one more shrine dedicated to Radha Krishna. The main attraction of this temple lies in the image of Goddess Kali that bears a long protruded tongue made out of gold.Devotees throng this temple during festivals like Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Poila Boishakh, the Bengali New Year day and Sankranti to seek blessing of Maa Kali.Visited the temple with great devotion but disappointed to see the unfriendly & rude behavior of greedy priests near main deity, demanding money all the time .  The temple authorities should look in to the matter as such persons are spoiling reputation of such a holy peeth."

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Sea Dweller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Very beautiful temple,"Kalighat was a Ghat, sacred to Kali on the old course (Adi Ganga) of the Hooghly river (Bhāgirathi) in the city of Kolkata. The name Calcutta is said to have been derived from the word Kalighat. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga which connects to the Hooghly. The Adi Ganga was the original course of the river Hooghly. Hence the name Adi (original) Ganga.     The Kalighat temple in its present form is only about 200 years old, although it has been referred to in Mansar Bhasan composed in the 15th century, and in Kavi Kankan Chandi of the 17th century. The present structure of the temple was completed under the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family's patronage in 1809.

Right from the time you get out of ur car/ transport  they keep asking for money. Elders/ people with young kids are mishandled. Good management is need of the hour at this temple.

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Rupsha_Mumbai,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Avoidable trip,"Kalighat temple is a landmark temple in Kolkata, attracting hordes of devotees every day. There are shops/stalls on both sides of the approach road selling various knick knacks. The temple premises are crowded and the biggest issue are the pandas who will charge you arbitrary sums of money for entering the temple, offering pooja, their own fees and what not. It leaves you with a very bad feeling, so my suggestion is not to engage with them at all and just make an attempt to enter the temple on your own, though there is no guarantee you will be able to get through to the shrine of the deity for darshan. In any case, your devotion does not depend on what you pay to pandas, so dont feel bad if you cant actually see the idol because of unscrupulous people like them. We were practically left empty handed after paying up whatever cash we were carrying. I went with my father but the panda asked us to offer pooja separately so that he could rip us off separately, twice ! Then he had the nerve to ask us to go to the nearby ATM to get more cash to pay his fees. We didnt oblige obviously but nevertheless we felt totally cheated by the experience. This guy even kept asking us about what we do, where we are from, maybe because they adjust their ""rate cards"" according to what they think is our spending ability. It is probably best to avoid this place or else be very firm about not taking help from any pandas."

Not only that, it was disturbing to see how they man handled devotees (including women!!!) just because those devotees did not bribe them to deserve to just see the deity. Most devotees saw the Maata's deity from far and only those who flashed rupees were allowed to walk in. Moreover, there was a group of goons to scare people off and who occupied most of the temple space. I had to flash money at them (from far) and then was allowed to walk in to get closer to the deity and my family members who didn't flash money at them were not allowed the Darshan - What a shame! I have been asked for a review internationally and I am going to provide them the facts as-is. It is also interesting to note that their website does not have an option for review or ""contact"" so unless higher authorities are involved, these guys can operate under the radar and continue with this. It is also worth noting that the ""president"" of this temple is nominated as a District judge - this is what the country coming down to - sad and a shameful situation."

There are N number of cheats roaming around in this temple, fleecing tourists. Wonder what the administration is doing out there. We were 5 people of a family who did the mistake of going to this temple without groundwork.It was obvious that we were outsiders with our getups and our language. It started with one priest(cheat) who gave an offer of Rs 200 per head if we wanna just see the Kali statue OR Rs 350 per head if we want to touch the deity(As if he owns the deity!).Should have kicked his a** then and there itself,didn't do it and it was a big mistake.We opted for the first option & gave him 1000 Rs and went ahead with him.Inside the temple,everyone were heckling each other in the so called queue,temple priest was demanding money to be put in his pooja thali, screaming at the top of his voice near the deity. Somehow came out of it, then we were directed to go in front of another priest who started chanting sanskrit shlokas for me and my wife. He asked me to repeat those and demanded Rs 2100 to be put in his thali. Next my wife was asked to repeat some other shlokas and asked to put Rs 1500. After the shloka exercise,one coconut was given to be broken in front of so called deity which was shown to us in the wall and asked to deposit Rs 500. Everything happened in a matter of few minutes.At this moment i lost my cool,I directed my family members to come out of the temple and  demanded all my money back from these cheats ,threatening to call POLICE.The priest came and  asked me to take all the money from his lungi.For some reason,i took only 4K Rs back which i regret. On our way back ,the beggars were heckling us . I assume all of these people,starting from the first priest to the beggar are part of this fraud nexus operating in the temple.I recommend not to visit this temple or go with a local if you are a tourist and never ever show how much money you have in your purse."

We were there on a rainy weekend morning when the whole city was flooded but the Panda's are there waiting for a catch of the minute.It is harrowing and despite paying multiple currencies getting an eyeful of the deity is difficult. Beware of the junior Panda's who will forcefully tie or garland the holy thread and demand money. They look for kids for victims of such acts as adults usually shoo them away.Saturdays there is sacrifice of a goat and we happen to see a baby goat post the sacrifice soaked in its blood. It happens twice a week.Not to forget be careful with your wallets, cash, mobiles and valuables.In Short, for a Millisecond view of the Deity please be prepared for a LOT OF PENANCE.

We stood in a pavilion in front of the main shrine (which you could still go into) and couldn't see Kali Mata due to the crowds; the priest with us parted the crowd with a shout for 1 second and we caught barely a glimpse of Kali Mata, but the darshan was not satisfying at all. The pandas tried to rush us off, but we fought and made them show Kali Mata again, and we finally saw Her properly. The priest then tried to convince us that bags and mobiles were not allowed in the main darshan line (they are), and he said he could take care of them, an offer we were highly skeptical of, so we refused and left. The shop owner from the beginning tried charging us 1151 rupees for the offering basket he initially said cost 200 rupees, and we fought with him and left in a huff; as we turned onto the main road, one of the shop owner's friends came and talked to us and said ""oh, it's always like this here, that shop is one of the best,"" which solidified our negative experience; why was he trying to invalidate our feelings and experiences?Go to this temple only if you're prepared to ignore all the shop owners and pandas asking for money. Everything, including darshan, is free (except maybe a tip to the shoe keeper close to the entrance). Prepare yourself mentally before visiting Kalighat; it's a very draining environment and experience. Shops near the temple are good, though."

This priest had his arrangement with local stores where we put our shoes and washed our hands and feet. Then we went to the VIP line which was much shorter than the extremely long regular line. I always feel guilty going in the VIP lines. I feel like I'm cheating but I quietly did what I was told. The priest with me warned me that they will try to ""sell"" me extra blessing inside for couple of thousand Indian Rupees and not to fall for that. He was right and it was disappointing to see how such a beautiful divine place has become a business but then again its Kalyug. The VIP line took about an hour and I was in no rush. It have me more opportunity to be so close to Mata and focus on her. I think there is positive hidden in everything. Cannot wait to go again and quietly sit and take it all in. Jai Mata Di"

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Go581028,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Not for the faint-hearted,"Unlike most of the other reviewers, I visited the famous Kalighat temple as a tourist from the UK, with almost no knowledge of Hindu religious practice.I had been advised by a local person in Kolkata that the temple was to be avoided. Nevertheless I took the opportunity to visit with a local friend who was familiar with the temple. My trusted local guide was essential. Knowing about this temple's reputation and with no knowledge of Bengali or Hindi, I would never have attempted a visit on my own.Firstly, the temple entrance is not that obvious - it's quite a small structure set back from the street. We first visited a shop (there scores of such places) where we left our shoes, washed our hands and got flowers for our offerings. They said we could pay on our return and seemed quite honest - this particular shop was recommended by my friend.Then things started to get busy. The ground was dirty, we saw various shrines outside the main building. Saw a number of goats being prepared for sacrifice. I declined an invitation to go into the sacrificial area where the goats were being decapitated.Then, fighting off the offers of ""VIP treatment"" we joined the queue to enter the main shrine to see the goddess. The queue was quite fast moving. By the time we were entering the very narrow entrance to the shrine, there was a lot of  jostling and pushing. Inside was chaotic crowds with people having just a few seconds to lay their offering in front of Kali. I was very surprised by the statue itself - it was nothing like the usual portrayals of Kali I had seen in paintings.On the advice of my friend, I paid 151 Rupees for the offering (they asked for 501). Which seemed very reasonable.The area around the temple has many beggars and souvenir stalls. Be careful with your valuables when visiting the area. The ban on photography inside the temple is strictly enforced.Overall, a memorable, exhausting but unique experience. Made possible for me only with a local trusted companion."

However if you stay firm this temple is worth a visit. The whole complex is fascinating as is the image of Kali herself in the centre - make sure the pundit allows you to see it and don't be rushed past. The pundit will latch onto you immediately as you enter and will not go away so you've got him with you the whole time,  he will try and force the pace of your looking round so he can get onto the next visitor - resist and take your time. He will ask for a donation to the temple - that's reasonable as there's no entrance fee. He will later ask you to buy ""a bag of rice for the poor"" for 2000 rupees - that equates to about 40 kilos. just refuse. He will then say a prayer for you and ask for a ""personal donation"", again depends on how good a guide he's been. You need to keep friendly though, so be very polite, also you shoes will be unattended for a long time!Despite this, stay focussed on looking at the temple and the people - it's definitely worthwhile despite all the above!!!

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Sumit Kasera,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Painful experience at Kalighat,"Over the years and with many experiences across different religious places, I have developed great dislike for temple visits – especially because of generally unclean places, presence of crooks or beggars in most of such places, and mad rush for money – when the purpose is possibly the exact opposite. The visit to Kalighat was driven by the simple reason that it was one of the Shaktipeeth. While the Hindy Mythology has interesting background on origin of the Shakti Peetha, the most popular is based on the story of the death of the goddess Sati. Out of grief and sorrow, Shiva carried Sati's body, reminiscing about their moments as a couple, and roamed around the universe with it. Vishnu had cut her body into 52 body parts, using his Sudarshana Chakra, which fell on Earth to become sacred sites where all the people can pay homage to the Goddess. While Kolkata was my birth place, my visits to Kalighat was always one of detest due to the crowd and lack of cleanliness. After marriage, the only driving force was the pledge to show all Shakti peetha to my spouse (some of which were outside India) – hence the visit to Kalighat.We got very early in the morning and were at the temple around 5.30am. The place was quite dirty and unkempt. The car stopped at a distance and then we used narrow bylanes to reach the temple. There was no direction or signage to assist the tourist. The early dawn was yet to set in and the cleaning up of the streets was taking place. Small ramshackle shops were selling flowers and coconuts for worship. One of our relatives talked to some of the priests and we went straight inside the temple. So, while the queue for ordinary folks waited, we did our puja at leisure. After the puja (workship) was over, there was haggle of the money to be paid – small sums were exchanged and that was that. There was no feeling of devotion or worship. It was just push and shove, haggle for money, and dirt and filth all around.The first shakti peetha had been visited. But I wonder if for an ordinary tourist, was it worth a visit?"

It is regarded as one of the 51 Shakti Peethas of India where the various parts of Sati's body are said to have fallen in the course of Shiva's Rudra Tandava. Kalighat represents the site where the toes of the right foot of Sati fell. The present structure of the temple was completed under the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family's patronage in 1809. But in the texts of the 15th century, there is reference of this temple. The Hindus from throughout the world thronged to this place to have a ‘darshan’ of goddess Kali.

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,saminternetmarketing,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,"Very sacred temple of powerful Goddess Kali, but beware of Thugs.","The temple is very old and powerful. People from across India throng to the Kalighat temple to visit it. It is very famous but has been becoming infamous of late because of the open robbery by the pandas and thugs in Kalighat.There is a deep nexus between the pandas, the main priest, security guard and all touts approaching you. So, do not shell out a single rupee because if you do you will fall into a never ending trap.Let me explain how it works. Several pandas approach you right from the area where the main entrance of Kalighat starts. They will ask you just Rs. 101 to provide you a VIP entry into the temple even if there is no queue. They will take you through the entrance without following the queue. If there is a long queue, you may save some time, but if not its just the same. They will also ask you to buy some flowers and offerings etc. from some nearby shop. This is where it all starts.After you take the flowers and offerings inside the temple, and go near the Maa Kaali Pratima, there will be a priest standing their. He will chant some mantras and put the mala around your neck. And then his assistant will light a fire and let you take some blessings from the holy fire. He will put a tilak on your forehead and give you back your prasad/offerings. Until then it is all perfectly fine.Next what happens is really bad. The main panda extorts money out of you. He will ask for a very high amount. He will say that the rituals he just performed for you costs Rs. 1100 and his fees is Rs. 500 extra. If you do not pay the amount, they may man handle you, insult you and even abuse you. There was a couple ahead of us who was harassed and made to pay Rs. 1600. The man came with his child and baby. The priest started threatening him that he had done the pooja and now he had to pay otherwise something very bad will happen to him and his family. The poor guy gave up and paid after being harassed for around 5 minutes by the main panda and his assistants.Our driver told us that the pandas are thugs and hence we did not take their services. We went inside on our own. The queue was not long and so, it took around 10-15 minutes for us to enter the temple. We were near the pratima within half an hour. We did not have offerings so, we just joined our hands and prayed to maa. The priest put a tika on my forehead and demanded money. I wanted to donate Rs. 100 to the temple but since I know this money will go entirely to the priest who is probably making crores every month from the thousands of visitors visiting everyday, I decided to give just Rs. 10. He angrily asked for more money. When I said I will not give more, he just pushed me asked me to leave. Luckily I knew how to speak Bengali. So, I told him that none of my friends will give any money and the money I gave was for all. His assistant shouted as me saying that since I have given Rs. 10, I should engrave my name on the temple. he wanted to insult me.Then my friends went through the same situation. They did not know Bengali and were harassed by the priest. The priest told one of the ladies who did not give up to the bullying of the priest and refused to give any money - ""You have money to go to beauty parlor and watch Shahrukh Khan movie, but no money to give to temple!"". Another friend of who gave Rs. 10 was insulted by the priest as well. The priest told to him - ""You can spend lakhs to go to Bangkok and around the world but you cannot give a few hundred rupees in the temple!"".This was an absolutely shocking experience for my friends. So, I suggest everyone going to Kalighat temple to be prepared for such experience. You should be ready to argue with the pandas and refuse to give any money. If you want to give money for temple development, there should be other ways and you should always get a receipt."

The entrance is through a grand doorway on Zakaria Street. Once inside you are enveloped in the calm and serene atmosphere, a big contrast from the hustle and bustle outside.The place is interesting from an architectural point of view, as it is perhaps the only structure in this style still in good condition in Kolkata. Currently it is undergoing renovation, and one is hopeful that the outcome will be great. Since it is of recent vintage, only modern materials are needed and the work should be easy and can be finished quickly.The architectural details are fascinating, a testament to the workmanship of the artisans from Murshidabad. The interplay of light and shade amid the arches and lattice work is a visual delight. Another delight is watching the huge fish in the wuzu khana, where there are two large pools of water for the ritual ablutions before prayers.Speaking of prayers, it is essential that you avoid going there during prayer times, unless you want to pray there! The crowd of people is massive, as the mosque can accommodate 10,000 people, and for the Friday noon prayers it is packed to overflowing. The best time to go is early morning (up to 10am), when the whole market is empty and the morning sunlight gives a warm glow to the place. There are no restrictions on women or other religions as long as you dress appropriately for a place of worship."

If you are accompanied with any local authorised tour guide you will not be hackled for money, but if you are asked for money, tell the your local accompany to deal with it.A very nice place to be for a change and the walk around the surrounding is unique too. Lady traveler visiting alone might feel uncomfortable so its best to be accompanied by a male members. A great tourist spot in Kolkata with a big change."

One of my favourites Kolkata books is Chowringhee, so after walking through that area, I kept going to Dalhousie Square (aka BBD Bagh) in search of the 'Writers Building'. Dalhousie Square was named after one of the British Viceroys so there's a delicious irony that it's now renamed after three Bengali Freedom Fighters who killed the British Inspector General of Prisons. One generation's terrorist is another's hero and we see that happen all over the world.Name change or no, BBD Bagh is architecturally SO British that it almost makes you laugh. Like the Viceregal Lodge in Shimla or the High Court in Mumbai, it's deliciously Victorian Britain at its best or worst depending on your perspective.  Grand old buildings, many of them in need of repair, remind us of a time when Kolkata was the centre of the British Empire's influence in India and it's got an architectural grandeur that Delhi just didn't replicate when the capital moved there."

Otherwise the chaotic traffic and the street vendors will distract your attention and you will come back without experiencing much . Keep in mind if you have no interest in history or architecture then do not waste your time visiting the square . There is a lake in the middle of the square flanked by majestic buildings on all its sides . All of them must be around 150 to 200 years old . Some of the notable buildings to watch out for when you take the walk is Writers Building which covers the entire block ( don't forget to see the representation of science, commerce , agriculture etc beautifully personified at its roof ) Railway Headquarters at Fairlie Place, the GPO with its huge dome , the Royal insurance buildings , HSBC buildings  , the Post and Telegraph office and its quaint tower , Currency Building , St Andrews Kirk and its soaring steeple. A walk through Red Cross place is also interesting with its quaint buildings and leads straight to the Governors Palace . From there go to St Johns church and see the last supper painting painted by an European artist of some repute . This church also has the oldest cemetery of Colonial Calcutta . You can then talk a walk through Council House Street and return to Dalhousie square and appreciate the array of stupendous buildings on either side of the road . A walk to the other direction of Council House Street will lead you to the Calcutta Town Hall , the Council House and the phenomenal Calcutta High Court . A walk in Koilaghat street adjacent to GPO will also be an interesting one . You can see the really old Metcalfe Hall with its Corinthian Columns constructed many moons ago and then end the walk in Millennium Park off Strand Road which is a beautiful all length and no breadth park and enjoy the Calcutta waterfront .  The river is a sight to see with two Herculean bridges spanning the river on either side . Having travelled around the world I can say that anywhere if they had an area like this it would have been a major tourist attraction doing serious business . It's a shame that the upkeep of this once salubrious locality  is nothing short of a ""tamasha "" ensuring that once resplendent buildings and courtyards  represents a wreck.

BBD_Bagh,Rajesh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Couples,Office Para (area) of Kolkata,"Kolkata has always amazed me and will do so forever, for its contrasts and confusions. Sometimes, its hope gets lost in unemployment, poverty, the jungle of traffic jam and urban mess. The same hope gets rebirth in the thinking of young poet's imagination. Kolkata lives for yesterday and tomorrow. Today is over to take a right decision or to do a demonstration. The colloquial OFFICE PARA or British Dalhousie Square or more recently BBD Bag are different names given to the same place. It is as colorful and as contrasting as Kolkata itself. Come on any Sunday afternoon, and feel what the manorial buildings are speaking about? Is it Kolkata for today or Calcultta for the yesterday.I took the attached pictures in a weekday rainy afternoon on board a taxi."

The whole area is full of buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries. These are all government or private office buildings now so a proper tour of the interiors may not be possible though. The GPO, The Town Hall, The Governor's residence and the Eden Gardens are all nearby. Try to catch the reflections of the Writers Building (currently under renovation) on the pond called Lal Dighi.There is no metro stop in the area, get down at Esplanade and walk (about 10 minutes)."

However, the GPO and Writer's Building are some of the two buildings where you may still smell the rich tradition of Bengal from the great old days. Other than that, its just an office area, and trust me, there are much better office areas in other cities across the universe."

Bagh is nothing but a commercial and political center of all of East India where many of the business and political institutions from the colonial era still exist. The centerpiece is the Writer's Building which is the secretariat of the Government of the State of West Bengal and houses the office of the Chief Minister of West Bengal.  For company you have the magnificent GPO, the massive RBI, Headquarters of Eastern Railway and Calcutta Port Trust and plenty of other Government offices. As a backpacker tourist if you are visiting BBD Bagh get ready to be dwarfed when you are crossing these buildings.When I was a teenager and walked the pathways alongside these structures in BBD Bagh I used to feel proud of being a Calcutta. It gave me a sense of pride that Calcutta was once the capital of the British Era before they thought of shifting base to Delhi. Well Calcutta’s loss was Delhi’s gain. Look where the Capital has aspired to become while Calcutta still languishes in its past glory."

BBD_Bagh,Raymond W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Ringed By Interesting Buildings,"With precious little to celebrate in terms of modern Kolkata- the city is basically a dustry wreck, with magnificent buildings in various states of decay- the local administration have renamed the former Dalhousie Square BBD Bagh in honor of three wannabe assassins who failed to kill a British official here in the 1930s. This drum-beating nationalism is a common ploy in India, used as a way to try and distract attention away from the obvious failings of local administrations. No, there has not been much development or even maintenance in Kolkata for decades- but at least we have renamed the former British landmarks in honor of Indian personages!The main garden (bagh) is fenced off, which is one disappointment, but there are still a plethora of colonial buildings around the square. You can see the magnificent Writer's Building- an 18th century wonder which covers an entire block, a 19th century church, the General Post Office and much else besides. It could be a wonderfully nostalgic reminder of British India, but the traffic, cables and lack of maintenance somewhat detract from the experience, Still, colonial history fans will enjoy this very much."

This area has the same flavour of the Fort area or the D N Road area of Mumbai. A wallk around the tank will be worthwhile if you are fond of colonial buildings. You may start walking north wards from the very beautiful Esplanade Mansion at the corner opposite the majestic gate of the Raj Bhawan and head straight - right upto the Royal Insurance Building - General Post Office Building and the RBI building and take a right turn to walk all the the way along the brick red Writer's building till the St. Andrews Church, then take a right again to walk along the Mint Office and the Office of the WBTDC. One can always enjoy steaming hot cups of chai from the kullads (read: small earthen cups) in this area - a refreshing dose for your tired legs.. This area is close to all major bus stands and other attractions in Kolkata such as the Majestic State Bank of India Building and other buildings on the Strand Road, the Raj Bhawan and the buildings and emporiums on Chowringhee.

Academy_of_Fine_Arts,_mittal_cauvery18,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Awestruck,"It was simple art gallery that had mesmerizing paintings. Not a fancy decor. Few paintings were very child-like but others were really astonishing. The best painting I liked was ""Buddha+Krishna+Mahadev"" (pic posted). I wish the description was also written so that its easy to know what an artist has depicted. Though artists always leave a scope to predict for viewers but a brief description would have been better to appreciate the beautiful piece of art because painting is just not about the colors but also the thought behind it. Art Gallery is a beautiful place to dust down the tiresome day and freshen up. (pics of the paintings I liked the most are attached)"

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,ChakWalk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Highly recommend for shopping ,"I have been here multiple times since 1996. The place has a wide variety of shops and a few places to grab a small bite, and coffee or tea.The best aspect of this place is the shops carry sizes for tall women. And there are tailors on site that alter garments adequately and affordably.Watch the sizes, there is poor quality control so either try on the garment, take a measuring tape or a garment that fits so you can be sure of the size.I take a 44 in salwar pants and have found a pair every trip.Seams usually aren't serged so I will run a serging or zigzag stitch along the seams after I bring them home.Great place for handloom saris.Bathrooms fair. It was a little disturbing to see the window was not completely shielded. See photos. No soap for handwashing so bring some wipes or sanitizer.I could spend hours here. To do serious shopping, allow at least 3 hours."

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Deepak DB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,State Govt Handloom/Handicraft Shops,"I had been to this shopping paradise a few years ago and had picked some exclusive art from the West Bengal Govt Handicraft Board shop Manjusha. I had a hard time recalling the name of this mall and finally got locals help to get there. Though Manjusha was no longer there all other state handloom and handicraft stores are still there. You really need to dig deep to get the good genuine stuff as now a days most of the shops have similar stuff whereas I usually seek to get the local flavor of the state. The prices in all the stores are fixed and almost all accept Master and Visa, not sure of Amex. The discounts too are all documented which makes it a good bet to buy from them rather than other stores which are open to negotiation. You could negotiate here too if you buying high cost or bulk, thought the discounts won't be too high as they are governed and audited stores.There is a private West Bengal art store Biswa Bangla which has some exclusive collection of art and traditional wear which was simply beautiful. The prices are bit higher but the collection is different and looks good quality.There are shops of local sellers too besides state emporium. Some eateries and good seating area for those who cannot manage all the standing and walking.There are washrooms there which are very average in terms of cleanliness."

During those days money didn't come by so easily and so going to Dakshinapan was indeed a grand affair. The place still has a life and a charm of its own. Colourful shops, displaying their wares (mostly privately owned now),starting from clothes,bed and bath linen, handicrafts, cane and wooden furniture, carpets, eateries and what not.Its a kind of open complex..the individual shops are air-conditioned but the whole area is not under a single roof .It's a must visit."

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Ankur G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,An old school shopping complex of Kolkata,"This mall is elder to the others mentioned on the list and is a favourite meeting point for many Kolkatans. Its easier to reach for people from both the southern suburbs like New Garia/Sonarpur as the railways connect these places and also for people from Ballygunge to further in central Kolkata due to easy availability of public transport. Ths place is also a cultural venue due to the availability of Madhusudhan Mancha within the complex area which stages plays and music programs and even films. You won't find lifestyle brands but would get a taste of Indian handmade garments, room decorators and other utilities. It's an old-school shopping arena wherein the shopkeeper would directly interact and hand over products to check."

It is located in south Kolkata just near the Dhakuria flyover. Primarily caters to the middle class shopping but now it becomes expensive day by day, but quality wise the products are satisfactory. Various kinds of fashionable garment stores are there. Bargaining is a common practice. A couple of well decorated cafeterias are also present. . Great selection of indian clothing, kids wear, cosmetics, western wear, handicrafts, shoes etc. are available. This place is used to be a great happing place but nowadys lost its old charm. The whole area needs a good clean and  new paint. Professionalism is much more needed here. But which I like here which is a welcome change from the Brands and Mall type of shopping culture. Those who think it's a shopping mall, I must tell it's an unairconditioned big shopping complex, gathering so many individuals shops. Basically it's a  Indian wearing and accessories based shopping complex. Nice varieties of sarees, salwars are available..Bishwa Bangla is a good addition( but overpriced). Lots of shops selling local and state products.. Good atmosphere to hangout even if you are not there for serious shopping. Lots of government stores, expensive stuff. But you will still have choices and prices from smaller shops. Fare ranges from handicrafts to clothing.Various state emporium and private shops are present here.

We found the lay out a challenge to find what we were looking for and there we other shops in addition to the state emporiums which was a bit confusing. I recommend the state emporiums ( you are unable to visit the majority of India) as the opportunity to see the richness and variety of Indian art and craft though so please do visit.

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Dhiraj H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,The essential destination for your souvenir purchases in Kolkata ,This shopping complex in South Kolkata has been our eternal favourite for all our shopping needs for souvenirs. The market is open till 8 PM daily except Sunday on which it is closed. Parking is limited and there is always a queue to park your cars. If you are driving and have a companion it makes sense for your parter to go in and start shopping while you find a parking space. The complex is spread over two floors. When you enter you see the new Biswa Banga outlets including one for the famous Bengal muslin. These outlets are the brain child of the current chief minister. Further on you have the celebrated Dolly's tea house. There are a number of shops selling Khadi tops at the entrance. The Kerala handicraft shop at the ground floor is decent. In the first floor our favourites are Purbashree the Assam handicraft outlets and the outlet selling Kashmiri handicrafts. The complex is rather untidy and stinks in some places specially the first floor.This complex is maintained well can be such a top class shopping destination in Kolkata. Where else can you get get handicraft and clothes from so many parts of India?

It has lot of open space  and also houses Madhusudan manch where different cultural activities like plays etc are held.

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Situatedness,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Solo,Big selection of shops from different Indian states,"Several Indian cities including Delhi have similar setups, where state run emporia sell typical clothes and craft products from their different states.  Calcutta's is quite central,  comprehensive  but compact,  and easy to access.  The model is a bit tired,  but it is a good place to get fixed price goods,  and there are some very high quality items along with a fair bit of tat. Don't miss Dolly's tea shop in the centre, which is truly a classic Anglo-Indian institution... "

I continue to like it."

Essentially a ladies shopping delight, one would find a wide variety of authentic Indian cotton and silk saris. Also there are polyester/ chiffon/ etc. saris along with salwar kameez sets. Wooden and metal figurines and animals are available at reasonable prices. One has to wait for the period when the discount starts.There are quite a few restaurants to refresh oneself after a tiring shopping bout. And there are open air joints also if that is what one seeks.And lastly - the prices are extremely reasonable."

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Sachin K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Nation's own Factory Outlet,"I call it India's own factory outlet. Reason being under one roof, one gets to see the handicrafts and art of all the states in India. Most amazing part of it is the kind of bargain on things which I really missed in Mumbai. Evenings are the best time to be at this place. Apart from shopping, right at the gate, there are kiosks waiting to treat you with amazing 'Puchka' (known as 'paani poori' in Mumbai and 'gol gappe' in Delhi) and 'Aloor Dum'(potatoes cooked in oil with a thick yet not overwhelming amount of gravy made of cumin, ginger, onion and other spices). Overall, a decent, simple and a must visit spot in South Kolkata."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Nightshade00,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,Interesting variety of Indian handicrafts,"Not the easiest to locate by taxi, but well worth the effort. This is an open-air complex, and most shops are not air-conditioned, so it can get pretty hot and sweaty while shopping. Great place to view and purchase interesting and reasonably priced handicrafts from all over India. One of the store managers explained to us that the sale proceeds go back to the villages in which the handicrafts are made.Dolly's is a nice place for some iced tea when you need a break from all the shopping."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Mario1547,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Excellent hassle free shopping,Forget about New Market. This shopping complex is lined with state emporiums from all over India. Most prices are fixed and you don't have to struggle with touts and high commissions. Prices are reasonable. Bring cash as most stores only take cash and there is no ATM in the complex. 
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Journey to the heart of the earth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,Proper Kolkatan shopping,"I had not been to Dakshinapan for years and then popped in for a delightful afternoon last October whilst visiting family.The big malls are no competition in my eyes for traditional places like this. Reasonably priced, colourful, traditional styles- a feast of Indian shopping. They have fixed prices, so no haggling nowadays but that makes for relaxed shopping. There are state emporiums from all over India so this is like a mini India tour under one roof.I especially loved the printed cottons and handlooms. Elegant, colourful and very wearable. The colours are holding fast till now.My only regret was going on a public holiday when many shops were closed. I intend to make up for that this year!"

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Avatima,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,The original market complex with a lot of free space,"Long before supermarkets and malls came up in this part of the country, this shopping complex was set up in what was then a bus garage. The shopping complex currently houses emporiums of many state handloom and craft organisations and offer outstanding choices of sarees and curios across shops. It also has a few decent eateries, shoe showrooms and regular wear shops in the ground floor. The biggest attraction for the local youth is the free space to roam, chat and spend time in the open air of the complex.Though there is a reasonable space for parking, the entry and exit of the parking can be improved."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,RudraPalash,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,Indian handicrafts and handlooms at its finest!,"This is one place where you get products from almost all states in India. It is a two storied-complex housing Govt emporiums representing each state in India. You get handicrafts, decoration pieces as well as saris and other outfits. I have always found good choices for gifts from these emporiums. Emporiums such as Lepakshi and Mriganayani are  outstanding for brass handicrafts and so are some of the other emporiums. Kashmir emporium dazzles you with wood handicrafts. Uttar Pradesh stores used to have a fine collection of brass items but unfortunately they have discontinued the brass items. Prices may be a little on the higher side but you are spoilt for choices. A lot of these emporiums also carry household items such as bedcovers, rugs, brass lamps and shades, fancy jewellery, paintings as well as silks and handloom items from that state. Dakshinapan has a lot Khadi stores, shoe stores and 'Silence' which sells items made by differently abled people. Recently, Bengal's emporium 'Manjusha' has been remodelled to Biswa Bangla store which houses Bengal items but they are very expensive. It has regular stalls for clothing which are usually less pricey. Emporiums are fixed price shops but sometimes they run discounts. What Dakshinapan lacks, after a tired day of shopping, is a decent, hygenic food court. You can get tea from various states of India at Dolly's as well as have a quick bite there. There are rows of tailors available to quickly alter your kameez, skirts etc. which you just purchased. Unfortunately, Dakshinapan does not have lifts and you will have to climb up the stairs making the second story unavailable for wheel chair bound elders."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,haimanti p,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Reasonable price,"Very good shopping experience in reasonable rate. On a very crowded day one can shop happily because the place is big enough to accommodate a lot of people. Many of the shops are government handloom shops and therefore they sale goods at a reasonable rate. This complex has many shops and a big collection of saris, cloth materials, readymade wear for both men and women, handicrafts and other household items with a great variety. I suggest tourists to have a hastle free shopping experience here "

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Dipeeta D Mukherjee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Solo,Good place to hang out and little bit of shopping,"When it started years back, shops in Dakshinapan offered varieties with reasonable pricing. However, with passage of time, it has become a hanging out place for sections of the community, and the shops therein charge little bit extra than the Gariahat market, which is so close (two bus-stops away). If I want to purchase fancy items, I'd rather go to South City, which is nearby too. "
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,rashmib53,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Under one roof,"Dakshinapan shopping complex is a sprawling places having showrooms of all the states where one can buy authentic products at fixed prices. Besides the showrooms it has numerous shops selling readymade garments at reasonable rates, many khadi outlets, Khadim showroom, and Silence, the store where things made by differently-abled persons who are trained at their center are sold thus making them self sufficient. There are vast open terraces for kids to play, eating joint etc. Tea at Dolly's rounds everything off perfectly!"
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,wjtourism,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Couples,Excellent experience for a good cause,"We went to the Dakshinapan market in Kolkata where a number of state governments provide opportunities to purchase handicrafts and weaving. Noteworthy was the Silence store which is managed by and for people with disadvantages. A new operation called Biswa Banola which is an initiative of the government of West Bengal is fantastic. Very much worth a visit. Beautiful products, knowledgeable staff and great presentation."

And there are shops representing different parts of India. For example, Assam emporium has wonderful varieties of traditional muga silk sarees (the cost is high but that is quite justifiable; it's exceptionally genuine.) Here, there is everything for everyone in your family. A must visit place for foreigners looking for unique Indian dresses/jewelry/artwork at very reasonable rates. I got a beautiful rajasthan styled plazo for Rs 300. Quite amazing.There is a parking lot too. So, you can literally shop till you drop!"
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,SJasmineG,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Business,Best place to shop for authentic Indian Artisan souvenirs,"As a regular traveler to Kolkata, this is my favourite place for shopping. Shops are government run and each state of India is represented. Its a great place to purchase authentic, quality artisan crafts, gifts, textiles etc.  It's an open air complex. The architecture is somewhat grim but don't let that put you off going there. If you want to buy some really nice Indian items, this is definitely the place to go. The prices are fixed so there is no haggling, or at least, not much. There are restaurants here so you can eat and shop as well.By now, I've probably purchased gifts from most of the shops here, my favourites being the Rajasthan, Kashmir and West Bengal shops. But they are all wonderful and prices are reasonable. In addition, there are numerous shops selling just Indian clothes and shoes.  I really want to give a shout out to a small souvenir shop called Silence. This is a store that sells a wonderful array of gifts, the proceeds of which go to help the blind and disabled craftsmen. Definitely check that place out."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Jean G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Family,India in microcosm,"This shopping centre features crafts from around India - each of the states (or certainly, many of them) is represented here with eg a Kashmir shop, etc etc..  If you want the chance to stock up on gifts to take home, this is a good 'one stop' place to do it, though the centre is a little difficult to find.  We had to work quite hard to convince our driver that this was where we wanted to go, rather than to the modern centre which features Armani and Louis Vuitton!"
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,ashmdsKualaLumpur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Couples,Good for variety,the most unique part of the shopping complex is that we saw shops representing various states of india. The idea is great and most of the shops are selling traditional clothes and antiques pieces. A lot of variety to chose from these shops. We purchased lot of bedding stuff from maharashtra shop and few clothes from west bengal shop. Only disadvantage is that one cannot expect a air-conditioned mall types shopping. otherwise the place is very good and there are few eateries to fill the stomach.
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,TariqTabib,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Best Shopping Complex,"Dakshinapan Shopping Complex, an open air shopping center which has got two floors with a beautiful courtyard in the center is little out of the way, but it's an excellent place to buy traditional Indian artifacts. You will find many Indian state-run emporiums here, stocked with fixed price goods from all over India which sells mostly hand-loom and handicraft products. Apart from these there are also many privately owned shops which sell foot wear, ethnic dresses as well as dress.The prices are also reasonably very cheap. There’s plenty of tack but many shops offer excellent-value souvenirs, crafts and fabrics.Dakshinapan remains open from Monday to Saturday from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm. Remember, you must take time to visit this shopping complex."

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,ManaseeSoman,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,IDEAL FOR VERY INDIAN PRODUCTS...,"Dakshinapan shopping complex is located at the southern end of Dhakuria overbridge..It has state emporiums of the home state i.e. west bengal and many other indian states - odisha, andra pradesh, punjab, uttar pradesh, tamil nadu, rajasthan, gujarat, kashmir, madhya pradesh and state emporiums of north eastern states. its a good place to shop for bengali cotton sarees (basak, adi tangial, handloom house and tantuja) as well as for silk sarees (resham shilpi and others). exclusive madhubani sarees can be bought from central government's handloom house and exclusive munga, pati and mekhala sarees can be bought from the assam and purbanchal state emporiums. The Madhya Pradesh State Emporium (Mriganayanee) has sarees and dress materials (but they are expensive) along with furniture, a wide range of furnishings, lovely notepads and folders, including lovely colourful cotton carpets, bell metal art, kurtas and other knick knacks..The AP state emporium (Lepakshi) sells sarees, dress materials, jewellery and other knick knacks...Visit Lepakshi for exclusive ikkat bedsheets... They are expensive but worth the price. Cane furniture is sold in many shops but the best is in the WB state emporium and in the emporiums of the north eastern states. The WB state emporium also sells the traditional bengal artifacts like pata chitras, handicrafts made from shells, bell metal and exclusive stone cravings. There are also two good shops not belonging to any particular state emporium, but belonging to the artists syndicate.. One is Aranya (on the 1st floor - close to the kashmir emporium) and the another is karigar lane (also on the 1st floor - near lepakshi) Both these shops sell small items like ethnic jewellery, lamp shades and other knick knacks made from cotton and papers. The Kashmir emporium is full of quality products but the range is high.  The is also one shop named SILENCE on the ground floor which sells items like jewellery, candles, lampshades, etc which are made by the physically challenged persons.There is no good restaurant in this shopping complex. BUT DOLLY's TEA SHOP can certainly quench the thirst of thirsty shoppers with its exclusive iced teas and snacks. Its on the ground floor - opposite the gujrat emporium (Gurjari) - just in case, you miss it, because the place doesnt look like a tea shop n the first place.  Reach Dakshinapan by 11 am and you will be happily busy till 4 pm... The shops in this shopping complex work only till 4 m on saturdays, so bear that in mind. Dakshinapan Complex is a good place for shoppers from outside Kolkata - who want maximum variety in less time. All the items in this complex - right from furniture to trinkets - are soaked in the local Indian flavour. This complex has no shops selling branded stuff."

Built by the then Lord Octerlonee of the Colonial era in the 19th Century to commemorate his famous war victory and a tribute to the martyrs , the white giant stands tall and handsome with the effervescent white shade , compelling one and all the passerby to stand and stare at this towering structure. Well connected to all the nooks and crannies of the near and far,the monument is one of the most eminent and oft- visited go-to landmarks of our very own ,The City of Joy and barely 90 minutes drive away from the NSC Bose Airport. The Minar gets transformed into a altogether surreal avatar when bejewelled by it’s adoring psychedelic neon lights at night. A truely out-of-this-world birds- eye view of the whole Kolkata can be obtained if you manage to huff and puff your way through the serpentine interior to the pinnacle of this gigantic monument, called the Shaheed Minar."

Shaheed_Minar,Sheel,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Best visited early in the morning,"In ANY other city on earth, something like the Ochterlony Monument would be treated as a national treasure. In Calcutta, it's treated as an open air urinal.The Ochterlony Monument (as the Shahid Minar was originally known) stands tall amid the environmental wasteland that is the Esplanade Bus Stand. Bus drivers and passengers litter and urinate freely without fear of censure. You have to be really careful where you walk and it is advisable to visit as early in the morning as possible, unless you REALLY enjoy inhaling toxic bus exhaust fumes. The delightful addition of drunks and drug addicts lolling around at the base of the monument after dark mean you are either very brave or stupid, or both, to try visiting this at night, which is a pity really because it looks even better when its lit up.Instead of attempting to recreate ersatz Big Bens and faux Calcutta/London eyes, the city would do better to protect and project its rich cultural heritage.

Acropolis_Mall,Rajamukherjee1973,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Movies and food option make this place great,"Acropolis Mall located in South Kolkata Kasba connector , is an upbeat mall which has been designed with exuberance but lack planning and commercial management. Other than the Food Court and the cinema ,there is less value proposition in this mall.Food Court has all the major food brands, licensed franchisee , however , do not offer taste and quality as per International standards. The cinema enclave is pretty costly and upbeat but has true comfort and ambience. Whether it delivers value for you is a question that you need to answer by visiting."

Acropolis_Mall,dmanac,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Average,"Well designed floors and food court. Feels a little lack of variety. Best store is the one for extra large XXXXX. Good experience for kids of 6-14 years.There is lack of imagination and innovative approach. I hope most of the frequent mall visitors would agree to the observations and comments.Double layer parking is innovative but not under use due to very few cars and exorbitant charge. If you exceed even a minute after an hour, you end up paying for 2 hours!!"

When all these three factors fall in right places, then a mall can't go wrong! If you want to spend quality time while being in South Kolkata or somewhere near the Bypass, then this is the place to be! It may not match the grandeur of South City mall or the premium value of Quest Mall, but it will definitely leave you impressed,specially when you want to visit a good place to do shopping or just for hanging out with friends, without negotiating too much traffic (as in case of the other two malls as mentioned above).."

Acropolis_Mall,KRISHNENDU B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Extremely Poor Multiplex,I went with my parents to see one of the movies in its Cinepolis ie multiples. My parents had high blood pressure & a little breathing problems. But after requesting to almost 7 staffs they denied to switch on the air conditioner. As it was an evening show and it was the month of January. They told that they do not switch on their air conditioner or exhaust fan. My father became so sick that we need to leave the movie on half. I cannot understand why they are cutting down their cost so much for the people who are spending a lot for their best seats. This is like murdering people & will never suggest anyone to go their specially during their night or evening shift. If anyone read this please share for this severe inhumanity.

Royal_Calcutta_Turf_Club,tumbleweedchris,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Trashy Turf Club,"After skating by under interstate slums and past beggars, you enter the public area of the local Turf Club. This place is by no means royal or even passable as what most people would consider a nice horse track. There are signs for people not to urinate off the stands into local residential areas, patrons spit, patrons chug 8 oz cups of Coke as if they were beer, and litter is everywhere. The track is by no means a typical race grounds and is a poorly maintained racing surface. There is a pit of bookies making odds and taking bets, all while operating out of briefcases full of cash and recording everything by pencil and paper. This place is truly a one of a kind sight, even if it's not a very pretty one. Therefore, I'm ranking it as a 4 for novelty and curiosity, even though the facilities are a 1 by any other standard. It is also worth noting that it might make women tourists uncomfortable as there likely isn't 10 women in the place at any given time. They also take cell phones at the entrance, but I would just tell people you don't have one because I would not trust any valuables left anywhere here."

Better still, concentrating on the faces of the crowd can provide you the glimpse of both worlds. Haves and havenots. While one is jumping with joy having found his choice has brought home the bacon, for the loser the world is lost. Without losing time both the groups quickly get engaged to find the next winner. True you can hardly see more attentive students anywhere these days. And a postgraduate can be found as keen as a school dropout to locate a winner. But be careful there is a saying that no one wins in racing except the authorities who get the tax revenue that is irrespective of the results. As long you can afford it as fun and don't gamble to earn a livelihood, it can remain as a fine pastime and a thrilling day out . Happy wagering and good luck!"

In summers they start around 2 pm and in winters around 12.30/1 p.m. and the last race is usually 4.30 /5 p.m.  There are two stands.  One for the general public at a cheaper entrance and the other is the members stand where entrance is higher and there is a dress code.The buildings are very much of the Raj era.  They have a very big paddock in which the horses parade before going out for the race.  All the tote boards are very legible and there are totalisers on the gound as well as the first floor of the building.  Betting here is relatively simple compared to other countries - just pay your bet and get a ticket with your bet printed on it.Bets can be as low as Rs.10/-.  There is plenty of seating.  Members can pay for a box to sit in for the season to watch the races.From the stands there is a beautiful view of the Kolkata skyline with the Victoria memorial in front and all the first skyscrapers of Kolkata too!  Of course, the excitement builds up when the horses are put into the gates and if your horse wins you are in seventh heaven.  All in all a great way to spend a lazy afternoon"
Royal_Calcutta_Turf_Club,forestloverNagpur,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,My First and only visit,"The Royal Clacutta Turf Club gave me a very nice invitation as a Special Invitee(along with spouse) for its Monsoon Derby race day in October 2012.I took my own car rather than the one I was using officially and this thing made me move along the diversion route for normal traffic and hence what should have taken me five minutes took lot more time and by the time I could reach the entrance gate after parking my vehicle the races had already started and all the persons whom i expected to meet before the start of the races had moved inside.I could not contact them any more as the mobiles are not allowed inside and if you carry them then they have to be deposited at the entrance gate and token taken from the club staff at the counters.I did that and moved inside admiring the old British style buildings of the club and the race course.I could see a large number of members and visitors inside and of course the horses strutting around with their numbers and jockeys,trainers and owners  before going for the races.There were stalls for eatables.There were many screens from which we could see the odds,the horses,the race and the winnings.There were boards showing the choices for different races by the various newspapers.We went up to the members enclosure and saw the race in progress.From there we looked around at the Kolkata skyline the maidan,the Victoria Memorial and the high rise buildings on the Esplanade and Chowringhee and the new bridge nearby.After that we studied the race books and guessed about the winners.I did get my choices for the horses in the first three sometimes.We enjoyed the thrill of the horse races and I remembered that I had a great love of horses right from childhood as my maternal grandfather had a number of  horses and during visits to his place I used to get a horse for my daily ride.The Monsoon Derby race was won by a horse I had thought would win.When  I went down I was surprised to find that the owner appered to be someone I had played golf with once at the Tollygunge club but I was confused whether actually he was the same person or some one else and in the confusion forgot to congratulate him.In all, the horse races at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club were enjoyable.As I was on the way out from Kolkata being close to retirement it was really a royal experience which I will remember."

Very rarely would you see miles of open green in the very heart of any city as the Calcutta Maidan. The Royal Calcutta Turf Club is at the south western corner of Kolkata and bang apposite the Maidan (or open green area).Races are held on weekends mostly but if you like to bet in style, go there in December - January months, when the Invitation Cup races take place and the weather is very pleasant.

The open air audi inside is very good for professional cultural performances. The shops inside I found to be too expensive compared to Eco Park Biswa Bangla Haat.

Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Sachin0408,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Nothing Great About it.,"Swabhumi - The Heritage Plaza: The site is synonymous as well as famous for the various auditions that are conducted here for the Indian Television Reality Shows. You can see a swarm of people / contestants queuing outside the so called Heritage Plaza many times a year. After all the TRP’s are huge ways to attract viewers to the idiot box. So every time they come to hunt for talent for Indian Idol, India’s Got Talent, Dance India Dance or the likes ‘Swabhumi’ is their ideal choice. Its sprawling campus and open space gives them all the space they need to conduct the audition.The structure is not more than a decade and a half old. I remember frequenting this place before I left Calcutta in 2005 along-with friends to catch a movie in the nearby multiplex Inox.  People and the websites might boast of its structural elegance and the handicraft shops inside; or for that matter the food stalls but trust me there is nothing worth spending your hard earned rupee, dollar or pound here. You are sure to find better and original stuff outside if you have a perfect guide to take you around or if you do your homework well."

I had find some other alternative. This place is just next door. Good place to sit in peace while u wait for your show at just Rs. 15. I was there at evening and it had practically no shop open. Given its huge size, with some accurate background music it would feel nothing less than a ghost house. Don't get me wrong when I am saying ghost house, place has excellent infrastructure and very well lit. It's kind of infrastructure you come across when you're visiting a five star hotel. By the way Hayatt is just across the road. Given that all shops closed and very less activity of ideal people here. It becomes a perfect place for love birds. So if you are bored of sitting on grass in gardens then sitting on bench and marbels can be a welcome change. "

I was surprised at the large number of foreign volunteers that were gathered at Mother House before my group took a local bus here together. They come from all over the world and some of them have been here for months. I spoke to a chinese guy who quit his job just to come India and volunteer for 3 months.. and he’s not even a catholic! A worthy testimony of how Mother Teresa’s universal love have come to influence people all around the globe.The nuns I spoke to were all kind and gentle people. Personally, I felt that the organization of work duties had room for improvement, but the initiative to open up volunteering stints for as short a duration as a few hours is brilliant. It gives people like me a chance to help out physically as well as be uplifted mentally. Believe it or not, this giving experience definitely go both ways!"

I was lucky to witness the singing and the sermons, within the few minutes that I was there for, due to my big checklist and limited time in the city.Seeing Mother Teresa's room oddly gave me nervous goosebumps. All the people of the place seemed so full of faith and reverence it was almost overwhelming. Met people from at least seven different countries from Europe, Northern Asia and Africa all there to try and absorb the history of the place.There was a lady outside, in large spectacles, who spoke pleasant English, and asked money for her ""handicapped son"". I almost believed her until her friend spoke in Bengali, tauntingly with a contradictory tone to what she said. She said ""the girl doesn't look as stupid as she is"". They didn't know I could understand Bengali.I'm a medical student in Bangladesh since Jan 2016. I understand well enough.I just quietly walked away as they shouted after me."

Nehru_Children_s_Museum,Avishek Banerjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Remembering old times,"Recently been to Nehru Children's Museum after 2 decades. Earlier my grandfather used to take me there when i came to Kolkata on vacation. Now was my 2.5 yr old son's first trip to the doll museum. The place has not changed a lot, but in general sense requires better upkeep and maybe govt initiative. It is run by an NGO , National Cultural Mission.The museum is a five storied building on JL Nehru Road, close to Rabindra Sadan Metro Station. Out of five, three are museum and other two houses other activities related to children like painting, dance classes ans other simular workshops. Other notable sites around are Birla Planetarium, St. Pauls Cathedral, Nandan, Academy of Fine Arts.The place is a dream land for a kid because it is stuffed with dolls and toys. Left wing gallery and the landing on all three floors are lined with showcases filled with toys and dolls. There are dolls from various states of India as well as various countries. Some are aquired and some are donated. It gives the child a glimpse of the world. Right wing gallery on second and third floor houses even better exhibit. Second flood displays the story of Mahabharat and third floor displays the story of Ramayana through tiny but detailed models depicting various scenes from the epics. The lighting and 3D effect of the figures make it attractive for children. While younger ones ask their parents about the scene, older ones can read the descriptin in gist wtitten in 3 languages. It is a great place to start learning our mythology. The miniature models get embedded in the mind, as it happened to me!Current rates of tickets are INR 10 for children up to 16 yrs and INR 20 for anyone above 16 yrs. In my opinion it is a great place to spend a good 1-2 hrs with your kud if visiting Kolkata or if staying here."

Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

If you really want to enjoy this sanctuary then you have to ha've some patience then you will be able to see varieties of Birds. Best time for visiting this sanctuary is between 7a.m. to 9a.m."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

Not that impressive as i thought. But still if you are a bird watcher you can see many kind of common bird. You have to stay still to make the birds feel free to play  around.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

If you really want to enjoy this sanctuary then you have to ha've some patience then you will be able to see varieties of Birds. Best time for visiting this sanctuary is between 7a.m. to 9a.m."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Joy_Sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary,"It's a rarity to find areas densely covered with trees and foliage these days within a metropolitan city but Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary (short form - CKBS) , also known as ""Kayaler Bagan"" is a pleasant sight in the city of joy -Kolkata. Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now.

A part of the property was encroached by local promoters. Constructions have been erected in the encroached area.The other portions were acquisitioned by State Government. Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest. So go there with precautions such as anti-mosquito cream."

One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.

There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply.

It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

This time too it wasn't good .Any was I would tell about the good this first :1)Very easy to reach , its on the EM Bypass towards Baruipur hardly takes 10 Minutes from ""Shahid Khudiram Metro Station"" by Taxi.2)Previously there were no walls to protect the place now they have wall on all side except the EM Bypass side .So the illegal entry have reduced.3)It may not be a good place to see birds but there is nice place for Flora.4)It feels like a dense forest (it due to the uncontrolled shrubs growing).Bad Part:1)You cannot stand there for long due to the mosquitoes and humidity due to the dense vegetation .2)You wont be able to see any birds of interest , at least I didn't see any.3)Its not a proper bird sanctuary compared to other places , its just a patch of land with uncontrolled growth of plants .4)Rs 50/- entry is not worth it.5)Rabindra Sarobar is a far better place to see birds in spite of its location in the middle of the city and is free.6)Its more of a Mosquito Sanctuary"

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city.

A part of the property was encroached by local promoters. Constructions have been erected in the encroached area.The other portions were acquisitioned by State Government. Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest.

One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there.

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

No dedicated parking, so taking a big car is not recommended.Timings and Entry: The summer and winter timings vary by 30 minutes. The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene. This also reduces the chances of getting to view many species of birds around mid-day. Trees are not marked. Most water resources dry up in winter. Overall maintenance can definitely be better."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now.

It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest.

One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there.

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head.

Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area).

Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

After entry through the main gate I was stunned to feel the calmness in the green. Every nature lover around Kolkata must visit the place. There is a map of the whole area after entering through Gate which shows a large water body is present there but unfortunately the water body is fully dried. The authority should look into the matter.
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,rajibk95,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary - An island within Kolkata,"Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, is 20 minutes from Garia junction and 5-7 min from Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission. There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit.

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Joy_Sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary,"It's a rarity to find areas densely covered with trees and foliage these days within a metropolitan city but Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary (short form - CKBS) , also known as ""Kayaler Bagan"" is a pleasant sight in the city of joy -Kolkata. Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

The best months to visit are Nov to Feb as it's pleasant weather .You can go well equipped with a pair of binoculars and a good DSLR .There are plenty of birds , and butterflies all around but if you are observant , you could notice beautiful spider webs and large creepy crawlies .There are a variety of wild plants and it's the perfect place for a naturalist !"

You have to drive down a kilometre for refreshments.Ideal for a winter day trip."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Joy_Sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary,"It's a rarity to find areas densely covered with trees and foliage these days within a metropolitan city but Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary (short form - CKBS) , also known as ""Kayaler Bagan"" is a pleasant sight in the city of joy -Kolkata. Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Agniva_Das,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Solo,Bird Watcher's Paradise,"Hidden away in one corner of Narendrapur is CKBS, a garden locally known as ""Kayaler Bagan"". This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Biswadeep Datta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A true forest but man-maid,"I had an occasion to visit the Chintamani Kar Bird sanctuary (CKBS) on a Saturday. It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,paulmnav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Thick forest in the city,"I loved it despite the mosquitoes.I was there by 5.45am thinking they open at 6am but they open at only 7am in the winter So I tried my luck along the road by the river outside and was very happy with more than 10 varieties including my ever sighting of a Rufous Treepie among others I connected with 3 other bird watchers as we entered and enjoyed my sightings . I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Probhat N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Bird Sanctuary inside City,"How many people are aware that there exists a Bird Sanctuary ( ! ) inside this city of Kolkata ? That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

It is really a paradise land located so close to the city of Kolkata. The place has an ample amount of different varieties of trees comprising of some beautiful orchids. A variety of birds are a frequent visitor to this place and many other are it's residents. The best time to visit this place is in the winter. And early mornings are must to watch birdlife however different birds visit the sanctuary in the different seasons but according to me winter is the best. Apart from birds a large variety of insects including different types of butterflies are present. Overall the place is really a nature's paradise"
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,PChaudhuri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Alright for a short visit,"While the place is like a dense jungle in the city, it could be better maintained. water bodies with adequate viewing area would be good. Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Soumya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Stunning place out of chaos,I visited the Sanctuary in the morning of 3rd week of September. After entry through the main gate I was stunned to feel the calmness in the green. Every nature lover around Kolkata must visit the place. There is a map of the whole area after entering through Gate which shows a large water body is present there but unfortunately the water body is fully dried. The authority should look into the matter.
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,rajibk95,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary - An island within Kolkata,"Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, is 20 minutes from Garia junction and 5-7 min from Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission. There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

No dedicated parking, so taking a big car is not recommended.Timings and Entry: The summer and winter timings vary by 30 minutes. The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene. This also reduces the chances of getting to view many species of birds around mid-day. Trees are not marked. Most water resources dry up in winter. Overall maintenance can definitely be better."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest.

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic.

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city.

Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there.

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Dannyxb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Superb forest Sanctury within easy reach of central Kolkata.,"This place may be relatively small, but it's quite brilliant. I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

This time too it wasn't good .Any was I would tell about the good this first :1)Very easy to reach , its on the EM Bypass towards Baruipur hardly takes 10 Minutes from ""Shahid Khudiram Metro Station"" by Taxi.2)Previously there were no walls to protect the place now they have wall on all side except the EM Bypass side .So the illegal entry have reduced.3)It may not be a good place to see birds but there is nice place for Flora.4)It feels like a dense forest (it due to the uncontrolled shrubs growing).Bad Part:1)You cannot stand there for long due to the mosquitoes and humidity due to the dense vegetation .2)You wont be able to see any birds of interest , at least I didn't see any.3)Its not a proper bird sanctuary compared to other places , its just a patch of land with uncontrolled growth of plants .4)Rs 50/- entry is not worth it.5)Rabindra Sarobar is a far better place to see birds in spite of its location in the middle of the city and is free.6)Its more of a Mosquito Sanctuary"

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city.

It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there.

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

It is really a paradise land located so close to the city of Kolkata. The place has an ample amount of different varieties of trees comprising of some beautiful orchids. A variety of birds are a frequent visitor to this place and many other are it's residents. The best time to visit this place is in the winter. And early mornings are must to watch birdlife however different birds visit the sanctuary in the different seasons but according to me winter is the best. Apart from birds a large variety of insects including different types of butterflies are present. Overall the place is really a nature's paradise"

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,rajibk95,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary - An island within Kolkata,"Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, is 20 minutes from Garia junction and 5-7 min from Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission. There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city.

A part of the property was encroached by local promoters. Constructions have been erected in the encroached area.The other portions were acquisitioned by State Government. Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest.

One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes.

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Biswadeep Datta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A true forest but man-maid,"I had an occasion to visit the Chintamani Kar Bird sanctuary (CKBS) on a Saturday. It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

The best months to visit are Nov to Feb as it's pleasant weather .You can go well equipped with a pair of binoculars and a good DSLR .There are plenty of birds , and butterflies all around but if you are observant , you could notice beautiful spider webs and large creepy crawlies .There are a variety of wild plants and it's the perfect place for a naturalist !"

You have to drive down a kilometre for refreshments.Ideal for a winter day trip."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Joy_Sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary,"It's a rarity to find areas densely covered with trees and foliage these days within a metropolitan city but Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary (short form - CKBS) , also known as ""Kayaler Bagan"" is a pleasant sight in the city of joy -Kolkata. Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

No dedicated parking, so taking a big car is not recommended.Timings and Entry: The summer and winter timings vary by 30 minutes. The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene. This also reduces the chances of getting to view many species of birds around mid-day. Trees are not marked. Most water resources dry up in winter. Overall maintenance can definitely be better."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

If you really want to enjoy this sanctuary then you have to ha've some patience then you will be able to see varieties of Birds. Best time for visiting this sanctuary is between 7a.m. to 9a.m."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic.

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

If you really want to enjoy this sanctuary then you have to ha've some patience then you will be able to see varieties of Birds. Best time for visiting this sanctuary is between 7a.m. to 9a.m."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic.

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit.

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city. A must visit for bird lovers!"

A part of the property was encroached by local promoters. Constructions have been erected in the encroached area.The other portions were acquisitioned by State Government. Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest. So go there with precautions such as anti-mosquito cream."

One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.

There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply.

It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

This time too it wasn't good .Any was I would tell about the good this first :1)Very easy to reach , its on the EM Bypass towards Baruipur hardly takes 10 Minutes from ""Shahid Khudiram Metro Station"" by Taxi.2)Previously there were no walls to protect the place now they have wall on all side except the EM Bypass side .So the illegal entry have reduced.3)It may not be a good place to see birds but there is nice place for Flora.4)It feels like a dense forest (it due to the uncontrolled shrubs growing).Bad Part:1)You cannot stand there for long due to the mosquitoes and humidity due to the dense vegetation .2)You wont be able to see any birds of interest , at least I didn't see any.3)Its not a proper bird sanctuary compared to other places , its just a patch of land with uncontrolled growth of plants .4)Rs 50/- entry is not worth it.5)Rabindra Sarobar is a far better place to see birds in spite of its location in the middle of the city and is free.6)Its more of a Mosquito Sanctuary"

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city.

Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest.

One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there.

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

No dedicated parking, so taking a big car is not recommended.Timings and Entry: The summer and winter timings vary by 30 minutes. The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene. This also reduces the chances of getting to view many species of birds around mid-day. Trees are not marked. Most water resources dry up in winter. Overall maintenance can definitely be better."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head.

Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area).

Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,PChaudhuri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Alright for a short visit,"While the place is like a dense jungle in the city, it could be better maintained. water bodies with adequate viewing area would be good. Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

After entry through the main gate I was stunned to feel the calmness in the green. Every nature lover around Kolkata must visit the place. There is a map of the whole area after entering through Gate which shows a large water body is present there but unfortunately the water body is fully dried. The authority should look into the matter.
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,rajibk95,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary - An island within Kolkata,"Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, is 20 minutes from Garia junction and 5-7 min from Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission. There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

You have to drive down a kilometre for refreshments.Ideal for a winter day trip."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Joy_Sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary,"It's a rarity to find areas densely covered with trees and foliage these days within a metropolitan city but Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary (short form - CKBS) , also known as ""Kayaler Bagan"" is a pleasant sight in the city of joy -Kolkata. Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

No dedicated parking, so taking a big car is not recommended.Timings and Entry: The summer and winter timings vary by 30 minutes. The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene. This also reduces the chances of getting to view many species of birds around mid-day. Trees are not marked. Most water resources dry up in winter. Overall maintenance can definitely be better."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

If you really want to enjoy this sanctuary then you have to ha've some patience then you will be able to see varieties of Birds. Best time for visiting this sanctuary is between 7a.m. to 9a.m."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

The best months to visit are Nov to Feb as it's pleasant weather .You can go well equipped with a pair of binoculars and a good DSLR .There are plenty of birds , and butterflies all around but if you are observant , you could notice beautiful spider webs and large creepy crawlies .There are a variety of wild plants and it's the perfect place for a naturalist !"

You have to drive down a kilometre for refreshments.Ideal for a winter day trip."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic.

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city.

A part of the property was encroached by local promoters. Constructions have been erected in the encroached area.The other portions were acquisitioned by State Government. Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest.

One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply.

It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Probhat N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Bird Sanctuary inside City,"How many people are aware that there exists a Bird Sanctuary ( ! ) inside this city of Kolkata ? That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

It is really a paradise land located so close to the city of Kolkata. The place has an ample amount of different varieties of trees comprising of some beautiful orchids. A variety of birds are a frequent visitor to this place and many other are it's residents. The best time to visit this place is in the winter. And early mornings are must to watch birdlife however different birds visit the sanctuary in the different seasons but according to me winter is the best. Apart from birds a large variety of insects including different types of butterflies are present. Overall the place is really a nature's paradise"

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes.

No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Agniva_Das,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Solo,Bird Watcher's Paradise,"Hidden away in one corner of Narendrapur is CKBS, a garden locally known as ""Kayaler Bagan"". This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Biswadeep Datta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A true forest but man-maid,"I had an occasion to visit the Chintamani Kar Bird sanctuary (CKBS) on a Saturday. It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name?

Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

The best months to visit are Nov to Feb as it's pleasant weather .You can go well equipped with a pair of binoculars and a good DSLR .There are plenty of birds , and butterflies all around but if you are observant , you could notice beautiful spider webs and large creepy crawlies .There are a variety of wild plants and it's the perfect place for a naturalist !"

You have to drive down a kilometre for refreshments.Ideal for a winter day trip."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Joy_Sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary,"It's a rarity to find areas densely covered with trees and foliage these days within a metropolitan city but Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary (short form - CKBS) , also known as ""Kayaler Bagan"" is a pleasant sight in the city of joy -Kolkata. Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit.

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

If you really want to enjoy this sanctuary then you have to ha've some patience then you will be able to see varieties of Birds. Best time for visiting this sanctuary is between 7a.m. to 9a.m."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic.

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

If you really want to enjoy this sanctuary then you have to ha've some patience then you will be able to see varieties of Birds. Best time for visiting this sanctuary is between 7a.m. to 9a.m."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic.

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit.

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city. A must visit for bird lovers!"

A part of the property was encroached by local promoters. Constructions have been erected in the encroached area.The other portions were acquisitioned by State Government. Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest. So go there with precautions such as anti-mosquito cream."

One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.

There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply.

It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

This time too it wasn't good .Any was I would tell about the good this first :1)Very easy to reach , its on the EM Bypass towards Baruipur hardly takes 10 Minutes from ""Shahid Khudiram Metro Station"" by Taxi.2)Previously there were no walls to protect the place now they have wall on all side except the EM Bypass side .So the illegal entry have reduced.3)It may not be a good place to see birds but there is nice place for Flora.4)It feels like a dense forest (it due to the uncontrolled shrubs growing).Bad Part:1)You cannot stand there for long due to the mosquitoes and humidity due to the dense vegetation .2)You wont be able to see any birds of interest , at least I didn't see any.3)Its not a proper bird sanctuary compared to other places , its just a patch of land with uncontrolled growth of plants .4)Rs 50/- entry is not worth it.5)Rabindra Sarobar is a far better place to see birds in spite of its location in the middle of the city and is free.6)Its more of a Mosquito Sanctuary"

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city.

Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest.

One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there.

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

No dedicated parking, so taking a big car is not recommended.Timings and Entry: The summer and winter timings vary by 30 minutes. The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene. This also reduces the chances of getting to view many species of birds around mid-day. Trees are not marked. Most water resources dry up in winter. Overall maintenance can definitely be better."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head.

Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area).

Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,PChaudhuri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Alright for a short visit,"While the place is like a dense jungle in the city, it could be better maintained. water bodies with adequate viewing area would be good. Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

After entry through the main gate I was stunned to feel the calmness in the green. Every nature lover around Kolkata must visit the place. There is a map of the whole area after entering through Gate which shows a large water body is present there but unfortunately the water body is fully dried. The authority should look into the matter.
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,rajibk95,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary - An island within Kolkata,"Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, is 20 minutes from Garia junction and 5-7 min from Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission. There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene.

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!).

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

You have to drive down a kilometre for refreshments.Ideal for a winter day trip."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Joy_Sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary,"It's a rarity to find areas densely covered with trees and foliage these days within a metropolitan city but Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary (short form - CKBS) , also known as ""Kayaler Bagan"" is a pleasant sight in the city of joy -Kolkata. Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

No dedicated parking, so taking a big car is not recommended.Timings and Entry: The summer and winter timings vary by 30 minutes. The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene. This also reduces the chances of getting to view many species of birds around mid-day. Trees are not marked. Most water resources dry up in winter. Overall maintenance can definitely be better."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

If you really want to enjoy this sanctuary then you have to ha've some patience then you will be able to see varieties of Birds. Best time for visiting this sanctuary is between 7a.m. to 9a.m."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

The best months to visit are Nov to Feb as it's pleasant weather .You can go well equipped with a pair of binoculars and a good DSLR .There are plenty of birds , and butterflies all around but if you are observant , you could notice beautiful spider webs and large creepy crawlies .There are a variety of wild plants and it's the perfect place for a naturalist !"

You have to drive down a kilometre for refreshments.Ideal for a winter day trip."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."

I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"

If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic.

It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."

I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."

Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."

There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata.

Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience.

The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road.

I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Rangan B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Couples,An Oasis in concrete jungle,"It is unbelievable that such a place actually exists in a bustling metro and I would not have known about it had not my better-half dragged me to this place. This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Aref786,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014,Nature filled with sweet songs of Birds and peaceful environment," well to me it's really a very good place inside nature to spent  some hours of your weekend, a decent place where you can take your family or friends. One thing you must remember without Binoculars and long lens camera it's not worth visiting this place.       If you really want to enjoy this sanctuary then you have to ha've some patience then you will be able to see varieties of Birds. Best time for visiting this sanctuary is between 7a.m. to 9a.m."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Johnfromkol,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,Birds and butterflies galore !,"This place is quote underrated by the public!It is very well developed by the WB Forest department and hence the entry fee has been increased to Rs 50/ per person.One needs to visit this place either in the early hours of the morning or upto 10 am. The best months to visit are Nov to Feb as it's pleasant weather .You can go well equipped with a pair of binoculars and a good DSLR .There are plenty of birds , and butterflies all around but if you are observant , you could notice beautiful spider webs and large creepy crawlies .There are a variety of wild plants and it's the perfect place for a naturalist !"

You have to drive down a kilometre for refreshments.Ideal for a winter day trip."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Joy_Sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary,"It's a rarity to find areas densely covered with trees and foliage these days within a metropolitan city but Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary (short form - CKBS) , also known as ""Kayaler Bagan"" is a pleasant sight in the city of joy -Kolkata. Though the sanctuary is not located in the heart of the city but it's presence is of great importance to a large aviary community in its surroundings ,on the fringes of the city.The Sanctuary opens at 7 in the morning and is open till 5 in the evening and is a treat for any bird-lover as it houses a wide range of birds and certain reptiles like the monitor lizard. Though a number of birds found in the sanctuary might be  available with the city, hovering around housing complexes but to find them in their natural habitats is a pleasing sight. Ways to reach the sanctuary:The Sanctuary is located about 15 KMs from the heart of the city and the nearest railway station is Sonarpur on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour Line. From Sonarpur station, one can hire an auto which charges a nominal fare for a ride of 20 minutes. The Sanctuary can also be reached via the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass road.Best Time to visit:Birds are found through out the year but the ideal time to visit and enjoy the environment would be between the months of November and January.Entry Fee :INR 50 per head. No charges for Camera.There are paths laid out in the jungle which could be followed to reach the various corners and along those paths, one would find a large variety of foliage with the birds chirping away between them.A stroll in the sanctuary for a couple of hours on a weekend is an ideal escapade for any nature lover or specifically a bird lover !!!"
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Agniva_Das,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Solo,Bird Watcher's Paradise,"Hidden away in one corner of Narendrapur is CKBS, a garden locally known as ""Kayaler Bagan"". This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."
