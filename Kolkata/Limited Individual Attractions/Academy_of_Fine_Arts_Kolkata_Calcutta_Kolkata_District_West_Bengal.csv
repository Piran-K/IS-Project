Academy_of_Fine_Arts,_mittal_cauvery18,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Awestruck,"It was simple art gallery that had mesmerizing paintings. Not a fancy decor. Few paintings were very child-like but others were really astonishing. The best painting I liked was ""Buddha+Krishna+Mahadev"" (pic posted). I wish the description was also written so that its easy to know what an artist has depicted. Though artists always leave a scope to predict for viewers but a brief description would have been better to appreciate the beautiful piece of art because painting is just not about the colors but also the thought behind it. Art Gallery is a beautiful place to dust down the tiresome day and freshen up. (pics of the paintings I liked the most are attached)"

Academy_of_Fine_Arts,Supratik Gupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017,Nostalgic,"After long 30 odd years, i had been to this theatre to watch a bengali drama by Kanchan Mallick and Neel Mukherjee. The ambience was too good. The acoustics was superb, since the actors did not use mikes, but even then we were able to hear crystal clear. However, i would request the authorities to renovate it ASAP, since the chairs etc. are broken, seat covers are torn."
