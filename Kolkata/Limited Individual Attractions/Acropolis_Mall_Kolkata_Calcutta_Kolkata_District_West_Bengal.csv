Acropolis_Mall,Bapan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Family,Another mall in South Kolkata. Cheers for generation next,Just another mall. Good layout. Convenient communication. Food court and Cineplex all there but no book stall. Good enough for hang outs and eating out. Parking is a big issue during the evening time. If you are a resident of Kolkata it is very easy to have public transport . Close to the Gariahat Market and that's an advantage. If you go try  Cavender's Milk shake .

Other than the Food Court and the cinema ,there is less value proposition in this mall.Food Court has all the major food brands, licensed franchisee , however , do not offer taste and quality as per International standards. The cinema enclave is pretty costly and upbeat but has true comfort and ambience. Whether it delivers value for you is a question that you need to answer by visiting."

Good experience for kids of 6-14 years.There is lack of imagination and innovative approach. I hope most of the frequent mall visitors would agree to the observations and comments.Double layer parking is innovative but not under use due to very few cars and exorbitant charge. If you exceed even a minute after an hour, you end up paying for 2 hours!!"

Acropolis_Mall,sourav2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016,One of the most effectively designed recent malls of Kolkata!,"Acropolis Mall is the combination of wonderful utilization of space (considering its size),a very good mix of brands (right from major apparel brands, grocery stores,play areas, party zones, restaurants, food court to a beautiful multiplex) with an equally strategic location. When all these three factors fall in right places, then a mall can't go wrong! If you want to spend quality time while being in South Kolkata or somewhere near the Bypass, then this is the place to be! It may not match the grandeur of South City mall or the premium value of Quest Mall, but it will definitely leave you impressed,specially when you want to visit a good place to do shopping or just for hanging out with friends, without negotiating too much traffic (as in case of the other two malls as mentioned above).."
Acropolis_Mall,Ratan G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,A new mall in city of joy,"We visited this mall for the first time last night. We were delighted with the shops, restaurants and ambience of the place. Car parking was good. The place is big, so did not feel crowded. Ver clean and many big names in retail sector are there.Nowadays individual shops are absent in the trendy malls, Acropolis is no exception. Certainly will visit this mall when we come to Calcutta again.Finally we had a nice dinner at Chilles restaurant there."

The cineplex is state of the art and a deligth for me is Spencers supermarket live it excellent job guys staff can be snobbish but the variety is super great . It's secure and room air conditioned the funny thing is there's no seating in the common areas it's kinda a standish mall . There's a Chillies (havnt tried it ) and Barcelos Spanish flame grilled chicken yummy hey don't forget to try cheesy masala popcorn in the theatres .It's hard to find Coke Zero or diet drinks need have it on the fountains in the food court ... A must visit "

Acropolis_Mall,Eimeargency,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,"Good henna, bad overcharging on drinks","Although it is more difficult to get to and from Acropolis Mall (buses and taxis are available), I had been told by friends that the best henna in all of Kolkata could be done by a man in Acropolis Mall. It was so interesting to see how quick the man could create the beautiful designs. We also went to Hoppipola for drinks with friends while in Kolkata. Although the atmosphere there was good, prices seemed to vary on drinks and we did feel like we were charged more because we were tourists."
Acropolis_Mall,N P J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Shopping shopping and food,We spent almost a full day in this mall. Started with food at the food forum on the top floor which offered a decent variety to choose from. Then we went for shopping. Most of the shops were branded ones but also had some local ones. The only complaint I have is the song that played in the mall...it was only one song that too with couple of lines playing whole day long...I believe there is a movie theatre as well but we were tourists and were not bothered to check it out.
Acropolis_Mall,KRISHNENDU B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Extremely Poor Multiplex,I went with my parents to see one of the movies in its Cinepolis ie multiples. My parents had high blood pressure & a little breathing problems. But after requesting to almost 7 staffs they denied to switch on the air conditioner. As it was an evening show and it was the month of January. They told that they do not switch on their air conditioner or exhaust fan. My father became so sick that we need to leave the movie on half. I cannot understand why they are cutting down their cost so much for the people who are spending a lot for their best seats. This is like murdering people & will never suggest anyone to go their specially during their night or evening shift. If anyone read this please share for this severe inhumanity.
Acropolis_Mall,Somosmita,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016,Huge and imposing,A great place for interesting food and shops. Away from the heart of the city. Ambient atmosphere. Huge and spacious.
Acropolis_Mall,Avatima,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Spacious mall with good options for dining,"Location: On Rajdanga Connector, opposite Kasba New Market, not far from Ruby Hospital crossing in the EM Bypass.Ambiance and decor: Gorgeously lighted, has a lot of free walking space in each floor.Contains quite a few branded clothing shops, a movie multiplex, a food court, a hypermarket store from Spencer's a couple of Salons and spas and the usual filler stores.USP: Availability of multiple brands and does not give you that congested feeling of an over-discovered destination, just yet."
Acropolis_Mall,masterhari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Business,Great food varaities in the food court.,This mall has great food options and at a reasonable rates. The restaurant Auntie Anne's which serves Cinnabon is a great restaurant which opens at 10.30 am. The other restaurants open at 11 am.
Acropolis_Mall,Sachin Kaluskar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Business,Indeed a Mall of Joy!!! ,Acropolis is no doubt the Mall of Joy in the City of Joy Kolkata. It has all reputed brands you want. I loved it's Food Court. Good varieties of food. The Mall is big enough to explore things you need and small enough to not to make you feel tired. Looks like the design has been made keeping in customers comfort in mind. I didnt feel tired walking around. 
Acropolis_Mall,Sayan B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Very happy to visit here,"Acropolis mall is very near to Siemens and Chakraborty para areas..very new, fresh and staff is well behaved..all big brands like Mark and Spencers, Praapti, Van Heusen, Louis  Phillipe and others are present here..the movie experience is also awesome but the best part is the food court with mouth watering Bengali, mughlai and Chinese food..Mainland China has also a Asia Kitchen in 4th floor.. Just hope that it keeps it up and some bookstore like Crossword or Starmark comes up.."
Acropolis_Mall,tripsmaker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,Walk around to New Mall,"It's a brand new mall, earlier I  visited probably last year, then it has only few shops. Now, there are many big brands. All major luxury brands, have outlets in this mall. There is a food court, good location, good ambience. Only negative part is, It has no grocery outlet available. "

Acropolis_Mall,anshumanbanerjee,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Mall without any utility,"I visit there often as it is closest to my home. Else, you do not have any reason to pay visit unless you are addicted to shop with a fat purse OR movie goers. The Mall authority should think about opening a grocery store or something where you need to visit the mall for some basics. Luxury shops may not help to get higher footprint. Restaurants and movie theaters are the reasons for most of the footfall today."
Acropolis_Mall,Doyel K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,Best food court,This place has a different vibe as compared to other malls. The food court is more customised and offers a feel of an international charm combined with local and national cuisine. They also have some of the best restaurants in town.
