BBD_Bagh,Ema Datshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,Great architecture,"Before I went to Kolkata, I felt that I 'knew' the city through the many novels I'd read that were set there and so some of the places I sought to visit were places I knew from literature. One of my favourites Kolkata books is Chowringhee, so after walking through that area, I kept going to Dalhousie Square (aka BBD Bagh) in search of the 'Writers Building'. Dalhousie Square was named after one of the British Viceroys so there's a delicious irony that it's now renamed after three Bengali Freedom Fighters who killed the British Inspector General of Prisons. One generation's terrorist is another's hero and we see that happen all over the world.Name change or no, BBD Bagh is architecturally SO British that it almost makes you laugh. Like the Viceregal Lodge in Shimla or the High Court in Mumbai, it's deliciously Victorian Britain at its best or worst depending on your perspective.  Grand old buildings, many of them in need of repair, remind us of a time when Kolkata was the centre of the British Empire's influence in India and it's got an architectural grandeur that Delhi just didn't replicate when the capital moved there."

Once the British RAJ was ruled from here. Now it's the business district of Kolkata. Connected via trams, the Metro it's kind of easy to visit. Best is to walk it yourself and see the old buildings .....a mixture  of British and Indian architecture. "

BBD_Bagh,wanderingbreeze,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Heritage Walk,"If you have to visit Dalhousie square you must visit it on a Sunday , preferably at the morning . Otherwise the chaotic traffic and the street vendors will distract your attention and you will come back without experiencing much . Keep in mind if you have no interest in history or architecture then do not waste your time visiting the square . There is a lake in the middle of the square flanked by majestic buildings on all its sides . All of them must be around 150 to 200 years old . Some of the notable buildings to watch out for when you take the walk is Writers Building which covers the entire block ( don't forget to see the representation of science, commerce , agriculture etc beautifully personified at its roof ) Railway Headquarters at Fairlie Place, the GPO with its huge dome , the Royal insurance buildings , HSBC buildings  , the Post and Telegraph office and its quaint tower , Currency Building , St Andrews Kirk and its soaring steeple. A walk through Red Cross place is also interesting with its quaint buildings and leads straight to the Governors Palace . From there go to St Johns church and see the last supper painting painted by an European artist of some repute . This church also has the oldest cemetery of Colonial Calcutta . You can then talk a walk through Council House Street and return to Dalhousie square and appreciate the array of stupendous buildings on either side of the road . A walk to the other direction of Council House Street will lead you to the Calcutta Town Hall , the Council House and the phenomenal Calcutta High Court . A walk in Koilaghat street adjacent to GPO will also be an interesting one . You can see the really old Metcalfe Hall with its Corinthian Columns constructed many moons ago and then end the walk in Millennium Park off Strand Road which is a beautiful all length and no breadth park and enjoy the Calcutta waterfront .  The river is a sight to see with two Herculean bridges spanning the river on either side . Having travelled around the world I can say that anywhere if they had an area like this it would have been a major tourist attraction doing serious business . It's a shame that the upkeep of this once salubrious locality  is nothing short of a ""tamasha "" ensuring that once resplendent buildings and courtyards  represents a wreck. The nearest place to have a hearty meal is the Restaurant at the Great Eastern Hotel at Old Court House Street which happens to be the first luxury hotel in Asia and is in operation since 1815 I believe . Some of the photos I have added are period photos and some are new ."

Sometimes, its hope gets lost in unemployment, poverty, the jungle of traffic jam and urban mess. The same hope gets rebirth in the thinking of young poet's imagination. Kolkata lives for yesterday and tomorrow. Today is over to take a right decision or to do a demonstration. The colloquial OFFICE PARA or British Dalhousie Square or more recently BBD Bag are different names given to the same place. It is as colorful and as contrasting as Kolkata itself. Come on any Sunday afternoon, and feel what the manorial buildings are speaking about?

The GPO, The Town Hall, The Governor's residence and the Eden Gardens are all nearby.

However, the GPO and Writer's Building are some of the two buildings where you may still smell the rich tradition of Bengal from the great old days. Other than that, its just an office area, and trust me, there are much better office areas in other cities across the universe."
BBD_Bagh,iammsaurav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Business,Old is Gold !!,"BBD Bagh has so much to offer about the history and heritage of Kolkata. The old buildings from the english times, the beautiful lanes, trams etc gives you so much insight about this place. If you visit kolkata, do visit this place, as you would surly be spell bounded by it's beauty."
BBD_Bagh,Sachin0408,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Solo,A Walk to Remember,"B.B.D. Bagh is nothing but a commercial and political center of all of East India where many of the business and political institutions from the colonial era still exist. The centerpiece is the Writer's Building which is the secretariat of the Government of the State of West Bengal and houses the office of the Chief Minister of West Bengal.  For company you have the magnificent GPO, the massive RBI, Headquarters of Eastern Railway and Calcutta Port Trust and plenty of other Government offices. As a backpacker tourist if you are visiting BBD Bagh get ready to be dwarfed when you are crossing these buildings.When I was a teenager and walked the pathways alongside these structures in BBD Bagh I used to feel proud of being a Calcutta. It gave me a sense of pride that Calcutta was once the capital of the British Era before they thought of shifting base to Delhi. Well Calcutta’s loss was Delhi’s gain. Look where the Capital has aspired to become while Calcutta still languishes in its past glory."
BBD_Bagh,anupam b,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,Old heritage area,This is oldest area of kolkata from British time. You can see writters building here which is a very old British construction. This building used to be government bureaucratic building. Now a days some part of it transferred to other place. Opposite of these building there is a pond called Laldighi which is now underground parking lot. There is a famous bus stand. Nothing special to visit. 
BBD_Bagh,Doyel K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Solo,Very crowdd,"This is the centre of the hub of offices and government jobs. Thousands of people flock here to go to their respective desks. This area has a huge market for daily passerby, and there are important monuments and colonial buildings. "

BBD_Bagh,Shivcharan V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Solo,Historic Square from British Era,"Formerly known as ""Dalhousie Square"" it has now been renamed as ""BBD Bagh"" ( Garden ) named after three freedom fighters. All these impressive colonial buildings were used as offices of various Government departments when Kolkata was the capital during the British Empire.  Now it houses the current Government offices of the Bengal Government.  There is Secretarial, Raj Bhavan, Writer's building, General Post Office, St. Andrew's Church, Radha Bazaar, Lal Bazaar with a pond called ""Lal Dighi"" in the middle of the Square..This area is well served by public transport, tram and Esplanade Metro Station is also near by.  There are  lots of shops and street food vendors around this area.  This area is World Heritage Site."
BBD_Bagh,IndraJJ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Family,Kolkata's business district,"At the centre of Kolkata's business district, the imposing and magnificent structure of Writer's Building demands all our attention for a good government house. Next is the St. John's Church with its all past glory to welcome anyone coming for a business or just a casual troll. In weekdays, this place gets a new lease of life with all hustle and jostles. Not just lifeless concrete structures, anyone can't miss the mouth watering street food and so many items on offer by roadby sellers. Best vehicle to get there? Tram, what else to enjoy the fast pacing movements outside!"
BBD_Bagh,DebduttaGhosh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Business,Writer's Building and some offices,"BBD Bagh is really a beautiful square located in the East Central Kolkata. The area is very well maintained and properly beautified. Writer's Building, Lal Dighi and St. Andrews Church are some of the points of interest around, otherwise the area is filled with offices and other old buildings."
BBD_Bagh,Chandan144,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Solo,Of offices and people,"This is basically Kolkata's office hub, with most offices in and around this area. During working days, BBD Bag comes alive with a sea of humanity of every description, street food, shops, pavement sellers, hand carts, and noise...a lot of it in fact. But don't ignore the majestic GPO or General Post Office building, office of the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation, an old Synagogue and the land mark  St. Andrew's Church.Do try the street food here, it come piping hot and moderately safe to eat. If you can, do repeat the visit at night and enjoy the difference. It is for you to discover."

BBD_Bagh,Stephen D,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Couples,Not much to see but worth a quick walk after reading the history...,"The Writers Building was behind sandbags with no access.  Can't even get a good distant view of this grand old British building because Lal Dighi was also closed (""for renovation"").  In india this can be a semi-permanent condition !St Andrews Church was open and a lovely island of Western Culture.General Post Office is superb British Colonial architecture and you can actually get inside."
BBD_Bagh,Raymond W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Ringed By Interesting Buildings,"With precious little to celebrate in terms of modern Kolkata- the city is basically a dustry wreck, with magnificent buildings in various states of decay- the local administration have renamed the former Dalhousie Square BBD Bagh in honor of three wannabe assassins who failed to kill a British official here in the 1930s. This drum-beating nationalism is a common ploy in India, used as a way to try and distract attention away from the obvious failings of local administrations. No, there has not been much development or even maintenance in Kolkata for decades- but at least we have renamed the former British landmarks in honor of Indian personages!The main garden (bagh) is fenced off, which is one disappointment, but there are still a plethora of colonial buildings around the square. You can see the magnificent Writer's Building- an 18th century wonder which covers an entire block, a 19th century church, the General Post Office and much else besides. It could be a wonderfully nostalgic reminder of British India, but the traffic, cables and lack of maintenance somewhat detract from the experience, Still, colonial history fans will enjoy this very much."
BBD_Bagh,Felix L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,Nothing exciting,"This is the area which most evidently reflects it's past British rule with large colonial buildings everywhere. It is somewhat interesting to look at, but nothing particularly exciting or particularly impressive. "
BBD_Bagh,ManaseeSoman,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 • Couples,Short walking tour... must do...for enjoying the colonial architecture in Kolkata...,"A walk around the BBD Baugh (named after the three young Bengali patriots - Binoy, Badal and Dinesh ) is perhaps the best place to get the colonial feel of Kolkata. This area has the same flavour of the Fort area or the D N Road area of Mumbai. A wallk around the tank will be worthwhile if you are fond of colonial buildings. You may start walking north wards from the very beautiful Esplanade Mansion at the corner opposite the majestic gate of the Raj Bhawan and head straight - right upto the Royal Insurance Building - General Post Office Building and the RBI building and take a right turn to walk all the the way along the brick red Writer's building till the St. Andrews Church, then take a right again to walk along the Mint Office and the Office of the WBTDC. One can always enjoy steaming hot cups of chai from the kullads (read: small earthen cups) in this area - a refreshing dose for your tired legs.. This area is close to all major bus stands and other attractions in Kolkata such as the Majestic State Bank of India Building and other buildings on the Strand Road, the Raj Bhawan and the buildings and emporiums on Chowringhee. The Esplanade Metro Station is the closest Metro Station to BBD Baugh."

BBD_Bagh,GrainVodka,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2012,BBD Bagh -- Journey Down the Memory Lanes,"Located in the heart of city of Kolkata, BBD Bagh houses the Secretariat of the state and is the central business hub of the city. However, we wanted to visit the place because of its link to history of the freedom movement in India. The place is named after the three martyrs of freedom movement, Binoy, Badal, and Dinesh who were heroes in the famous battle of corridors in Writer’s Building on 8th December 1930.Prior to that time, the place was known as Dalhousie Square. Close to the place is the Lal Dighi tank and most of the important buildings like Writer’s Building, Bengal Chamber of Commerce & Industry, and Telephone Bhawan are located here giving it the name of “office para” (location of offices). An attraction is the statue of Maharaja Lakshmeswar Singh of Dwarbhanga."
