Baps_Shri_Swaminarayan_Mandir_Kolkata-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Beng.ht,debasis005,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 â€¢ Family,Mixed feeling,I was bit disappointed to my first visit there. When I reached the temple it was closed at 2 pm and was scheduled to be opened at 3.30pm. I came with my family in my private car and  to wonder you can't enter the temple and park your vehicle till it was closed. I can understand if the temple for the idol is closed at least the premises can be kept open for the visitors to enter and wait inside. The complex was very big but visitors have to wait outside the temple at the side of the most dangerous highway you can ever find with buses driving on a suicide mode. I had to find a less safe place to park my car and waited for 1.5 hrs outside. This is pathetic management rule. Other than that no doubt temple architecture is definitely praiseworthy.Parking is not free btw.And a word of caution if you are coming in your own vehicle and you reached after temple is closed then be ready to wait outside at the most dangerous highway you can ever find.

Easily accessible by public transport, Has a very spacious parking too.Ambiance: Exquisitely crafted, shows the wealth the followers of this sect command. Peaceful, with a lot of open space. From our brief visit a few minutes before lunch, it seemed this temple is somewhat free from the clumsy, ritual-oriented and claustrophobic that most religious sites in this part are. However, it does not evoke the aura of peace and the desire to meditate that, say Auroville or Belur Math, does."

There is a golden statue(not sure) of lord Swaminarayana in the museum cum sanctum (garbha griha) beneath the main temple. Visitors can perform special offerings and puja in that sanctum.What I liked the most is unlike other temples of this country, this place is neat and clean and quiet. Here I can find peace of mind just by seating at any corner for sometimes. One who loves to visit temples and religious places must visit this new temple of kolkata, and pay his/her humble obeisance to the lord.If you want to come by bus, take any bus which is goes to diamond harbour or amtala.
