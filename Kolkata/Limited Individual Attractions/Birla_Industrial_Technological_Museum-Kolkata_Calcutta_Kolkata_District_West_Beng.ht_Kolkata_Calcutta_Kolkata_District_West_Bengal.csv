Birla_Industrial_Technological_Museum-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Beng.ht,atulya_sinha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,VISITOR-FRIENDLY SCIENCE MUSEUM,"Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, established in 1959, is the oldest science and technology museum of the city. The building was originally the residence of Raja Baldeo Birla (1863-1956) and it was donated to the Government by his heirs for setting up museum. Now a new wing has been constructed perpendicular to the original three-storied building and some exhibits are displayed outdoors as well. There is a well-maintained garden, where statues of great scientists have been installed.In addition to basic physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, astronomy, electricity, electronics etc., there are galleries devoted to technologies such as television, motive power, transport, metals, etc. A special feature is a mock-up of a coal mine. There is a dedicated gallery for children as well. There are several small auditoriums, where documentary films are regularly screened. As a mechanical engineer, I was particularly interested in the motive power and transport galleries, both of which have rich collections. The latter includes a narrow gauge steam locomotive and a vintage car which belonged to Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, the eminent scientist. The exhibits are generally well-maintained and efforts are made to improve them from time to time. For example, the interactive exhibits which were operated by touching a button are now modified to be activated without any physical contact. The museum is visitor-friendly and their website is quite informative. Parking facility is available inside the compound, but there is a separate charge for it. Washrooms are well-maintained"

BITM is also the pioneer of the Mobile Science Exhibitions with the first exhibition on wheels. With its galleries, diverse activities and the growing chains of the satellite centers, this museum is now the place where science manifests itself through means of interactive and animated models.

Birla_Industrial_Technological_Museum-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Beng.ht,Sumit Kasera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,An evening with science and technology,"Bengalis lay special emphasis on education, sports, art/craft & theatre in their life – it is no wonder that in Kolkata you find art/craft centres, sports clubs, theatres, science museum and the likes spread across the city. Birla clan have special place in shaping the countours of the city – channelizing back the gains from the business into making science centres, temples and museums in the city. BITM website states: established on 2nd May 1959 under the administrative control of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), Birla Industrial & Technological Museum in Kolkata is widely regarded as the mother of science museum movement in India. The idea behind this pioneering initiative came from Dr. B C Roy, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal who after visiting the Deutsches Museum in Munich was inspired to create a similar institution in India for public engagement with science & technology. His vision and efforts in this regard found instant support and patronage from the likes of Pandit Jawharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India, and industrialist Shri G D Birla. The latter donated the Birla Park, his sprawling bungalow and the adjoining plot of land in the upscale Ballygunge area of Calcutta, to CSIR for setting up an Industrial and Technological Museum. Pandit Nehru received this magnanimous gift from Shri G D Birla in 1956. It was possibly philanthropy at its peak.The BITM visit was very interesting due to multiple reasons – the key being a mock coal mine that taught us a thing or two about coal mining. In an artificial setting, the place appeared almost too real and true. Apart from this, there was live science show with demonstration on liquid nitrogen. Apart from this, there was a 3D show.Overall, it was a place recommended for children for few tips and tricks on science and technology."

They didn’t disappoint me . The upgrade and maintenance deserve applause.  The coal mine, the planetarium , magic shows  all are mind blowing. The 3 D shows need little brush up as all 3-D glasses are far from date of expiry. They ruin the experience of such great shows. There is no one to explain the science and technology part. There can be classes on science, history , geography , astronomy, mineralogy just like the other shows. The planetarium facilitators (few of them) need to be confident and a little more efficient. The play zone is wonderful. I prefer to go there again and again. But I guess a little more staff and few new ideas will help the place to gain more attention."

But this place doesnt have a clean eatery or coffee shop! The only eatery is terribly maintained has only thali's(Fixed meal of rice, veg, chicken/fish) to offer, nothing for the kids who are the prime visitors and for whom this place is dedicated to. I would request the management to open up a decent place to eat with emphasis on hygiene and cleanliness, and only parts of the premises is air conditioned, pls make it centrally a/c. Also smart staff are required to provide a more professional approach. Overall, badly needs a facelift. This is one of the pride of Kolkata, this should be taken care of."
