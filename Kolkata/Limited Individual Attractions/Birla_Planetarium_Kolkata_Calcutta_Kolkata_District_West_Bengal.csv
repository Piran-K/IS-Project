Birla_Planetarium,ohiowanderer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Perfect on a rainy day in Kolkata,"We attended the 6:30 PM show in English and it was very good.  My friend had visited the Planetarium in 1982 and remembered it fondly.  It was just as good in 2018.  The show was narrated by Robert Redford, and you can't go wrong with Robert Redford.  The show was about cosmic collisions.  The planetarium was clean and had comfortable seats.  After the show, take a look at the displays. And there are clean toilets, a luxury in that area. You cannot take big bags inside and have to leave them at a booth outside.  I was a bit concerned about that but my backpack was safe."

Birla_Planetarium,saronichatterjee27,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,"""Up above the world so high""","we are habituated to look the dusky sky in Kolkata because of the increasing pollution. Birla Planetarium offers you to experience a clear view of night sky ( don't be serious, just enjoy). They conduct shows in different time schedule in Three laguages i.e.- Bengali, English,Hindi. You can easily follow the show(s) as per your choice. All the shows are quite informative .The shows are very much useful to the school students. Parents and teachers must come here with their children so that they can enjoy a live presentation of what they have learnt in their books. Show tickets are available for Rs.80 per head, but large group of students can enjoy discount also.The place is easily accessible  from Maidan Metro. It is very near to Victoria Memorial and situated just next to the St. Paul's Cathedral.The only negative point about the management according to me is that, they don't allow you to buy ticket from the counter in advance. They start selling tickets just half an hour before the show. Because of that (as I didn't know the rule), I have to wait from 4pm to 6pm to buy tickets for 6:30 pm show and was forced to take the unnecessary long queue to collect my tickets."

Birla_Planetarium,Jennifer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,A hidden gem of Kolkata while in open view,"As a foreign visitor it might be easy to just pass by this planetarium while visiting nearby sights. However, the planetarium has a 13:30 and 18:30 viewing in English which I would highly recommend (only 80 rupees). We really enjoyed the show and learned a few new things about our solar system. The chairs are comfortable enough and there is AC.After the show there are still a few galleries to view, which I would suggest not to miss out on. I found it especially interesting to see paintings of Hindi deities (and the explanations of their  connection to space) next to scientific explanations of our solar system.This was truly a great visit!"

Birla_Planetarium,Abhay Kumar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Needs Improvements,"My visit to Birla Planetarium was bit disappointing.The first disappointment was that there was no proper arrangement for seating people who are waiting for the next show. There was no eatery where one can get some snacks or drinks while they are waiting.Despite all the big talk about digital India, only cash was accepted as Entry Fee. This only shows that the management is not adopting new payment methods.There was no punctuality as the show started nearly 7 minutes late and the announcer did not even apologize for the delay. Not surprising that people ridicule Indians by calling IST as Indian Standard Time. On the whole lots of changes needed."
Birla_Planetarium,somdipghosh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,The place is good,The place is good and people who tell about has good voice . This place is good for both children and adults to know about what stars shines in our sky.
Birla_Planetarium,MdZaff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Amazing view of the Brahmand,"We visited the planetarium in the afternoon. There were some techincal issues and the show started late. However, once the show started we were immersed in another world. The background narrative is excellent. We get to know our universe in a different light. Its great specially for kids. Added attraction is the displays about stars, planets, galaxies,etc which you can walk through before and after the show. Its a place to spend with the kids. However, there seemed to some technical glitch as one part of the space was completely black, maybe blackhole."
Birla_Planetarium,Suman Sankar Ghosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017,An sketchy tour of the cosmos,"This is again a trip down the memory lane. I have come here as a child with my father and now i have come again as a father. But the place has lost its charm. The projection is jittery, the associated lecture is stern cold and brief. The toilet stinks and you can smell it even inside the planetarium. The chairs, are uncomfortable and broken. I am shocked at the level of neglect."
Birla_Planetarium,Satish_at_VSSE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Get immersed in Universe!,"A must experience. There is a show about Universe and mega events happening in Universe.

Birla_Planetarium,Dhairyashil V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,An educative celestial experience.,"Birla Planetarium is a dome shaped single storeyed structure next to St. Paul's Cathedral. It conducts sky-shows for the public introducing them to astronomy and educating on subjects like the evolution of earth, mysteries of space, Mars and other planets etc. It also has interactive sessions for answering any doubts or myths about the space and the planets. The shows are very educative especially for the school going children who can get a glimpse into the cosmos through these sky-shows. The inside of the planetarium also houses pictures, busts of scientists, educative displays for the information of the visitors. The planetarium is a plastic-free zone.One thing we found strange was that our show was delayed by almost an hour as we were told by the management that as it was raining with lightening, the show could not be conducted as the lightening is causing disturbance to the signals ??The sky-shows are conducted in English (1.30 & 6.30 pm), Hindi (12.30, 2.30 & 4.30 pm) and Bengali (3.30 & 5.30 pm). The shows last for about 40-45 minutes. Cost of Entrance Ticket is Rs.80/person. Additional shows in Hindi and Bengali are conducted in the morning on Sundays and Holidays.Overall an educative experience on the celestial happenings."
Birla_Planetarium,P_Sengupta2005,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,A brief meeting with the STARS...,"It was an amazing experience, remembered the childhood days when I had first visited the place way back, my 7yrs old son was also not an exception in terms his ecstasy.Especially the new developments that they have, the visual effects after the renovation will catch the eyes.The constellations are so clear and goes to show how one can actually identify the zodiacs very easily after being lead to them virtually.Timing of the shows in different languages also makes it easy to comprehend for those who are comfortable with Hindi and Bengali apart from English.The only thing I felt could have increased the attraction was an online ticketing, which is still not introduced. But I hope in the future the authorities will provide online tickets to increase convenience for the viewers.In a nutshell its a pride of our city to have such marvellous destination in the heart of the city-centre..."
