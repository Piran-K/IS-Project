Birla_Temple,Sumit Kasera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful temple to see the legacy of Birlas,"The major business family of India including the Tatas and Birlas always had a rich tradition of doing lot of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities. These families have created plethora of beautiful temple, hospitals, schools and other activities. The Birla mandir in Kolkata and in many other cities made are extension of this rich tradition. Wiki tells us that ‚ÄúA national chain of the ""Birla temples,"" temples of grandiose scale and design, have become major landmarks and part of the cityscapes of Indian urban life in the late twentieth century. The Birla temples exist in conjunction with other large industrial and philanthropic ventures of the wealthy Birla family, including major institutions of technology, medicine, and education.‚Äù Birla Mandir exists in many cities of India including Varanasi, Delhi, Kanpur, Kolkata, Jaipur and many other cities. These are typically made in white marble or sandstone. In Kolkata, it is easily reachable in Ballygunge area. Since we used Uber, was not sure about the parking. The temple opened in morning from 5.30 A.M. to 11 A.M and at 4.30pm in the evening till 9pm. We went in the evening and a small crowd gathered around. As soon as gates opened, it dissipated pretty soon. There was small room at the entrance that kept our shoes for a small fee as shoes were not allowed inside the main temple. The sanctum sanctorum was richly decorated, and temple was dedicated to Lord Krishna and Radha. There were other deities in the temple as well. While there were no fees, the mesmerizing experience was mildly soured by constant demand for some money by the staff working there for the security and upkeep. For sure, the temple is a beautiful place to go and fall in awe for an hour to see the legacy of the Birlas."
Birla_Temple,rajarshi2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Is the story behind the Temple true?,"Impressive when you see it from outside, though does not look very grand once you view it from close quarters. However, what intrigued me was the story I heard from a friend of mine who knows the Birla family well. It seems that construction at the temple will never end, because apparently the Birla scion (GD Birla) who began constructing the temple in 1970 had a dream that the Birla business empire would collapse the day construction at this temple ended. Hence, there is always some work or the other in progress at the site.Worth a visit if you in the locality and have nothing better to do."

Excellent architecture of the temple.Ambiance of the temple creates peace in mind.Temple staff rude in nature.

Birla_Temple,Dewashish C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Radhe Radhe.. Radhe Govinda ,Temple is very clean and centre of the city. Very huge and attractive to lose your presence.  I felt lucky and stress free after visiting the site. Chanting of mantras and bhajan made this place pious and pure. Good to see once at least when you are in kolkata. I v attended evening aarti at 6pm. It was good but no distribution of prasad after it. Mobile can be taken inside the temple in silent mode but taking pictures are prohibited. Any one can sit out side the temple and feel happy to spend time for a while.  No entry fee.  You may be asked some money from  gate keeper for taking family photos. Overall good experience.

Birla_Temple,Dr. JP Sarma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,The same charm,"I still remeber faintly my first visit to this temple when I was a little child with my father. Dad had come to Kolkata to attend some conference, I guess-Lions if I am correct. We undertook this visit then and the experience still resonattes inside me. I had the same feelings rush in when I took my elder son to this temple. Immediately my memory cells began to function, and I recollected my thopughts when I visitied with my father. That time, I don't remeber keeping our shoes  in the shoe counter. The place is very very clean and very well organised. The  sight of too many Security men was a sore point, which was not there earlier. But, I think, changes in societal norms and behaviour necessitates that.The feeling of divinity was still percolating. I felt glad that I could replicate what my father did to me, to my elder son, though it was absolutely unintended and came as a divine surprise to me."
