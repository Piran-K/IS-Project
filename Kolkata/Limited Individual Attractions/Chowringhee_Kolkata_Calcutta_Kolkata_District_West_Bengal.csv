Chowringhee,Rasputin21,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Chaos,"Chowringhee used to be a beautiful wide street with mansion and good hotels.  Gardens on the other side provided a lovely contrast.  Now is is a concrete jungle with decaying buildings, derelict buildings, dirty broken foot path (if you can even call it it a footpath), dirty stalls.

It is filled with crowds and it is very tough to walk on the streets as you have to maintain pace with the crowds. I went here along with three other friends and stood at street corners to marvel at the architecture of the Old buildings like the LIC Building. Also we visited the Hogg Market [New Market] which was built during british rule and wondered why it could not be converted like the Central Market in Kuala Lumpur. Both are built around the same time.It's also home to all the old movie halls like New Empire, Roxy, Elite, Tiger, Metro etc and now what we see is most of them have been converted into Shopping places or restaurants.I hope the Bengal government which is instrumental in beautifying the New town area will also focus on this amazing place in Kolkata."

Chowringhee,Harpreet_Chd,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Business,An experience to remember by,"There is not one particular thing that you can label as a definitive sight seeing activity per se in this area, known by the ever popular name of Chowringhee. A popular place, immortalised in books, movies, stories and even history, Chowringhee became famous as an urban destination when the British started building residences around this area, which was practically a jungle infested with wild cats. It is to Kolkata what Piccadilly is to London.The main stretch of the area is the JL Nehru Road, but other popular roads like Camac Street and Sudder also fall in this area. For the locals and tourists alike, Chowringhee defines Old Calcutta, both in terms of the layout as well as the architecture of the buildings. This is also the Business hub of the city, and therefore almost always crowded and chaotic. You will find all modes of transport, all forms of shops, all varieties of things to eat, and all different types of activities happening around you. You can catch a bus, hire a rickshaw, travel by metro, ride a bicycle, take a walk...have any form of Indian/Chinese/Continental/American cuisine in some nook or corner of the umpteen streets in the area, and also find small to large shopping establishment either in the well defined shopping outlets, or as an unorganised setup on the pavements- don't be surprised to find full suits being sold right on the pavement. It is precisely this order in chaos that makes Chowringhee so special- be a part of the crowd, experience the madness in all forms and colours, savour the delicacies on offer, and live life the way it is on offer in Chowringhee. You will find your own reason to cherish some or all of it."

Chowringhee,pankaj3b,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Solo,Centre Point ok Kolkata,"Chowringhee is the heart beat of City of Joy. It is the centre from which you have access all over the city. As far as shopping is concern, everything is easily available that also according to your pocket. It gives you feel why Kolkata is said to be city of Joy."

Chowringhee,diadour,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,This is the hub of the hustle and bustle!,"Kolkata is riddled with people, cars, and more people.  Chowringhee area is one of those places but also wonderful with curio shops, outdoor markets and so many knick knack stores.  It's worthwhile to walk around and take it all in, even buy some few souvenirs to bring home "

Exceptional to average hotels, shops for everything, Many restaurants for different types and category, public and private transport and so on. Be careful when crossing the roads as the traffic is not that sober!"
Chowringhee,Avatima,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,The CBD of Kolkata that still tells a story of the colonial prime,"The hub of non-IT offices, perpetually lively (or crowded, if you are a daily commuter), often the center of political agitations, always in the news, but impossible to ignore if you live in or visit the city. Buildings may not be sky-high, but the view is one of the best indicators of how late 19th, early 20th century city centers used to look like. Deightful for street food lovers and bargain hunters"
Chowringhee,sujoy c,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,My recent visit here,"One weekend I have visited this area. This is basically heart of Kolkata. One of the most busiest place in Kolkata. From early morning to late night, huge no of people come here everyday. Main problem is the availability of car parking. Numerous street foods are available near the new market area. Lots of restaurants, food court, shops are located here."
