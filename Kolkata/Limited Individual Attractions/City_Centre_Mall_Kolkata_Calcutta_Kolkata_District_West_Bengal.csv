City_Centre_Mall,Manishrajb77,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Raj,"In City Centre mall you will get all types of services i.e. Restro, Pub, Pizza Hut, KFC, & lot of other things"
City_Centre_Mall,akghosal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,One of the best shopping centres/malls in the Kolkata area,"One of the best shopping centres/malls I've visited in the Kolkata area and a place I've visited many times throughout the years whenever I've travelled to Kolkata. Has a relatively good selection of shops (even though a few have shut before and during the pandemic), most of the indoor mall and even the outside corridors are relatively clean and well-maintained (definitely puts New Market in Central Kolkata to shame in my opinion) and covid checks and regulations are followed for the most part. My only issue with this place is that the main food court (think it was called Hangouts) is no longer present anymore, having been replaced by a Burger King and a cafe, which is a real shame in my opinion as that was a place I loved to visit and eat whenever I went with my relatives here and its closure means that there are fewer eating options now, but apart from that, I still love visiting this area and with the new metro line now open, travelling there should be more convenient than before, especially when the full line to Howrah opens."
City_Centre_Mall,Natalie1204,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 • Family,Lots of open space and things to do,"Love that there’s so much to do at this mall.

City_Centre_Mall,Sanjib.M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Customers getting harassed by Mall Security persons.,"Though this is a nice place to hangout with many Shopping options, but recently I have witnessed some chaos and harassments which was created by the securities of the mall, What ever the reasons are I do not know but the behavior of security persons towards the visitors is simply not tolerable.  They are even manhandling.  Though it happened with another person, But me as a customer of this place feeling very much dishonored by seeing this happening. Commonly there were two to three security persons  involved with this. I request Mall higher authority to intervene in this."
City_Centre_Mall,Indradeep R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Exactly city centre,"The location of the mall caught my attention. Its just below the City centre metro station and thus navigating from this place is quite easy. While this review is with regards to the mall, however I cannot stop mentioning something which caught my attention about 100 metres from the mall and which you might want to explore. There is a house which I covered which amazingly landscaped from the streets to the entire boundary wall as well the outer house walls and balcony with flowers. It just cheered me up and of course the pleasure to the eyes to the heart which is inexplicable. The mall is quite large but from the metro side it can be a bit claustrophobic. I almost got lost trying to find the entrance to the CCD though it can be easily accessed from the outside as well. There are enough Retail shop and food outlets to spend time and to shop your hearts content, I have given 4 rating for the location though I was not quite excited with the architecture of the place as I found it confusing"
