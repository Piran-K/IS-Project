City_Centre_New_Town,sujoy c,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,My recent visit here,"Last Saturday, I had visited City Center-II @ Rajharhat. A small food festival was going there. Some popular restaurants of Kolkata took part in that food festival. This center is a very large. U can park your park outside also, it would cost you less. Inside, parking fee is bit more. There is lots of open space available inside this mall. But you have to cross lots of stairs to get inside the mall. This would create some problem for old aged persons. But overall it is a nice place."

City_Centre_New_Town,Ashutosh J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Excellent for movies poor for dining or shopping,"The place is good for movies but not shopping. Common brands are mostly present but not the best stocks. The children's toy bus is absolutely annoying out here. Restaurants are few and substandard or overpriced. The useful shops here are undergarments from jokey, KFC, bata, MC Donald's, titan, levis and hardly anything stable. Parking vis sufficient though. Maseekah and Gammas used to be acceptable restaurants but both are closed."
