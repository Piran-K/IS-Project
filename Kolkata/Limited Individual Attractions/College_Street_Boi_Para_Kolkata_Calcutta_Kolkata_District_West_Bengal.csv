College_Street_Boi_Para,The_Crimson_Corpse,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Didn't find what I was looking for,"Didn't find any Western comics in college street from publishers like Dark Horse, Image, IDW or DC/Vertigo. There were no Japanese mangas either.I tried many bookstores near the coffee house (including those shops that sells foreign books) but didn't find any international comics from publishers i mentioned above.I tried looking for a few Non-Fiction books as well by international authors who specialized in particular subjects ... but there was nothing in college street.The only place that has a decent collection of western books are online shopping sites.College street bookstores needs to change with time. They should have a good collection of the following -1) international novels, 2) international comics (including TPB and Omnibus editions),3) non-fiction books dealing with pathology, world history, world religions, paranormal research and various other topics. If they fail to have these in their stock, then they should at least procure them from the west on customer's request and also keep us updated with tracking information, refund, delay in delivery and other such things via phone or e-mail.Its 2022 and they should import books from overseas, just like amazon does for their Indian customers."

And I make it a point to go back every visit. The old bookstalls crowding the pavements are a browser's delight. Pick up novels, artbooks, history tomes, juicy recipe books - anything you like. The prices are delightful and the books charm by their very ancientness. Top tip: wear very comfy shoes; carry an umbrella during summer and monsoon and sling a big, light tote bag over your shoulder. You will need that to tuck away all the books that you buy! Happy reading..."

College_Street_Boi_Para,Pradip B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Booksellers do not give up easily,"Probably the Largest Book Market in the World. It is said that 'If you do not find a Book in College Street, the Book probably does not exist'.Every customer gets a royal treatment from the Book Sellers, particularly from the small stalls.  I recently went to buy a Book. One of the Shopkeeper searched for 15 minutes  in his stock, his neighbour's stock before giving up, but with a suggestion to go to a faraway shop to try.Rarely one would get such a service anywhere else."
College_Street_Boi_Para,SandeepSaha1967,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,Quest for memorabilia ends in partial success,"For used books on school subjects and professional courses, there could not be a more complete place than this. You can see people coming from remote parts of Bengal seeking that magic tome that would open up their or their child's career. But it's not a sellers market as hundreds of stalls via to sell you the book you want at the best price.My quest was entirely different. I have been feeling nostalgic about my school days and the books and magazines we grew up with. In an age of one television station or none, they were our lifeline, in particular the sports mags. I searched hard but was drowned by the cacophony of text book hawking. Finally, I found one chap on the pavement. He had only about 2 dozen Sportsworld's and Sportsar's of the mid 80's, none older than that. A bit of a let down but I was happy to collect 2 intact issues with yellowing pages that reminded me of the simpler and hero-worshipping times."

College_Street_Boi_Para,sumankar34,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,INVIGORATING PLACE," a place for bibliophiles and savants. a place which is humorously referred to as the place where u can find even original edition of Kautilya's Arthashastra. a place which, though not well organised, remains one of the best places to go in kolkata. the footpath is no more there as almost 70-80% of the path is taken over by the shops as regulations are made by govt for the sake of regulations and not for implementation. the contents of the shops have spilled over the footpath and there is spillage of crowds on to the road which typically leads to blockage of free flow of traffic. College street is also famous for the Coffee House, which makes every bengali sentimental, but is nothing of the past other than the fact that its place where substandard quality food and coffee is available at not very low prices and one is allowed to sit for as long as u can inhaling the huge amount of smoke, listening to the small talk and looking at the young carefree college goers enjoying their lives.
