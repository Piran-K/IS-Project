Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,ChakWalk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Highly recommend for shopping ,"I have been here multiple times since 1996. The place has a wide variety of shops and a few places to grab a small bite, and coffee or tea.The best aspect of this place is the shops carry sizes for tall women. And there are tailors on site that alter garments adequately and affordably.Watch the sizes, there is poor quality control so either try on the garment, take a measuring tape or a garment that fits so you can be sure of the size.I take a 44 in salwar pants and have found a pair every trip.Seams usually aren't serged so I will run a serging or zigzag stitch along the seams after I bring them home.Great place for handloom saris.Bathrooms fair. It was a little disturbing to see the window was not completely shielded. See photos. No soap for handwashing so bring some wipes or sanitizer.I could spend hours here. To do serious shopping, allow at least 3 hours."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Rishi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020 • Family,Nice,Good shops.. good collection.. there is a space for 4 wheeler parking for 25 odd cars but it's very congested.. cars are parked haphazardly hence difficult to take it out while leaving. There is very less space on the nearby roadsides as well for parking.
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Camel1161,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Good selection and variety and check out the women's cooperative.,In addition to the great shopping at Dakshinapan (and Dolly's tea) make sure to check out the building next door with the West Bengal Rural Women’s cooperative which is only a few months old but has some interesting products. There are many shops there with local handicrafts and very reasonable prices.

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Meera S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Value for money,"One of the amazing places to shop. There are plenty of both small and big shops. You'll find sarees, accessories, small and big artifacts, kurtas, terracotta idols etc.  They rarely bargain but Price are pretty reasonable. You need at least 3-4 hours or may be more to explore and shop."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Sounak Poddar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Shopping and Eating,"Great place to hang around, shop and eat. pretty reasonable rates and good quality of products under one roof is really great to witness."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Deepak DB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,State Govt Handloom/Handicraft Shops,"I had been to this shopping paradise a few years ago and had picked some exclusive art from the West Bengal Govt Handicraft Board shop Manjusha. I had a hard time recalling the name of this mall and finally got locals help to get there. Though Manjusha was no longer there all other state handloom and handicraft stores are still there. You really need to dig deep to get the good genuine stuff as now a days most of the shops have similar stuff whereas I usually seek to get the local flavor of the state. The prices in all the stores are fixed and almost all accept Master and Visa, not sure of Amex. The discounts too are all documented which makes it a good bet to buy from them rather than other stores which are open to negotiation. You could negotiate here too if you buying high cost or bulk, thought the discounts won't be too high as they are governed and audited stores.There is a private West Bengal art store Biswa Bangla which has some exclusive collection of art and traditional wear which was simply beautiful. The prices are bit higher but the collection is different and looks good quality.There are shops of local sellers too besides state emporium. Some eateries and good seating area for those who cannot manage all the standing and walking.There are washrooms there which are very average in terms of cleanliness."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,stantp1916,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Good for shopping or relaxing ,"One of the oldest shopping complexes of kolkata. Predominantly a garment and footwear market, it also has some good food stalls. But for people like me who don’t go for shopping there is a wide open area outside to sit and spend your time chatting with friends. Although this time I was sad to see they have cordoned off most of the seating space and left only a small area to sit idly "
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Padmini15,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Kolkata's First Mall!!,"I have been to this place since I was a teenager, a shopping complex which had all the state emporiums. During those days money didn't come by so easily and so going to Dakshinapan was indeed a grand affair. The place still has a life and a charm of its own. Colourful shops, displaying their wares (mostly privately owned now),starting from clothes,bed and bath linen, handicrafts, cane and wooden furniture, carpets, eateries and what not.Its a kind of open complex..the individual shops are air-conditioned but the whole area is not under a single roof .It's a must visit."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,shiju j,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Good collection of state emporiums,"Good place in Kolkata to shop with families from various State Emporiums. You can find good collections of textiles and handicrafts from Bengal, Orissa, Jammu, Andhra, North East, Khadi items, etc. Must visit Khadi shop by Govt. of India, Bengali shop on ground floor, Andhra shop on first floor for great buys."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Subrata N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Medicine Shop,"This is a good medicine shop in kolkata, dhakuriya.all type of medicine available here..I m very satisfied to buy medicine here.."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,PRRM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,traditional,one should expect traditional items of west bengal in there from various districts. bit pricey but peaceful to walk around.
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Chandreyi M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017,Fun place to shop!,I loved walking around all of the stores in Dakshinapan!  I love the fact you can buy authentic items from all the different states of India all in one place; the prices are not cheap but that is too be expected for authentic items.  There are regular items at reasonable prices as well.  Good place to pick up quality souvenirs. 
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,DianneR46,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,Lots of variety of clothing but perhaps a bit disappointing,Lots of vendors although ‘ much of the same ‘ in most stores. There are two more high end shops offering over priced ( for India) clothing and potential souvenir or gift items.Worth a visit if you can deal with Kolkata taxi drivers!
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,BhawaniPathania,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Business,Great choice of handloom stuff..,"This complex houses the handloom houses of practically all states. So, in one place you can browse through the Katha work of Bengal, bamboo artefacts of North east, Maheshwari of MP and Madhubani of Bihar...Also, if you like your tea, do visit the Dolly tea stall and select delectable array of Darjeeling Brew..."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,harshdawer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017,1980's style shopping experience,A shopping hub which takes you back in time when shops were shops and not boutiques and Showrooms . Look around maybe you may find a gem of an artifact or maybe some classic ethnic garment .
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Bajaboolie,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,Just ok for shopping,"We went here 9 years ago and feel that the shopping at the center has gone downhill since then. There are many shops from many regions. On a hot day, there isn’t much ac so can get hot. Dining options looked ok. Was sad to see Dolly’s tea house is gone as we loved that before. Probably wouldn’t go back as a tourist."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Ankur G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,An old school shopping complex of Kolkata,"This mall is elder to the others mentioned on the list and is a favourite meeting point for many Kolkatans. Its easier to reach for people from both the southern suburbs like New Garia/Sonarpur as the railways connect these places and also for people from Ballygunge to further in central Kolkata due to easy availability of public transport. Ths place is also a cultural venue due to the availability of Madhusudhan Mancha within the complex area which stages plays and music programs and even films. You won't find lifestyle brands but would get a taste of Indian handmade garments, room decorators and other utilities. It's an old-school shopping arena wherein the shopkeeper would directly interact and hand over products to check."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Prabir G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Good Place for Hangout and shopping,"Located next to Dhakuria bridge in South Kolkata,  this market complex provides one stop centre for shopping, eating cum hang out joint for young crowd and ladies in particular. Quite different from a modern shopping mall, this multi level open market houses various State Emporiums and clothing and fashion shops. At the ground level you can find choice of restaurants and bengali styled tea shops. The open structure is the style statement of the complex. At the entrance you will find a large open stepped arena which is popular hotshot for Hangout for students from Jadab our University. Next to the complex there is a theatre hall ( Madhu Sudan Mancha) which houses bengali thater and shows on a regular basis. Must visit."

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Papiya C,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Reached its used by date,This can be an awesome tourist attraction but alas like many things in Kolkata and West Bengal the charm eroded maybe two days after its opening?The place is unkept and when you approach the toilets from even 10 metres you can smell the strong smell of urine.Avoid the place if you can - which is such a shame as it does have some very interesting shops.
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Animesh Patra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Good unairconditioned Shopping Center under one roof but lost its charm,"Good shopping destination for affordable fashion wear under one roof . It is located in south Kolkata just near the Dhakuria flyover. Primarily caters to the middle class shopping but now it becomes expensive day by day, but quality wise the products are satisfactory. Various kinds of fashionable garment stores are there. Bargaining is a common practice. A couple of well decorated cafeterias are also present. . Great selection of indian clothing, kids wear, cosmetics, western wear, handicrafts, shoes etc. are available. This place is used to be a great happing place but nowadys lost its old charm. The whole area needs a good clean and  new paint. Professionalism is much more needed here. But which I like here which is a welcome change from the Brands and Mall type of shopping culture. Those who think it's a shopping mall, I must tell it's an unairconditioned big shopping complex, gathering so many individuals shops. Basically it's a  Indian wearing and accessories based shopping complex. Nice varieties of sarees, salwars are available..Bishwa Bangla is a good addition( but overpriced). Lots of shops selling local and state products.. Good atmosphere to hangout even if you are not there for serious shopping. Lots of government stores, expensive stuff. But you will still have choices and prices from smaller shops. Fare ranges from handicrafts to clothing.Various state emporium and private shops are present here. A good place to by Indian traditional garments and handicrafts.Parking place is available for a smaller amount of cars hence you have to wait in a long queue."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,JackSmithKS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Lost its charm,"This used to be a happing place but has lost its old charm. Bishwa Bangla is a good addition( but overpriced). Most of the emporiums are quite good. The whole area needs a good clean, new paint "
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,HwenTsang,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,Typical Bengali Shopping Complex,"Has a Typical Bengali Shopping Complex feel...which is a welcome change from the Brands and Mall type of shopping culture which is often stifling and ostentatious...Lots of shops selling local and state products...new addition is the West Bengal govt. flagship store of Bishwa Bangla...Sarees, Salwars, Jewellery, Arifacts et al....There is also Tourism office of Tamil Nadu and lots of Govt. shops of other states in India selling their local wares like those of Kerala, Orissa etc. One can bargain in the non-govt. shops...."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,IamTaani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Love love this place,"This place is a recent discovery and I already love it.

This complex has government Emporiam from all states from Uttar Pradesh to Tamil nadu and you can buy Saaris at very reasonable price. There are other small shops which sell latest trends in kurtas and at very reasonable price. They don't have trial rooms but they will alter the dress for you in 10 mins right there , price inclusive. I got a frock cut  kurta with pompoms for 650 rs. And there were lot if options to explore from. "

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Ellinor H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,Good place to shop ,"Good place to shop authentic Indian things that benefit communities. The shops range from charity establishments, a famous tea shop and regional shops."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,SunnyandBuster,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends, State emporiums ,We were able to find only a small variety of Bengali items though recommend you check out Biswa Bangla as good option for textiles. We found the lay out a challenge to find what we were looking for and there we other shops in addition to the state emporiums which was a bit confusing. I recommend the state emporiums ( you are unable to visit the majority of India) as the opportunity to see the richness and variety of Indian art and craft though so please do visit. 
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Aidan S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Shopping from all of India's states! ,This was one of my favorite shopping areas in Kolkata--each store within the complex features goods from the various states around India: kantha-stitched items from W. Bengal; beautiful jewelry from Orissa; teas and specially-woven tea towels from Assam; shawls from Kashmir; etc. 
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,samirganguli,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Marketing Spot ,"Dakshinapan, located in South Kolkata adjacent to the Dhakuria Bridge is a very good shopping spot for ladies. Spread over a very large expanse at different floors, one finds it quite relaxing to do shopping here. There is a wide variety of ladies clothing - pan Indian - at extremely reasonable prices. Both ready made as well as material are available - and the tailors are also situated right there in the complex. Outlets of most states of India are also located here with clothing of that state as well as a large variety of curio of these states. One has to wait for the yearly sales to take place, which normally occur during March April, when these curio are available at very good discounts. And, after a bout of marketing, if you are hungry or in a mood for a good cup of tea, it is right there. Coming out of the complex, one can avail buses and taxis right there. "
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Dhiraj H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,The essential destination for your souvenir purchases in Kolkata ,This shopping complex in South Kolkata has been our eternal favourite for all our shopping needs for souvenirs. The market is open till 8 PM daily except Sunday on which it is closed. Parking is limited and there is always a queue to park your cars. If you are driving and have a companion it makes sense for your parter to go in and start shopping while you find a parking space. The complex is spread over two floors. When you enter you see the new Biswa Banga outlets including one for the famous Bengal muslin. These outlets are the brain child of the current chief minister. Further on you have the celebrated Dolly's tea house. There are a number of shops selling Khadi tops at the entrance. The Kerala handicraft shop at the ground floor is decent. In the first floor our favourites are Purbashree the Assam handicraft outlets and the outlet selling Kashmiri handicrafts. The complex is rather untidy and stinks in some places specially the first floor.This complex is maintained well can be such a top class shopping destination in Kolkata. Where else can you get get handicraft and clothes from so many parts of India?
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Dino W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,The Mall culture of the 70s and 80s...taste of rustic homespun malls!!!,"Picture this...and we walked amidst the colorful..musical...variety loaded shops that have a unique zing which is so evident but only in this complex...Some may say it's like a mini India..some may say it's a smaller 'dummy version' of Delhi's dilli haat...What you find is a spectrum if I can say at this place...spectrum of food..spectrum of shops...spectrum of budget (that one can shell out) , spectrum of variety, spectrum of the kind of shoppers you see...wow now that's some spectrum loaded image I'm trying to paint:)All in all a place for those who like not just black or white but shades of grey and that's what I mean by spectrum...right from shorts to wrap around skirts and tops to sarees, suits, accessories...to food..to footwear...the stuff sounds a lot and believe me you...all this is available in a fairly small placeIf you are arty person who adores colors..wilderness and just so much variety then this is the place for you...this place has the propensity to get super crowded specially during pujo time of Kolkata and when some key theatre performances are happening (auditorium next to it so this place often is visited by artists, performers, theatre goers)The place has full potential to make big holes in your pocket :)...as you will surely be lured to pick up something or the other.There is a place dollys cafe which is an old gold tea shop run by Bengali women...you get teas of various kinds along with some bakery items (considering the sweet tooth that Kolkata has)...well you can't expect any 'cloak and dagger' confidential conversations here...haha as it's a small modest place for people to meet and chit chat...you will enjoy it for the feel of the place...but for many of us who wanna connect with someone through dialogues may find it difficult to concentrate:)...so it's a place to go and experience onceOne biggest drawback is the state of the washrooms....sigh!Do visit the shop called silence...its a shop where you will find accessories and items made from differently abled individuals...again creative arty hearts will enjoy this place and will perhaps walk out of the shop with something or the other in their shopping cart Quick tip....at the entrance of this place is a jewelry shop...for those who like accessories of different kinds..this is a must visit...Do visit the various state emporiums or shops...its good to see the handicrafts and artifacts from various parts of the country...As I sign off all I wanna say...this place is a shoppers delight...away from the malls...going back to the good old market days:)...its also a place where one can just perhaps go with a book and sit in a corner and let the energy of the place stir you as you read along ...or for any nomadic souls who just want to feel the place or any normal soul:) who just wants to go for a break...Lastly....being an al open place..summers is certainly not the right time to visit if chai...chat..and open air is your idea of chilling out..Have fun and happy shopping :)Dino and dodo"
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Aseem A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,"Good , can be better",Dakshinapan is a good idea of having all the state emporium under one roof. Beside state emporium it also houses dozens of small shops mostly selling ethnic wears. Presently the market is more a budget shopping destination then a cultural destination. It has lot of open space  and also houses Madhusudan manch where different cultural activities like plays etc are held. Parking is a problem but if you enter through backside(Jodhpur park) it is slightly better.
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Prabir G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Good open market with wide State Handloom Showrooms,"Located in Shakur is, in South Kolkata, this market opened late seventies.

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,wordsncolors,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,"Many products, one destination","First up, we were quite disappointed to see our favorite music store G55 gone! With no music and movies to buy, we walked around and picked up some stuff from a few of the state emporiums. The place looks and feels just the same after years, which was a good feeling. The shutter down business by 7pm latest is kind of a bummer though."

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Situatedness,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Solo,Big selection of shops from different Indian states,"Several Indian cities including Delhi have similar setups, where state run emporia sell typical clothes and craft products from their different states.  Calcutta's is quite central,  comprehensive  but compact,  and easy to access.  The model is a bit tired,  but it is a good place to get fixed price goods,  and there are some very high quality items along with a fair bit of tat. Don't miss Dolly's tea shop in the centre, which is truly a classic Anglo-Indian institution... "

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Sachin K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Nation's own Factory Outlet,"I call it India's own factory outlet. Reason being under one roof, one gets to see the handicrafts and art of all the states in India. Most amazing part of it is the kind of bargain on things which I really missed in Mumbai. Evenings are the best time to be at this place. Apart from shopping, right at the gate, there are kiosks waiting to treat you with amazing 'Puchka' (known as 'paani poori' in Mumbai and 'gol gappe' in Delhi) and 'Aloor Dum'(potatoes cooked in oil with a thick yet not overwhelming amount of gravy made of cumin, ginger, onion and other spices). Overall, a decent, simple and a must visit spot in South Kolkata."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Nightshade00,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,Interesting variety of Indian handicrafts,"Not the easiest to locate by taxi, but well worth the effort. This is an open-air complex, and most shops are not air-conditioned, so it can get pretty hot and sweaty while shopping. Great place to view and purchase interesting and reasonably priced handicrafts from all over India. One of the store managers explained to us that the sale proceeds go back to the villages in which the handicrafts are made.Dolly's is a nice place for some iced tea when you need a break from all the shopping."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Mario1547,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Excellent hassle free shopping,Forget about New Market. This shopping complex is lined with state emporiums from all over India. Most prices are fixed and you don't have to struggle with touts and high commissions. Prices are reasonable. Bring cash as most stores only take cash and there is no ATM in the complex. 
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Journey to the heart of the earth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,Proper Kolkatan shopping,"I had not been to Dakshinapan for years and then popped in for a delightful afternoon last October whilst visiting family.The big malls are no competition in my eyes for traditional places like this. Reasonably priced, colourful, traditional styles- a feast of Indian shopping. They have fixed prices, so no haggling nowadays but that makes for relaxed shopping. There are state emporiums from all over India so this is like a mini India tour under one roof.I especially loved the printed cottons and handlooms. Elegant, colourful and very wearable. The colours are holding fast till now.My only regret was going on a public holiday when many shops were closed. I intend to make up for that this year!"

Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Avatima,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,The original market complex with a lot of free space,"Long before supermarkets and malls came up in this part of the country, this shopping complex was set up in what was then a bus garage. The shopping complex currently houses emporiums of many state handloom and craft organisations and offer outstanding choices of sarees and curios across shops. It also has a few decent eateries, shoe showrooms and regular wear shops in the ground floor. The biggest attraction for the local youth is the free space to roam, chat and spend time in the open air of the complex.Though there is a reasonable space for parking, the entry and exit of the parking can be improved."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,RudraPalash,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,Indian handicrafts and handlooms at its finest!,"This is one place where you get products from almost all states in India. It is a two storied-complex housing Govt emporiums representing each state in India. You get handicrafts, decoration pieces as well as saris and other outfits. I have always found good choices for gifts from these emporiums. Emporiums such as Lepakshi and Mriganayani are  outstanding for brass handicrafts and so are some of the other emporiums. Kashmir emporium dazzles you with wood handicrafts. Uttar Pradesh stores used to have a fine collection of brass items but unfortunately they have discontinued the brass items. Prices may be a little on the higher side but you are spoilt for choices. A lot of these emporiums also carry household items such as bedcovers, rugs, brass lamps and shades, fancy jewellery, paintings as well as silks and handloom items from that state. Dakshinapan has a lot Khadi stores, shoe stores and 'Silence' which sells items made by differently abled people. Recently, Bengal's emporium 'Manjusha' has been remodelled to Biswa Bangla store which houses Bengal items but they are very expensive. It has regular stalls for clothing which are usually less pricey. Emporiums are fixed price shops but sometimes they run discounts. What Dakshinapan lacks, after a tired day of shopping, is a decent, hygenic food court. You can get tea from various states of India at Dolly's as well as have a quick bite there. There are rows of tailors available to quickly alter your kameez, skirts etc. which you just purchased. Unfortunately, Dakshinapan does not have lifts and you will have to climb up the stairs making the second story unavailable for wheel chair bound elders."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,haimanti p,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Reasonable price,"Very good shopping experience in reasonable rate. On a very crowded day one can shop happily because the place is big enough to accommodate a lot of people. Many of the shops are government handloom shops and therefore they sale goods at a reasonable rate. This complex has many shops and a big collection of saris, cloth materials, readymade wear for both men and women, handicrafts and other household items with a great variety. I suggest tourists to have a hastle free shopping experience here "
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Ashmita12,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Family,Amazing shopping experience!,"I love this place for the variety that it offers. Amazing products, from all over India, under one roof! The prices are sometimes a little steep, however its still worth... Must try this shopping place. PS I also love the street food available just outside this shopping complex."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Dipeeta D Mukherjee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Solo,Good place to hang out and little bit of shopping,"When it started years back, shops in Dakshinapan offered varieties with reasonable pricing. However, with passage of time, it has become a hanging out place for sections of the community, and the shops therein charge little bit extra than the Gariahat market, which is so close (two bus-stops away). If I want to purchase fancy items, I'd rather go to South City, which is nearby too. "
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,rashmib53,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Under one roof,"Dakshinapan shopping complex is a sprawling places having showrooms of all the states where one can buy authentic products at fixed prices. Besides the showrooms it has numerous shops selling readymade garments at reasonable rates, many khadi outlets, Khadim showroom, and Silence, the store where things made by differently-abled persons who are trained at their center are sold thus making them self sufficient. There are vast open terraces for kids to play, eating joint etc. Tea at Dolly's rounds everything off perfectly!"
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,wjtourism,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Couples,Excellent experience for a good cause,"We went to the Dakshinapan market in Kolkata where a number of state governments provide opportunities to purchase handicrafts and weaving. Noteworthy was the Silence store which is managed by and for people with disadvantages. A new operation called Biswa Banola which is an initiative of the government of West Bengal is fantastic. Very much worth a visit. Beautiful products, knowledgeable staff and great presentation."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,anupam b,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Family,You will get maximum Indian state products,This is one of the largest market in Dhakuria area.you will find so many states stores here . specially hand loomlooms.if you look for Indian gifts you can come here specially for ladies sarees. .suits. 
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Anwesha D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2014 • Family,Its truly Made in India,"All ethnic stuffs from dress materials to sofa sets are available here and that too for rates which can make any shopaholic go weak in his/her knees. And there are shops representing different parts of India. For example, Assam emporium has wonderful varieties of traditional muga silk sarees (the cost is high but that is quite justifiable; it's exceptionally genuine.) Here, there is everything for everyone in your family. A must visit place for foreigners looking for unique Indian dresses/jewelry/artwork at very reasonable rates. I got a beautiful rajasthan styled plazo for Rs 300. Quite amazing.There is a parking lot too. So, you can literally shop till you drop!"
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,SJasmineG,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Business,Best place to shop for authentic Indian Artisan souvenirs,"As a regular traveler to Kolkata, this is my favourite place for shopping. Shops are government run and each state of India is represented. Its a great place to purchase authentic, quality artisan crafts, gifts, textiles etc.  It's an open air complex. The architecture is somewhat grim but don't let that put you off going there. If you want to buy some really nice Indian items, this is definitely the place to go. The prices are fixed so there is no haggling, or at least, not much. There are restaurants here so you can eat and shop as well.By now, I've probably purchased gifts from most of the shops here, my favourites being the Rajasthan, Kashmir and West Bengal shops. But they are all wonderful and prices are reasonable. In addition, there are numerous shops selling just Indian clothes and shoes.  I really want to give a shout out to a small souvenir shop called Silence. This is a store that sells a wonderful array of gifts, the proceeds of which go to help the blind and disabled craftsmen. Definitely check that place out."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Jean G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Family,India in microcosm,"This shopping centre features crafts from around India - each of the states (or certainly, many of them) is represented here with eg a Kashmir shop, etc etc..  If you want the chance to stock up on gifts to take home, this is a good 'one stop' place to do it, though the centre is a little difficult to find.  We had to work quite hard to convince our driver that this was where we wanted to go, rather than to the modern centre which features Armani and Louis Vuitton!"
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,ashmdsKualaLumpur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Couples,Good for variety,the most unique part of the shopping complex is that we saw shops representing various states of india. The idea is great and most of the shops are selling traditional clothes and antiques pieces. A lot of variety to chose from these shops. We purchased lot of bedding stuff from maharashtra shop and few clothes from west bengal shop. Only disadvantage is that one cannot expect a air-conditioned mall types shopping. otherwise the place is very good and there are few eateries to fill the stomach.
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,TariqTabib,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Best Shopping Complex,"Dakshinapan Shopping Complex, an open air shopping center which has got two floors with a beautiful courtyard in the center is little out of the way, but it's an excellent place to buy traditional Indian artifacts. You will find many Indian state-run emporiums here, stocked with fixed price goods from all over India which sells mostly hand-loom and handicraft products. Apart from these there are also many privately owned shops which sell foot wear, ethnic dresses as well as dress.The prices are also reasonably very cheap. There’s plenty of tack but many shops offer excellent-value souvenirs, crafts and fabrics.Dakshinapan remains open from Monday to Saturday from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm. Remember, you must take time to visit this shopping complex."
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,Tom R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Great for cheap handmade Indian products,This is the place to go in Kolkata for handmade Indian products from each of the different regions. Being government run also means that you aren't hassled constantly by touts vying for your business.Try Dolly's tea shop.
Dakshinapan_Shopping_Complex,ManaseeSoman,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,IDEAL FOR VERY INDIAN PRODUCTS...,"Dakshinapan shopping complex is located at the southern end of Dhakuria overbridge..It has state emporiums of the home state i.e. west bengal and many other indian states - odisha, andra pradesh, punjab, uttar pradesh, tamil nadu, rajasthan, gujarat, kashmir, madhya pradesh and state emporiums of north eastern states. its a good place to shop for bengali cotton sarees (basak, adi tangial, handloom house and tantuja) as well as for silk sarees (resham shilpi and others). exclusive madhubani sarees can be bought from central government's handloom house and exclusive munga, pati and mekhala sarees can be bought from the assam and purbanchal state emporiums. The Madhya Pradesh State Emporium (Mriganayanee) has sarees and dress materials (but they are expensive) along with furniture, a wide range of furnishings, lovely notepads and folders, including lovely colourful cotton carpets, bell metal art, kurtas and other knick knacks..The AP state emporium (Lepakshi) sells sarees, dress materials, jewellery and other knick knacks...Visit Lepakshi for exclusive ikkat bedsheets... They are expensive but worth the price. Cane furniture is sold in many shops but the best is in the WB state emporium and in the emporiums of the north eastern states. The WB state emporium also sells the traditional bengal artifacts like pata chitras, handicrafts made from shells, bell metal and exclusive stone cravings. There are also two good shops not belonging to any particular state emporium, but belonging to the artists syndicate.. One is Aranya (on the 1st floor - close to the kashmir emporium) and the another is karigar lane (also on the 1st floor - near lepakshi) Both these shops sell small items like ethnic jewellery, lamp shades and other knick knacks made from cotton and papers. The Kashmir emporium is full of quality products but the range is high.  The is also one shop named SILENCE on the ground floor which sells items like jewellery, candles, lampshades, etc which are made by the physically challenged persons.There is no good restaurant in this shopping complex. BUT DOLLY's TEA SHOP can certainly quench the thirst of thirsty shoppers with its exclusive iced teas and snacks. Its on the ground floor - opposite the gujrat emporium (Gurjari) - just in case, you miss it, because the place doesnt look like a tea shop n the first place.  Reach Dakshinapan by 11 am and you will be happily busy till 4 pm... The shops in this shopping complex work only till 4 m on saturdays, so bear that in mind. Dakshinapan Complex is a good place for shoppers from outside Kolkata - who want maximum variety in less time. All the items in this complex - right from furniture to trinkets - are soaked in the local Indian flavour. This complex has no shops selling branded stuff."
