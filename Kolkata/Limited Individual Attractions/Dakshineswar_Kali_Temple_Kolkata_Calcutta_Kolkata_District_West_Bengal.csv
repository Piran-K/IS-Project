Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,SubhankarAD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Huge Cosmic Energy flowing at this place,"Mobiles and footwear not allowed, hence better to leave them in your car or any shop at the 'Dala arcade', from where you buy dala or offerings for Kali Maa. Security is now strict and people then have to queue up to enter the temple premises. Once we enter the temple our mind changes to go up in sync to the Energy, left behind by the many eminent monks that continuously stayed/visited this place. They include Ramakrishna, Bijoykrishno, Vivekananda amongst others. Initially there will be Radha Krishna temple on our left, then the main Kali temple. There are two queues to have darshan of Kali Maa. Better to take the one that sees Maa from the front. On reaching Maa face to face, need to keep eyes open and take in everything. Darshan will be short unless one is a vip. Next come down and from the 'Natmandir' (now under renovation) sit, close your eyes and speak with Kali Maa whatever you wish to. There are 12 Shiv lingas besides the Ganga. Before or after visiting them, have a wash in the cool waters of the Ganga. There is also the room where Ramkrishna Paramhansa stayed. It is a must visit as this is the room great men visited and great teachings/discussions took place. Next to visit is Sarada Maa's home. Also need to visit 'Panchabati' where SRi Ramkrishna had meditated."
Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,K. Srinivasa Rao,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 • Couples,A divine experience - a visit to Dakshineshwar,"Divine experience  - Maa kali temple at Dakshineshwar is a highly revered holy place to visit. Despite lingering fear of coronavirus, the abode of Maa Kali is administered well with separate counter for depositing mobiles and shoes. When you enter the precincts, you will fond to your left crowded offices housing shoe and mobile deposit facility. There is orderliness in queue formation in general for both activities. Even carry bags can be deposited. These are prepaid counters and hence you should hold coins or small denomination currency note to avoid delay to others in queue. Once you deposit them, to your left is a passage to enter the shrine. Ladies and gents are separated near the entry point for security check. Announcements are made in Bengali, Hindi and English about Covid protocols. After entering the temple, the main Maa Kali temple building is the middle  tall one with multiple temple architectures  commonly found in these parts of India. There 3 queues for Darshan - two for having darshan straight and one where Maa Kali is visible from the side. Stand in  the queue and your turn will come. Have darshan peacefully, pray while waiting for your turn. You cannot get to see the deity for a long duration due to people waiting after you. As a devotee we should cooperate. Not much offerings are allowed but who ever brings prasad offering, the priests are nice to return major portions back to devotees. Walk back and can have darshan of 12 Lord Shiva lingas lined up opposite the temple on the banks of holy river ganga. There is temple of Lord Krishna next to the main building. There is a building facing the main temple for devotees to wait, pray and meditate. One can even take bath in Ganga and then have darshan. There is no pushing and over crowding. One can have darshan at their own pace. Once you exit temple building you can reach the same building where mobiles and shoes were deposited. One should visit the shops lined up selling eatables and temple related items. Trade and commerce thrives near temples and we should ensure that their business and livelihood too is important. Do your bit by buying some items as a memory of visit to Dakshineshwar Maa Kali shrine. The experience is indeed divine and people cooperating with one another is worth emulating. A must visit shrine when in Kolkatta."
Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,gpradeepshenoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Solo,Good temple,The easiest way to reach Dakshineswar temple is through metro. From exit of Dakshineswar metro station take skywalk to reach this temple. The walk from exit of metro station will be about 7-10 minutes. Footwears and mobile must be deposited (two seperate counters) at counters near entrance of temple for a small charge of Rs 3. When I visited the temple it was under renovation. Since the crowd was very less i got darshan of Godess very fast. When it rains the places inside this temple become very slippery. I saw a few people sliping and falling down because they were walking fast. So be careful.Just near this temple flows Hooghly river.After visiting this temple do go the banks of Hooghly river too.A must visit place in kolkata.

Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,KennethEast,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,An unusual experience,"This is a major pilgrimage site for Hindus.  The complex has a major temple that houses a revered incarnation of the goddess Kali.  That's what the pilgrims come to see.  Our group of four visited with a guide.  Frankly, without her I doubt we'd have had the steel to force our way into the crushing queue to get a glimpse of the shrine.  Our guide practically pulled us behind her into the throng--trying to keep us together and moving forward. It was insane but also oddly exhilarating. In a country where men and women don't even line up together at airports, they were together here in much more intimate circumstances.Keepers of the shrine kept people moving.  They had a challenge indeed.  On their way out of the shrine, some pilgrims prostrated themselves on the stairs in worship.  It's a miracle no one was crushed by the others who were being forced to descend the stairs below the shrine by the crowds behind them.  All this on a weekday afternoon visit! I can't imagine what it would be like on a busy weekend.After we survived the ""main course"", we had a relaxed walk around the dozen smaller auxiliary temples in the complex.  It's an appealing complex to look at.  But that's not what I'll remember.  I can still feel my heart racing as we pushed and shoved our way through the crowds to catch a view of a shrine that meant so much to so many around us."

Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,Bimal0401,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Divine Place of worship.,"Reached Howrah by Jan Shatabdi Express at 13.30 hrs. Since I have to board flight to Mumbai at 22:25 hrs,  I was having ample time to visit my paces of interest at Kolkata.Whenever I am at Kolkata, I love to visit two places viz. Belur Math and Dakshineshwar Kali Temple.  Since I had visited Belur Math twice/Thrice on my last visits, I had a strong desire to visit Dakshineshwar Kali Temple. Accordingly, booked Car and reached the Temple. After depositing Mobile phone, Luggage and Shoe against token at nominated counter, entered the temple.My first interest was to visit the Room of the Ramakrishna Paramhansa. The room in which Shri Shri Ramakrisha Dev use to live is in the vicinity of the temple itself. The room is kept as it is for the DARSHN for the devotees. On entering the said room, observed unique piece and highly positive vibrations. The devotees were entering to the room and  bow down to the portrait of Shri Shri Ramakrishna Dev kept on the  Chowkey (Bed) and sit for a while doing meditation etc. The atmosphere there at found pious and charged. Thereafter, I had visited the Kali ma Temple which is also a unique place.  There was a long queue to visit the main temple. On spending few minutes in the temple, roam around the temple and have a sun set view from the Ghat (Bank of the river Hubli/Ganga.)This to be added that in my earlier visits say during 1980-1990s, the vicinity of the temple was completely congested by the local vendors selling Pooja Materials etc. There was a complete chaos as regards to cleanliness. However, in my this visit,  to the surprise, it has observed that the all the local vendors are accommodated in the permanent structure opposite the temple and the entire area of the temple is kept very neat and clean. It may be noted that though the temple administration has no where displayed the charges for depositing Luggage, Mobile and other Valuables, Shoes, the person at counters ask one to pay the charges.The  Dakshineshwar temple is highly recommended  and must  visit place in  Kolkata."

Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,prashant_newaskar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Dakshineswar Kali Temple,"Dakshineswar Kali Temple:One of the most majestic attractions in Kolkata is the Dakshineswar Kali temple. It is also a place of pilgrimage for the devotees and place of beauty for all.It is quite interesting how the temple got constructed. The temple was built by Rani Rashmoni who was apparently quite rich. She wanted to go to Benaras on a pilgrimage in a caravan of 24 boats. One night before her departure Goddess Kali appeared in her dream and said you don’t need to go to Benaras. You can build a temple for me on the banks of Ganges and I will appear there.She cancelled her Benaras trip, bought 30,000 acres of land (massive) including 20 acres from an Englishman. After many years of construction the temple was inaugurated on 31 May 1855. Its first priest was Ramkumar Chattopadhyay. After Ramkumar’s death a year later, his younger Brother took over as the priest. That priest became the world renowned Ramkrishna Paramhans. The temple consists of the main building 46 feet x 46 feet - 100 feet tall with eleven spires. The Deity is called “Bhavatarini Kali”There is large courtyard around the temple which has 12 Shivlingas. There is also a Radha Krishna Temple. By the side of the temple is the Ghat by the side of river Ganga..The temple is built in “Bengal Style” of architecture. It’s a truly impressive structure. If the temple complex could be kept spotlessly clean, it would increase its magnetism many times over..The whole area Dakshineswar- Belur Math can truly become an eye pleasing soul satisfying (for the devotees) tourist hub if developed with passion and vision.."

It’s an unbelievable feeling once you are there in the temple premises. It’s always advisable to plan early and go early in morning. We went on a Friday morning at 8 am. There was hardly any crowd and we had a wonderful Darshan of Maa Kali. We had planned to visit Ada peeth by 10 as the Aarti starts there at 10.30 am. Well a wonderful experience.The only thing that has changed over years is more security and blockage of mobile ph cameras inside the temple, I personally don’t like it and wish the system changes on this aspect.

Huge building of Kali mata, Routine average crowd and queue, approximately 10-15 minute in queue. Simple temple. People takes bath at river Hoogly/Ganga shore, the water was dirty. We didn't taked bath. There are twelve small temple of Shiva in row in front of Kali temple in the same premises. Wallet, belt, shoes, mobile, purse etc not allowed inside the temple, there are paid locker facility is there for the luggage with nominal 20-30 rs charges. Spare approximately one hour to visit the place, but you will require more time to reach the temple in traffic as it is in congested area."
Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,rggg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Peaceful !!,We went early in the morning. Temple opens at 5 am...we went at around 7 am. There wasn't any crowd. It was a quick darshan. There's no menace of 'dalas and pandas' in this temple. Temple is big. There are 12 shivlings... all alike...all have small temple to themselves. We had a flight to catch otherwise would have spent more time here. Try to go in the morning to avoid the crowd and feel the peace which temple offers.

Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,Kunal Ahuja,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Visited first time,"It was a crowded place, people were breaking the lines to go and take the blessings of Kaali Mata, and the cue was going on increasing. So there were some people roaming there who ask for some money for giving people VIP entry directly inside without waiting. And then too when we take the special entry people are pushing each other and breaking the line for getting out. It's located inside a lane and many small outlets are there beside them like to buy sindoor, photos of God's, books, Bangles, bangali sweets. N many pandits roam behind people for doing this or that type of Pooja. Don't ever believe or trust them. They just want to manipulate people and bribe money from them. They think that they are God. Don't ever come into their talks. Nothing happens. Just prey to God whichever you believe in. Remember P.K movie of Aamir Khan. It's the same."
Dakshineswar_Kali_Temple,Sujit C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,An Amazing Visit to Dakshineswar kali Temple!,"After initial hiccups, I finally managed early morning of Nov 24th., 2019 for darshan of Dakshineswar Kali Ma's temple from Belur where I had entrenched myself for attending one of my childhood friends Son. The Steamer (Ferry) experience from Belur Math to Dakshineswar on the early morning hours was amazing. Also there is a provision to walk down on the Skywalk which connects right upto the temple premise, but for older people it could be quite tiring. Hence, early morning Steamer / Ferry ride is much more pleasant and enjoyable. The Steamers start right from 7:00 AM and available every half an hour interval and just a paulty fare of Rs. 22.00 (To & Fro). Also, please remember, steamers are available from Hooghly,  and other Ghats in Kolkata, so kindly check the availability from other places. Start early, when you don't expect too much of rush, and avoid if possible on weekends, i.e., Saturdays and Sundays!!! Huge number of devotees visit on the weekends and it's quite a mayhem as usual at all religious places in India. Inside the temple premises there is a Bazar from where you can get all items for offering, though I generally avoid such rituals.  To have a glimpse of the main Maa Goddess Kali enter from the extreme right, may be there could be ques, so standing for few jealous minutes could be worrisome and a botheration if it's sunny and hot in the open. There are three Temples side by side and 12 Shiva Linga temples on the opposite side. The middle temple is that of Maa Kali!!It's was a wonderfilled experience, quite overwhelming, in an serene atmosphere. Clean and tidy. If anyone intends to offer private Puja then he or she may do so, but then you have to contact their office for a priest before 9:30 AM. for performing the religious discourse."

A couple of things - going into the temple proper is a bit of a hassle, and shooting inside the temple is not permitted. Also - beware of the monkeys! They are big. They can be vicious!I have read some reviews stating that the best place to shoot the temple is from across the river - and I, in hindsight, would agree. Maybe the next time I'd do just that!"

It was a marvel to watch in the moonlit night."
