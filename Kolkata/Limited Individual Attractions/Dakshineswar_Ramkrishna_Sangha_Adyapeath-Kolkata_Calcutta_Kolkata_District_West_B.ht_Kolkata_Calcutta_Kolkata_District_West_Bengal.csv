At the main alter also, there is Sri Sri Ramakrishna at the bottom, the Godess Kali, (exact replica of the idol found by Sri Sri Annada Thakur) in the middle and Radha-Krishna at the top, one mounted on the other, and encircled with the symbol of ""OM"".Symbolically, the temple bears the Trident of Lord Siva, the Moon and the Star of the Muslims, the Cross of the Christians and the Fan of the Buddhists. Remarkable mark of religious tolerance, establishing God as One for all.The temple has extensive infrastructure and philanthropic missions. Large number of visitors are provided with full meal as 'prasad', in an orderly way. The temple opens only during the regulated hours. Therefore, for a visit, have to adhere to the stipulated timings.There are variety of shops just outside the temple complex, and enough space inside for car parking. Only had hoped that the upkeep of the complex would improve over the years. The car park and the walkways could be paved for more hygienic ambience."

The distance from Dakshineshwar kali temple is about 1.2 Km and 10 minutes by toto (battery operated taxies) for 10 rupees or by bicycle rickshaws which will cost 20 Indian rupees which is situated in DD Mondal ghat road. The main alter in temple takes a very unusual configuration three alters one atop the other Sri Ramakrishna at the bottom, then Mother Kali made of 8 metals in the middle and on the top alter murthis of Radha & Krishna known all over India as a divine couple. The main alter is open only between 10.30 to 11.30 a.m. and 6.30 to 7.30 p.m. Temple is open on 52 days of the year on specific days. So check the timings before visiting the temple. This is one the reasons why it’s not popular among non- Indians but it’s worth the visit if your religious minded even if you’re a non-Hindu.Tips for visitors: this is a holy place. So your dress code must be strictly maintained. No short trousers or skirts.no wearing footwear inside the temple and a counter is there for few rupees to keep your footwear safe.do not take photos inside temple and permission is needed from authorities to take any photos even on non-temple areas. Respect the rules set by the temple. They do a lot of charitable work helping the poor (see their website) and you can give a donation according to your means if you like to the office and collect a receipt. Do not forget to visit Dakshineshwar Kali temple which is world famous and situated only 1.2Km away.Good luck on you visit and may Mother Kali who has a great power over Kolkata bless you even if you’re not a Hindu."
