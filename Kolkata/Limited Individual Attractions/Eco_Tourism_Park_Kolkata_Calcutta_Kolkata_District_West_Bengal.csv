Eco_Tourism_Park,Beulah K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Good to visit.,"Experience inside was good, tickets timmings should be made earlier,people arrive early but tickets are issued only at 11am, too hot, seating arrangements should be made for people who arrive early, no display boards, security not knowing anything, very confusing where to book tickets where to go for rides, more display boards needed.

Eco_Tourism_Park,PaesFerns,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Best Park in Kolkata for an outing with a child,"Amidst the crowds, dust and pollution of Kolkata, the Eco-Park feels like a green soothing oasis. Cool winds from its lake offer some reprieve from the oppressive heat of the city. It is good for an outing but not on the weekend- when it can get crowded.Services are average and some are broken down. Toilets are not the cleanest. Go for a one time experience"

Eco_Tourism_Park,Dyena Mugen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Family,A pleasant surprise at the Eco Park!,"Eco Park is certainly a wonderful place to spend the day with the family. Probably better to visit in the late afternoon when it is less humid. We visited the 7 wonders of the world with our young children and found it to be a nice evening stroll as we imagined ourselves travelling around the world to see these UNESCO heritage sites. The surrounding offers some green space with some play equipment for the children. There were a few carts and shops that offer food and drinks. The toilets were gross so be prepared to bring toilet paper and lots of hand hand sanitiser. The park is huge, we didn’t get to see the butterfly park, toy train, cycling and many more other activities that were available there."

Eco_Tourism_Park,Payel,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Arijit Singh Concert at Eco Park by Mitali Sangha & Other Sponsors on 2nd Feb,Very poorly handled programme. Cost of the tickets are so high however programme arrangement is as such cattle ground scenario. In case of Silver segment also flat seating arrangements done. People standing anywhere and everywhere.If you manage to get hold of a seat also then you are unlucky as people in front of you will keep on standing. All volunteers & police men are literally avoiding any intervention due to chaos! Worst handled programme ever witnessed! No responsibility of the management other than only squeezing money from audience in the name of Arijit Singh.Arijit Singh ...you should also take a note if this how your programme is mis-handled and hard earned money of common people are wasted!

Eco_Tourism_Park,atulya_sinha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,KOLKATA’S OWN EIFFEL TOWER,"Re-visiting Eco Park after a gap of four years, my wife and I were amazed to see the new developments that have taken place. Apart from the infrastructure, the upkeep and cleanliness were far beyond our expectations. We entered from Gate no.1, having crossed one of the largest parking lots in the city. The tickets at Rs. 30/- per head seemed a bit steep, but as soon as we entered the Park we told each other that the rate was justified. As we took the curved path along the lake, our first impression was that the lawns were maintained very well. Many visitors were seated on the cast iron benches facing the lake, while the more active ones were boating or riding tandem bicycles. We soon came across a Japanese Garden, with a pagoda and restaurant – which we did not enter, as we were keen to see the rest of the park. A little later, we found ourselves in front of a miniature Eiffel Tower. We could not resist the temptation to take the elevator to the first floor of the little Tower, where we got excellent views of the lake on one side and the green belt on the other side. We continued walking along the path, till we came to the island resort and the guard told us that we had reached the end of the Park. We retraced our steps and took a coffee break at Ajante Café. The ambience was warm and welcoming and the staff were very courteous, but they tested our patience by taking about  forty minutes to serve a plate of chili toast and two cups of coffee. By the time we left the café, it was getting dark, but we continued walking along the lake. We came across the jetty meant for boating and also saw the toy train; apart from a Bengali Village, the Artist Cottage, many life size sculptures of sportspersons, a musical fountain, a herbal garden, a wide choice of restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets, and many other attractions. By then we were quite tired and we exited from Gate no. 3 to find a great choice of sweets at Mishti Hub. Driving along the boundary of the Park, we realized that we had seen only one of the miniature  monuments inside. The others – including Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids and Christ the Redeemer – were all clustered together at the north end. A good reason to visit the Park again very soon!To conclude, your point of entry should be decided by what you intend to do. If you want to take a leisurely walk in the least crowded part of the Park and see just the Japanese Garden and Eiffel Tower, enter at the southern end from Gate no. 1, as we did. If you want to go boating or cycling, it would be best to enter from Gate nos. 2 or 3. Finally, if you want to brave the crowds and see miniature versions of the Seven Wonders (but excluding the Eiffel Tower), you should enter from the north, i.e. Gate nos. 4 or 5."

NO GUARDS in the water,only one irresponsible person struggling to release boats in the lake, and nobody helped two ladies stuck in the water. The driver of motor boat said he could not stop his boat, even if the paddle boat drowns. They even do not help in parking the boats.

Thought process behind the development is commendable and well maintained park. But the fun is ruined with huge crowd, most of them were shouting at their high volume without any reason, some have got stereos which were on their full volume and passage of remarks to other visitors. Would be better if some monitoring happens inside to control the loud shouting, unnecessary volume of music system. Presence of considerable number of police personnel will help to stop passing remarks by some visitors and enjoyment of the space by others. General security is good and did not feel any issue."

Eco_Tourism_Park,Natalie1204,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Awesome open space ,"The park is vast and very well maintained. It’s one of the cleanest places in the city and one of the few that imposes a fine for littering. If you plan to go to a particular spot in the park, check with gate is closest as it can be quite a walk. There are lots of activities like Zorbing, cycling etc or you can simply walk. The seven wonders, water fountains, lake, little cottages are lovely to see and walk by. The canteen is nice too as are the little eateries and restaurants. There is a recently opened Mini golf course and training academy opened too. Indoor skating is also an option. "

A general ticket is only INR30, but that won't allow you into the 7 wonders section. A good place to go for a run or to get away from the noisy city. Note its usually only open from the afternoon."

Eco_Tourism_Park,ShikshaC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Well maintained and huge…,"I visited Eco park on Friday towards the evening and there were several people already waiting in queue. We entered through gate 4 and visited the Wonders of world area. The park already has an entrance ticket and then you need to pay extra to visit the wonders which is very confusing. They should have informed about the charges at entry only. The park is  located in a huge area and is divided into different zones like rose garden, mask garden, tea garden, etc. In the centre it has a lake where musical fountains are operated during evenings. The washrooms even though paid are not at all maintained which was a huge disappointment. It will take a full day to cover this place. "

Eco_Tourism_Park,wanderer2174,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,A delightful one day picnic,"Eco Park was a nice surprise in Kolkata. They have lots of theme areas within the park and its an enjoyable park , if the weather is good. We travelled in a nice weather and the park was teeming with visitors. Preferably visit the park on weekdays as the crowd is a lot on weekends and it becomes little difficult to navigate around.There are golf carts for senior citizens which are absolutely not available on weekends as they are very less in number compared to the crowd. We stood in line for nearly an hour and there was no word when will be get the cart..the officials would not give any information on anything.I wish there was an information booth for tourists like us who would have questions. The other problem was the language. The officials could not answer any question as probably they only understand Bangla..so there was lot of chaos actually as we were traveling with senior citizens. Finally we put them on the AC mini train which goes around the exhibits but this train didn't cover the seven wonders of the world which has been put up near Gate D..For ppl who can walk, its a walk of about 4-5 kms and one can cover everything.. So absolutely avoid weekends and enjoy the park !!!"

Eco_Tourism_Park,Zinia F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Nice for an afternoon or so,Went out with family friends...the area is vast and would require a day (I mean 24 hours) or two to cover..Gutted as we couldn't explore as much as we were late arriving and they were announcing for closure in the mic.
Eco_Tourism_Park,Bobby,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Awesome place to spend your day,"Ecopark is located in Rajarhat very close to City Centre 2. Entry is reasonably priced at Rs 30 each. Parking is Rs 20 for bikes and 100 for cars. It is best to enter from gate no 2 if you want to take the electric car or the toy train as the only booking counter is located there. The park is huge with an awesome water body adding to the beauty. Replicas of Eiffel tower,  Taj Mahal and Leaning Tower of Pisa give the shutterbugs lots of time to spend. The rose garden is beautiful. Bumping cars in the pond is another new thing to see. Food options are very limited and disappointing although you are allowed to carry your own food inside. The park is closed on Mondays."
Eco_Tourism_Park,Sandipan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Great place,"It is located in the Newtown area, which is well connected with public transport.
