It's a shame as the fort plays an important part in the history of Kolkata and it would be good if the army itself set up times regular daily tours which people can pay for.

This structure is actually located on the ramparts of Fort William.It got its name much later when Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener, the 1st Earl Kitchener, occupied it during his tenure as the commander in chief between 1902 and 1909. He was one of the most celebrated officers to have taken over as commander in chief. When he arrived in India, he was already famous as Lord Kitchener of Khartoum.

Fort_William,Clive F,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Solo,If only one could visit it!,"Both at Union and State level India purports to encourage tourism, which makes it even more frustrating that so often it fails to exploit gems in Government possession which could be popular attractions bringing in high-spending visitors.  Of course the obsession with 'security' provides an excuse for denying access to this large complex containing a significant number of attractive and historical buildings.  I'm quite sure that the Indian Army's Eastern Command could function perfectly well, and safely, even if access were granted to much of Fort William.  But I'm not living in hope, so remaining limited to looking at the exterior, which although interesting enough in itself is nothing compared with the gems that exist behind the wire.Oops, sorry; am I even supposed to know that it is a Command Headquarters?"

We walked more than KM to reach the museum to find that it is closed on saturdays. Neither the guard at the entry gate nor the numerous other guards on the way whom we asked for directions seemed to know the timings for the museum.So do prior checking before you visit.Otherwise it is a peaceful area where history resides.
Fort_William,Peter S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Business,Excellent! But why is Fort William listed as an attraction at all?,"I was able to visit Fort William last year because (typically) someone knew someone who pulled strings. But it is very difficult for 'ordinary' visitors to get in to  Fort William (and when you do your access and ability to take photos is severely limited) so why is it even on the Tripadvisor list? It is a fantastic historic site, but as a functioning army base it is not a tourist destination."

My only wish is that they will be more receptive to opening up the grounds and the structure to the public... to handle crowds better, they can limit the number of passes per month. As it is the sheer sight of automatic weapons manage crowds better anyways :)"

Fort_William,Dhruba1954,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Family,The Fort where never a shot been fired,"Although I am not a member of the Armed Forces, I have had  the opportunity to have breakfast at Fort Institute over the weekends. Earlier about twenty years back I did business with the Army. The changes are distinctly different and for the better. The Army is aware of the heritage it has inherited and taking care of them. The new museum gives vistors a flavor of the different wars it has fought  over the last 100 years. Every thing is good but this Fort is really notaccessible to the general public. If you have an army officer as a friend dont miss it."
Fort_William,theCraftyCamera,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Friends,The Raj experience,"This is not a tourist destination. Its the headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army.Unlike the Red Fort in Delhi which is also used by the Army, general entry is not permitted. You can't go in un-escorted. Period. Don't ask why - its a defense establishment.If you are a guest of a defense personnel (army, navy or air force) you can accompany the personnel info Fort William. Not all areas are super-secret and there are several officers who live inside the complex. But even inside, its best to be with the army personnel and not wander around aimlessly.Once inside, the full splendor of the British Raj is revealed. You are no longer in the world of civilians but in the regiment of the Raj. Raj-era buildings and customs transport you to another era. This is a must do if you know an Army officer. If not, you are out of luck :)"

Fort_William,GuelphTraveller,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 • Solo,Inaccessible,Many of the important historical sites in the Maidan such as Fort William are behind the walls of the Military and consequently inaccessible. This is a problem in India. Many tourist sites are closely restricted and often when you can see them photography is not allowed. India des need to be more tourist friendly in this respect.

Fort_William,Rohit Gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2012 • Couples,Majectic and Grand,I am not in defence services but I have been to alot of cantonment areas with friends and relatives. I love to visit them and spend a quite time.This place is very British in architecture. It actually has tunnels which are still in use. These tunnels are one way so only one car passes at a time.You feel proud to be an Indian when you see such places and architecture.

Fort_William,anupam b,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2013 • Couples,Fort William- The seat of British Power In India,"Fort William was the place from where the British ruled india before the Capital moved to Delhi in early 20th century. There is an excellent museum with atifact which opens at 1000hrs. the Fort has  a moat around it with a rampart. It is said that the British Army had an underground tunnel which led to the Hoogli river, where three ships were always kept ready in case of any emergency.
