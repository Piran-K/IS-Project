Howrah_Bridge,Let's Go Sightseeing,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,The Most Famous Bridge in India,"The Howrah Bridge, also called Rabindra Setu, connects Howrah & Kolkata. I crossed the Howrah Bridge first in the cab & went till the Howrah Station. When I returned to the Bridge, I got down & walked.There's no provision to enter the pedestrian path from the vehicular road anywhere on the Bridge; only at the ends. When you walk, you enjoy this cantilever bridge & the Hooghly flowing below. The pedestrian path can be a little dirty though."

It is considered one of the longest cantilever bridges in the world. Also known as Rabindra Setu, it connects Howrah and Kolkata. It carries daily traffic of over one Lac vehicles and countless pedestrians and is as historic as it is grand. The beauty of the bridge, however, comes alive in the night time when it is all lit up. The view of the city from the ferry, which runs between Kolkata and Howrah from the launch ghat especially in the night, is awesome.Howrah Bridge was the third longest cantilever bridge at the time of its construction, but now it is the sixth longest one of its types. It was renamed as Rabindra Setu in 1965, after the name of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. There are total of 8 lanes of strand road on the bridge for four wheelers, bicycles & pedestrians. This bridge unique due to the fact that it was built without a single nut , bolt or, welding and is held together by rivets only."
Howrah_Bridge,Xplorential,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Howrah Bridge- The pride of Kolkata,"The iconic bridge can be best viewed and photographed from the Malik Ghat in Kolkata. The famous landmark of the city, the Howrah Bridge, constructed by the British during 1940's, is one of the busiest cantilever bridges in the world. It carries a massive daily traffic of approximately 100K vehicles and more than 150K pedestrians every day.Some interesting facts:1. There is a famous belief that the bridge does not have any nut or bolt. But in reality, Howrah Bridge does have nuts and bolts, but just a few.2. The first ever mode of transportation that was used on the bridge was a solitary tram. Trams used to operate on the bridge till 1993. After that period, they were banned due to vehicular traffic on the bridge.Tips for viewers:Best time to view the best of this remarkable bridge is early morning during sunrise or evening during sunset. But we visited here at around 7:30 in the evening so that we get a view of the bridge with the famous purple/blue lighting. Reach to the starting point of the Howrah Bridge (from Kolkata towards Howrah Railway Station). Take the stairs down towards the flower market which can be seen from the bridge itself. Ask anyone the direction towards Mallik Ghat. You can sit in the concrete seats built in the ghat area. Hang out with friends or visit alone or simply go for a photography expedition, this place will surely give you a different experience altogether."

Howrah_Bridge,Johann R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,The Artistry Of Engineering,"The Howrah Bridge was built during a time when engineers thought themselves artists, in the vein of Eiffel of Tower fame in Paris. This was probably the last time engineers engaged in art and it happened in1943. The brutal beauty of the bridge is as wondrous as the fact that it's a cantilever bridge and one of the longest in the region. Parking a vehicle is not permitted. Neither is taking photographs (for security purposes, I believe), so most of the pictures cannot do justice to the intricacies of the construction methods used to hang this riveted masterpiece over the Hooghly River."

Howrah_Bridge,Pamela Ghosh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Joy ride,"One of the most popular bridge that Kolkata is identified with and seen in many old timer movies also!! Built way back in the yesterday years, Today also it stands solid like a rock as if constructed recently. It connects the Howrah station to the city and a ride through it is very enjoyable especially in the mornings when it's not so crowded. You can enjoy the rays if the rising sun reflecting on the Ganga. It's really beautiful!! It's a long stretch over the Ganga but you don't want the ride to end soon. Because the ride in the morning is ecstatic. You can see the fishing boats down below already out for their early morning catch. If you want to enjoy the evening view, it's best not to ride on it because it's overcrowded and may take you hours to get out. Best option is to take a ferry ride across and enjoy the view of evening lights amidst the night sky. It's an enchanting sight ferrying over the Ganga and watching the recording Howrah Bridge."
Howrah_Bridge,Alok M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Mesmerizing experience,Enjoyed the boat ferry trip in the evening hours. The view was beautiful when the bridge lit up. It gives mesmerizing experience when the boat moves slowly in the Hooghly river and the magnificent bridge comes closer and closer till you are sailing under it. Perfect destination for nature lovers.
