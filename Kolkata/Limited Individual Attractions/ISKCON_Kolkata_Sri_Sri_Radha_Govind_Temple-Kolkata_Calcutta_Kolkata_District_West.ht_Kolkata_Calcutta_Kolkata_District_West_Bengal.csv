Hiring a local city taxi is the best mode of travel for reaching this place.ISKCON temples are known for the cleanliness, beautiful decoration and amazing murti of deities. Most of the temples are of Lord Krishna, but every where local touch is available. The other thing I like at these temples is the sincerety of the pujaris of these temples. I have visited nearly 6-7 temples of ISKCON and Juhu and Vrindaban temples rank on top of the list hence I have rated this temple as average as compared to these two; else Kolkata temple also offer you the same feeling.Later we took prasaad at Govinda, the restaurant chain of ISKCON adjacent to the temple.
