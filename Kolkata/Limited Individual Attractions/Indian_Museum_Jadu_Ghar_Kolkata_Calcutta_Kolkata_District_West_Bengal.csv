Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Bijaya Kumar Nahak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Relive India's History and Culture in One Place,"India is known for its old civilizations and their cultures.Sanskrit is the earliest language that has ever been recorded in India; according to many experts, the Vedas (6500–1500 B.C.) were written in this ancient and classical language.From around 400–300 B.C., many kingdoms, like the Maurya Empire, Shunga Empire, Gupta Empire, and many more, came and ruled over India's different parts and left their cultures all over the country.That's why I always have a love and affection for Indian history and culture and am eager to know them in detail, so this December I visited the Indian Museum in Kolkata, the biggest and oldest museum in Asia.The museum is filled with lots of astonishing and eye-catching sculptures. On three floors, there are approximately 35 galleries.It has almost every historical and cultural detail about India that anyone would want to know. Starting with Hindu Gods, Indian kings and their cultures, different rulers who conquered this country at some point in their lives, and various sculptures and discoveries from various eras of Indian history, there is something for everyone.If you have a desire to know about the historical aspects and cultural values of India, I suggest you visit the Indian Museum in Kolkata at least once in your lifetime; you will not regret it."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Sunder Kole,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,A Astonishing Experience,"While visiting the Indian Museum in Kolkata,Throughout my childhood, I had the impression that museums were stuffy and dreary, and that bored children from school trips went there. However, I credit Kolkata for changing my perception.From the outside, the magnificent white pillars standing tall appear massive and spectacular. As I enter the museum, I notice that it has three floors and 35 galleries. Each floor has a minimum of 1000 years of history. Art, Archaeology, Anthropology, Geology, Zoology, and Botany are said to be the six major sections. The Indian Museum has everything from Egyptian artifacts to Buddhist relics and stores carvings from southern India. It has a Zoological Garden with very unique well-preserved specimens of animal species that are more than 100 years old, which astounded me. Every floor introduces us to a new era in history. There is something for everyone. The fascinating artifacts and relics left me speechless. If you want to go back in time and relive history from prehistoric to modern times. Then visit the Indian Museum."

I recently had been through Kolkata’s Indian Museum that to being 830+ Kilometers away from it.Yes, you guessed it right. It was a virtual tour. And I must say anyone and everyone who is interested to capture the rich ancient Indian culture into their hearts and minds should visit, either physically or virtually. For me personally, Mythological tales spark a curious tickle in my senses. Therefore the hypnotizing depiction of Krishna Leela took my words away. There I saw coins of the Greek Kings in Bacteria and India. There were some mesmerizing statues of Sadasiva, Dancing Siva, Goddess Parvati, and Buddha. A panel dedicated to Radha Krishna and more. Apart from the above, I was immensely fascinated by the intrinsically carved structures and handmade Kantha textiles with enormous detailing in them.  Exciting, isn't it? Why not go to the site and explore this astonishing tale of mythology, evolution and civilization yourself? "
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Sujuma Machahary,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,A trip of the Originals,"I had a virtual tour of the Indian Museum of Kolkata, which is known to be the largest and oldest multipurpose museum in the Asian-Pacific region of the world.I found myself surrounded by absolutely stunning sculptures, that was filling me with the pure flavor of ancient human creation.It was a glance over the remains of an ancient stupa called Amravati, that surprised me with its ability of mesmerizing anyone whoever have a close look over it.Indus valley civilization is a piece of Indian ancient history, without which it's incomplete to call it a discussion. When I gazed over its exhibition, I learned about the pieces of evidence found, that proved its ancient existence of rich culture, art, and technology.Besides that, I would like to hats off to the authority for playing a significant role in displaying ancient antiquities in such a lovely manner and managing the whole decorum of the museum. Overall that was a great experience for me to involve myself in the aura of ancient originality."

The museum also has a rich collection of Zoological, Botanical, and Geological Surveys of India.I liked the way the exotic Egyptian artifacts, relics of Buddhism, and stone carvings from Southern India were presented and preserved. Different sculptures of Buddha in different mudras were very pleasing. The zoological garden had unique well-preserved specimens of animals, which amazed me.  The virtual tour was fascinating, and it gave me an insight into the museum."

Awe is what anyone can feel when they see it. I appreciate the way the sculptures are positioned and presented. Seeing the intricate details on the sculptures clearly displays the craftsmanship of the artisans. Ideal lighting adds to the attraction. Personally, I like sculptures of Buddha performing different mudra. The sculptures and artwork clearly depict the rich history of India. These pieces of art have enchanted me with their messages and the incidents that they depict. If the virtual tour is this enthralling, how much more so if it were real?"
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Srinidhi Rao,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Couples,A treasure that is wasted,Why will they not air condition this treasure trove is a question that came to mind when we were sweating profusely while navigating the place.Lovely collections of stuff. But lack of qualified guides or literature...it is just a store that is on display.  So much more could be done there.Get a feel that the administrator lacks imagination and does not care
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Pradyumn Yadav,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,A day with Museum,"A day with Museum 	We all have heard about the beautiful & glorious History of India. There is a city in India where we have assembled all the historical monuments. The Sweetest city in India, Kolkata. It is a place of cultures. This is the palace where the oldest and biggest Indian museum is located, Indian Museum, Kolkata. I always wanted to visit this amazing place at least once. All thanks to Google Arts and Culture, I am able to experience a staggering virtual tour. After landing on the Indian Museum page, there was a short introduction to the museum. These museums kept alive our customs, traditions, culture, sculpture and history. When you visit them you will feel the real India, ancient Indian. Mainly Google Arts and Culture tour me only 4 Galleries. •	Gandhara•	Archeology•	Bharhut•	CoinsGandhara.Gandhara gallery was full of artwork on stone. It's a totally breathtaking scenario, knowing and seeing your ancient culture from so close. Gandhara is the origin of the Gupta dynasty. During the Gupta period, he actually worked on art and culture. Ashoka Pillar is proof of their fine artwork. They demonstrated the richness of Indian artwork.ArcheologyMahisasuramardeni, Budha in Dhyanmudra, Bacchanalian Scene, Vishu, Sadasiva, Chariot scene from Mahabharat, Sindhu-Saraswati Civilization, Bodhisattva Maitreya, and many other artworks are there. Seeing all these pieces of art your mind gone ask more than enough. It has a serene atmosphere and a rustic sense. The majority of the relics are enormous and medium-sized statues. The museum features a lovely lawn with some pillars found during the excavation of the remains. You will be welcomed by a sizable model of the city as you enter the museum.BharhutBharhut is a village, famous for relics of Buddhist stupa. This museum's Bharhut Gallery is a portion of the well-known and preserved Buddhist Stupa. It vividly displays many statues and the majority are Buddha. There are also lovely statues of the Buddha, Nataraja (the dancing Shiva), and other gods. Indian Museum has Buddha idols and shattered scriptures of gods revered during the period of the Buddha can be found. Including sculptures of the ""laughing Buddha,"" paintings of Shri Krishna, Ganesha statues, and statues of Buddha and his disciples in various poses, including sitting, standing, and meditating. At that time, idols were really lucky, lovely, and the best artwork imaginable. The room is full of sculptures of Buddha and other Indian mythology gods. Coins.In my favorite room, curving someone’s face on metal without any technology is the next level of skills. I came to know a fact about coins, that in ancient times no coins looks similar to each other, reason when making coins they hit the coin with the hammer. Hard hit on hot coin print the design on the coin, but every time coin maker has to aim for the perfect print. That’s every coin look different. Indian museum has a large number of ancient coins of India. It is described that they have more than 50k coins. They have mentioned how the barter system was invented and developed time by time. Indu-Euro coins, Coins of native states of India, and coins of eastern India, are on display. You can see how skilled and talented our ancestors were. They have done so marvelous work."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Kaizar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,The Life of Buddha in Indian Art,"I am a staunch believer in Buddhist philosophy.Quite recently I attended the exhibition titled - Indian Buddhist Art, organized by The Indian Museum in Kolkata.The exhibition illustrated the inspiring life of Gautam Buddha and why he left his heritage and riches in search of true enlightenment.The reason I appreciate Buddhism is because it focuses on building inner peace, rather than controlling external chaos.Even though this exhibition was a limited-time event, experiencing it virtually was immersive and true to life.I would recommend this Virtual tour to anyone who wants to get a deeper insight into Buddhism."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Jsjsnndnd,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Virtual visit to Indian Heritage,"We all have heard about the beautiful city of India, Kolkata. It is a place of cultures. This is the palace where the oldest and biggest Indian museum is located. I always wanted to visit this amazing place at least once. Due to some personal problems, I would be able to visit it. All thanks to Google Arts and Culture, I was able to experience a staggering virtual tour. after landing on the Indian Museum page, there was a short introduction to the museum. There they described the history of the museum that was founded in 1814, in the cradle of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.They classified them into three main wings—Archeology, Anthropology, and Art—which are filled with various objects ranging from idols, caskets, mummies, and textiles to the collections of zoological, botanical, and geological surveys of India. They demonstrated the richness of Indian artwork: ancient civilizations; Buddha sculptures; ancient coins; and the various deities with their different ways of worship. They circulated the museum in eight different galleries to explore every corner, so it was easy to understand. The first thing I saw was the Buddha gallery. I have a Buddha statue at my home. I follow him and also read about him. There were so many statues of Buddha in their temples, which explained the story of their lives. It was fascinating to me. I felt like I was actually there. It was so real. There were statues of our gods. Our ancestors used to wear ancient coins, different types of textiles, and dresses. I zoomed into the images and enjoy the details of every piece of art with crystal clarity and without any physical disturbance. There were a variety of items on display, including 292 Indian items, 219 Kolkata items, 213 Dharmatala items, 66 textile items, and 52 fiber arts. They have categorized them so well in different colors with different time agesThere was a small corner where a small model of Taj mahal was placed, which was surrounded by some home décor, utensils, and hand fans. The second thing I liked was the ancient gold coins and how they were used to portray faces or symbols to be used as currency in ancient times. I liked the ancient paintings of gods, the fictitious art with messages, and the paintings of specific people. Engraving the human faces in bronze statues without any modern technology with such perfection is incredible. and some amazing textile work.I'll highly recommend it to those who want to explore these types of places but, due to their problems, can't move out. This is the best option for you. I enjoyed it, and it was an incredible experience for me. Yea, if it was real, then it'd be much better, but I still hope to do more virtual tours in the future."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Pragya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,My unconventional visit to an incredible place,"Even after being born and brought up in Kolkata, my visit to Indian Museum was long overdue. Therefore, today I used the Google Arts and Culture app to explore the integral part of heritage of ""The City of Joy"", virtually.I had quite a pleasant experience. The 360 degrees view feature effectively compensated for the restrictions that we posed due to me not literally being there. However, it would have been better if we could properly look at each of the pieces and read what is written alongside them. The museum itself looks like a piece of art. It has a rustic feel with a tranquil ambiance. The three main wings- Archeology, Anthropology and Art are filled with various objects ranging from idols, caskets and textiles to the collections of botanical, zoological and geological surveys of India. Even the lighting was soothing and the walls, albeit devoid of any colour, added to the minimalistic yet beautiful layout of the museum. My personal favourites from the displays there include The Bharhut gateway and railings, The Kantha and The Mahisasurmardeni idol. Although, it was a virtual experience, I liked it a lot. I hope to visit Indian Museum in reality very soon. I would also recommend this place to anyone who plans to visit Kolkata."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Manish Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,My visit to Indian museum.,"I got an opportunity to visit Indian Museum, Kolkata. This tour left me with surprise with the richness of Indian artwork, civilizations, buddha sculptures, coins, and the various deities with their different ways of worship. In this write-up, I would like to share a glimpse of my tour experience with the readers, students who like to explore more about culture, Buddhist civilizations, and archeological remains.Indian Museum Kolkata has a wide variety of buddha idols, fragmented scriptures of deities worshipped at Buddha's time. The deities were ""laughing buddha's"" sculptures, Shri Krishna paintings, Ganesha idol, and Gautam Buddha with his disciples in various postures such as sitting, standing, meditating. The idols of that time were really auspicious, beautiful, and the finest work that could be imagined. Clothes paintings, designs were also there which somehow deciphered the clothing pattern, occupation of the people at those times. Barter system was also described which may be the transaction medium like the money today. The significance of human life is depicted through the various paintings, idols which denotes they believed human birth as a way to liberation. The coins of various dynasties such as Gupta, Kastrup, Votive metals were shown which emphasize that India had the well-developed Metallurgy science from the very beginning around the Buddhist period. Various paintings showed music, flute, dance images which denotes our cultural richness.I also come across various technical devices like Filigree Work that seems like cigars but couldn't understand their usage. Sindhu civilization, the drainage system is also described in the writings and paintings. My visit to the Indian Museum was full of learning and excitement which is impossible to get from the books. I can bet you would enjoy the visit to the Indian Museum, Kolkata.Happy Journey."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Anand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,"It was worth experiencing in lifetime, especially for the history lovers.","It was a terrific and immersive experience taking a virtual tour of the Indian Museum, Kolkata with the Google Arts and Culture app. The Indian museum or Imperial Museum of Calcutta is the largest museum in India from the era of the 1800s and 1900s, was founded by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Kolkata (Calcutta), India, in 1814, housing thousands of art and antique pieces that no other museum in this subcontinent has. Many local residents typically call it “Jadughar”.If you are planning to visit the museum, please ensure that at least you have half of your day because the Museum has so many sections like geography,  human revolution, Indian history, aqua life, garments from India, etc. There was a particular sculpture that got my attention, it was titled 'Sadashiva', which is engraved on stone describing it as a three-headed figure with ten arms, is the Supreme Being, in the Shaiva Siddhanta tradition of Shaivism. It was so well crafted and the attention to detail was eye-catching. History lovers will truly enjoy the place as this place smells history. "
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,saish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,great,"During these tough times, you can visit The Indian Museum, Kolkata virtually.It was founded in 1814. It is the oldest and the largest multipurpose museum not only in the Indian subcontinent but also in the Asia-Pacific region of the world. It has more than one hundred thousand objects in its collectionIt has three main wings - Archaeology, Anthropology, and Art. In addition, it also houses the collections of the Zoological, Botanical, and Geological Surveys of India. Many unique and rare things are preserved and displayed in the galleries of the sections.One of my eye-catching experience was an exhibition titled Indian Buddhist Art,  showcasing masterpieces of Buddhist Art from different parts of the Indian subcontinent. It has shown the life of Siddhartha, better known as Gautama, the Buddha, through sculptures and paintings. One of the sculptures was named “Maya’s Dream” in which Maya Devi(Siddhartha’s Mother)had a dream where she saw a white elephant entering her womb. In sculptures, this theme is presented by a lady asleep on a couch with an elephant hovering over her.All Siddhartha's life stages are preserved as a form of sculptures, from ""Siddhartha's Birth"" to ""First Sermon"". These sculptures carry emotions within themselves, one thing I will like to add from the last sculpture of this exhibition ""Last Stage of Buddha's Life"" Siddhartha's last words were 'Decay is inherent in all living beings. Work out your own salvation with diligence'"
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Sakshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,A must visit place in Kolkata,"I did a virtual visit to the Indian Museum, Kolkata on Google Arts and Culture platform. They provide almost a real-life experience with a 360-degree tour, which includes everything you need to know about an antique. They found the Indian Museum in 1814. It is not only India's oldest and largest multipurpose museum but also the world's largest in the Asia-Pacific region. Its collection has over a hundred thousand pieces and is built into three main wings: archaeology, anthropology, and art.Being a history student, the collection that I was most excited about was the archaeology and art section. It has a collection of artefacts that describes the inspiring story of Lord Buddha and how people ‌preached the lessons and learning of lord buddha. There is an extensive collection that ranges from Standing Buddha, Stupa, Ganesha, Lord Shiva etc. you can see that it broke some of these pieces from one edge which makes you realize that time waits for none. My favourite art piece is of Lord Buddha’s head. The plaster head of the Buddha is a stunning example of Gandhara art. While they kept the top knot and wavy hair, the upward treatment of the brows, half-open lotus bud shaped eyes, and a sense of inner serenity on the face make it less rigid than the traditional Gandhara rigidity. It’s a must-visit place if you’re in Kolkata!"
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Akash negi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Great,"I enjoyed the virtual tour of the museum so far, even though it might be more informative because Kolkata is a culturally diverse city. 1814 was the year when the museum of Kolkata was founded.There is no museum older than this in India. Sections, such as Art, Archaeology, Anthropology, Geology, Zoology, and Economic Botany.Each section has its' own gallery. Many unique things are displayed in the gallery of each section.There is a huge collection of Armors, Sculptures, Mummies, Fossils, and Fibers. Some of the main attractions are the sculptures of Devi Durga, the Egyptian mummy, skeletons of dinosaurs, footprints of Buddha, and different types of fossils and fabrics.They beautifully displayed the clothing of the people of our country India. In addition, there is a section with masks and weapons from medieval India.Having a tour of this museum was overall a worthwhile experience for me. I recommend visiting it to everyone."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Akash mumbai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,"Indian Museum, Kolkata. A virtual tour","I visited the Indian Museum of Kolkata while I was at home. In the museum, several sections offer the visitors to experience medieval statues, paintings, fish species, rocks section, different kinds of civilizations in the medieval ages, etc. The part that struck me was the Antiquely sculpted medieval statues of gods and goddesses. Being someone who is a firm believer in God this place is something I could not have missed. Most of the statutes were broken as they are many centuries old, which gave me an insight into that era. The bronze artifacts froze me because I was surprised by the amount of detailing done on them. An entire section depicts a scene from Indian mythological stories like goddess Durga killing demons, Lord shiva dancing, and lord Krishna playing the flute. A separate section is dedicated to Antique buddha idols which look marvelously beautiful. There is one section that has a replica of diverse fish species.I also found antique shawls used by the monarchs. Handicraft items with handmade detailing were something I felt like taking with me and having on my tea table.  I was fascinated to revisit the story of evolution in this museum. As it has paintings of the universe coming into existence, depiction of the entire series of human evolution from Dryopithecus until now i.e. homo sapiens. The fact museum has a dedicated section for a variety of antique coins used in the world. it was lovely that I was reminded the fact of the barter system in the olden era just to realize how digitalized things have become now. If you look out for beautiful and raw historic evidence of civilizations, mythology, or Human existence this is a must-visit and can be done virtually while you are still home."

Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Anjan Sengupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,Needs urgent attention,I had a second opportunity to visit this museum in March 2021 and I was saddened to see the deteriorating condition of the building at many places.The museum has lots and lots of different antiques starting from the skeletons of extinct animals to fossils of different objects. This place even has a Big Ashok Stambh and an Egg of a Dinosaur.But the thing that makes this place unique in India is a 4000 year old Egyptian Mummy which is the only Mummy present in India.The building of the Museum needs urgent attention for repai  renovation. Overall a nice place to visit.
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,The Shots Of My Life,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Oldest Museum in India,"The building is in pristine white and exudes a class of its own. It is the oldest and biggest museum in India, founded by the Asiatic Society of Bengal.It houses a brilliant plethora of antiques, fossils, paintings, war time weapons, armours, skeletons and a wide variety of flora, fauna, art and handicrafts displays. We especially liked the Egypt gallery, the underwater world and fossils, as well as the marvel, the moon rock."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,atulya_sinha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,INDIA'S OLDEST AND BIGGEST MUSEUM,"The Indian Museum (established in 1814) is the oldest and biggest museum in India. It is older than the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC established in 1849, as well as the Uffizi in Florence, which did not become a museum till 1865. American author Mark Twain, who visited this museum in 1895, described it as “an enchanted place of Indian antiquities.” He further wrote, “Indeed a person may spend half a year among the beautiful and wonderful things without exhausting their interest.”The Indian Museum has been extensively renovated and re-organized during its bicentenary celebrations. The exterior has been painted yellow, instead of the original white (however, the walls surrounding the central courtyard are still white). There is a separate ticket counter which can be accessed without entering the building. A cloak room is available alongside where one can leave one’s belongings before entering. Tickets cost Rs. 50/- for adults and Rs. 20/- for children, with additional charges for cameras (however, photography is not permitted in some of the galleries). Since the ceilings are quite high, one must climb about 50 steps to reach the upper floor. There is a grand staircase in front, and two lesser staircases at the far corners of the building. There is a large grassy central courtyard, where many visitors like to rest. There is a lift, but it is meant to be used only by senior citizens and the differently abled.Well-maintained washrooms are located beyond the staircase in the right-hand corner of the ground floor. It is advisable to use them before proceeding to the first floor, since there are no washrooms there. The major galleries are located on two floors. The ground floor has galleries devoted to archaeology, sculptures, coins, anthropology, geology, etc., while the first floor has the Egyptian and Painting galleries, apart from the botanical and zoological ones. A very fine Roman-style marble statue of Queen Victoria, donated by the Maharaja of Burdwan, occupies a central location on the first floor. A marble bust of “Rai Omrito Nath Mitter Bahadur 1847-1908”, trustee and treasurer of the museum, is displayed on the right landing of the main staircase. Since I had reached the museum at about 3pm and it was to close at 5pm, I decided to visit a limited number of galleries. I spent a few minutes in the Siwalik Vertebrate Fossil gallery located to the left of the main entrance, where a remarkable pair of elephant tusks is on display. Since the day was pleasant, I spent some time viewing the sculptures displayed in the verandah surrounding the courtyard. Next I visited the Egyptian gallery on the first floor. It turned out to be quite small, and most of the exhibits were replicas. However, the presentation and upkeep were quite good. I spent more than an hour in the Paintings gallery on the first floor. This gallery is lined with old wooden cabinets along balconies located near the ceiling, accessed by winding staircases. These are not in use now and they have been sealed off. This gallery also has magnificent windows facing the road, which have also been sealed off while artificial lighting has been installed. There is a rich collection of paintings on display, including miniatures from Mughal, Rajasthani, Pahari and Company/Patna schools, along with water colours and a few oil paintings from the Bengal School. There are several paintings by Abnindranath Tagore, who served as the vice-principal of the adjacent Government College of Art in the early twentieth century. While the presentation is well organized, the lighting leaves much to be desired. The illumination level is good, but the bulbs are mounted near the ceiling, creating the effect of the harsh sunlight of noon. Secondly, the paintings are framed behind regular instead of non-reflective glass. Hence if one tries to photograph any of the paintings, there are multiple reflections on the glass. There is a small gift shop located near the exit, offering a small selection of picture post cards and replicas of sculptures, in addition to books. There is much scope for expansion and diversification here. I would also welcome small books and pamphlets which can guide visitors as they pass through the galleries. In addition, there can be audio guides which are a standard feature of reputed museums nowadays, providing information for the visitors and bringing revenue for the museum."

Trust me if you love visiting a museum then please tick this one in your checklist. Just a word of caution. Get your expectations low about the ambiance It is located in a heritage building with a large lawn. Such grandeur is restricted only to the building. The maintenance is very poor as most places are not even dusted. However, the quality of display is the best in the world. It has fossils of prehistoric times , metals of all varieties, all kind of animal world. It’s like an one stop encyclopaedia. If you have a child please do take them. Importantly as an adult you will learn a lot The entry feee is Rs 50/- per adult and for photography its Rs 50/- even if you shoot with your mobile phone.

It hosts a large number of permanent exhibits. Some are basic about natural history and some about art and culture. I liked the hall on the first floor with old buddhas, ganeshas and other sculptures from the 12th-15th centuries. I loved the masks display on the 3rd floor (with special hidden access from the fish exhibition on the second floor). I also enjoyed the Mughal miniature paintings. This hall is beautiful. While other exibits are not worth the visit (e.g., Egyptian), still I found the museum very interesting and despite the state of the building. BTW, there is a street food market, just out side the side of the museum that was delicious."
Indian_Museum_Jadu_Ghar,Sea Dweller,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,One of the oldest museums in the world.,"The Indian Museum was founded by Danish biologist Nathaniel Wallich in Serampor, near Calcutta in 1814.From 1814 to 1878, the museum’s funds were located in the premises of the Asian Society in Calcutta, but later moved to their own premises. The museum mansion contains: the Egyptian mummy, a Buddhist stupa from Bharut, the ashes of Buddha, the Ashoka column, whose symbol with three lions has become the official emblem of the country and is present on the coat of arms of India. In addition, the museum stores fossils of prehistoric animals, stuffed animals of India and other parts of the world.Unfortunately, the museum building, as well as the exhibits themselves, are in rather poor condition. For storing stuffed animals and skeletons of ancient animals, as well as for storing works of art, special conditions of humidity and temperature are required, which, unfortunately, are not here."

The whole exterior needs repainting and all the cracks and holes in the walls need fixing too. The displays are badly lit ( many items in darkness because the light bulbs had blown) and the information plaques are barely readable.This place could be special as it has a great collection of art, archaeology, and  anthropology. Instead it's depressingly bad. To add insult to injury, it still has the old discriminatory pricing system - the entry fee for Indians is 50 rupees, foreigners have to pay 500.

Great range of collections ararnged over s series of galleries in what we would conisder a traditional manner from a Western perspective the museum explores archaeology, zoology, ethnography, geology, local crafts, argitculture etc.  It was really busy with famillies when we visited on a Sunday which resulted in a lovely buzz. There is a small cover charge, the interpretation is old school but gives you enought to go on.  There is a shop with a limited range o products and some heavy looking publications so not much for the internatonal tourist.  Do visit if you are in Kolkata!"

Second, I went there with a specific goal of seeing 19th & 20th century Bengali paintings. This review is based entirely on the paintings exhibits in this museum.This museum really lacks a purpose.  I fully realize that is a third world museum with limited resources, but there is so much you can do with what you have.  The painting are displayed with no the thematic or historical context.  There is no educational activity in the museum to make average Indian become acquainted with the important painters of Bengal.  Everything becomes a backdrop for people taking selfies.  As an Indian who left this country, I was saddened to see its culture and history languishing in the background.  Interestingly, it is not easy to figure out where most of the great Bengali paintings are located in Kolkata. There are a few scattered paintings at Jorasanko Thakur Bari, again without any descriptions or context."

One noteworthy thing is outside painting of the hole building is white colour that is not covered with moss. Black spots in building outer walls is common thing in Kolkata. This building is exception. This indicated the regular maintenance of the facility. No food and handbag allowed inside. Also no food available inside. However there are separate feeding room for baby. Cafeteria is the worst thing inside the museum. Foods and very bad. All tables are filled with museum staffs having launch they carry from home.Vehicle parking is nightmare like all places of Kolkata and this no exception.The museum shop sell good collection of old artifact copies and some very old museum brochures at old price. The oldest museum bulletin in on sell for inr 2 in 2019. What a concept!!!!!

It is famous by the name of Jadu Ghar or Magic House among the locals as most exhibits are not less than the wonder for us.6. It has such vast collections which makes it impossible to be throughly covered within time span of one day.7.The building itself is very beautiful but at the end the poor maintenance of most of the area makes the whole experience  miserable.8. The campus including Toilets is buzzing with staff but no one is concerned about their duty else all have arrogant body language and unconcerned attitude.9.After visiting this museum and finding it full of treasures an obvious feeling towards the authorities comes which is a request to proper supervision and due maintenance.10.A museum shop is also there but mostly of no use though has great potential."

Apparently it is the oldest museum in India and ninth oldest in the world.  It dates back to 1814.  It has a new gallery full of Masks from different regions and traditions in India.  These were absolutely lovely, but then I specialise in mask.  For others the galleries of fabrics and art work, including some painting by famous Indian artists, were fascinating.  There were large amounts of big boned skeletons, fossils and, apparently, mummies somewhere but I was less interested in those.  I was there for 3 hours and only saw a part of it.   Be aware that you're not supposed to take food in - I had 2 bananas which I was allowed on the grounds I wouldn't eat them while inside - they caused the guards some amusement! There was plenty of space to walk around slowly even though there were a lot of visitors.  The Victoria Memorial and St Pauls are a short walk away if you want to cover all three on the same day.  The building has a faded grandeur and is clearly in need of investment for its upkeep.  Well worth a visit.  Closed on Mondays."

There should more English translations and the glass screens all need cleaning, and items on display need dusting. It is very difficult to appreciate anything. There also needs to be some proper a/c.

Yes there’s a real mummy there too which is one of the favourite attractions among the kids. It houses some wonderful works of art including Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu stone sculpture and Indo-Persian miniature paintings beautifully conserved and framed."

Unfortunately, the whole place has a very shabby appearance.  So much more can be done to make every gallery attractive and well lit.  Take the Sivalik section, for example, the whole hall looks so run down even though it has priceless collections on view.  Request the authorities to give this maginficent institution a thorough overhalul."
