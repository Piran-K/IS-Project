Jain_Swetamber_Dadajika_Temple,Cavan R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Bling personified,"As a representation of the austere Jain branch of Hinduism, this place was an ironic surprise. Three temples set in pleasant gardens were ablaze with inlay stonework and  mirrored glass tessera, totally at odds with modesty and austerity. Unlike most Hindu temples which are usually a riot of colour, there was almost no colour here, it was just a riot of reflected light.  Well worth seeing."

The temple is beautiful, with ornate, decorative structures.  The gardens and surrounds are peaceful and reflective, and there is a little shop to the side where you can purchase small items.  You cannot take photos of the deities but you can take photos of the general temple and grounds.  I always recommend taking a headscarf with you even if you don't need to wear it.  If it's a working temple, you usually need to wear it.  Definitely worth visiting when in Kolkata."

This was one of our favorite temples we visited. The style of Jain temples is very different then Hindu temples and worth seeing. The workers here were very welcoming. Just watch out for the people that will act like your friends and give suggestions on what to do like a tour guide and then ask for money. There is a small gift shop here that is worth a look."

Jain_Swetamber_Dadajika_Temple,Sukanya D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,Non Jains No Entry,Tucked away in the bye lanes of Belgachia are a cluster of at least 3 Jain temples. This one is closed from 12 noon to 3 Pm. Non Jains maynot enter the temple. So land up any time if interested only in architecture and not of the faith. You can take good photos through the railings. Fabulous shots. The durwans were really rough and shooed me and my friend who had come all the way from Delhi ( I did see  dogs inside the temple complex but felt I was treated worse)...but I still got the shots. Almost none of my Kolkata relatives and friends knew about these temples...just goes to show...I did not mind NOT being allowed to enter...but the way the durwan behaved still rankles...he needs to remember he guards a place of worship.The Dadaji temple next door was such a contrast...we were welcome and we wandered around at will (quietly...no loud voices please...this is a temple) and paid our respects at the main temple too.

I love the marble Jain temples I had visited in other parts of India, I found the place a bit gaudy and over the top. Having said that - the level of workmanship is superb.I enjopyed the garden and the floral compositions.The temple was constructed by Ray Badridas Bahadur in 1867. Throughout the temple there is an abundance of glass and mirrors, the ceilings are adorned by chandeliers which provide a reflection in the walls."

The beautiful glass temple is ornately decorated with minute carvings throughout. There are several European statues in the area. Outside the main entrance there is a side entrance to another temple which rises high and is guarded by two lion statues on either side. The other portion of the compound opposite to the exit of the glass temple, looks entirely different resembling a bit of Mughal architecture. The long pathway reaching to a marble temple is clean and very well maintained. There is a water body adjacent to the temple. It is a noteworthy place of visit in Kolkata."

A fairytale view from the flyover everytime we passed.Had been hearing a lot about the place from others and finally during our recent Kolkata trip we decided to visit the place. All set for the visit....we reached there one fine morning. Alas, we could not even step inside! Right at the main entrance, the guard stopped us and informed us that entry is not allowed. We thought we did not hear correct so we asked what happened. He repeated that entry is not allowed. When we asked whether the temple was closed now and would open later. He said that is not the reason.....only Jain people are allowed entry!!!Well.....we were all super shocked, disappointed and did not know what else to say. Had to return back with no choice."

It will take around 1 to 2 hour to get the darshan. Lot of places surrounding the temple to visit. Please check and plan to visit all temples when visiting Madurai. 1 to 2 days are sufficient for visit all places.
Jain_Swetamber_Dadajika_Temple,Dev1972,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,How can a out of bounds place be a place to visit,Only Jains are allowed to enter this temple. Others are shooed away. That way I can understand it to be only a private temple. But even then I wonder how can a religious place behave like this. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SHOOED AWAY FROM ANY OTHER PLACE- BE IT A TEMPLE OR A MOSQUE OR A CHURCH OR A GURUDWARA. SHAME on this place.
Jain_Swetamber_Dadajika_Temple,Shourjendra D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,More glitzy of the Jain temples,"This temple is located in the by lane of North Kolkata,and access is easier through Raja Dinendra Street. Vehicles go right at the entrance,and parking is available in the alleys,free of chargeI have been to this place many times before,when I was a kid, but went there yesterday again, with two young kids aged 4 and 10,and they were equally happy and I could actually re-live my childhood through themThe location has 3 temples,on either side of the narrow alley ,and 2 are easily accessible to general public,by foot,after you get down from your vehicle. The main attraction is the ornately designed temple built in 1910 by a certain Rai Budree Das Bahadoor,who was a Mookim to the then Viceroy.Main attraction is the finely handcrafted with colourful mosaic tiles temple dedicated to the Jain leader Guru Sithalnath Ji. Inside the temple photography is strictly prohibited and there are innumerable CCTV cameras to desist you. Inside the temple,it is calm and serene,and chants of the Jain priests can be heard in chorus.Designs on the wall and the colourful glass on the window,make a fine print on the floor,if you visit in the day time,like we did yesterday.Not much to do apart from pay your respect.Attraction for the kids remains the same,as 40 years back. That is feeding the fishes,whose number though has drastically deteriorated over the years. There is a small fountain on the premises whose water at the base contains small number of small fishes. My kids started feeding them small pellets of Atta (Indian wheat flour).There is also a larger but extremely dirty water-body at the rear,which contained many fishes when we were young. Now the water is so dirty and stinky,that you would hate to go near it. Fishes are very less,and due to the dirt layer,you can hardly see them,except exclaim at every bubbles you see at the surface,made by them.At the back of this premises,there is a gate which leads out to the alley at the back. That alley takes you to another Jain temple at the rear called the Shree Jain Swetamber Dadaji ka Temple. This one is a bit cleaner than the Sithalnath Ji temple.There is a large water body at the back here too,which has few swans and ducks,enjoying the relatively cleaner water. Here also priests were chanting on their own and people of Jain community,thronged the place to pay their respect.Overall a nice outing with the kids enjoying themselves,feeding the fishes and the ducks. See my accompanying pictures to have an idea of the place"

Apparently it took 25 years to complete. One can believe this if you look close at the detail."
