Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Lovely,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023,Terrible behaviour of the security guards and staffs,"It was a horrible experience. I  am very disappointed with the behaviour of the security guards today when we visited the museum. As following Rabindranath Tagore's writing since childhood. I waas excited to visit here after travelling from all the way from Darjeeling.The behaviour of the museum's security guards and staff was so rude that I refused to even enter the museum. It was difficult to navigate the museum so by mistake we entered a gate where there was no notification or barricade of ""NO ENTRY"", the security guards screamed and insulted us thrice even after we politely apologised to them. After that they also asked for our mobile phone to check the gallery , we co-operated and showed them, but even after then they insulted us in front of the public over there. They have no rights to touch our phone and go through our phone's gallary. They have absolutely no manners to talk to a women.I have been to other museums in Kolkata and heritage site, never faced this issue. I would never recommend my friends and acquaintances to come to this place and get insulted by their manerless security guards.Who is going to compensate my time and effort?"

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Lubaba S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,Rabindranath did not know that I would visit...😔,"It was my long cherished wish to visit the house of Bishyokobi in Kolkata, alas he did not know that I would come one day, so that he made the rules flexible for the visitors. It is a goverent-run national property, which has heritage value. Rabindranath, himself is not a property of India but he belongs to all bengoli speaking nationalities. The national anthem of Bangladesh is wrote by him, so we own him, we  him. I was surprised by the behavior of the staff, to dishonor the emotions of the visitors. They just throw out us by telling that taking  picture of the name of the house is not allowed even from a distance!I was soo disappointed and i hppe authority provide some training to the staff on behavior change communication skill."

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,A sense of nostalgia,"The name itself is romantic & evokes a sense of nostalgia. Jorasanko Thakur Bari is the ancestral house of the Tagore family. Rabindranath Tagore was born, lived & died here.Jorasanko Thakur Bari is a priceless heritage remnant. It’s constructed in the typical Bengali style. You will love the bright green & red facade! The Museum within, commemorating the life of Rabindranath Tagore, is called the Rabindra Bharati Museum.Apart from the entry ticket (INR 10), there is an INR 50 ticket to use mobile cameras within the premises but do note – photography inside the Rabindra Bharati Museum is prohibited.The Museum comprises galleries related to Rabindranath Tagore & to the Tagore family. In the galleries related to Tagore, you’ll find his possessions, photographs, sequence of events leading to his illness & last days, his relations with countries like China, Hungary, Japan & the USA.In the galleries related to the Tagore family, you’ll find family ancestry & photographs, Bengal School paintings, & Tagore house portraits. You can do justice to the Rabindra Bharati Museum only if you’re ready to invest at least three hours.As you tour the Museum, there are security guards who guide you on the right path & ensure there’s no noise/ unruliness. A couple of galleries had captions only in Bengali, making it difficult for non - Bangla speakers to understand."

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Haimanti S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Jorasanko Thakurbari day visit,"It's a serene place with a nostalgic feel. Informative and awe inspiring to see the rooms, personal belongings, paintings, letters and writings of Gurudeb Tagore and his family. The simple grandeur of their home is in keeping with their patronage of bengali culture, art and literature.Points to improve:1.The shop should be stocked much better with his and other Tagores'translated books,prints of paintings and Tagore's own portrait prints. It's a great marketing opportunity lost!2.Transport & connectivity 3. Bathrooms should be near and better maintained."

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Anuradha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Wonderful museum and heritage building ,"Birth place of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore and a heritage building. Very well maintained and informative, offers many galleries related to gurudev’s life and his family. Most of the galleries provided information in English but In a few galleries information needs to be written in English too along with Bengali language so that more people can understand. Ladies washroom was in a pitiable condition with no water. Management needs to take care. "
Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Adip R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Another must visit place,Rabindranath Tagore was born here and also breathed his last in this building. There are many exhibits to remind visitors about this all time great poet of Bengal.

Check the hours before you go.
Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,TapanKB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Worth visiting if you are visiting Kolkata!,"It is the ancestral home of the Tagore family. In fact Rabindranath was born here and died here at the age of 81 in !941.As the Tagore's were one of the wealthiest families in the city in the 1800's the house reflects this...........also, some of the galleries are well kept. Definitely get a private guide, its worth the money.The house is in the heart of old Calcutta and walking the lanes and bye lanes but still bustling with people gives you an idea of the vibrancy of this city."

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Lead S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A place which should have been a cultural magnet of Kol ... is not,"Rabindranath Tagore - an iconic figure of Indian literature, lived worked and passed away in his ancestral home. We were excited to see this house. But our entire experience was marred by multiple events at Jorasanko Thakur Bari which left a bitter taste in our mouth.1. Toilets just outside the premise (next to where Tagore's car is parked) are HORRIBLE! Don't use.2. Tagore's car is filthy dirty and unkempt and in a corner parked away in obscurity.3. There are no photographs permitted inside Tagores house. If you ask a security personnel, they don't know the reason but vehemently defend the rule by shouting at anyone who dares to feel inspired by Kobiguru's words and paintings and wants to retain a bit of it through their cell phone camera.4. The premise is patrolled by numerous roaming security guards - who seem jobless most of the time. The museum closes at 5:00 pm, but these normally lethargic guards become active and start shouting at the guests to leave by 4:45.5. Once inside the house, the atmosphere is great with a faint robindro sangeet playing in the background.6. Kobiguru's personal belongings are unkempt, not lighted and moth balled. I could see tears on his robe.What an inspiring place this could be but .... I was saddened to see all of this. Overall a very unwelcome place, that has so much potential."
Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Suzanne F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Very worthwhile,"Set aside hours for this museum. Rabindranath Tagore was an amazing man, and you'll learn all about him here., along with his family. His nephews were revolutionary visual artists, as well. "
Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,atulya_sinha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,THE HOME OF THE TAGORES,"Jorasanko Thakurbari features prominently in the autobiographies of Rabindranath Tagore and his nephew Abanindranath. It was known as a centre of vocal and instrumental music, acting and stage décor, poetry and play readings, sketching and painting, and much else. Above all, it was the home of the illustrious Tagore family. The Thakurbari consists of three interconnected structures built in different centuries. Ram Bhavan, the earliest building at the site, was built by Nilmani Tagore (1729-91) when he shifted there from Pathurighata in 1784. The triple-storied main building, which forms the main façade that one sees while entering from Rabindra Sarani, is Maharshi Bhavan, named after Mahirshi Debendranath Tagore. Finally, the smaller building on the left is Vichitra Bhavan, constructed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore in the 20th century.One enters the complex through a long passage starting from an arch on Rabindra Sarani. The Thakurbari, with its red and cream walls and green woodwork is a magnificent sight. You buy tickets near the gate – Rs 20 per head. In case you intend to use a camera or camera phone, you need to buy another ticket for Rs. 50 from the Museum office, but you are still not permitted to take any pictures inside the buildings. Incidentally, the tickets are aesthetically designed and worth preserving as souvenirs! You take off your shoes and pass the tiny reception/ sales counter, go up the main staircase and find yourself in the modest suite of rooms once occupied by Rabindranath, including the chamber where he breathed his last in 1941. You turn left at the end of the corridor, where you find two galleries of paintings: the first contains works of the Bengal school (mostly water colours), while the other has western style portraits of several generations of Tagores. A replica of the Nobel prize medal awarded to Rabindranath Tagore in 1913 is also on display. Next, you enter Ram Bhavan, the oldest structure. You see the room where Rabindranath and other family members were born. An alcove in the wall and some simple furniture from the original room has been carefully preserved. As you proceed further, you find four galleries which commemorate Tagore’s travels to America, China, Japan and Hungary respectively. These galleries have been sponsored by the governments or academic institutions of the respective countries and their displays seem quite ostentatious after the stark simplicity of the earlier galleries. You return to Maharshi Bhavan and reach Vichitra Bhavan through a small flight of stairs. It turns out that Vichitra Bhavan – true to its name – is a double-storey building which was constructed without a staircase! Later, a small wooden staircase was added, which can be seen in the reception chamber on the ground floor, but it is blocked off on the first floor. The upper floor of Vichitra Bhavan contains one large hall with a few smaller chambers, where pictures and other memorabilia associated with the Tagore family are on display. The lower floor contains the library and research centre, which are not open to public.Despite the grandeur of the buildings and the fabulous wealth of the Tagore family, one finds no trace of opulence in their lifestyle – just compare the simplicity of Jorasanko with the extreme flamboyance of Mullick Thakurbari (also known as the Marble Palace) in the same neighbourhood. It appears that Prince Dwarkanath Tagore (1794-1846), the poet’s grandfather, had rejected European culture in his home and organized a great sale of his household goods – including china, clocks, marble-topped tables, mahogany chairs and pianos – as far back as 1841! Later generations of the Tagore family were to become leaders of the Bengal Renaissance across diverse forms of art, including painting, drama, poetry and music. Highly educated individuals volunteer to work as guides in Jorasanko – we had the honour of being escorted by a young lady with two post-graduate degrees, including one from Rabindra Bharti University itself. Such learned guides combine deep scholarship with much adoration for the institution. They are fluent in multiple languages – including English, Hindi and Bangla.A visit to Jorasanko Thakurbari is highly recommended."
Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Prabir G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Birthplace of Bengali Renaissance,"A. Opening Hours : 10.30 am till 4.30 pmB. Entry Ticket: Rs. 10 pp Indian                            Rs. 50 pp for ForeignersC. Location : Jorasanko, off Chitpur Road, Kolkata North    One of the iconic Heritage place of Modern Bengali Cultural History, this place is the Family Residence of Famous Thakur aka Tagore family. One of greatest poet and philosopher of all times Rabindranath Tagore was born here and grew up and stayed here till he shifted to Shantiniketan World University. He breathed his last also in a room in this building, on 7th August 1941.There are 3 sets of buildings and the oldest part was built in the year 1784 and is known as Maharshi Bhavan(Debendranath Tagore). Unfortunately, the place does not get the kind of respect and footfall that it deserves. I visited the place on 29th Nov'19 ( Shame that being a outright born and brought up resident of Kolkata, it took me 60 years from my year of birth to visit this place, that too being a out and out Rabindranath follower). The entrance is from Chitpur Road. There is a sonnet lumiere show from 5.30 in the evening as well. Once you enter you see the e storied barrack styled red brick house with iconic green wooden blind. You must avail guide service which is free and being conducted by young student and Tagore Researchers. A young lady student accompanied us as a guide. You need to remove shoes before you enter the Building known as Tagore Museum. The first part is the oldest one known as Maharshi Bhavan. Here you find the bedroom of Rabindranath's father and other rooms with lot of furniture, artifacts used by the family. The newest part Bichitra was built by Rabindranath in 1901. Here you find a large hall where the poet himself performed his own creations and was attended global luminaries from all over the world. There is an anti room where the poet used ad his study. You can find the small table sitting where he wrote the famous letter quitting his knighthood in 1919, post the infamous Jaliwanwalabagh Massacre. In the third section, you can find the bedroom of the poet, kitchen used by his wife Mrinalini Devi.Two most iconic place in this entire building , is the family birth and postnatal care room, where the poet was born on 6th May 1861 and the room where he breathed his last on 6th August 1941. Throughout the entire Building in separate sections you can find things, dresses used by the family. I was amazed to see things used by Pandit Iswarchandra Vidyasagar also kept in a room. A denture used by Vidyasagar put me in the Tryst with History. You can find number of paintings by various artists here. Art materials used by famous painter Abanindranath Tagore are kept in a room. There are three separate galleries Chinese, Japanese and European. You can find lots of displays and Tagore's travel history to these places in these sections. You can see the car used by the poet displayed here. But I was shocked that it is covered with dust showing complete lack of attention to this famous piece from history.Simply amazing place. But sad to see very few visitors in such an iconic place. Must visit for a Tagore Follower"

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Deepak DB,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Rabindra Nath Tagore's Beautiful Family Home,"We were hell bent not to miss this spot when we were at Kolkata and it is proved coz we dared rains, knee deep or higher water level across city to reach the spot.Rains had led to flooding on the grounds and we took help of other tourists who were at the counter to get us entry tickets as the counters were submerged too. In this confusion we missed on taking the Camera tickets (if they still allow one) If they do then please do get it.It's a beautiful traditional house with with gardens and verandah's inside. Its a huge set up upstairs and one has to take off their foot wear before that. It has a mix of display of his pictures of travel across the world, his clothes, furniture, memorabilia and the room where he breath his last. Its a must visit place if you are into history and keen to know about his works and India's journey to freedom. some of the rooms are air conditioned which is savior. A guided tour would be ideal, not sure if they have one. we were there on the day when the city was fully flooded."

Had to keep the camera in the custody so I couldn't take any picture inside the museum. It's saddening part. But we've felt the whole experience through our heart with love. We were roaming around in those houses, where we felt like the poet guru was always walking on the stairs."

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,RoyDebashis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,A great place to about Rabindranath Tagore,"The place is located at Jorashako area of Kolkata. This is one of the most important tourist attraction of the City. This is place where Rabindranath Tagore born and his childhood passed. He also died in this house. This complex is build on a area of 35000 square meter. This site is open for visitor from 10:30am to 5:00pm. This is closed on Monday and Thursday. Ticket price differ for Indian, Student, SAARC citizens and other foreigners. For Indian it is Rs. 20, For SAARC it is Rs. 30 and for Foreigners it is Rs. 150. Photography is not allowed inside the house. But with a photography ticket of Rs.50 anyone can take photograph of the complex.  I didn't find the staffs deployed their is much cooperative and trained. They just poke guest every time and disturb their mood. I think for this kind of site stuffs should be more trained and gentle. It will take around 3 to 4 hours if you visit the house in details. Other than the memories of Rabindranath they have several museum carrying the moments of Tagore's life."

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Ayub Q,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Fascinating,"For visitors to Kolkata, specially those with a little interest in Bengali culture and history, a visit to the Jorashanko Thakur Bari is a must.Built in the 18th century, this is the ancestral home of Rabindranath Tagore, the great poet and the first non European Nobel laureate. Tagore was born in this house, spent much of his childhood here and died in the house in 1941.The Thakur Bari has been turned into a museum, showcasing Tagore's work and the life of Tagore and the Tagore family. It also showcases other stalwarts of Tagore's time.The Jorasanko Thakur Bari has been restored to the way the household looked when the Tagore family lived there. This gives us a glimpse into their life. The museum has 3 galleries, one dedicated to Tagore and his work and the other two to the Tagore family and other luminaries of the time. It is said to contain about 700 paintings and numerous rare photographs of Tagore and his contemporaries. Though one can take photographs of the grounds and the buildings from outside for a small fee, photography inside the house is not permitted. We found it interesting that young locals thronged the grounds, happily and noisily taking photographs and virtually having a picnic, while those inside the museum were mostly visitors from outside.We also found it interesting that a caretaker came up to us and lamented that "" Tagore's Shrine"" was not treated with the respect it deserved. He opined that the youth of today had no respect for history and tradition. The eternal complaint of age against youth."

Rabindra Bharati University is painstakingly looking after this place which was donated to them by the family. The house is beautiful with history written everywhere... I was in awe of the whole place and especially Rabindranath Tagore's last days.. There are lots of exhibits and one will need 3-4 hours to see the whole place. Mind you, the second floor is not very well kept and things are dusty as is full Kolkata !! I wish they could have more funds to look after the place more better.. I think about 40% of the house is what we get to see and the rest of the building is not maintained and is shut down.I must add that the volunteers have done a great job of the light and music show in the evenings which ONE SHOULD NOT MISS... its a must watch and I was so delighted to hear Gulzar's voice. The house lights up so well and the yesteryears come alive with the beautiful story rendering done by talented artists which is famous in Kolkata.. the show is an historical wonder and I just feel they should add some fans for mosquitoes. The show generally starts at about 6.15 pm as daylight is now longer.. so maybe it may be delayed as summers' set in.. The people are wonderful and the visit to this house is a must.."

As a keen history buff, this place tells nothing that you couldnt get a better understanding free on the net. There is little continuity in the displays. In fact, some are even presented telling the story in reverse. There is almost nothing displayed of the original life. Furniture mostly gone. Lots of concrete. They charge additional to take pics of the outside of the building. For what. It is a construction of minor architectural  interest other than to show how the few lucky privileged lived walled off from the squallor and filth outside. They dont allow pictures inside at all. For what? There is almost nothing worthy of a pic inside and virtually nothing original. A waste of time and money. Surely this privileged family could show more respect to their ancestor and see it is done properly."

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,DoiBedouin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,The Bonedi Thakurbari,"The main building is now turned into a museum with the artefacts of the progenies of Maharshi Dwarkanath Thakur. The first room at the entrance depicted the then “Baithakkhana” with an attached kitchen.   The next room was of Rabindranath himself and it was here he breathed his last.  Through his room, the inner corridor and other rooms (Andar Mahal) are accessible. The other rooms on first floor are dedicated to Rabindranath Thakur’s various visits all over the world.  Rabindranath himself was no less a traveller in his times.  He visited 36 countries.  The halls are dedicated to his visit to Japan, China, USA and Hungary.  The hall of China is turned to a miniature Chinese monastery with similar ambiance- with hanging Chinese lanterns and Chinese paintings on the wall,  a miniature Buddha in the adjacent hall,  followed by a seating hall with scriptures and porcelains from China,  giving way to the last hall with Chinese books.  The entrance to the hall is itself a lookalike of a monastery entrance.  The stairs to the second floor led to the Hall of USA and Hungary with features depicting the places.  The hall of USA has a mini Statue of Liberty, one would also find the famous frame shared by Einstein and Rabindranath here.  These are all situated in the Andar Mahal and the trail through the house is made comfortable by air conditioning, the trail through the inside veranda is shaded by typical the then matted curtains (madur-parda). Best time to Visit:  In March during Basanta Utsav, or during May, especially on Rabindranath Thakur's (9th may) birthday.

Located in Jorasanko, North Kolkata, his ancestral home is better known as ‘Jorasanko Thakurbari’ (scripted on the entry gate as well). Built by the poet’s grandfather, Prince Dwarikanath Tagore in the 18th century, the entrance plaque reads ‘Rabindranath was born and breathed his last here’. Though the building has been recognized as Rabindra Bharati University, a part of this 217 years old erection is a museum (Rabindra Bharati Museum) to Tagore’s family culture and customs. The poet spent most of his childhood days and his final days in this house. Tagore family was always highbrow and ahead of their time. The museum held galleries dedicated to Tagore family with their photographs. It showcases emerging of Tagore into a world famous poet and finally a Nobel laureate. Along with the poet’s works and paintings the galleries display works of other distinguished family members like Maharshi Devendranath Tagore (poet’s father) and Abanindranath Tagore (poet’s nephew).

The woman in charge of the top most floor was very friendly, we had good conversation. The other floor incharge were cooperative too. Most of the gallery been modernized so I usually didn't get the old vibe. Now after coming down to the grounds area & taking few shots the guard started shouting no you can't take more pics, you can't take pictures by posing like a model!! Bla bla. He literally pushed us out of the courtyard area. So yeah, the overall experience was very bad for me. Not gonna going back to this way too commercialized place ever."
Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,Gavster Bedlington,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Overbearing staff ruin the cultural grace of the heritage property.,"There's no escaping Tagore when you arrive in Kolkata - his writings our etched on the airport roof . So you would think the museum opened in his family home would elicit the importance of his standing but sadly no. The exhibitions are dry and the layout confusing , signage in Bengali not useful to international visitors and parts look a little tired .A sheer lack of creativity in exhibiting his belongings and furniture. Most bizarrely is the strict lack of photography but ok that's the rule and heaven help you if you happen to use your mobile for a non photographic duty . We wanted to remember a quote and were busy typing it into our notes and where castigated by a surly guard . We tried to explain what we were doing , we asked to speak to a curator and she came over with a mobile phone - but hers was an official phone. We then asked her to write the quote down on paper for us and she wouldn't . We asked if we could buy the quote in the shop. The shop was shut . We were then given permission to record it on our notes on the phone but under the beady watch of a guard. It just seems so pompous and ridiculous of preventing the works and recognition of Tagore to be unknown except for intellectuals an ethos living in Bengal. And certainly far removed from the man himself was trying to promote in the sharing of idea. And don't get us started on the abrupt guard who deals with taking the shoes. The staff here need some serious and urgent training in customer service and welcoming visitors as without them they won't have a job when it goes under."

Jorasanko_Thakur_Bari,tunai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,An Illustrous House of Culture!,"Tagore is Bengal's greatest 20th century poet, the first Asian to win the Nobel prize and this was the house where he was born in 1861 and where he died in 1941. Jorasanko Thakur Bari is inseparable from the cultural heritage of all Bengalis. It is also one of the grand mansions of Old Calcutta, built in the 18th century.  I was back after 10 years and glad to see that there are now exhibits devoted to Tagore's relationship with the US as well as China and Japan. And a whole new section on his final illness, surgery and death.  Although the house is well maintained, the signage needs improvement.  They will send you to  the third floor first and it takes a while to figure out that this was where Tagore's grandfather lived.  There are often  few clues as to  how other rooms were used and who were the residents. Instead, there is an overabundance of literary texts and artifacts. For Westerners, it can be a little perplexing, especially if you're not familiar with the history of the house, the family and Tagore's  work.  Some preliminary research is recommended. The best way to get here is to take the metro to Girish Park station. It's an easy walk from there."
