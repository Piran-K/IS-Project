Kalighat_Kali_Temple,jinshui,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,"Gross, disgusting, unkept temple with greedy touts","We are not worshippers. We chose to visit this temple as it was highlighted as one of the places of interest in Kolkata. This review is from a tourist pt of view. This temple has to be the most gross and dirtiest one among all those we have visited in India.  There were a lot of touts surrounding the temple singling us out to offer us ""VIP"" line. First, we were told to remove our shoes and then they wanted 500rupees pp to skip the line.  i looked at the ground and shook my head. You have to walk bare foot for at least 30-40meters to the so called VIP entrance. The problem is not the distance. it is the ground. It was semi dried mud, with traces of broken glass, garbage, faeces, etc  I had trouble walking that with my shoes on let alone in my bare feet. Sewer water flowed alongside while on going construction nearby added to debris piling everywhere, We walked around and found the ""VIP entrance"" . Some Indian tourists ready to enter that door told me they paid 100rupees each and left their shoes ""around the corner"", as told by their tout.  Reluctant to remove my shoes to step on those filthy earth- mud ground, we continued to walk around the temple and found the main entrance of the temple. There, the real line stood. We stood in amazement at the throngs of people, standing in a rough line. Every one, except a few, were in bare feet, holding their spot nearly skin to skin to the person in front of them, facing the shut entrance gate, waiting for it to be opened. One couple near the front of the line told us they have been waiting for at least 2 hours. They encouraged us to go queue up and forget about the vip fees. Eventually, we found our way to the back and saw the end of the line. There were at least a few hundred people. So, we decided to turn back and pay the 100rp. The touts were waiting for us. Except this time, there was a lady who created a shoe station right at the Vip entry. So, now, we are just a few steps away from entering the temple. I didnt think it was too bad to tread over the dirty ground for just a bit. However, by then, since it was near 4pm, the reopening of the temple, the VIP entrance is now swamped with about 20 people, all pushing and shoving with plastic buckets of offering over their head, fighting to be the first to enter the temple. As the flood gate opened, these people began pushing harder and one lady nearly fell over. There was a young Indian couple who look like a newly-wed. The girl in a pretty indian sari must look like she was 14? We were caught in the middle of the group, being shoved around as it inched towards the steps. After stepping into the temple, i was flabbergasted because the grounds inside was WORSE than outside. It was wet and slippery. There was a manhole cover seemed barely closed, emitting disgusting smells. Walls were old and paint peeling off, tiles broken or chipped. The whole building looked like it has not been maintained and  looked sad and neglected. We continued to be moved by the crowds from one spot to another. Our tout tried to find a back way ""up"" the temple but were stopped. He then explained something in Hindi to a lady in uniform who gave us a special access up the stairs. Many others were yelling and gesticulating, wanting to get in faster. Up the narrow steps, we found ourselves in a small platform, there another mob scene with about 10-20 worshippers were yelling and fighting to gain access to the front of the deity, whom we think was behind a window. Below and behind us, we saw more people whom i imagined came in from the ""proper public line"". I feel bad for them because despite waiting for hours, it looked unlikely they  could ever get up to where we were. A very old and short lady stood next to us, in a corner to avoid being squashed by the mob. On the other side, a beggar stretched out his hands begging... Someone from across the room saw our wide eyes and used two hands to motion the international ""wait, calm down"" sign. TBH, my son and i were more amused than frightened as we witnessed the fervour and frantic behavior of the devotees.  After a while, our tout used his arms to create a free spot for us to stand at the front so we could see what was behind the window. We had like 5 seconds max before someone pushed us out. All i remember seeing was a fire pit with a 2 feet tall fire by my feet and i didnt want to be pushed over it and be set on fire. My son said he saw the deity with 3 eyes and multiple arms. Then, we were urshered out - same way we came in. that's when i realized we entered through the ""exit"".On our way out, our tout asked, ""happy?"". We shrugged and he put an orange  paint mark in the middle of our forehead. We were hoping to see architecture marvel but we received a first hand experience of a religious frenzy.  Given the disgusting surrounding, we would not recommend this visit to any tourists, including worshippers."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Radhika,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Worst traumatic and horrible experience,"Kalighat temple is the worst experience i have ever had. I had been to Kolkotta twice , but this is my last visit to this shaktipeeth. Pandas (priest) will surround you and loot your all money in the name of kali and her shringhaar ( make up of the id) , even when you say you are left with no money , they will keep an eye on your wallet , if you appear well off, they will target you. Your money will be exhausted , and they will not let you go , then the same money is distributed among the gang . I came out furious . Not at all peaceful place like dakhineshwar . Will never visit in any lifetime . Forget this life"
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,PiyaChatterjee,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Horrible experience,Extremely mismanaged and a place where goons (disguised as pandas) try to loot gullible visitors. My 75yr old dad was surrounded by pandas and some of them tried to pull out his wallet. My 8yr old daughter was pulled and pushed. It left a really bad taste in the mouth
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Polly Chakraborty,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Family,Visit to Kalighat temple,"A hopelessly managed temple with corrupt culture of loot in the name of religion. If Victoria memorial, birla planetarium, belur math, dakshineshwar can be managed why not kalighat. Rs. 330/person for vip Kota but no queue and system, too much crowd to handle. Darshan not possible. Will never visit again!!"
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Shambu K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,Horrifying experience,"I visited this place in 2021, and have to say this is the worst place on earth. They just rip you off the moment you arrive there. Next, I saw the main statue of the goddess there were cockroaches on it and the priests were rude and abusive. Everywhere we went we were harassed. There is a river at back but that is only a sewage now. Then we heard that everyday the so called goddess gets many sacrifices of animals. I lost faith in this cult of Goddess worship. I would say no one should go here !"
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Sanghamitra Das,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Sinful nature of people in charge of kalighat temple clearly showed that the temple no longer remain a religious place.,"Yesterday me and my sister visited kalighat temple at around 5:45 p.m. with intention to watch Mother's sondhya arati.  After having darshan of Mother from the veranda in front of her garvagriha we were waiting quietly in the veranda at one corner for the arati to begin without disturbing other darshanarthis. At around 6:30 p.m. without stating proper reason two ladies on duty tried to pull us out of the veranda but as they failed to do so another person told us that he will arrange for arati viewing for us and based on his words we get out of the veranda. Very soon we realized he actually played a trick to get us out of the veranda so that people whom the temple pandas and committee members approve can only see the arati from front. Even one lady who claimed kalighat temple to be their private property told that she will decide who will watch arati and who will not according to her wish. All this arrogance, playing tricks for self-interest  and speaking untruth, of people who are in charge of the temple clearly shows Kalighat temple at present does not meet the qualities  that a religious place should meet. Hence, I took resolution not to visit Kalighat temple any more in my life time."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Akhil N,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Couples,Save us from priest’s,It’s was a very bad experience. I did not feel like I was visiting a temple. Priests behave like gangsters. They forced/demand me to pay 5000 rupees and did not let me out. Unsafe place. Beware - Will be looted by the touts.
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Rahul,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Commercialised temple,"I did not feel like I was visiting a temple. Walk towards it and you are immediately confronted by pandas (priests or brahmins) offering you special access at a premium, touts selling flowers and pooja materials and eunuchs. The place too is unclean and one does not feel the bliss usually associated with temples. You dont pay, you cant make it inside, that's the problem there. No administration or police to make sure devotees are untroubled. Seems like one complete business set up. I would not recommend going there unless you are either willing to be extremely thick skinned and shameless or willing to shell out money as and when asked."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,gpradeepshenoy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Solo,Visit only if you're a devotee,"This sakthipeeth is situated about 15 minutes walk from exit of Kalighat metro station (please check the correct exit gate number ).   I went to this temple on a Thursday evening and it was empty . Had darshan of Godess Kali easily and quickly . The area surrounding the temple is not kept clean . Many people who claim to be pandas (priest's)will approach you when you are near the temple promising quick and easy darshan, plz avoid them. One bad thing in this temple is everyone including main priest's of the temple are money oriented and almost everyone in the temple will ask for money which is very bad.   Mixed feelings after visiting this temple. Temple surroundings must be kept more clean and people inside temple including priests must be taught how to behave with other's."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Sushant S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Bad experience. WB Tourism turning a blind eye.,Very powerful temple but unfortunately had a bad experience here. I have roamed whole of India but have never seen a more badly managed and unsafe temple.Being from out of town we were cheated by the touts pretending to be priests. They even threatened that ill things would befall us if we didn't pay money to one of the touts. Near the deity a tout will threaten you again and not allow to leave till Rs 500 is paid (which would never go to the deity or temple). Despite numerous complaints it is surprising that West Bengal Tourism is taking no action.If from out of town please do not visit without a local to give you company.
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Amit P,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Family,"Chaos, mismanagement and looting in the name of Godess.","This is one of the most poorly managed temple in whole india. Chaos, mismanagement, rampant looting of the devotees at every possible corners are  most common findings here. No covid protocol is being maintained here so take care of your own health. This place should be visited only by the true devotees of godess kali and by those people who have good quarreling and fighting skills, other people should avoid this place at all cost as they will be looted by every possible crooks present there masquerading as priests or pandas. First when you reach there, agents of puja offering shops will approach you to buy offerings from them. They will not tell you prices of all the items, most of the charges are hidden, it is that when you come back and going to pay them then they will demand exorbitant amount from you. So either enquire about the exact amount before hand or avoid their trap in the first place. Then if you enter the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctoram then the main priest will again try to loot you by telling you some fake stories or some emotional quotes and will force you to donate hefty amount of money in the name of temple committee but truly speaking there is no such thing as temple fund as you won't get any receipt of your donation, the entire amount will eventually go to the pocket of the priests so be careful inside the sanctum also. Then there are numerous pickpockets present inside the temple complex, if you go early in the morning then it is fine but if you go there after 9 am or in the evening when there is tremendous rush, there is every possibility of your purse, mobile or money being snatched from your pocket by pickpockets. So you have to keep yourself safe from pandas, priests, shop agents, pickpockets, beggers - all these people. There is no queue management method as well, during peak times, 3-4 lines from different directions will converge at the gate of sanctum, and there will be paid VIPs who will jump the queues and enter straight into the sanctum, there will be total chaos and nobody will know exactly what is happening there. Inspite of all these difficulties, if some true devotee of maa kali wants to visit the place then it is advisable to visit early in the morning or at late evening otherwise 3-4 hrs will be wasted and money or mobile can get snatched away by thugs. I will not recommend this temple at all because the main purpose of visiting a temple is to get some mental peace ,to be free from worries but sadly those will not bee possible here and after getting looted by crooks or pickpockets, peace will disappear and mental agony will loom large on you."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Bhaskar_10,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Joi Maa Kali : Save us from the priests,"Darshan on 11th Feb 2021 at 6.15am - MorningEasily accessible by Bus, Metro, Auto, Rickshaw, Taxi or by walk. Taxi's and Auto drop off point is Kalighat Police Station which is 200mts from the temple so be prepared for the small walk especially if you have any elderly member with you.The temple opening time of 6am and early darshan is probably very convenient as less rush at this hour. Beware of the touts and priests who will definitely line up to entice you for grand darshan starting from INR 50/- onwards but this is a free facility so why pay. Also while buying flowers please buy the fresh lots as they are very affordable - a 54 floral garland will cost INR 10/- while 108 floral garland will cost INR 20/-. For Prasad you can stick to INR 21/- or  31/- . Follow the queue to the sanctum sanctorum where the Kali Maa Deity presides and pay your offerings and seek blessings. the priests will ask for INT 100/- onwards, just be deaf and walk away.Cleanliness and temple maintenance can be better but no complaints.Security / Shoe racks / queue facilities if better provided then it will help in more inflow of pilgrims.One of the Shakti Peeth this is very pious place for Hindus. Anyone visiting for the 1st time specially female tourist or pilgrims are advised to go to a shop and take prasad and keep your shoes there. Request them to send one of their employees to escort you to the temple and then out. You may pay them INR 50/- for this service but it will be helpful, this is my personal suggestion only.This place provides immense peace and divine feeling upon the darshan of Maa Kali.Joi Maa Kali"
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Saravanan Srinivasan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Divine Experience,This is within the city of Kolkata and reaching this place is easy by public transport. I took a metro and it cost me 5 INR from MG road. I would highly recommend not to talk to the touts or shopkeepers about the temple. If you are planning to offer flowers it's highly advisable to get it enroute and not near the temple Please take some time to stand in the queue and have the darshan. You will not regret it The touts make their way in thanks to the administrators of the temple.They really mess up things and are behind only money I felt very calm inspite of all the commotion outside.Thanks to the Almighty
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Arun K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,HOLIEST  SHAKTI  PEETHAM,"Kalighat Temple, located in Kolkata is one of the 51 Shakti Sthals of India & is one of the most visited Kali temples in India. Located at the spot , where the toes of Sati's right foot fell during Shiva's Tandava dance. It is said that Kalighat was where Chowranga Giri, a Dasanami monk, worshipped Maa Kali with great austerity and has thus been known as a religious center of Maa Kali  for centuries. This 200-year-old temple embodies the principle that only divine knowledge can subsume sodomized ego, akin to an Asura. Situated on the banks of Adi Ganga, the temple has a sanctum sanctorum along with a huge hall in the name of Nat Mandir. In the north-east of this sanctum, there is a Shiva Temple. There is one more shrine dedicated to Radha Krishna. The main attraction of this temple lies in the image of Goddess Kali that bears a long protruded tongue made out of gold.Devotees throng this temple during festivals like Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Poila Boishakh, the Bengali New Year day and Sankranti to seek blessing of Maa Kali.Visited the temple with great devotion but disappointed to see the unfriendly & rude behavior of greedy priests near main deity, demanding money all the time .  The temple authorities should look in to the matter as such persons are spoiling reputation of such a holy peeth."

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Sea Dweller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Very beautiful temple,"Kalighat was a Ghat, sacred to Kali on the old course (Adi Ganga) of the Hooghly river (Bhāgirathi) in the city of Kolkata. The name Calcutta is said to have been derived from the word Kalighat. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga which connects to the Hooghly. The Adi Ganga was the original course of the river Hooghly. Hence the name Adi (original) Ganga.     The Kalighat temple in its present form is only about 200 years old, although it has been referred to in Mansar Bhasan composed in the 15th century, and in Kavi Kankan Chandi of the 17th century. The present structure of the temple was completed under the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family's patronage in 1809.     Currently, the area around the temple is very built up and crowds of pilgrims are constantly here. Unfortunately, taking pictures inside the temple is prohibited."

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,mamta w,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Beware of pandas,This is one shakti peeth and i am disappointed to see how the trust/ pandas manage it. Devotees spend time and money to visit this place and the end experience is feeling cheated. The dont let u do darshan unless u pay a good amount. Right from the time you get out of ur car/ transport  they keep asking for money. Elders/ people with young kids are mishandled. Good management is need of the hour at this temple. Do not take money/ wallet any valuable things with yourself when going to the temple.They hardly let you take darshan of the idol.

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Rupsha_Mumbai,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Avoidable trip,"Kalighat temple is a landmark temple in Kolkata, attracting hordes of devotees every day. There are shops/stalls on both sides of the approach road selling various knick knacks. The temple premises are crowded and the biggest issue are the pandas who will charge you arbitrary sums of money for entering the temple, offering pooja, their own fees and what not. It leaves you with a very bad feeling, so my suggestion is not to engage with them at all and just make an attempt to enter the temple on your own, though there is no guarantee you will be able to get through to the shrine of the deity for darshan. In any case, your devotion does not depend on what you pay to pandas, so dont feel bad if you cant actually see the idol because of unscrupulous people like them. We were practically left empty handed after paying up whatever cash we were carrying. I went with my father but the panda asked us to offer pooja separately so that he could rip us off separately, twice ! Then he had the nerve to ask us to go to the nearby ATM to get more cash to pay his fees. We didnt oblige obviously but nevertheless we felt totally cheated by the experience. This guy even kept asking us about what we do, where we are from, maybe because they adjust their ""rate cards"" according to what they think is our spending ability. It is probably best to avoid this place or else be very firm about not taking help from any pandas."

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,NKS,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Kalighat Temple - Terrible experience inside/ out being surrounded by greedy priest, goons and thugs","Hi - I traveled to India to visit the Kalighat temple and I was shocked to see how corrupt the priests were. Not only that, it was disturbing to see how they man handled devotees (including women!!!) just because those devotees did not bribe them to deserve to just see the deity. Most devotees saw the Maata's deity from far and only those who flashed rupees were allowed to walk in. Moreover, there was a group of goons to scare people off and who occupied most of the temple space. I had to flash money at them (from far) and then was allowed to walk in to get closer to the deity and my family members who didn't flash money at them were not allowed the Darshan - What a shame! I have been asked for a review internationally and I am going to provide them the facts as-is. It is also interesting to note that their website does not have an option for review or ""contact"" so unless higher authorities are involved, these guys can operate under the radar and continue with this. It is also worth noting that the ""president"" of this temple is nominated as a District judge - this is what the country coming down to - sad and a shameful situation."

There are N number of cheats roaming around in this temple, fleecing tourists. Wonder what the administration is doing out there. We were 5 people of a family who did the mistake of going to this temple without groundwork.It was obvious that we were outsiders with our getups and our language. It started with one priest(cheat) who gave an offer of Rs 200 per head if we wanna just see the Kali statue OR Rs 350 per head if we want to touch the deity(As if he owns the deity!).Should have kicked his a** then and there itself,didn't do it and it was a big mistake.We opted for the first option & gave him 1000 Rs and went ahead with him.Inside the temple,everyone were heckling each other in the so called queue,temple priest was demanding money to be put in his pooja thali, screaming at the top of his voice near the deity. Somehow came out of it, then we were directed to go in front of another priest who started chanting sanskrit shlokas for me and my wife. He asked me to repeat those and demanded Rs 2100 to be put in his thali. Next my wife was asked to repeat some other shlokas and asked to put Rs 1500. After the shloka exercise,one coconut was given to be broken in front of so called deity which was shown to us in the wall and asked to deposit Rs 500. Everything happened in a matter of few minutes.At this moment i lost my cool,I directed my family members to come out of the temple and  demanded all my money back from these cheats ,threatening to call POLICE.The priest came and  asked me to take all the money from his lungi.For some reason,i took only 4K Rs back which i regret. On our way back ,the beggars were heckling us . I assume all of these people,starting from the first priest to the beggar are part of this fraud nexus operating in the temple.I recommend not to visit this temple or go with a local if you are a tourist and never ever show how much money you have in your purse."

This is a religious place of worship and one comes there to seek blessings and peace but alas it will be difficult to get.This temple is soaked in history and full of Panda's (priests) who are waiting to feast on you (and your money of course). If that was not enough there are hoards of people who too come here to seek blessings and peace.The best way to explore the temple is to have a local with you who knows the way around. The Priests irrespective will haunt you for money on pretext or other. It is also said early mornings of week days are better. We were there on a rainy weekend morning when the whole city was flooded but the Panda's are there waiting for a catch of the minute.It is harrowing and despite paying multiple currencies getting an eyeful of the deity is difficult. Beware of the junior Panda's who will forcefully tie or garland the holy thread and demand money. They look for kids for victims of such acts as adults usually shoo them away.Saturdays there is sacrifice of a goat and we happen to see a baby goat post the sacrifice soaked in its blood. It happens twice a week.Not to forget be careful with your wallets, cash, mobiles and valuables.In Short, for a Millisecond view of the Deity please be prepared for a LOT OF PENANCE. Better visit with a local or just pray from the road in the vicinity if you have to. The streets too have loads of beggars and hawkers chasing you.Photography Prohibited!"

We stood in a pavilion in front of the main shrine (which you could still go into) and couldn't see Kali Mata due to the crowds; the priest with us parted the crowd with a shout for 1 second and we caught barely a glimpse of Kali Mata, but the darshan was not satisfying at all. The pandas tried to rush us off, but we fought and made them show Kali Mata again, and we finally saw Her properly. The priest then tried to convince us that bags and mobiles were not allowed in the main darshan line (they are), and he said he could take care of them, an offer we were highly skeptical of, so we refused and left. The shop owner from the beginning tried charging us 1151 rupees for the offering basket he initially said cost 200 rupees, and we fought with him and left in a huff; as we turned onto the main road, one of the shop owner's friends came and talked to us and said ""oh, it's always like this here, that shop is one of the best,"" which solidified our negative experience; why was he trying to invalidate our feelings and experiences?Go to this temple only if you're prepared to ignore all the shop owners and pandas asking for money. Everything, including darshan, is free (except maybe a tip to the shoe keeper close to the entrance). Prepare yourself mentally before visiting Kalighat; it's a very draining environment and experience. Shops near the temple are good, though."

This priest had his arrangement with local stores where we put our shoes and washed our hands and feet. Then we went to the VIP line which was much shorter than the extremely long regular line. I always feel guilty going in the VIP lines. I feel like I'm cheating but I quietly did what I was told. The priest with me warned me that they will try to ""sell"" me extra blessing inside for couple of thousand Indian Rupees and not to fall for that. He was right and it was disappointing to see how such a beautiful divine place has become a business but then again its Kalyug. The VIP line took about an hour and I was in no rush. It have me more opportunity to be so close to Mata and focus on her. I think there is positive hidden in everything. Cannot wait to go again and quietly sit and take it all in. Jai Mata Di"

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Go581028,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Not for the faint-hearted,"Unlike most of the other reviewers, I visited the famous Kalighat temple as a tourist from the UK, with almost no knowledge of Hindu religious practice.I had been advised by a local person in Kolkata that the temple was to be avoided. Nevertheless I took the opportunity to visit with a local friend who was familiar with the temple. My trusted local guide was essential. Knowing about this temple's reputation and with no knowledge of Bengali or Hindi, I would never have attempted a visit on my own.Firstly, the temple entrance is not that obvious - it's quite a small structure set back from the street. We first visited a shop (there scores of such places) where we left our shoes, washed our hands and got flowers for our offerings. They said we could pay on our return and seemed quite honest - this particular shop was recommended by my friend.Then things started to get busy. The ground was dirty, we saw various shrines outside the main building. Saw a number of goats being prepared for sacrifice. I declined an invitation to go into the sacrificial area where the goats were being decapitated.Then, fighting off the offers of ""VIP treatment"" we joined the queue to enter the main shrine to see the goddess. The queue was quite fast moving. By the time we were entering the very narrow entrance to the shrine, there was a lot of  jostling and pushing. Inside was chaotic crowds with people having just a few seconds to lay their offering in front of Kali. I was very surprised by the statue itself - it was nothing like the usual portrayals of Kali I had seen in paintings.On the advice of my friend, I paid 151 Rupees for the offering (they asked for 501). Which seemed very reasonable.The area around the temple has many beggars and souvenir stalls. Be careful with your valuables when visiting the area. The ban on photography inside the temple is strictly enforced.Overall, a memorable, exhausting but unique experience. Made possible for me only with a local trusted companion."

However if you stay firm this temple is worth a visit. The whole complex is fascinating as is the image of Kali herself in the centre - make sure the pundit allows you to see it and don't be rushed past. The pundit will latch onto you immediately as you enter and will not go away so you've got him with you the whole time,  he will try and force the pace of your looking round so he can get onto the next visitor - resist and take your time. He will ask for a donation to the temple - that's reasonable as there's no entrance fee. He will later ask you to buy ""a bag of rice for the poor"" for 2000 rupees - that equates to about 40 kilos. just refuse. He will then say a prayer for you and ask for a ""personal donation"", again depends on how good a guide he's been. You need to keep friendly though, so be very polite, also you shoes will be unattended for a long time!Despite this, stay focussed on looking at the temple and the people - it's definitely worthwhile despite all the above!!! Photography is prohibited.The shops outside the temple sell a lot of souvenirs so have a look. Finally, nothing to do with the temple itself but beware of pickpockets in the streets outside."

One of them insisted us to leave our footwear under a small shop, and compelled us to buy so called PRASHAD from the same shop. We did not like those dirty sweets in that small and dirty shop. But after taking our footwear they made everything compulsory and looted Rs. 300/-. Even we could not  see Kali Maata even for two seconds. Surprisingly there was no such rush there, that time except the bunch of business men, looters and so called Purohits. Why there is no attention by any endowment authority or some other government department?

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Sumit Kasera,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Painful experience at Kalighat,"Over the years and with many experiences across different religious places, I have developed great dislike for temple visits – especially because of generally unclean places, presence of crooks or beggars in most of such places, and mad rush for money – when the purpose is possibly the exact opposite. The visit to Kalighat was driven by the simple reason that it was one of the Shaktipeeth. While the Hindy Mythology has interesting background on origin of the Shakti Peetha, the most popular is based on the story of the death of the goddess Sati. Out of grief and sorrow, Shiva carried Sati's body, reminiscing about their moments as a couple, and roamed around the universe with it. Vishnu had cut her body into 52 body parts, using his Sudarshana Chakra, which fell on Earth to become sacred sites where all the people can pay homage to the Goddess. While Kolkata was my birth place, my visits to Kalighat was always one of detest due to the crowd and lack of cleanliness. After marriage, the only driving force was the pledge to show all Shakti peetha to my spouse (some of which were outside India) – hence the visit to Kalighat.We got very early in the morning and were at the temple around 5.30am. The place was quite dirty and unkempt. The car stopped at a distance and then we used narrow bylanes to reach the temple. There was no direction or signage to assist the tourist. The early dawn was yet to set in and the cleaning up of the streets was taking place. Small ramshackle shops were selling flowers and coconuts for worship. One of our relatives talked to some of the priests and we went straight inside the temple. So, while the queue for ordinary folks waited, we did our puja at leisure. After the puja (workship) was over, there was haggle of the money to be paid – small sums were exchanged and that was that. There was no feeling of devotion or worship. It was just push and shove, haggle for money, and dirt and filth all around.The first shakti peetha had been visited. But I wonder if for an ordinary tourist, was it worth a visit?"

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,SSMP_10,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,"Sacred temple, but beware of touts/pandas","Kalighat temple is dedicated to goddess Kali and is a very famous and old temple. Thousands of people come from different parts of India to visit this sacred place. But every body should be cautious about pandas/touts. One can go to the garbhgruha through a queue without donating money to pandas. Please do not take any kind of help from the pandas, otherwise you will be asked to pay for it. If one has to offer puja/ flower etc., buy directly from vendor, stand in queue and go to the inner sanctum for puja purpose. Do not allow any people from the sweet selling shop to accompany with you, he may demand money."

Kalighat_Kali_Temple,saminternetmarketing,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,"Very sacred temple of powerful Goddess Kali, but beware of Thugs.","The temple is very old and powerful. People from across India throng to the Kalighat temple to visit it. It is very famous but has been becoming infamous of late because of the open robbery by the pandas and thugs in Kalighat.There is a deep nexus between the pandas, the main priest, security guard and all touts approaching you. So, do not shell out a single rupee because if you do you will fall into a never ending trap.Let me explain how it works. Several pandas approach you right from the area where the main entrance of Kalighat starts. They will ask you just Rs. 101 to provide you a VIP entry into the temple even if there is no queue. They will take you through the entrance without following the queue. If there is a long queue, you may save some time, but if not its just the same. They will also ask you to buy some flowers and offerings etc. from some nearby shop. This is where it all starts.After you take the flowers and offerings inside the temple, and go near the Maa Kaali Pratima, there will be a priest standing their. He will chant some mantras and put the mala around your neck. And then his assistant will light a fire and let you take some blessings from the holy fire. He will put a tilak on your forehead and give you back your prasad/offerings. Until then it is all perfectly fine.Next what happens is really bad. The main panda extorts money out of you. He will ask for a very high amount. He will say that the rituals he just performed for you costs Rs. 1100 and his fees is Rs. 500 extra. If you do not pay the amount, they may man handle you, insult you and even abuse you. There was a couple ahead of us who was harassed and made to pay Rs. 1600. The man came with his child and baby. The priest started threatening him that he had done the pooja and now he had to pay otherwise something very bad will happen to him and his family. The poor guy gave up and paid after being harassed for around 5 minutes by the main panda and his assistants.Our driver told us that the pandas are thugs and hence we did not take their services. We went inside on our own. The queue was not long and so, it took around 10-15 minutes for us to enter the temple. We were near the pratima within half an hour. We did not have offerings so, we just joined our hands and prayed to maa. The priest put a tika on my forehead and demanded money. I wanted to donate Rs. 100 to the temple but since I know this money will go entirely to the priest who is probably making crores every month from the thousands of visitors visiting everyday, I decided to give just Rs. 10. He angrily asked for more money. When I said I will not give more, he just pushed me asked me to leave. Luckily I knew how to speak Bengali. So, I told him that none of my friends will give any money and the money I gave was for all. His assistant shouted as me saying that since I have given Rs. 10, I should engrave my name on the temple. he wanted to insult me.Then my friends went through the same situation. They did not know Bengali and were harassed by the priest. The priest told one of the ladies who did not give up to the bullying of the priest and refused to give any money - ""You have money to go to beauty parlor and watch Shahrukh Khan movie, but no money to give to temple!"". Another friend of who gave Rs. 10 was insulted by the priest as well. The priest told to him - ""You can spend lakhs to go to Bangkok and around the world but you cannot give a few hundred rupees in the temple!"".This was an absolutely shocking experience for my friends. So, I suggest everyone going to Kalighat temple to be prepared for such experience. You should be ready to argue with the pandas and refuse to give any money. If you want to give money for temple development, there should be other ways and you should always get a receipt."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,amitava g,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Jai Maa Kali,"5star for its traditional architecture, build,religious value, history and above all the Deity. 3 star for the chaos and mismanagement. Be careful with your belongings during darshan. If u visit only for the sake of visiting then it's okay."
Kalighat_Kali_Temple,Suman Sankar Ghosh,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017,One need to be super religious to visit this place,A utterly dirty place full of crooks and cheats. Beware about your belongings and whom you are talking. Better to visit during odd hours as it tends to be extremely crowded. If you are super religious then only dare to visit.

Be careful of people approaching you to `help' out..best proceed on your own speed. Plenty of police about who hopefully will be happy to help.
