Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,Abu Taher,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Zoological gardens,"The Zoological Garden, Alipore (also informally called the Alipore Zoo or Kolkata Zoo) is India's oldest formally stated zoological park and a big tourist attraction in Kolkata, West Bengal. It has been open as a zoo since 1876, and covers 18.811 ha (46.48 acres). It is probably best known as the home of the Aldabra giant tortoise Adwaita, who was reputed to have been over 250 years old when he died in 2006. It is also home to one of the few captive breeding projects involving the Manipur brow-antlered deer. One of the most popular tourist attractions in Kolkata, it draws huge crowds during the winter season, especially during December and January. The highest attendance till date was on January 1, 2018 with 110,000 visitors."
Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,Zac Chacko,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,A good zoo to visit ,"Went with four children 11-14 years old. We could go around the whole zoo in about 3 hours. The enclosures were quite nice and the animals well looked after it seemed. Some have glass walls so you get a good view. The weather was not very hot so there was some comfort in the shady parts. Otherwise, it just about stretched the endurance of the troupe. Adequate places to buy water and refreshments are there inside the Zoo. Overall a pleasant experience."

Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,Anjan Sengupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,Losing the Glory,"Apart from being the oldest Zoo in India, this was once considered to the largest too. Sadly, the glory doesn‚Äôt remail here as of now. As on today, its a small Zoo with nothing unique. Years of apathy from the Government Authorities have taken a toll on this Zoo. This can be visited if you have children with you, but you will be disappointed if you had already visited some of the bigger Zoos in India."

Zoo is very mismanaged, no proper indications for directions and not sequentially arranged. Aviary is not good very less variety of birds, in reptile section most of the cages were empty. Animals were not well fed..no lion(only one lioness), no wolf, porcupine or apes(other than one chimpanzee). People were sitting on ground and eating food, littering garbage here and there.Can give it a miss if its not your first zoo visit."

The panther was panting as it made its rounds. There was a group of menacing wild cats which growled in anticipation. I caught a Monitor Lizard sunbathing, swimming and rock-climbing, and a couple of zebras sleeping in standing position. There were a lot of small, newborn tortoises in many compartments. An ill-tempered chimpanzee was seen throwing his excreta on public. But the best part of it all was the sight of a large number of flemingos, pelicans and swans bathing themselves in the waters, and then having  lunch . It was a day well spent."

Contrary to the infamous opinion about the lack of cleanliness and dearth of animals, we found this place quite neat and well maintained. Despite covering a big area, the appropriately placed signboards make navigation convenient. Abundant deers, giraffes, peacocks and a wild variety of birds make for a very pleasant trip. Yes there are just a couple of tigers and lions and placed at a more-than-formidable distance, however, that is quite a sight. By the time we finished watching the elephants and were considering looking for the exit, we found it right in front of us. Overall a very pleasant trip."

Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,ziniatalks,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Child Memory refreshed,"The day was nostalgic. Liked the ease of e-ticketing. 30 per head and 250 with movie camera. The entry gate is separate and no rush. But the lady in the counter did not check our identity, though the instruction says one need to carry id proof; which may be proved to be a lacunae if something serious happens in this day of terrorism. No security check also in this gate. Counter ticket and the entry was full of people.The status and count of the animals - is actually poor, but only because it is a place with one of my best childhood memories, I have marked average. in each cage you have one one animal, like one lonely lioness(no lion), one rhino (without horn), one sloth bear, 2 elephant kids (6 years and 8 years), one Jackal in miserable state, 4-5 crocodiles, 2 - 3 chimpanzees, kangaroos were not mature, 1 jaguar, 1 cheetah, few tigers in enclosed cage (old fashioned), 1 white tiger in the open arena but was sleeping, a couple of deer each of different categories in their concerned open enclosures, 1 hippo(again sleeping like a mass), Few Giraffe,few Zebras, 1 white peacock with it's lady,   one peacock with its family..... the collection of birds are really good, but again alone in the cages in most cases(though I am not aware of their habitat, but birds are generally lives in community, so also Lion and Elephant. Food stalls are there but options are redundant. I do not find the food courts (if they are at all termed so) are hygienic, lot of flies and open foods are sold; so better to carry your own food. though they say it is a plastic free (!) zone, but food stalls are themselves selling juices and lassy in plastic glasses or lab-based thermocol  plates! Otherwise small wraps made of ""newspaper"" with the beautiful and colourful newsprints!Drinking water again primitive supply system, not dependable. They are selling packaged drinking water of low grade companies. So again be self-reliant.Worst part is washrooms. Lot of urine units, half-level doors as they cater to same sex, so you need not to bother for privacy and you can't even lock from in-side (obvious reason is other can see your presence from outside)! Two-three closed doors are there but  to be used as latrine and condition is not usable as stools are visible, while urine can't be seen in plain eyes, so you are bound to use the half door ones. Water supply pipe-line is there but no mugs to apply. In short, filthy and no privacy. In the duration of 3 and half hours, I used once, I have not noticed any attendant to clean. My husband's feedback about the male urinals are also same. It's a shame!There is no arrangement of any activity for the animals in their enclosures, not outside for the kids (like toy trains, play tools etc). Lots of grounds are there where people are sitting and doing family picnics amidst dust. No cart for carrying aged people, so avoid if you have aged people in the group or expect walking. No parking owned by the zoo authority! So avoid personal vehicle.In short, in Kolkata, if you do not have to go anywhere and you have never got a scope to experience what a zoo is, come to Calcutta Zoo. Better to avoid. I have been to Darjeeling Zoo, Mysore Zoo, Bangalore Zoo, Vizag Zoo, Delhi Zoo, Nainital Zoo and on top of all Nandan Kanan in Bhubaneshwar; these all are gems of keeping the animals in Captivity. Hope the feedback helps others."
Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,Shantanu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Old memories....refreshed,"When I was a kid, I used to visit the Calcutta zoo with my dad, almost every month! The last time was in my high school years in the early '90s. So, it was a trip down the memory lane when I visited the same old zoo again a few days ago....after decades, and was pleasantly surprised to find it the same and well kept. In fact I found it to be a lot cleaner and better maintained than before. The glass covered viewing shelters at the tiger, leopard and kangaroo enclosures, provide an unrestricted view of the magnificent animals....the star attractions undoubtedly being the five bengal tigers (2 white and 3 natural) that we saw. The white tiger made a majestic appearance and leisurely walked past the glass separation a couple of times, could clearly see every movement at a distance of just a few feet. As mentioned before, the entire area is pretty well maintained, especially keeping in mind the kind of footfall it experiences, dotted with snacks/ice-cream counters all around. But I do need to say here that we as a race, need to be better mannered and be conscious about littering. There is an entry fee of Rs. 30/- per head (no time limit) and the zoo keeps open from 9am to 5pm, Friday to Wednesday (closed on Thursday). There are three entrances, the main one being on the Alipore Road. Among the other two entrances, one is on the National Library Avenue, just next to the crossing as you turn towards DH Road, and the other one is on Orphangunge Road, for people coming from the Khidderpore side. I'd recommend you to visit the website of the zoo beforehand.And of course, this is a ""must visit"" for your Calcutta experience to be complete. P.S. Avoid taking your own car, severe shortage of parking in and around the zoo."

Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,saronichatterjee27,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Hurrrrrayyyyy... It's Zoo Day,"I think this is the top of the places in Kolkata which is enjoyable equally by children and grown ups. One of the famous zoological gardens of India to get in touch of variety of wild animals, numerous number of birds and vegetation.If you manage to go to the zoo even every year, every time you experience a happiness in your mind, not a bit of monotony can touch you. My little daughter really enjoyed the real Tiger, Lion, Elephant, Zebra, Deer...and couldn't believed their existence as she used to look them in her books and television until she came to the zoo. The zoo is well maintained and staffs are really doing good. You are allowed to carry your own food ,but plastic bags are a big NO. But lack of proper supervision and security check, some people are still carrying plastic bags. I also noticed lots of people throwing plastic cups, ice cream cups, plastic spoons beside and in the main water body. Though there are many washrooms, some stupid parents made their kids to pee beside the path. These type of acts are need to be stopped by strict supervision."

Winter holiday, a basket fool of food few for us few for the animals.

Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,ggm,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Better identification on the trees than at the botanical garden.,"Spacious, well landscaped park with a diverse range of tree species, each of which is identified in Bengali and English, much better than the trees in the botanical garden itself. Less surprisingly, there is a good collection of animals, too."
Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,kingshukB25,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,refreshing experience and wide ranging species of animals.,"Unlike many other ""attractions"" in Kolkata, my experience of the Alipore Zoo was refreshing. I went with my two year old son who, like me, had a great time. I was very impressed with the different kinds of animals and birds. Wide ranging and very diverse. Some very fascinating like the ""Slow Loris"" - I have not seen a primate move slower then that. The animals appear to be well looked after. There is a sense of openness, which is comforting given a zoo by its very nature is restrictive. Not surprisingly, there are several royal Bengal tigers, all well built and healthy. I do feel the enclosures for the tigers, Rhino and hippo could do with some improvement/ enhancement. Signage is a problem, but thats alright as it adds to the fun and excitement. Its important that you get there early and be prepared to spend a better part of the day there if you want to explore the zoo in its entirety. With the lovely weather in Kolkata in the months of Nov-Feb, now is a great time to visit the Zoo. Be prepared to walk. The ticket booking system needs to be looked at. Especially the online booking side of it. I lost money because my online payment did not go through. Also, the security guards, all great guys, need to be a little more pro-active when dealing with errant and mischievous patrons. we came across a few and I was quite frustrated to see that they could get away with their tom-foolery and general bad behaviour, whether towards the animals or generally maintaining hygiene and cleanliness. Frustration was increased because the Zoo otherwise is clean and well maintained. Finally, a very nice feature about the Zoo is it gives you the option to adopt an animal. Its a great idea, which not only ensures funding for the Zoo but gives animal lovers the opportunity to care for the animals, albeit, vicariously. I am considering adopting the Slow Loris!"
Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,dhruba007,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,ALIPORE ZOO,"I got three tickets on line @ Rs.30/- per person. From Dumdum  to Aliporeit took exactly 36 minutes.Gates opened at  9am. The ticket counters are separate. There is a food court. From the main entrance turn left where the orang otang is located, then deer , and at the opposite is the zebra.Then walking back we saw the Snake house,Lion,tigers,hippos,zirraffe. Lucky to see all the animals. They were well looked after.Kangaroos were inside the AC room. Toilets and drinking water well located. Zoo very neat and clean.To go round it took about five hours."

Zebras, Giraffe, different types of Apes, pheasants, crocodiles, birds etc. are all present in this zoo.Lots of fishes can be seen in the waterbodies inside the zoo, and bats and fishing birds can be seen outside the cages.One should plan for at least 2-3 hrs. for visiting this zoo.

Kolkata_Zoo_Zoological_Garden,Sudipto M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,A shadow of it's past,"The iconic zoo in Kolkata, founded by royalty, is in complete shambles. While much effort has been made to improve the living conditions of the animals, the services for the visitors are just awful. On busy winter days the bins are overflowing with garbage and the staff are too overwhelmed by the problem. Visiting during the off-season (summer and monsoon) can be a better experience depending on the weather. For the sake of the zoo, do not bring your own food as it just adds to the garbage problem."
