With giant trees and tanks and vast green fields, the maidan indeed helps the citizen to breathe free air and to go out on morning walks and exercise during the day. "
Maidan,jjaf,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,An excellent people and river watching area,Great place to wander early in the morning or in the evening.  Plenty to see and do and lots to take photographs of.  You can sit and watch or join the other strollers along the river side.

Maidan,HwenTsang,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,Wonderful Lush Greens,In the very heart of city...Best time to visit is winter...admire the lambs ambling across with pink marks on fleece or the police squad on horseback who are present from the British era or a little girl balancing or walking on a rope or witness horse carriages with tourists whizzing past on the adjacent road or see a budding artist sketching the landscape...great picnic spot...catch a glimpse of the imperial victoria memorials or listen to the singing fountains or watch locals playing a cricket match on a lazy afternoon...
Maidan,SilentBlogger,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,"One of a kind, piece of history!","The Maidan has been around for like ages. A place where memories and history has been created across generations.Such a big open maidan in the middle of a main city is very rare. I do not recall any other city which has a bigger open ground than Kolkata.The place has been around for so long that almost every family who has their roots in Kolkata, will have a memory from Maidan. Be it any sports, rally, parade, function or an event of national importance. Maidan has seen it all!"
Maidan,Vikram1971,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Lungs of Kolkata,Its a good place but TA has options 'average' and then 'very good'. the area is the whipping boy of the city's processions and large gatherings. I've some very good childhood memories associated with the place. The area is under control of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army.
Maidan,Pritam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,Kolkata's Horse cart,"If you visit Maidan for 1st time, then you must not avoid horse cart ride. Few of this cart is very old, and you could feel that you are at Kolkata of mid 1800s."
Maidan,Gopal K,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Could be so much better,"Maidan could be Kolkata's Central, but the place is neglected. It's interesting to watch cricket games there, but why not create some decent installations for the public, plant some nice trees and keep the place clean? Kolkata municipality should seriously take care of this place. "
Maidan,niya27,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,Big open area,"It is a big open area on one side of Kolkata. There are many places to visit in maidan such as birla planetarium, Victoria memorial hall, shaheed minar etc. People use it for morning walk, playing cricket etc."
