Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Dennis P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Hustle and bustle and a riot of colour,What an amazing place to walk through !! Marigolds were in abundance throughout the market al ready  to be woven into beautiful displays for the forthcoming celebrations on Republic Day. I felt guilty admiring all the flowers and getting in the way of workes going about their business and others trying to deliver chai to the sellers.A great colourful experience !!
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,ShallineeR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,A different kind of experience! ,"Don't let the noise and the hustle discourage you from going to this market. It is very noisy, busy, unkempt and the road is a little narrow but the experience and the feel is just amazing.Flowers in huge quantities. From roses to marigolds. The flower market ends where the spice market begins."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Tess@gypseyrosetravels,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Colour sensationj,"if you are after a feast of the senses, this is the place to visit. Has to be one of my favorite.The array of flowers and ever friendly flower sellers are in abundance.A photographers dream."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,AEB_9,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Fantastic visit to the Flower Market,"We went on the Flower Market tour led by Manjit, a professional photographer who is passionate about this beautiful city and its people and places. The tour was a fantastic experience.  Manjit regularly visits the market with groups and is known and respected by the vendors at the market.  As a photographer, Manjit was able to direct us to take our own great photos, while providing us with lots on really interesting information.  Manjit has a great sense of humour, enjoys people and his business as a guide and professional photograher. He treated us to snacks and chai during both walks. Great opportunities to try street food. Recommend highly."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,KennethEast,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Intense and fabulous!,"This visit was one of the highlights of our three-plus weeks in India!  We hired a car and driver for the day at our hotel and made the Flower Market our first stop.  You could possibly do it on your own, but it was much easier and more complete with a guide.  Ours took us through nooks and crannies, up stairs and down narrow paths.  She stopped at dozens of stalls to explain what people were doing.  She kept us alert to people carrying large bundles on head or body who could easily have collided with us. The colors were amazing.  The market was packed with people.  We would likely not had the nerve to explore so much without someone leading the way.  Our visit was about an hour long beginning about 9am on a Monday.  There was plenty going on.  No need to get here really early.  Don't miss it!"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,James c,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Must see in kolkata ,"My mother and got up at the 530am just to walk through here as we were told this is when it is bustling. The best local and VERY Indian experience you can have in kolkata. I got the best shots here, not for the faint-hearted though, could be a culture shock, my mother is 70 but is a westernized indian, it was a little overwhelming for her but I say you have to see this, make sure you go up stairs and walk across howrah bridge in early rush hr and the walk to see howrah train station, largest in india"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,GeoBeetles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,A great place for photoshoot,"If you’re a photographer, writer, or heck, even a visitor trying to get a flavor of what ordinary life in this big city is like, then a visit to this flower market is a must. It’s safe and the people here are nice and accommodating, although the goings-on could be the cause for a slight migraine if you aren’t used to this kind of commotion. For me, born and brought up in Kolkata (then Calcutta), it was most welcoming. And no, afterwards I didn’t need any aspirin."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,FJHH24,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,COLOURFUL AND VERY BUSY,To walk through the flower market gives a great sense of how people sell their flowers and also how the flowers are delivered there.  You have to be careful not to be knocked into by the huge carrying baskets which are carried on the heads of the sellers!  A really interesting experience and one which shows how the people market their flowers.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Manish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Flower Galore,"I solely visited this place for the experience and it was undoubtedly a great one. I had walked all the way under the scorching sun and was tired by the time I reached, but the moment I entered the place it filled me up with energy from the crowd. The place was bustling with people and flowers being sold everywhere. The aroma from the variety of flowers here and there filled up the air with a unheard fragrance. It felt so fresh and the constant bargaining going around everywhere bought a smile to my face."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,travelon110,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Friends,"Bustling, interesting local market",Well worth a visit! Very colorful and interesting. I think we spent an hour there in total. We took a bus from Esplanade heading to Howrah and hopped off before it got on any on ramps. We still had to ask to be pointed in the right direction even though we knew it was under the bridge. There’s a part that’s more covered stalls and a part that’s open air near the tunnels that go under the bridge. It seems sellers leave once they sell out so earlier is better. We got there probably around 8:30/9am and it was still bustling. There is a pay toilet there in case you need one. It hadn’t rained in the previous few days so it wasn’t muddy. 
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Elizabeth V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Oh boy!  Found what I was looking for,"This was our final day in India and, at last, I found the India that I had been looking for.  Yes, I know I had seen the opulence of the 5+ star hotels, and the poverty, and the emotion of the Ganges, but I had not seen what I had been looking for.  Here it was.  The complete mass of humanity.  The hustle and bustle.  The noise.  The smells.  I had this vision of so many people, crowded into one spot, rushing around, minding their own business.  OK - you had to mind your head as it was likely to be clobbered by people carrying great loads on their heads.The colours, the designs, the garlands, the multitude of stores, the happy people, the madness.  It is difficult for your senses to cope with this onslaught, but it is so worth it.  If you are in Kolkata, even if only for an hour, you must not miss this.  You will have to adopt Indian customs - forget being polite, you will need to barge your way through, or you will stand still and see nothing.  It seems as though you are very safe here but beware of other tourists who may be pick-pockets - the crush is manor from heaven for them."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,FranB68,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Dont miss out !,The magic of this flower market is a must ! Go early to avoid the heat and be in awe of the beauty and the madness of this market . The biggest flower market in Asia . A glimpse into ancient India !
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,christinejc88888,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Flowers galore,A must.  You will see how the garlands of flowers are made and wonder how all these flowers can be used every day.   Take time to just hang out at along the River too.  From here it is easy and fun to walk across old neighbourhoods and get a feel of this wonderful city.   Constant honking is part of the experience.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Penwyllt,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,"A fusion of colour, sights and sounds not forgetting smells!","The Malik Ghat flower market is a maelstrom of sights sounds and smells which assault your senses.  All set on the side of the river close to a wrestling compund and people washing in the dirty waters of the holy river Hooghly. The flowers are beautiful and made up into garlands and bouquets for religious and more mundane events. The place is full of colour and a buzz of activity as we witnessed people bathing and washing, clothes and pots and pans in the river close to the large and imposing  Howrah bridge. Well worth a visit!"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Annabelle S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,A microcosm of India!,"The Malik Ghat flower market is a microcosm of the delights and disgusts of India for tourists. I come down strongly on the side of delight. It is a wholesale market doing millions of rupees of trade a day and employing thousands of people in the process. The flowers are beautiful and made up into garlands and bouquets for religious and familial events. The place is a riot of colour and a paradise for photographers. It also reveals India's poverty with the communal washing of bodies, clothes and pots and pans in the river under the cold steel of the Howrah bridge. It's amazing, enthralling, upsetting. Like India."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,talkee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,So beautiful all the religious arrangements,This place is full of flowers  and the making of arrangements and garlands for daily worship in homes and weddings( it was wedding season when I visited). All the daily flower delivery door to door (homes) retail people packed the place 
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Neil R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,We thrive on poverty tours. this is one of them,"what is the fascination with showing off the seedy underbelly of the city ? filthy, unco-ordinated and worth a miss"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,K.D.Ttree,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Tramping thru the mud early in the morning to see beautiful flowers and sacred statues,"We were off to an early start and warned to put on good walking shoes. Very muddy. Flowers beautiful, some not in bloom but overall tons of flowers/amazing colours. Walked thru Potters' quarter. Very artisic/creative people  with bales straw and mud from the Ganges making sacred statues for Hindu ceremonies. Ferry over Hooghly River to flower market but bus back. Lots of people washing at the Ghats. Again lots of tired, barefoot, people. Still an experience you are unlikely to get anywhere else."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,gorlinjay,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Beware the mud,A nice walk through. Lots of flowers. Be careful walking. Lots of mud. Garlands of marigolds and roses. Colourful. Good pictures.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,TrailBlazer724979,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Wholesale flower market..good quality and low rate,Visited on auspicious occasion of Shiva Puja...First Monday of Shravan ..Got all flowers at 25% of price than it is available in local markets or on streets.Delighted...Must visit for those looking for bulk flower purchase...One less star as the place was too crowded and needs cleanliness...
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,NirmalSunkari,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018,Photographers Paradise,"Avoid coming here if you cant take a bit of dirt and mud. If you can bear it for a while, then this is a delectable haat. Be prepared to encounter some rare flowers and some common ones in a never before seen volumes. What fascinated me though was not the flowers but the flower-sellers -- Their eyes full of hope. Go here to witness life itself"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,pmartelli,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Business,"Colorful, scented, crowded, magnificent !","Magnificent indian typical atmosphere.You have to go there early morning to enjoy the light of the sunrise over the river, the parfumes of the flowers, colors everywhere, pleople negociating the prices .It s getting strange and a bit awkward at dusk. Dogs , fires of cookers , people sleeping on the road, children yelling, all mixed in the shadow ! "
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Karine V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Solo,"colors, colors, colors","The best moments for a visit are in the early morning. Get up before 6am, it's worth it. Watching the sellers arriving with baskets full of flowers or garlands on their shoulders is really a magnificent scenery. The market is full of colors and floral scents and it is a nice location to experience daily life in Kolkata. But you can not only see the flowers, don't forget to walk all in behind. There you can watch all activities near the ghat. Bathing people, women washing clothes, children playing ...."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Lloyd Macklin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,overwhelming colours..,the wholesale market is huge and the masses of flowers on display overwhelm the senses. Walking through the crowded alleyways is an experience in itself. Don't get lost!Unfortunately the scents of the flowers is overpowered by the local pollution. The view of the bridge and the Ghat itself is average. Worth a visit.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,pagel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Such a buzz,"We did an early morning tour of the Flower Market and getting up before 6am was definitely worth it... the colour... the liveliness... and the energy of the market was a wonderful start to the day.   Our hotel arranged for a tour guide for us, Shekar, and he was a softly spoken gentleman who shared this wonderful experience with us.  He also took us through to the banks of the Ganga where the city was awakening - as others have said - the wrestlers, the families, the flower wholesalers.  This was my favourite part of our stay in Kolkata."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Allene W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,There is more than just flowers here,"Yes, there are flowers of many colors but don't miss the ghat just behind the flower market.  At dawn, it is already busy with men bathing in the river, brahmins performing rituals, barbers at work, and wrestlers practicing.  From here, you can also stroll to a beautiful old tiled structure that once served as the bathing palace for women.  The Howrah Bridge is a striking backdrop as are the people whose lives are woven into this market and location.  My favorite images of my visit here do not have a single flower in them!"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Dana M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Wonderful shopping!,I had a great trip visiting the market.  Great displays of flowers and spices.  5 Star recommendation!!
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Paul R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,Colourful and vibrant,"I realise as I write reviews, that my liking for Kolkata mainly came not from attractions like temples and monuments but from wandering the streets and encountering places like this sprawling flower market in the shadow of the impressive Howrah bridge.The scents and colours of the millions of blossoms is woven in amongst streets and buildings along the banks of the Hooghly river and is a treat for the senses. The cheerful bustle of the traders and buyers creates the sort of environment I could happily wander through for an hour or two.And I did."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Eric G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Great Place to Visit Near the Old Howrah Bridge,"This was not on my ""to do"" list, I went there by accident and discovered one of the most interesting places in Kolkata. The flower market is huge and seems chaotic but at the same time it is somewhat organized by types of flowers. It was interesting to see the flowers that have been ""woven"" in beautiful different styles and shapes, probably to be used at temples or elsewhere. It seemed to be a flower trade center rather than a retail sale place."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Felicia D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,A treat for your senses,"The flower market is all hustle and bustle!  It is truly an example of a working enterprise.  You can’t buy any flowers individually, as these are sold only to wholesalers.Here you’ll see lots of marigolds, but also roses, lotus flowers and some others I can’t identify.  It’s loud.  It’s busy.  It’s crazy.  Everyone is ok with you taking pictures and videos. If you walk out of the market, you’ll find yourself at the Hooghly River and you’ll have a good view of the Howrah Bridge.  However, there is a bad smell at this river edge, and a lot of poor homeless dogs lying around."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,SLSGGJD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017,Be Ready to Have your Eyes Filled with Colors of Many Hues!,"I could not believe the colors, flowers, smells and rawness of this event. It was a wonderful way to spend 2 hours walking through hundreds of flower vendors. The variety is amazing as you head to the inside and outside markets. "
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,ACL3112,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017,A market for real people .......,"We loved our visit - the activity, the people, the noise, the flowers, it is an incredible atmosphere. You can watch the florists creating their colourful arrangements, there are mountains of garlands for temple visits. This is a real market and you experience the real life of Kolkata. "
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,SFOYYZ_Eric,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,What a Market!,"I walked around the flower market yesterday.  What a fun place to be to see it in action.  The colour of the flowers, the sounds and actions of people...  pure sensory overload.  "
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Deryn H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,A hive of early morning activity,We visited this market with friends and a guide.  We s pent a good hour picking our way around the various vendors.  There seemed little or no order to where the traders could place their wares but the traders were all happy to have their photographs taken and not at all shy.   The market was in hyper-drive on this day as it is the Diwarli festival so flowers were in great demand.  There are some defined footways but there is also a great deal of rotting flowers and vegetation and I would recommend trainers or at least closed in shoes.If you like to get in amongst the noise and atmosphere then this is the place to see trading at its best.   Flowers are sold by the weight.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,DexterD2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,A must do in Kolkata ,Beautiful colours and street life of India.  May not be your thing if you don't like crowds but it is well worth it and offers amazing photos from overhead bridges.We caught the metro to the nearby station (the trains don't start until 7am so don't bother being earlier) and then wandered the streets until we got to the flower market - passing through a large fruit market on the way.One of my highlights of Kolkata. 
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,AmD,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Mallik Ghat Flower market ... about bloom and gloom,"In early September this year I visited Mallik Ghat Flower market. Not the best of times, to see flowers in bloom, but nevertheless it was exciting for me to experience the 'hustle and bustle' around flowers. Its a must see for residents of Kolkata, and for anyone who has a love for flowers (who is'nt?).Touted as one of the largest flower markets in Asia, while I was excited, but saddened too with the plight of the market. The vendors lined up street sides, and an elevated corridor. Practically no infrastructure for a thing of beauty and something that is so delicate.    The market starts early in the morning around 5am, and is done by early part of the day. Vendors from near and far bring their produce to sell to retailers who come from places far and near."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Dipanwiita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Quite busy and colorful,Walking around the market was a good experience. Had been there to do some photography and the vendors were more than happy to pose for me. Some of them even shared their stories and did not shy away from exhibiting their talents. Wonderful place with wonderful people.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,jonesharma29,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Flower market,Mallick ghat flower market famous flower market.here you find almost all type of flower.walking around flower bunches is amazing but usually very crowded in morning
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Vicky D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016,Flower Market,Wonderful experience even with the failed attempt at pick pocketing by some local sellers. To visit here you need to be happy to push through crowds packed in like sardines. Worth it though. We were taken by a hotel chaperone and so glad we took that option.
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Neale A,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Large and colourful-but watch your step,"With most of this stinking corpse of a city, the flower market should be visited quickly. The colours are certainly bright but the stench of effluent and putrid, rotting trash can get to you.If you do not like oppressive crowds I suggest staying away."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,AlokeshBagchi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Big Flower market,Astonished to see such big flower market! But very crowded and dirty! No toilets around! Not for usual tourists
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,MAHENDRANATHAN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,An Amazing Rainbow of Colours,"The Malik Ghat flower market can be found adjacent to the Howrah bridge with a multitude of flowers of various kinds and colours. The traders are seated side by side with their flowers in full display and you have a small walkway between these seated traders to walk through and make your purchase.Most of the flowers being sold are used for prayers in the temples and the array of colours displayed is fascinating.The sweet fragrance which emancipates from these flowers is also very captivating.You must also be careful of these vendors carrying these flowers in huge bundles over their heads walking along the same footpath and not stand in their way as the load appears very heavy. As you walk along,you will also see fruit vendors selling local fruits which are in season at reasonable prices.Fruits like mangoes, grapes, pomegranates were available in late Feb / March. This is a site not to be missed. Strongly recommended.Make sure you leave early for the market. Best time would be around 7.00am - 8.00am."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,ShishirGujrati,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Amid Beautiful and Scented Flowers,"Located below Howrah bridge, this is a place which will take away all your tensions and tiredness once you are here. The pleasant smell of flowers will refresh you. Various types of flowers, bouquet, garlands are available here or can be tailored made here"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,RaghuRajMurmu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Friends,Wholesale Flower's Mandi (Market),"Right under the Howrah bridge's eastern side, this market is nestled tightly. If you are claustrophobic then maybe, this is not your kind of space to venture in. But if you can brave the crowd, do walk into this space twice in a day; first in the early morning to see a fresh supply of flowers coming in and being sold in bulk. Then again towards the sunset to view the hustle-bustle in the light of many lamps as well as small bulbs.Here you will get to see the most used Marigold as well as the exotic variety of flowers. The scent of different flowers should send you in a state of trance.However, be very cautious with the money that you are carrying on you because there are many pickpocketers, while it would be a good idea to flash out that huge DSLR of yours; only if you are getting into the market in a group.Do enjoy 'Chai in Kullhad' (earthen tea cup), while you are there."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,The Author,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,Riot of Colour - don't miss this place!,"To best appreciate this place, get here early. Around 6am is a good time as the market starts at 4am. To got to it, drop off just before the Howrah bridge and there are stairs that lead down to the market. It's a good place to view the market from above. Make sure you wear good covered shoes, the place is a little dirty and muddy in places but the smells and colours will definitely bowl you over! This is one of the best things to see in Kolkata so don't miss it!"
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Ruth B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Wonderful fascinating visit,"My guide took me here, I could not have navigated this on my own, and I absolutely loved it. Nestled under the magnificent Howrah Bridge, this market is full to overflowing with flower sellers of all types, the colours and smells and activity is mind boggling, as well as the ice makers (to keep the flowers cool) and then there are the food sellers and the carts and the dogs and all of life. Amazing!"

Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Dev1972,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,A typical wholesale market (mandi) of India except that it is for flowers,"The place is a typical wholesale market found in India. Its dirty, noisy, bustling with people and is a huge market for flowers only. A visit to this place is not going to excite you if you are visiting this place purely for sight seeing. But if you have to get an essence of what a typical Indian market place resembles, this is certainly a must visit. The market runs along the banks of the river Ganges and is bounded by the river and a Railway line. Entering by road, it lies in continuation to a row of shanties. But as soon as it begins, one will be struck bu the size and volume of flowers this market handles. Flower of all colours and for all usage can be bought real cheap here. And the hustle and bustle adds to the feel of the place. This is a place to visit for getting a feel of it...... not for sight seeing."
Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,Penelopewms,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,This is 7 days a week with lots of activity,I've heard a lot about this market so took a car and driver to guide me through the maze. This is colorful but a bit intense and you really don't do this on your own. There are so many little vendors who actually live in little cubbies which line these allies all selling their creations as well as bundles of blossoms. It's life raw and personal so be prepared for all the sights and sounds.

Malik_Ghat_Flower_Market,matt80baltimore,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,Awesome wholesale flower market,"This is not a place to buy flowers, it's a place to see the flower trade and commerce. Stay out of the way of the men hauling huge bags of flowers and watch as customers buy garlands and loose flowers and with porters to cart them off. This place is loud and crowded and hard to navigate, hence the four instead of the five."
