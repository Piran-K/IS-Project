Marble_Palace_Kolkata,ilina m,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Closed to Public with no Opening date,Closed to public. Appears shabby  and ill kept. Visibly lacks maintenance from the outside.The two guards at the gate did not even allow us to take photographs of the mansion and gardens from the outside -  Extremely ill-mannered.
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Mander Mukherjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Magnificent Mansion ,"A huge mansion, located on the northern fringes of Kolkata it was built by Raja Rajendra Mullick a wealthy Bengali merchant in the 19th century. The house was built in neoclassical style. The house has vast collection of western arts and also a private zoo. The entry is free though one needs permission to visit the place from West Bengal Tourism Information Bureau. "
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,R0binR,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Interesting but not not very good.,"The animal cages were awful and a disgrace. The house tour was interesting  but spoilt by staff only switching on lights where you stood, no chance of admiring the total scene of what it once was in its pomp.Would not tell others that this was unmissable!."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,good-living-montreal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,It used to be beautiful in the past,"The palace requires a special permit access from the West Bengal tourism office, but the security people are willing under certain conditions to let you go in. Part of the palace is still occupied by the royal family and this is not accessible for the public. No photography is allowed in the palace.You take off your shoes and you are getting a private tour with a guide. It seems that this place used to be very grand, but the time and weather has shown its impact. While it seems that the royal family tried to bring in any prestigious art from Europe, the collection is in very bad shape. The display is overcrowded and the building is not in great shape and it is definitely time for a renovation.It's a pity that if the royal family cannot preserve those valuable artifacts, they do not sell or contribute some of those art objects to the Kolkata Indian Museum."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Rasputin21,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,IMPOSSIBLE TO VISIT,"Like Rashtrapathi Bhavan in Delhi, the Marble Palace in Calcutta is an attraction that cannot be visited by a foreigner.  We tried to find the Tourist office at 2 Brabourne Street only to find the site a dirty, paan spat  spittoon hole of a foyer with no sign that the West Bengal tourist office was anywhere there.  Someone from the Tea Board at 6 GBB.  We went there and the the staff were merely talking to each other.  They had no map of Calcutta and the only brochure was on food - street food which if any foreigner was silly enough to eat would cause more than Calcutta belly!  They wanted us to return to 2 Brabourne road and search for the unfindable office somewhere in the building.  No foreigner is going to bother with this sort of running around.  The government obviously do not want anyone to see the dilapidated state it is in as is the rest of Calcutta.  Any wonder few foreigners come to Calcutta."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Sea Dweller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"It can be seen, that before it was a wonderful palace ...","Marble Palace is a palatial nineteenth-century mansion in North Kolkata. It is located at 46, Muktaram Babu Street. The mansion is famous for its marble walls, floors, and sculptures, from which it derives its name.     The house was built in 1835 by Raja Rajendra Mullick, a wealthy Bengali merchant with a passion for collecting works of art. The house continues to be a residence for his descendants, and the current occupants are the family of Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur.     To get inside today, you need to perform many formalities. First write down your name and citizenship at the entrance gate. Then you can take a walk in the garden. To get inside the palace, you must again write down your name, citizenship and full home address, remove your shoes and after that you can enter the palace. But even with all the formalities, taking pictures is prohibited, both outside and inside.     In general, I want to say that the building is rather poorly maintained."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,A Kundu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A heritage place,"Worth a visit at least once. The museum, particularly the objects kept on the first floor are rare collection & speak volumes about the taste of Zamindars of ancient Kolkata. However, photography inside the property is not permitted. Otherwise the visit would have been more interesting."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Antionio10,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Interesting,"This place is like a second hand store with lots of statues, paintings and other items crammed into a large space.  It is an interesting collection of items and in a once beautiful home.  Worth a visit."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,KennethEast,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Quirky and fascinating,"Definitely faded glory.  But what glory in its time!  Our hotel, the Taj Bengal, got us the necessary Tourist Office pass to get in.  That was a great help.  Entrance if free, but you'll be assigned a guide who will need to be tipped.  Ours had only ""functional"" English.  He could point out the interesting objects in the house tour, but couldn't really elaborate to follow up questions.  No matter. Don't expect a ""museum"".  It's more like a huge curio cabinet.  The house is on a grand scale--but is far from grand now.  The collection is amazing in scope but run down.  Didn't matter.  It was fascinating."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,culturalsafaris,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,interesting place,..if only to see the opulence of the past & how it has dilapidated to such an extent. It is a shame that Govt does not charge entry through a trust who'll maintain some of its priceless artifacts.It is in a miserable state of barely hanging. I am surprised how its owners can look at it without being moved into action

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Ajeet N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,A Wasted Masterpiece,"The marble palace lies in a corner which is desolate with narrow approach roads and vehicle inaccessible bylanes. Photography is not allowed which prevents popularisation. It is managed by unfriendly staff who give you an impression of being unwelcome. The upkeep is also poor which does not leave a good impression on ones mind. But inspite of these none too informidable drawbacks, the museum is packed with artefacts par excellence. There is wooden work, the highlight amongst which is a one piece statue of Victoria. There is marble, china, glass and brass in three roomfulls. The walls are adorned with reputed painters' works and india's own raja raviverma also finds a place.It is urgently necessary for the ASI to take this over and convert it into a well maintained museum of international attraction and repute."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Simon C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,An Absolute Gem,"This was a real surprise and if you are in Kolkata do visit. It does not really cater for tourists and is a little bit tired but the eclectic nature of the remarkable collection of fine art, antiques abd interiors is remarkable. No photography is allowed and you have to have a guide who will have minimal levels of knowledge about the art works but are pleasnant none the less.  In any other country this place would be packed but it feels like a reluctant heritage attraction and is delightfully quirky.  Minimal cover charge, no shop, no catalogue and they will turn on the light as you go around. There are two mirrors / pier glasses that have to be seen to be believed, they would not out of place at Versailles. "
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Anuradha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Wonderful ,"A large palatial mansion owned by a zamindar family. A part of it is open to public with a prior permission, though photography is not allowed. A huge collection of personal belongings of the family which include paintings, sculptures, furniture, carpets etc are displayed. Though the name of the place doesn’t do justice to what exactly it offers !  A must see place for awesome experience. "
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Vinay Paranjpe,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,amazing collection of paintings,this is the ancestral house of a prominent zamindar family. they have a collection of original paintings by some European renaissance masters which are really worth the view. the building itself is grand and indicates the grandeur of the past era! this is a much recommended place to visit when in Kolkata
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Sounak Poddar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Iconia,"What a beautiful place this is, only one can realise after visiting this. A marvel and true beauty, once a state of the art palace now not so well maintained."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,swarup,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Revisited  the colonial era heritage of Kolkata,"Visited Marble Palace recently..Built byRaja Rajendra Mullick in late 1830s is a marvelous  combination of British and Indian architectural designs. Contains many bronze and wooden  sculptures of early 19th century British period apart from utensils made of China clay and wooden piano.The zoo (although  not a proper zoo of modern standards) contains many birds not commonly seen. This ""zoo"" is the earliest known zoo in India established in 1854.My only suggestion would be that please  reach  there by 1500 hrs as the mansion closes by 1600 hrs.Then only you can complete the tour properly.  Lastly,  I would say that  there is lack of maintenance of the place..otherwise the place is an marvellous monument of Kolkata."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Inspire788577,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Fascinated and dismayed,"The last review was extremely comprehensive and summed up accurately what is on show (or not). Ignoring for a moment the nonsensical no photography edict, the ‘non-guides’ and the non-existent signage, this is still a remarkable place to visit. The marble is fascinating and the design bizarre; the chandeliers likewise and the Chinese vases vast and opulent. Most extraordinary was the birdsong: inside from the unfortunate caged birds and outside from their avian friends caroling freely. Bizarre and barking mad all in one place."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,atulya_sinha,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,PLAYTHINGS OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS,"Throughout the ages, those who had great wealth – especially the nouveaux riche, who acquired their wealth suddenly – have faced the problem of how to spend it! Mullick Thakurbari was constructed between 1835 and 1840 by Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur (1819-1887). The Raja was neither a ruler nor an aristocrat by birth – he was the adopted son of Nilmoni Mullick, a successful merchant, who died when the future Raja was only three years old. The young Rajendra was brought up single handedly by his mother Hiranmoyee Dasi, and went on to become a merchant, banker and philanthropist. He is said to have studied Sanskrit, Persian and English. It is hard to believe the claim that he spent his teenage years designing and supervising the construction of this extravagant neo-classical building, particularly because his mother was preoccupied with a legal dispute with his uncle. It is evident, however, that he was extremely wealthy and that he used his wealth to acquire works of art – somewhat indiscriminately. Later, his sons and grandsons also added to the family collection.The Thakurbari (later named “Marble Palace” by Lord Minto, then Viceroy of India) is a still a private residence where the sixth and seventh generations of descendants of the Raja live – but it is also a museum open to the public, albeit with conditions. You need permission to enter, but not from the owners – you have to apply in person and obtain a pass from the West Bengal Tourism Board, which neither owns or manages the establishment! As for the Palace/Museum itself, it has no conveniences like benches, luggage counters, washrooms or even drinking water for visitors. There is hardly any signage. There is supposed to be a whole galaxy of rules, but they are not displayed anywhere, leaving you at the mercy of the sentries on duty. There is very little information about the exhibits and no catalogues or souvenirs are available. The areas open to visitors are not clearly demarcated from the areas reserved for the use of the family and you might intrude upon their privacy by accident. As you approach the gate, you have to negotiate your way in with sentries in khaki uniforms armed with ancient spears. If you do not have the “mandatory” pass, you will be asked to write your name, address and telephone number in a register. Next, rules like “No photography” and “No parking” will be thrown at you – but as Groucho Marx had quipped, “These are my principles. If you don’t like them, I have got others.”Eventually, you manage to enter and feast your eyes upon the two pairs of stone lions occupying the four corners of the lawn. Then you realize that the grand façade you are seeing has no entrance for visitors – and so you turn towards the right to pay your respects at the statue of Raja Rajendra himself. (You may be tempted to take a quick selfie, but you are restrained by one of sentries who has been discreetly following you). Next, you walk into the long colonnaded portico along the west façade and confront a fresh group of sentries in khaki, who command you to take off your shoes and wait for a guide to become available. You are not permitted to enter without a guide and photography is just out of the question. If you are carrying any bags, you have to leave them on the steps. If you are part of group, expect at least one person to suggest quitting at this stage! If you are lucky, you meet a friendly sentry, who suggests that you can see the “zoo” while you are waiting for your turn to enter the building. You follow his advice and cross a lush green patch of weeds towards a series of enclosures, taking care to avoid collisions with sleeping lions or a bathing Venus! There you get to see half and dozen “chitals” (axis deer) and some unhealthy looking hornbills in cramped cages. The only healthy birds you find are the flocks of sparrows pecking on the ground. It is hard to believe that this was one of the earliest private zoos in India and animals and birds from its collection were donated to Alipore zoo when it was set up in 1876.Eventually, a “guide” appears and you realise that he is just another member of the khaki fraternity. He is polite and co-operative, but he has been employed primarily for keeping an eye on the visitors (the “no photography” rule is strictly enforced inside) – besides reading aloud the names of the exhibits. The guided tour covers three rooms on the ground floor. You begin with a room with two billiards tables (still used by the present day Mullicks and their guests) and a few sculptures. You turn left and enter a square chamber dedicated to Queen Victoria. There is a huge wooden sculpture depicting her coronation, and other statues of her as well. There is also a bronze statue of a strikingly beautiful woman – but when you examine it closely, you discover that her “crown” consists of tiny dragons and snakes! It turns out to be Medusa from Greek mythology, who had snakes instead of hair on her head. The ceiling of this room is adorned with elaborate wooden carvings in various colours.You enter the third room, which is known for its floor made of many different types of marble (estimates vary from 60 to 130). There are numerous sculptures in both marble and bronze, including two identical figurines of Napoleon. Then there are life-sized sculptures representing the four seasons and another pair representing Agriculture and Commerce. This hall also has Japanese porcelain vases. You exit this hall to reach the courtyard with a “Thakur dalan” or place of worship – perhaps the only Indian feature in this building said to be designed by an unnamed French architect. A Thakur dalan usually faces south, but this one faces west – some say that it was not originally meant for prayers, as there was a Jagannath temple at the north-western corner of the garden constructed by the Raja’s father, long before the Palace was built. The superb pillars supporting the roof catch your eye – technically speaking, they are “fluted columns with foliated capitals.” The corridors around the courtyard are occupied by antique wooden cages containing a variety of birds, including exotic macaws and cockatoos. The cages are quite small and you are justifiably outraged at this sight.Soon your guide ushers you up the wooden staircase and you find paintings displayed up to the very ceiling. You crane your neck, but cannot catch more than a glimpse of most of them. As you reach the landing on the first floor, there is large oil painting of the Raja Bahadur. The room to the right of the staircase has both paintings and sculptures on display. The walls of this room are inlaid with pieces of coloured glass. One hears the names of many famous artists – including Rubens, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Murillo, Gainsborough, and even Titian – but it not very clear which paintings are original and which are copies. The only one with a relatively well established history is “The Marriage of St Catherine” by Peter Paul Rubens, which was gifted by Lord Northbrook to the Government School of Art and eventually found its way here. In the absence of independent corroboration, it seems that most of the other paintings – some encased in glass and being spoilt by dampness – could well be copies made by art students. This room also has an elaborate grandfather clock which still chimes the hours, half-hours and quarter-hours.You step into the corridor, noting the oil paintings being exposed to the elements. A fine marble sculpture of a laughing satyr catches your eye.Your last stop on the first floor is the so-called Ballroom (translated from “Naach ghar,” which has a very different connotation). There are huge mirrors covering the end walls and heavy chandeliers suspended from the ceiling. Surprisingly, the floor of this room is made of plain grey cement. It seems quite rough after the marble flooring in the other rooms and is quite unsuitable for dancing of any kind. Your guide will give the lame explanation that the hall was carpeted earlier and show you a few moth-eaten rolls lying around. This hall has been filled up with furniture in various stages of disrepair – which remind you of the attics of Kolkata’s celebrated auction houses. You try to step into the balcony to escape the musty smell, but are called back by the guide as you are dangerously close to disturbing the family! By now you are feeling quite satiated. Your guide escorts you downstairs and you reach the billiards room again. You part amicably (ahem!) and retrieve your shoes and bags with a feeling of relief. If you search for Kolkata’s Marble Palace on the Net, you will come across numerous articles, gushing with praise, mostly written during the past ten or fifteen years. It seems that most of these writers were not casual visitors, but invited as guests of the Mullick family. On the other hand, the British writer Geoffrey Moorhouse says the exhibits look ""as if they had been scavenged from job lots on the Portobello Road on a series of damp Saturday afternoons.” Others call it “the height of kitsch.” A friend who specializes in the history of Kolkata dismisses the Mullick collection as “European trash” and the sentries/ guides in khaki uniforms as “the Mafia,” who are a law unto themselves! Despite the variety and the richness of the exhibits, one leaves with a sense of dismay. The obvious reasons are the poor upkeep and the attitude of the staff. But there is also a more subtle cause for the discontent felt by the visitor – the Palace is supposed to be a private residence, but nearly all the rooms one has seen were meant just for displaying opulence. Where did the Mullicks – especially the ladies – cook, eat, sleep or work? Well, they simply had another house – which can still be seen, in a state of disrepair, to the south of the Palace. Allow me to conclude with a word of recommendation: If you have included the Marble Palace in your list of 100 things to see/do in Kolkata, make sure that the other 99 are crossed out first!"
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Peter F,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Wasted Potential,"See Brun066's review about 3 weeks before this one. Everything he says is right.It is a brief escorted walk around a number of rooms, not a guided one. The billiard tables and some seats are covered up too so you cannot see them.The building is crying out for an audioguide or knowledgeable guides to show people round.The building and its contents are worth seeing but expect to be disappointed and if you are short of time this probably is a visit to be sacrificed to see other sites."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Brun066,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Demonstration of how a cultural asset should not be managed.,"As I understand, this palace was built in the 1830s by a wealthy Bengali merchant, whose family still owns it, and lives part of the premises.The rest of the mansion is open for visits, and this concession must be appreciated; but the appreciation ends here.In fact, entry is free in theory, but is subject to a permit from the Kolkata Tourist Office. However, the experience I lived shows that very few submit to this procedure unnecessarily bureaucratic, so the majority doesn't arrive with the permit; and this is an opportunity for the gatekeeper to ""grant"" the entry equally, against a tip.Not only that: when we reached the Palace, the entrance gate was flooded for monsoon rains. It would have been enough to throw two boards on the puddle to allow visitors to enter. But the gatekeeper doesn't do any of this: on the contrary, again, he ""grants"" your taxi to go beyond the gate and the puddle, in order to obtain a more substantial tip.Once inside, another tip is actually due, because the guided visit is mandatory.To be more precise,, the visit is accompanied, not guided: in fact the ""guide"" doesn't tell anything significant, apart from repeating something that is already written in the captions.The works of art (some outstanding) and antiques follow one another in the rooms without an apparent order: they seem to be piled up in bulk. Anyway, if there is an order, it's not given to see it. Everything is dusty and shows neglect.I would have gladly paid (as, I believe, many others) a real admission ticket, in exchange for a better collections' organization..This palace is however an interesting demonstration of the wealth of the family (and of Kolkata as a city) in the first half of the nineteenth century. But on the whole it's also a demonstration of how a cultural asset should not be managed."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Chris Ward,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Miserable Guide,"The Marble Palace is pretty amazing to look at, but the guide who walked us around told us little that wasn’t obvious and did the tour in about five minutes flat. Despite his cheerless manner he made it pretty clear that he expected a tip.Sadly there are birds kept in tiny cages in the palace who can hardly move their wings. I am glad we never visited the menagerie."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Ankit B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Not worth your time,"I had visited this Palace after reading good reviews and pics on the internet, but was extremely disappointed. It was a visit in the evening and the place was not lit at all and quite dark. There are lot of art and showpieces in the Palace, but they are haphazardly placed in the Palace (as if it is a store-room). There was also some antique furniture, which was cheaply covered with cloth/plastic sheets. The Palace was also dug at several places, and definitely not a sight worth visit. You need to tip the housekeeping staff, who would just read names written on the artifacts without any description whatsoever and you're left wondering if they were actually a 'guide'. During our visit, we were accompanied by a Spanish couple, who also left with a distasteful experience like ours. So disappointed I didn't even click a picture. It could have been a worthy attraction, but its shabby maintenance currently does not justify a visit."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Go581028,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Quirky and atmospheric palace,"This Kolkata palace is a grand 19th century house, neoclassical on the outside but with elaborate baroque interiors.The way it operates is strange - it is open to the public most days but they don't make it easy to visit. For example the so-called tourist permit that a sign says is required. I didn't have a permit, ignored the sign and didn't even have to bribe the gate guard - just walked straight in and signed the visitor's book.I also don't understand why photography is strictly forbidden, even of the exterior. Apparently because it's private property? But I have visited scores of privately owned properties around the world and had no problems photographing them.The house is operated primarily for the benefit of the staff. The owner does not charge an entry fee but retains a large staff of guards and guides who live off tips from visitors. As many other reviewers have suggested, a proper entry fee could raise some income to conserve the house and art collection. Otherwise, without any maintenance, the palace will eventually crumble. It appears that the current owner has no interest in preserving the house.The guide appeared to be clueless and could add very little information or answer questions. This might be due to their lack of English. I had to constantly slow the guide down so that I could study objects in more detail - he wanted me through as quickly as possible, to get my tip at the end. He asked for a preposterous 500 Rp tip, I certainly didn't give him that much.It is crammed with an eclectic collection of (mostly 19th Century) sculptures, paintings and furniture. Some may be genuine and valuable antiques but much of the collection is neglected and in poor condition. Some is just kitsch. Many of the paintings are bad copies of original works. The ""Reubens"" may even be genuine but it's in such poor condition it's difficult to tell.Nevertheless, it's well worth a visit to experience a quirky, fascinating and atmospheric view of faded grandeur from 19th century Kolkata."

The palace was built in the 19th century by Raja Rajendra Mullick and is a work of art. I went there with my friend in February 2019 and was accompanied by a guide who showed us the building. The palace is famous for its collections of paintings, statues, clocks, watches mirrors and other fine arts from different parts of the globe. All these reflect the taste of the Raja as well as his knowledge and the fact that he had been to different places of the world. "

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Colin H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Faded grandeur,"I visited the Marble Palace yesterday morning and thought I'd make a few points.I obtained a pass the day before from the Tourism Department of the Government of West Bengal office, which is located on the fourth floor of their building at 2 Brabourne Street (next to St Andrew's Church).  If you go to their office on BBD Bagh, they will tell you to go there.  It took only five minutes to get the pass, for which there was no charge.  You will need to take either your passport or a copy of its key page.The palace is fairly easy to find once you get to MG Road Metro Station (a five minute walk).  Alternatively, a taxi can drop you outside.There is no charge for visiting the palace, but the guide who shows you round (you cannot wander at will on your own inside) will expect a small tip (maximum 100 rupees, I'd suggest).  As many reviewers have remarked, the rooms you are shown, some of them very grand, are crammed with family acquisitions, some of which, I'm sure, are quite valuable.  I'd love to know if some of the paintings really are by the artists they claim they are by (e.g. Rubens, Murillo, Sassoferrato, Reynolds).  You are free to stroll around the grounds (including a small zoo) without an escort, though you will be monitored to ensure you don't take photos (which seems to be a big 'no'no' for some reason).  I'm afraid that I surreptitiously took a few when I was unobserved.It is definitely worth visiting the Marble Palace for a rare glimpse and fascinating insight into how the upper classes once lived in Calcutta.  The descendants of the gentleman who had the palace built still live in part of it.  However, I think they really ought to think about 'professionalising' the 'visitor experience'.  Either you open your home to the public or you don't.  If the former, then do it properly, by charging visitors a fair amount for interesting and informative guided tours and giving them something in return: a small brochure or information sheet, for example.  More anecdotes about the family and some of the items would be welcome. The guides should also be trained to provide much more information and to answer questions, rather than simply pointing to an item and saying 'piano', when it's perfectly obvious what it is!  The owners possess a magnificent asset and they really should be doing more to promote it and to enhance the experience visitors are given.  Despite my frustration, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Marble Palace, which is undoubtedly one of the city's great treasures.I should also mention that the guard on duty at the gate made a half-hearted effort to extract a tip from me.  He was not in luck!  He had provided me with no service whatsoever.  All he did was to bark, 'no photo, no photo'.It was also distressing to see some quite large hornbills kept in cages in the zoo which were far too small for birds of that size.  The bird cages in the main inner courtyard of the palace - dozens of them - were also far too small and very dirty too.  Disgusting!"
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Sukanya D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Well maintained Mansion and Semi- Museum,"Used to keep reading about this place in blogs so landed up at about 10.30 AM or so just like that on a Saturday (closed Monday and Thursday). The place was almost deserted...very few in Kolkata really bother with it. It took me over half a century to pay my first (and last) visit. The guard with a broken spear was officious but that was to be expected; we did not have a pass from the Tourism guys. They noted down the Aadhar Card number of one of us and entered. We roamed the grounds that was dotted with marble lions...all sorts (prowling, hunting, sleeping etc ). There is a coy Venus, a fountain and marble tables in leafy bowers. There was a Jagganath temple that only family members could enter (we were instructed to peep in through a window). It is old but not remarkable. A statue of the founder (an adopted son) is outside. There is a lake in front. Some birds are displayed in aviaries that ought to have been MUCH larger. Flocks of free sparrows made me happy. Animals? We saw only spotted deer in small, boring enclosures. NOT IMPRESSED...somewhat sad that the animals are kept like this. Guards strolling around kept telling us no photos...no photos...no photos.We were really under human surveillance and it detracted from the enjoyment of the lovely grounds. I appreciate that this is a private residence. The thought occurs to me that they should NOT allow ANY VISITORS. When we went up to the extremely well-maintained palace with mounted Moose heads on the wall...we had to take off our shoes (they provide shoe covers) and one guard kept us company all the while. He was polite, did not know much but was as officious as the others. No photos. No photos. NYET, NYET and more NYET...when one of us received a text message he was told...No mobile. What did I like here? The marble floor and wood ceilings. The two huge blemish-free mirrors (I almost expected to learn that the mirrors were forbidden to show reflections). The mirrors are so large that I was told (likely a tall tale) that these were installed first then the wall and windows of the hall were constructed. I kept imagining what beauties of the era would have been reflected in it; twirling and dancing....The huge Rosewood statue of Queen Victoria..a sad reminder of our colonial past where some curried favour with the English ..but anyway the art is to be appreciated. Paintings by Reubens. Raja Ravi Varma cheek by jowl with marble statues of all kinds....the four seasons, Night and Day etc. etc. Could have stood there admiring but the guard was merely walking us through the rooms. The rooms are massive. Stuffed as these are with exhibits these still have enough room for us to walk around and gawk.We were the only visitors at that point...we could have stood and stared.A 100 INR note to say Thank you to the guide and 50 INR to the guard with the broken spear for allowing us to park inside for free.Wish there were information booklets we could buy or photos.Checking the Internet I see good quality photos in blogs and wonder why I was not allowed to take some photos...maybe they should consider allowing photography for a fee. There is no toilet here that I could see and the animals really need to be housed better."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Marlis0707,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Bribes to enter - badly maintained ,"My brother in law insisted of visiting this place, was definitely an experience. In arrival the said you needed special permissions, we did manage to get in but were asked straight away for a payment and had to write our details in a book. They wanted a contacts number, which I thought was outrageous, got to be joking, why!!!! Told us not to take photos, was it because they didn’t want people to see how bad the place was looked after!!!!We were told to go to the side and to wait for the guide. Got told to take our shoes off, didn’t see the reason why as the place was not exactly clean. He showed us around the two floors. There is a large collection of paintings and antiques, which are badly maintained. They are covered in dust and dirt. Some pieces have been in the sunlight too much and showing neglect. The whole place needs a good clean, why have such valuable items and not look after it, this is beyond me. Obviously they have no bride in their place. After the tour obviously the guide wanted paying.We walked to the small zoo, which is in appalling condition, shame on them how the keep the poor animals. If that was in Europe, first the animals would be taken away and the would be charged.If they would clean up the place and look after it properly they could charge a standard fee and use the money to upkeep the place. The staff was only interested in getting a tip and you felt harassed by it. Perhaps the owners should read some of the reviews and take things on board "
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,abhigya m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,"Worth a visit (which is free) but for the guards shamelessly asking for ""bakshish""","The palace stands like a lotus in the dirty pond. As soon as we entered the premise, we were told where to park. There are parking spots inside the premise. Next, we were asked at the gate to NOT take photographs anywhere and to sign in our names/ address/ time of entry in a log book. We had to take our shoes off at one of the gates of the palace, and then assigned a guide, who showed us around the two floors. Rooms are full of beautiful but old and some rare statues, paintings, mirrors and other unique artifacts brought by the owners from all over the world. Though some rooms were closed for renovation on the 2nd floor, it was still an unique experience. After the tour, we generously rewarded our guide. Visit to the palace is ""FREE"", however as soon as we got in to our cars, the car windows were knocked upon by the guards asking for ""bakshish"". We were forced to dole out money to these assigned guards in brown uniform, even though they did nothing to deserve that. We are happy to reward people who deserve it. And all this happening in front of the eyes of the owners roaming in the gardens (owners were pointed out to us by the guide, and also the young owner who was sitting in the porch as the one who sings and has participated in singing competitions).The zoo has some nice species of birds. Beware of the guards when you go! Otherwise it is worth just one visit."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,David K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,"Visit to Marble Palace, Kolkata",The palace was well worth seeing both for the eclectic assortment of objects and for the building in its peaceful environment so different from the hectic city all around it.The guided tour would have been better if the guide had had more to say about the building but was otherwise just about adequate (focused almost exclusively on the country if origin of the item and what it was made of)The worst part was the entry system with no fixed charge for the guide (he was discontented with 200 rupees and we ended up giving him 400 rupees. The guard on the gate collected another 200 rupees per person making 800 rupees in all. Not a large sum by Swedish standards but rather a lot for a museum in Kolkata.I don’t pay a higher foreigners price if I know the mone is going to the museum but this system which allowed the staff to siphon off money didn’t feel good. They should replace it with proper entrance tickets.

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Tapan B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Gate closed on face,"Tried to find the location near Tagore university saw few lady students asked whereabout of Marble palace , they were busy eating puffed candy phuchka , said didnit know, as entered university saw a teacher asked if marble palace nearby told him heard within walking distance from Tagore house and university , he described the lanes where to pass for the palace, said to teacher your students didn’t know such historical palace , he rebuked me it was not possible to learn everything. True. After about five minutes walk through usual filthy dirty lanes came across a white building with a large ground in front. The gatekeeper with a spear in hand opened the gate for a car to reverse , usual Indian / Calcuttan notice no photography allowed.  when asked for entry the gatekeeper shut the iron gate almost on our face, pointed finger towards sky then asked very rudely to get permission from some unknown tourist office. however for us after visiting far and wide Europe almost all countries of South America North Africa south east Asia Japan Korea Australia seeing treasures in museums in Iran and Turkey looted from India , even after visiting forts palaces in India , we had no grief not being able to visit this house, we found the gatekeeper with spear more comical , took his picture ,if the palace owner did choose a guard with large moustache and head gear like in many hotels and mounting on a  white horse would have been more attractive guarding the vast wealth inside.  He  did not throw his spear towards us ."

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,SuffolkLucchese,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,"Stunning house, but a bit bonkers too...","What a nuts place, you have to have a sense of humour and go with it. Firstly it is worth getting the permit, from the West Bengal Tourist Office, but not the main address frequently mentioned in guide books, the correct place to go as mentioned on a previous post is Govind Bhawan, 4th Floor, 2 Braborne Road. Their is no signage other than the board by the lifts as you enter, one of the party should have id, I used a UK driving licence. The staff there are very friendly and being govt employees would not accept any token of appreciation for their help, on the contrary we were offered tea whilst we had a brief wait.There is no doubt this is an immensely important house in the history of Kolkata and the fact that the family still own and open it up is to be applauded. However it is bizarre the way it is run, sure it  is free but at every opportunity the staff are asking for tips. The permit at least bats off the rude arrogant gate staff. For whatever reasons the family have in not formalising the running of visits it is currently a mess. The collection is interesting, at times odd, a mix between possibly very valuable pieces and some worthless rubbish, it is not well kept and the guides are really there just to escort you around the building, they offer no history or useful comments about any aspect of the house, other than one liners such as “Napoleon” for a bust of Napoleon. The “guide” is only interested in his tip, which being a free look around would have been bigger if not for the pestering. To be able to see such a building is a treat and a glimpse of some of the former wealth in the city.The zeal with which the staff try to enforce the no photography rule is comical, I fully respect the family not wishing photos within the grounds, but they also try to stop you taking photos of the frontage from the street.All in all its great place to visit, such a pity the staff are so orientated in looking for their tips, in that respect it was the exception in our entire visit to Kolkata and many other sites where everyone was friendly and welcoming. With a little thought and renovation this place would be stunning. Just have your happy face on for the 45 mins or so it takes to look around, but the “zoo” is in poor condition and not worth it, but I hardly think any one goes there to specifically see it."

A Permit issued free of charge by the Tourism Dept at BBD Baug is required for entering this place. But as in most cases in India, we were allowed entry without Permit, just by bribing the Security guy at the main gate Rs. 50 only. Another Rs 50 was offered to the Guide who took us around the various galleries of this Palace. Part of the Palace is still a Private property where the Mullick family descendants reside. It is not well maintained & needs to be brightly lit so that all artifacts displayed can be really appreciated. Its a paradise for art lovers. Its closed on Thursday & closes by 3 pm daily. It is just 5 minutes walk from the MG Road Metro Station & is located in popular Chittaranjan Avenue area. It can be clubbed with a visit to Jorasanko Thakurbadi ( just 5 minutes away ) & a visit to the famous College Street & Presidency College with a drop at the famous iconic Indian Coffee House for a cup of Coffee & Bread Toast Butter."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,DoiBedouin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,The Marvelous Marble Palace,"The entrance to the palace has two large deer-head mounts.  Entering into the palace will literally connote the name of the place.  The palace is flooded with marble effigies and indeed a paradise for the art lovers.  The reception hall has billiards boards and a notable Japanese bronze vase of about 4 ft.  Walking on, the guide took us to a dark room which when lighted displayed the 6 ft high Mahogany statue of Queen Victoria. Other statues included the Greek Goddesses; the ceiling of the room too was decorated with wooden motifs.  The “hakur dalan” has a marble fountain like structure in the centre, with the marble floor designed in floral patterns.  The central worshipping pedestal too is of Marble with the figurines of Rama and Sita made on the walls behind it.  The arched roof above the pedestal section too has cupids and floral designs plasterd on the edges. The corridors had caged macaws of different types and cockatoos.  The first floor was availed through the wooden stairs with the wall paintings overlooking the visitors.  The first floor itself is another grandeur with frequent black marbled statues of birds (ravens mostly).  Worth mentioning is the dancing hall with the ceiling long wall mirror of Belgian  glass on both sides of the room, that my friend is going to etch it’s place on your memory. Throughout the hall was other statuettes personifying the Greek deities four seasons- Spring Autumn, Summer and Winter, the statue of Commerce and Agriculture. The other hall had the oil paintings of the linage of the Mullick family. Other paintings are – the “Marine View” by Dutch painter Jan Van Goyen, “Madonna with Child” by Italian painter Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato, “The Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine” by Rubens and “The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian” by Piero del Pollaiolo, as also some paintings by famous Indian artist Raja Ravi Varna and The Last Supper. The first ever piano, the grandfather’s clock and the ivory tusk are the notable mentions. Other statues worth mentioning are the greek Goddesses of Venus holding cupid, Apollo, Moses etc.   Best time to visit: Anytime;  Timing:  10 am to 4 pm. Closed on Mondays and Thursdays;  Cost:  Free entry, however you may tip the guide on your wish. You might need a prior permission from the tourism board.  Nevertheless, if you don't have any, a government identity card would do."

The place is dark and dusty and not at all commercial with a strange yet beautiful collection.  The guide has no fee but accepts/expects? a tip.

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,L7826XJjs,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,"Tourist trap with extremely rude ""tour guides."" Scam Alert.","First you've got to bribe the guard. He tells you this discretely on the way in; you must agree to a price but pay it on your way out.  No photos are allowed (not even ones from outside on the street; it's rather silly). The grounds and small zoo are worth a quick look and pleasant stroll but DO NOT GO INSIDE. This is a complete rip-off.  It's pay what you wish for a tour guide, and you can't go in without a tour guide. You should tell them you'll pay for it after the tour, not beforehand.  I agreed up front to an intentionally paltry 50 rupees thinking that if the guide was great I'd give him more, but he was a joke.  You see a piano and he points at it and says ""piano.""  Then ""billiard table,"" and then a bust of the god Jupiter, labeled Jupiter, and he points to it and says ""Jupiter.""  This whole thing lasts about 10 minutes.  I was the only one on my tour and as soon as the guide got me alone in a room away from the front guards, and with only one other Bengali custodian dusting something off in a corner, he asked me which country I'm from. I said US.  Then right away they started cracking rude jokes about me in Bengali of the ""stupid white American"" variety.  Imagine their shock when I started speaking Bengali to them and told them I understood what they were saying.   The guide tried to quickly smooth things over by asking me polite questions about where I was staying and how long I'd been in Kolkata.  The tour ended and I didn't want to give him anything, but I'd said 50 so I counted out 50 rupees for him.  He had the audacity after all of that to point into my wallet and ask for a larger bill.  I chuckled and said no way in hell and walked out.  there's nothing in there worth seeing and you don't need to pay to be insulted by thugs. Skip it.Once back outside, walking toward the gate, I heard a puja going on in the little temple on the grounds so I walked over to it. The door was wide open, there were two priests chanting and ringing a bell. I would have happily listened quietly for a few moments and made a cash offering as is customary, but instead a man stood up and shooed me out, saying ""Private temple!""  Then why's it on the grounds and why's the door why open?  Beats me.Oh, you'll get a taste of the local culture alright."

Turns out it was and is a private estate built and decorated by an extremely wealthy Indian businessman in the mid-1800’s.The building is very much in the Italian Palazzo style, all marble. It is filled...and I do mean FILLED...with a staggering collection of artwork.  Mostly paintings and statuary from late renaissance Europe, but also a sprinkling of Chinese and Japanese porcelain.  The huge Ruebens painting and the smaller Murillo were, in my mind, the gems of the collection.In essence it reminded me of the Hearst Castle in California. Another monument to a man with vast wealth and an inclination to collect.Unfortunately the Palace has not been maintained very well.  It is not at all clear to me what the plans are for renovations.  Apparently the owning family still live in part of the premises.  But, for 200 rupees to the guide and 100 to the security guard, you get a chance to experience a pretty amazing private art collection!Oh, do take a few minutes when you leave the mansion and see the few remaining animals in what used to be a pretty extensive private zoo.

It gets it's name because of the huge collection of marble artifacts  that he has in his palace. There are a lot of beautiful paintings and sculptures of marble, bronze, wood, bone china. The collection of exotic birds is very beautiful."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,WiniWin26,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Uncrowded place with numerous interesting artefacts,"Though the palace exterior doesn’t appear extraordinary, the interiors are amazing with well-laid marbles on the floor and elegant antique chandeliers hanging down the roof.The guide took us through the different rooms in the palace and provided us information about all the collections.Beautiful sculptures, paintings, huge mirrors, musical instruments and other pieces of art are all part of the collection. It is worth visiting this place when you are in Kolkata.The guides expect tips but don't demand minimum amount and they all share it. There's also a mini zoo outside the palace with many birds. I felt sad for the monkey that was locked up alone in an enclosure and seemed to be depressed."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Rina M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,Well worth a visit.,"The descendants of Raja Rajendra Mullick still live in the palace.The watchman charge Rs. 200/- to enter the compound (in lieu of the permit) and the guides also charge a fee. It is open on Sundays. The palace requires about an hour to walk through. It is one of the best preserved neoclassical 19th century mansions in Kolkata. The cast iron work on the front facade is beautiful. It has a great collection of sculptures, Victorian furniture and several paintings which includes two Rubens. The bird cages on the ground floor are messy and smelly and should be removed.. Without charging an entry fee - it is going to be impossible for the owners to continue to maintain or restore this glorious building and the premises. "

Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Aashish Kumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Awesome,It was weekend when i with my four friends planned to explore this historic place.much heard about this place. When we reached there was few guards standing at the entrance. Then we were amazed with the art collection and the statues of the Britishers. It was guided by a guide and explained beautifully by him. Then we came out of the museum and went to a mini zoo within the palace where we found deers of different types and also few birds which is not generally seen.
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Quarterdeck,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,Fascinating,"Interesting walk through a lovely home.  The art collection is eclectic and nicely presented by a guide that was on site.  The owner still lives in part of the home, and I think we got a glance of him--."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Irfan Q,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,A true hidden gem in the city of Kolkata,"We have been hearing about a place called Marble Palace for sometime and then somehow we landed up at this place. The entrance to this Palace is actually an experience. As we went on a weekend, we found guards at the Main gate who allowed us to enter and park the car in the parking area. It seemed a part of the palace is still occupied and at one end of the garden some family function took place a day earlier. We were strolling in the garden where we found a super mini zoo with dear and few birds.Mesmerised with the outer beauty of this palace we entered the main building where photography was a No-No. Nevertheless, we understood why photography is barred when we entered inside to see a full length Billiards board of ancient times surrounded by high rise seating arrangement. Amongst many statues and artefacts the best and the most amazing piece of work was a statue of a Queen (people to visit and explore) carved out of a single Rose wood.I consider this place a must visit for those who wants to see the hidden gems of the city of Joy."

There didn't seem to be any shortage of manpower, lot of staff can be seen around. But the artifacts are not looked after well. Staff is most interested in getting tipped!!! Very disappointing & sad. So much history in this place."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,NiteLifeMedia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Beautiful Art and Antique Sculptures,A Palace built on 5.5 acres of land and has amazing pieces of antique paintings and sculptures hundreds of years old. There is free entry and you will be escorted by a guide for no charge to ensure you don't take any pictures as photography is not allowed.We were lucky to have a private tour of the palace and access to some private rooms that are closed to the public with even better collections that are over 400 + years old. I guess it helps to know one of the owners family. Wish they could get a professional team of restorators to professionally restore the art to its original glory.Overall a must visit while in Kolkata as you'll be amazed at the collection they have. Breath taking.
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,PaulGs_77,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"Interesting place, guards solicit bribes to enter","This is an interesting mansion to spend a few minutes if you're in the area. However, the way it is run is an embarrassment. There is a big sign at the gate that says ""open 10:00am-2:00pm"" and ""admission free"", but if you try to enter, the guard points to another says that says ""permission from the tourism board required to enter"" or something like that. The guard then helpfully suggests you bribe him instead of getting said permission. You're also required to get a tour of the interior and tip the tour guide.I didn't mind giving the tour guide a decent tip since the kid made an effort to show various interesting artifacts and features. But I decided to only give the guard at the gate a small amount on the way out, since he hadn't actually done anything except solicit a bribe. He then started arguing that the amount I gave was insufficient. Pro tip for the guard: if you're going to demand bribes from visitors, maybe try to get cash up front to avoid any misunderstandings.If they clean up their act this place could be worth visiting. However, it's not worth going to a separate office to get permission to enter, and it's also not worth the bribery hassle from the guards."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Brett G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,"Must Have Been Breathtaking In Its Prime, But Now It Is Sadly Crumbing Into Dust","It's fortunate that this building still maintains some of its earlier grandeur, but, in its current state, being used for storage, collecting dirt and trash, and slowly decomposing into nothingness, this mansion may no longer exist in ten or twenty years unless the administration can find some way to renovate it and maintain it.  Sad to see such mismanagement.  Here's a proposal:  charge and entry fee and tell the guards to stop asking tourists to give them a bribe for the visit when the signs behind their heads say the visit is free.  In this way, the palace can have money for renovation and the tourists won't feel uncomfortable having the security guards fleece them for money.  A win-win situation.  The palace will look much better and we will thank the administration for their fine efforts.In other news:  a permit is no longer required.  I went today and, instead of receiving a permit for a subsequent visit, I was escorted immedialety inside the palace when I arrived."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Carol R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Another example of a super rich person hoarding ,"I have seen this throughout the world. Palaces built by super rich people with tons of expensive stuff in it. This one is packed with decaying statues and paintings. It is worth going to just to remind yourself that all these super rich people around the world collecting lots of expensive things is a waste of time.I admire Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Nandan Nilekani for choosing the path of giving back instead."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Footprints727663,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Beautiful,"I went to Marble Palace. The Marble palace near the Chorbagan in North Kolkata built in 1835 by Rajendra Mallick is famed for its art collection of masterpieces by Reuben and paintings by various renowned international artists such as Reynolds, Van Gogh and Rembrandt. It is great place to go."
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,davidtinney,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Wonderfully bonkers,"I just returned from the Marble Palace and it is just as idiosyncratic as the other reviews state. First, the museum is free. We tipped our guide (you have to go around with one) but didn't give money to anyone else. As mentioned in other reviews, the money conscious guards said some malarkey about 'not registering' as we were walking out (you can't) but we just said 'nice try'.The palace has amazing marble floors, more Victoria statues and busts than you'd find in London, and plenty of Italian marble statues. Also a strange collection of noisy birds on the first floor. The whole place has an entertaining and dusty air to it. Remarkable that the place is as in good a condition that it is.Sadly, I don't think the works by Reubens, Titian, and Murillo are authentic. If so they have an amazing conservationist considering that the room is not temperature controlled and pigeons can fly in and out. But still fun! "
Marble_Palace_Kolkata,Tathagat C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Visit to a Palace in City of Palaces,"We had visited this place just by chance since we were shopping in Burrabazar. We mentioned it to our driver, and he took us there the next day morning. Entry is troublesome, since the guard asks if there is any reservation (note - there is no means of reservation, he simply needs some money). The palace is intact, but not very well maintained - the zoo is small, but nicely kept. It mostly contains artifacts from 18th and 19th centuries and shows how zamindars used to live in past generations. "
