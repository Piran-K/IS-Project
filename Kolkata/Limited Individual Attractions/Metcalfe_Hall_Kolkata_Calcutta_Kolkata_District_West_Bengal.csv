Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Dwipayan Halder,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Friends,Beautiful bird sanctuary near Kolkata,"It is a great bird sanctuary. The place is nice, calm and clean. Many large trees are found. Birds are mainly observed in the morning and in the evening."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Biswadeep Datta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A true forest but man-maid,"I had an occasion to visit the Chintamani Kar Bird sanctuary (CKBS) on a Saturday. It happened as a solo trip. I was amazed to see such a good tourist place and above all a sanctuary so close to Kolkata. It is located in Narendrapur - Rathtala area. Many Private buses, Autos, Totos are available to travel to this place. The nearest metro station is Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar Area). You will get auto just outside the metro station which will take max 10 mins to get you to Rathtala. Fare is Rs.11.00. From Rathtala it maximum 5 mins walking to reach CKBS gate. Entry fee is Rs.50.00 per head. You will see all sorts of birds there. It is a dense forest and very hard to believe that it man-maid.   The only negative aspect of the place is that it is a natural habitat of mosquitoes who will surely give you a very hard time unless you take proper precautions."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,paulmnav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Thick forest in the city,"I loved it despite the mosquitoes.I was there by 5.45am thinking they open at 6am but they open at only 7am in the winter So I tried my luck along the road by the river outside and was very happy with more than 10 varieties including my ever sighting of a Rufous Treepie among others I connected with 3 other bird watchers as we entered and enjoyed my sightings . I am still processing the pictures but there were several first timers for me.Despite it being a thick forest if one has patience to stay still and ignore the mosquitoes, the chances of spotting become higher.I wish they would open at 6 since I saw many flocks fly away between 6 and 7.Affordable price. There are toilets inside. However own can see some plastic pollution as well as noise when young groups come in. After all it is a nature park and not an entertainment park."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,SRIKAKOLAPU,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,place for bird watchers,Its a kind of forest and you can watch birds mostly in the morning and you wont find them after sun comes out full.Good for a walk and good to have greenery in the midst of the city
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Jagneswar G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Morning walk,"This bird sanctuary is situated on the outskirts of Kolkata. While coming from Garia you can take the N. S. C. Bose road. Cross Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and turn right at Rathtala More. This is not Big in terms of land area, maybe around 3-4 sq km. But if you want to enjoy a walk in the woods and spot some birds, this is the right place. Entry fee - INR 50 per person."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Probhat N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Bird Sanctuary inside City,"How many people are aware that there exists a Bird Sanctuary ( ! ) inside this city of Kolkata ? That itself is a surprise enough. Located just before the famed Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission on the Southern Bypass, it’s actually a large garden, earlier known as “ Koyaler Bagan “ and now re-christened as Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, by the name of the famous sculptor and artiste.It is a popular spot for enthusiast amateur photographers as well as lovers as with a ticket of only Rs 50/- you can stay in the garden for any number of hours.  But I was totally upset with my expectation of a “ bird sanctuary “ as even in the enjoyable cosy winter  of Kolkata in the month of February there was seldom any birds in the so-called Sanctuary.  At the best it is a big garden for big time-pass and if you actually get to see some rare birds then you may consider yourself as really lucky."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Amolak Rattan K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Best place to visit during winter months,You will find peace and tranquility in a lush green environment and beautiful nature.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Navonil Dutta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,A wonderful place for Bird And Nature Lovers!!!,"A very nice place for nature lovers, bird lovers and also wildlife photographers. It is really a paradise land located so close to the city of Kolkata. The place has an ample amount of different varieties of trees comprising of some beautiful orchids. A variety of birds are a frequent visitor to this place and many other are it's residents. The best time to visit this place is in the winter. And early mornings are must to watch birdlife however different birds visit the sanctuary in the different seasons but according to me winter is the best. Apart from birds a large variety of insects including different types of butterflies are present. Overall the place is really a nature's paradise"
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,PChaudhuri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Alright for a short visit,"While the place is like a dense jungle in the city, it could be better maintained. water bodies with adequate viewing area would be good. Too much dense bushes prevents proper viewing. Watering holes should be a little away from walking paths or else the birds get scared. There were very less birds to be seen during this visit. Too much mosquitoes prevent you from enjoying the visit. Carry repellents and hand fans."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Soumya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Stunning place out of chaos,I visited the Sanctuary in the morning of 3rd week of September. After entry through the main gate I was stunned to feel the calmness in the green. Every nature lover around Kolkata must visit the place. There is a map of the whole area after entering through Gate which shows a large water body is present there but unfortunately the water body is fully dried. The authority should look into the matter.
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,rajibk95,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary - An island within Kolkata,"Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary, is 20 minutes from Garia junction and 5-7 min from Narendrapur Ramkrishna Mission. There are sharing autos or city buses you can take from Garia Junction. It is barely 3 mins walk from the main road. This places opens at 6 am and closes in the evening.The entry fee is nominal INR 25/-. There are no guides as you would get in Bharatpur etc. You need to explore the place on your own.There are mosquitoes hence, take replants to apply. Due to the vegetation all around it is humid and you will tend to sweat so carry sufficient water and some food as you will not find anything inside.You will get to see a huge variety of birds right from the gate but can explore further as per your enthusiasm. It is a relatively small enclosure but the variety of birds will definitely satisfy you. This is ideal for photography enthusiasts who are trying to hone their skills as it easily accessible considering you are maids the trees at times you will get to see/photograph the birds from close quarters.Do not expect many water birds though. This is a very good place if you want to introduce your kids to nature as well. the place is very quiet and re-juvenating as it cuts you off from the turmoil of the city.There are a few places where you can sit and rest but the restroom needs to be taken care off specially with the nation waking up to the call of 'Swach Bharat'.This is a must see if you are a nature enthusiast and staying or visiting Kolkata. It opens early, at 6 am hence and you should keep minimum 2-3 hours for it and you can still have the rest of the day for your other plans."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,RBan26,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Lots of birds amidst city life,We could not believe to land in such a natural bird sanctuary amidst the city hustles. A must go for bird lovers. Lots can be found if you have eyes and time in hand. Guides available to advise you on do and donts. Entry fees too high.
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Supratik Gupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,Good to go with a But,"While, the sanctuary is maintained up to satisfaction, yet, particularly in the winters, one should visit a bit latein the morning in order to view birds. There can be resting places in between for the photographers and more importantly for elders who need to rest at times,"
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Dr Anshuman Das,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Birds at Narendrapur,Located near Narendrapur. Entrance fees 50INR.  No previous  booking required.  Best to visit in the morning.  Approximately  2 hours drive from Park Street. BE SURE TO TAKE BINOCULARS OR YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.  CAMERA SHOULD HAVE A TELE LENS.

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Pritam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,So many birds at one place ,You could see so many types of birds at this place if you visit during winter season. Generally migrating birds came to this place during winter.
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,IamSangram,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017,A good place for bird watching,"The place is approximately 2 hours from Kolkata city. Try to visit in the morning when a lot of birds come out and make sure you find a water body so you can see a variety of birds.The walk inside sanctuary is great and takes you closer to nature. Overall, it's a great experience. Thumbs up for big groups and parents coming with the children."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,riya04,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Trip to birds paradise,We are a group of friends like to explore off beat places. CKBS is one of them. Its not that kind of place where you can picnic or enjoy loud music. Its a place where you have to watch and listen the nature.
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Avatima,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Nice place that can be more tourist-friendly,"Location: Narendrapur, not far from the EM Bypass. No dedicated parking, so taking a big car is not recommended.Timings and Entry: The summer and winter timings vary by 30 minutes. The entry free is INR 50 / pax.Environment: somewhat peaceful, but being in the midst of a busy and dense locality, not absolutely serene. This also reduces the chances of getting to view many species of birds around mid-day. Trees are not marked. Most water resources dry up in winter. Overall maintenance can definitely be better."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,arghya s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,nice place to watch birds,"A very nice place to visit for bird watching. but, hard to see. take time and you will be fully satisfied with lots of bird photos."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Dannyxb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Superb forest Sanctury within easy reach of central Kolkata.,"This place may be relatively small, but it's quite brilliant. I arrived by taxi asking the driver to find the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission and it was easy to locate after that by asking some locals. Please bring mosquito repellant with you as there are lots of biting insects. Bring also enough bottled water as there is nothing available once you reach the sanctuary. Obviously you will need binoculars. If you walk to the green shelter in the middle of the reserve and take the path to the left there is a huge tree after around 40 metres, some sort of fig, where we saw around 12 species of birds. Lineated Barbet, Blue-throated Barbet, Black-hooded Oriole, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and White-throated Fantails were all seen on that one tree. One of the security guys also showed us where to find the Large-tailed Nightjar. I arrived at 6.30 am and stayed until 9 am and had a great experience. I only saw 18 species of birds and a mongoose but it was well worth it. The entry fee is only 50 Rupees."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tarak N,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,Recent Visit to Chintamoni Kar Bird Sanctuary,"This was my second visit , my last visits was many years back.My last experience was very bad. This time too it wasn't good .Any was I would tell about the good this first :1)Very easy to reach , its on the EM Bypass towards Baruipur hardly takes 10 Minutes from ""Shahid Khudiram Metro Station"" by Taxi.2)Previously there were no walls to protect the place now they have wall on all side except the EM Bypass side .So the illegal entry have reduced.3)It may not be a good place to see birds but there is nice place for Flora.4)It feels like a dense forest (it due to the uncontrolled shrubs growing).Bad Part:1)You cannot stand there for long due to the mosquitoes and humidity due to the dense vegetation .2)You wont be able to see any birds of interest , at least I didn't see any.3)Its not a proper bird sanctuary compared to other places , its just a patch of land with uncontrolled growth of plants .4)Rs 50/- entry is not worth it.5)Rabindra Sarobar is a far better place to see birds in spite of its location in the middle of the city and is free.6)Its more of a Mosquito Sanctuary"
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,saswatmishra14,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Great place but less birds....,"I loved the place but birds were less and yet difficult to see....I yet got the Orange-headed Thrush....which was very beautiful. Water spots are the place where many birds are seen....they come to drink.Yes, the place is difficult to locate...but private vehicles can take you there if you tell them street address...no much people know about this sanctuary.Local birders and photographers were plenty here....I was too there to photograph birds....enjoyed every bit.I think this place is lacking only its promotion....so that more people know about this place."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Subhojit D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Not Worth it...,Well i have to say i was sure disappointed by the place because there was nothing much frankly...the entry fees was way above what it deserves..rs 50....botanical garden is 270 acres and it takes 20 per head while this former orchard situated beside civilization...like the people living in the bungalows can easily shoot photos from there roof tops..only 17 acres of forest...poor maintenance..no need to even buy a ticket...we discovered the sanctuary was so poorly bounded that we got out from within the wired fence and got in too without any soul noticing..not worth it got too less shots...but some interesting ones though..
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,DebduttaGhosh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,"Less birds, more maintenance required","Chintamoni Kar is not actually a bird sanctuary, rather a large property turned into jungle. The place is located in the extreme southern fingers of Kolkata. Water bodies inside have dried up and very less birds pay a visit nowadays. There is no watchtower or a resting spot and only small walkways to navigate inside. It is really difficult to spot birds because of the tall trees and with no watchtower, only chirping can be heard. If one is lucky, they can spot 5-6 different species of common birds like parakeet, oriole, owls etc. The dirt roads are very narrow and full of spider webs and mosquito. Overall very limited maintenance and hardly any facilities for visitors even though they charge ₹50 for entrance.Reaching there could be tricky for newcomers as the property is located off main road. Private transport is the best option to reach there."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,aurko_dg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,Oasis in the Sun!,"One has to be there to believe that a real bird sanctuary can exist amidst a concrete jungle called Kolkata.This was my first visit to any bird sanctuary, and am not at all good with the names of birds. All that I can vouch for is that a little patience and silence in these woods bring to you a plethora of birds as a feast to your eyes.The sanctuary does not allow food inside and that is one of the best reasons for survival of this place until now. Please do not eat inside. Carry your own water, and please do not throw plastics around. This is one of the few of the real green zone within the outskirts of the city. A must visit for bird lovers!"

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Jamil_Sayed,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Friends,"Small sanctuary, worth for visit","It was once a ancestral property of some Kayal ('Kayal' is a surname). A part of the property was encroached by local promoters. Constructions have been erected in the encroached area.The other portions were acquisitioned by State Government. Beside the Bird Sanctuary, the famous Artist couple Chintamani Kar and Amina Ahmed Kar had been living and they had a studio. In the name of Chintamani Kar, the Bird Sanctuary has been renamed.There are large old trees all over the property. In some portions, the thick wood  is frightening. In the surrounding area, the sound of bus trucks and hustle and bustle of the urban life , the number of birds are decreasing. Every day the aspiring photographers gather here with their camera.  It is true that they are able to see few birds. But the solitude within the expanding township is a bliss.The entry fee Rs. 75 is exorbitant. There are flock of mosquitoes all over the forest. So go there with precautions such as anti-mosquito cream."
Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Samar_Ganguly,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Couples,"The ""Bird Sanctuary"" without birds.","This is the worst ‘Bird’  Sanctuary I have ever seen. One can hardly see any bird or hear chirping of birds. There is no proper passage-way, no water in pond, no cleanliness. Even fruit-trees, which can provide food to the birds, are rare. I learnt from the officials that the birds had flown out for food in the morning and would return at sunset (that is, before & after the visiting hours respectively!). The Entry-fee (Rs.50/-) is not worthwhile. However, one can enjoy silence here to some extent. I visited the place on 20.12.2014."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Tirthankar Basu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,CKBS – A Forestric Teleportation,"Ever wondered what it is like to leisurely drive for just about half an hour through the southern suburbs of Kolkata to discover oneself amidst a virgin tropical forest? With the last 4 decades of Kolkata’s “Urban Morphology” being deliberated by a burgeoning wave of Urbanization, something like that is a futile expectation. The fact is that rampant suburbanization has pushed settlements longitudinally north and south, deforesting everything that came in its way. When nothing appears to be spared with the geography having to sustain such a high population density engulfing and corrupting everything ‘natural’ even in far flung rural areas till Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.A unique unscathed forestry nearest to urban perimeters of Kolkata? Yes a place like this exists. Re-introducing an acquaint suburb called Narendrapur where located is the “Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary”  christened afresh as “Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary”, (CKBS in short) after the very person – ‘Chintamani Kar’ a renowned sculptor whose initiative brought about its definitive conservation.CKBS is one marvel of a dense rectangular shaped patch of Terrestrial Forestry, a tropical paradise right in middle of a densely populated rural confine, surrounded among villages, farmlands, waterbodies and marshlands.CKBS  with a footprint limited to just about 17 Acres gives one a sense of being teleported to environs that thoroughly envelopes oneself from all directions with a density of utter vegetation. All it takes is a 18 kms leisure drive from Central Kolkata, through the central arterial roads of the city to a locality called Garia where one needs to continue on SH1 a little further to arrive at Narendrapur. An alternate and easier route, albeit longer is to opt for the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and cruise Southward till the point of its termination near Kamalgachi Crossing where one needs to eventually turn left and continue on SH1 a little further to reach Narendrapur.Notified as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1982 the Government of West Bengal could manage to acquire the land from private ownership only in October 2005. Comprehensively Inhabited by flora and fauna whether its rare bird species or animals like wild cats, the “Varanus Bengalensis” a Terrestrial Monitor lizard among other reptiles, jackals and many more in addition to the numerous species of birds, some common, some rare. The foliage comprises of trees that are several hundred years old, orchards, bamboo brakes, water bodies and wastelands.With a matrix of pathways, just as one would find in a conventional Wildlife Sanctuary, the routes within CKBS are a maze of wilderness. The deeper one goes, the only sounds one gets to hear are the rustle of the leaves and echoing bird calls with the air strongly tinged with aroma of the dense flora. Such is the visual and sensory impact of a visit to CKBS that it somewhat programs one’s mind to look at every concrete structure as an eyesore especially on return."

This is a small orchard earlier privately owned but now converted into a sanctuary by the tireless efforts of Chintamani Kar, a well-known sculptor. The dense foliage is home to Bamboo trees, Mango trees and Jackfruit trees. Because of the dense foliage, the winged hosts are quite difficult to spot, however some very rare species of birds & small creatures like jungle & civet cats are said to exist there. The area around the sanctuary also is home to a wide-variety of winged & small creatures due to the presence of many water bodies, palm & fruit trees, but now this area is undergoing rapid urbanization which means doom for this beautiful well-maintained green place."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Sukanya D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Hear many, see some, snap a few","This is probably Kolkata's (Calcutta's ) best kept secret. Not even hardcore, never-been -anywhere-else Kolkata-ns know about this. Passing Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur  (on your left)on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (NSC Bose) Road you drive on for about 30 seconds more and take a right (there is  a sign board on the right but it is high up and you may miss it...so if you pass a small green temple on the right, stop and reverse..you have missed the turn)  and there it is Chintamani Kar (a sculptor) Bird Sanctuary (CKBS)that used to be called Kayal-er Bagan (Mr Kayal's garden). Rs 50 gives you the right to enter...your cameras enter free with you (but no plastic stuff...this is a plastic-free zone). It is a cool, quiet place with winding paths that take you to bamboo groves and under tall trees laden with orchids. Lots of mosquitoes and bugs, we should have taken some insect repellents but the bird song will steal your heart and after a while i hardly noticed the bugs. There are many, many types of birds here and in the early hours most sing to welcome the morning. Spotting them is a little difficult because the trees provide cover, confuse the eyes and confound the camera. But suddenly you spot one and your day is made! There are cemented areas where the birds are provided with drinking water; many blogs show birds drinking here...but we were not so lucky. Maybe in summer....We were lucky that we asked one of the many patrolling guards if he could help us spot any birds worth mentioning ...because most of the ones we had managed to see were not lifers for me. With a smile and a politeness that is rare in Bengal, he showed us not one but two species...a Nightjar and a Fish Owl, His name? Milan Biswas and I will remember him with happy gratitude forever.What bids did I see? Rufous tree pie (a nuisance that scared away smaller birds), Tailor bird, Ashy drongo, Hooded Oriole,Lesser Flameback woodpecker, Kingfisher, Parakeet, Blue-throated Barber, Lineated Barbet, Babblers, Bulbuls (both red vented and red whiskered)..etc.There were butterflies galore; Blue Tiger, Common Tiger, Pierrot, Bushbrown, Common Jezebel,Common Crow, Common Mormon...many other.There were moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, snails, mushrooms, pretty flowering weeds, peculiar seedpods and attractive red apple-like fruits.The best part was that there was a lovely silence about the place with only natural sounds...the few people who were around all had photography equipment in their hands and generously whispered  tips about what they had found and where. Hand gestures were used to indicate a bird when someone spotted one; but usually we were almost all alone ...free to wander at will.The mistake we made was to leave the drinking water, sandwiches and coffee in the car ...we should have carried it in our side bags and munched as we walked...I, for one could have stayed here much longer than the 3 hours that  we did (It passed in a flash). But maybe food is not allowed in?This place gets full marks for having a decent toilet. It gets bonus points for the pleasant guy who smiled as he sold me the tickets and for the non-greedy, helpful staff we encountered. I repeat: a rarity...but then CKBS is a rarity too...an oasis and a birding paradise in the heart of chaotic Kolkata.Fair warning: No food stuff inside CKBS...nearest tea stall is on NSC Bose Road."

Chintamoni_Kar_Bird_Sanctuary,Agniva_Das,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Solo,Bird Watcher's Paradise,"Hidden away in one corner of Narendrapur is CKBS, a garden locally known as ""Kayaler Bagan"". This little patch of 20 acre forest is a bird watcher's paradise as it plays hosts to a diverse collection of birds throughout the year. If you are interested in bird watching/photography & you are coming to Kolkata this place is a must visit.For newbies this place might be a little challenging because of the thick forest. Roaming about in the sanctuary doesn't require a guide & is a refreshing break from the city's bustling crowd & traffic. Visitors are however advised to maintain sanctuary decorum & ethics to avoid problematic encounters with wildlife."
