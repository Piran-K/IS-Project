Metro_Railway,AVIDTRAVELLER53,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,Lucknow Metro Railway - for fun & for the environment,"We took a family member’s suggestion to take the Metro from LKO airport. It was very good. Took just about 35 minutes.

Metro_Railway,Amod,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Still going strong,Travlling by the Metro is a unique experience. Despite being over 4 decades old the Metro is still in good shape - perhaps got modernised in the past few years. It offers q quick connection between key places and keeps you away from the maddening traffic of the city. A 30 min. ride from Maidan to Dakshineswar costed us Rs. 20 per head.
Metro_Railway,Banshidhar S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Metro Railway,"The Kolkata Metro (Bengali: কলকাতা মেট্রো) is a rapid transit system serving the city of Kolkata in West Bengal, India.

Line 2, or the East–West Corridor, opened in 2020. It is the fifth-longest operational metro network in India after the Delhi Metro, Hyderabad Metro, Namma Metro and Chennai Metro.Metro Railway, Kolkata and Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation are the owners and operator of the system.

Metro_Railway,Rasputin21,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Not as good as the Delhi Metro,"The Calcutta Metro must be older than the Delhi Metro.  It is dingy and dark.  The Metro is only for able bodied people.  The old, infirm and handicapped cannot manage the many steps.  There are a few escalators, but to access them you have to climb stairs!!Signs could also be clear in English.There are generally only two ticket counters and it is difficult to hear what the sellers say because of the ambient noise.If you can figure out the system and the exit gates then it could be an advantage to use the Metro  rather than getting stuck in the heat in the traffic jams.  It is a cheap way to travel at Rs5 per station."
Metro_Railway,good-living-montreal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Great and Easy Way to Commute,"We were very happy with the Kolkata metro. It can be somewhat crowded in rush hour times, but it brings you to the right place without getting stuck in traffic. The drawback is that you have to buy per trip a token, instead of having a pre-paid card system. In rush hour, the ticket counter can be very busy and there is a long Indian ""line""."
Metro_Railway,Prathima A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Kolkata Metro Ride, a long pending wish",I had been wanting to visit Kolkata & take a ride in the metro train there for since I remember. Finally I had a chance to go to Kolkata & then travel in the metro train. I got in at Kalighat station & went all the way to Neopara station. From Kalighat I had to leave 3 trains as they were overcrowded & finally got into the 4th train.It was a good trip. Crowd dwindled slowly and finally managed to get a seat as well.I was happy with the journey & the new Neopara station too was very well constructed. I was impressed with the architecture there.
Metro_Railway,A Kundu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,An important lifeline,"Metro rail is undoubtedly one of the most important, fastest and safe mode of transport for people of Kolkata.

Peak hour it gets very crowded. There are three kind of cards, out of which one is for the tourist which is valid for three days. But I would suggest to buy ticket tripwise. It is even cheaper. The seats are old, bogies are old and not air conditioned. "

Metro_Railway,Kaustav B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Need some improvement,"This review is specifically based on one of the most important stations of Kolkata Metro Railway.This was one of the longest serving terminal station of Kolkata Metro Railway. It was also known as Tollygunge station until 25th August 2009 when it was re-christened to Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro Station, after the name of the great actor.But currently this place is good for regular travellers but not for people using this as a shelter during daily commute. This is quite a busy place and people take rest in the shades of these station during hot summer days. But the shades become even hotter when there is no fan out there. I strongly recommend to install a passenger resting area with all modern facilities in order to make this place great again."

In December 2018 the sense of a slight griminess was palpable.Unfortunately there was a fire at Maidan station when we wanted to travel from Dum Dum station to Park Street station.  There were announcements plenty saying the service was only from Dum to Dum to Central. Only problem was that all these announcements were in Bengali & I had to listen to it 4 times before I could figure out what was going on.In all fairness, this was a very rare event.Still a great boon to travel in a North South direction in Kolkata.

Metro_Railway,RoyDebashis,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Fastest way to visit Kolkata City,The city is highly dense. In working hour you will find heavy traffic jam. Sometime it takes hours to go just a KM. Kolkata Metro Rail is a blessings for this traffic jam. The metro rail established on 1984 and is the first metro rail for India. its connecting 24 to 30 stations. The metro service is expanding to different stations and channels. The maintenance of the existing metro is not up to the mark. Many trains need to be replaced. The stations also need some renovation work. Be careful with your belongings when you are traveling in busy hours.

Metro_Railway,Tapan B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Once pride of Calcutta now in decline,"Once pride, but perhaps not any more. Only one underground line , I believe north to south , usually comes on time ,platform clean , train dangerously overcrowded ,unsafe .usually impossible to get in or have to step on some one or use elbow to push and make way in with inevitable argument for entering or getting down, . If AC not working heat and sweat. There are seats saying for older people but not necessarily for pensioner old people . Therefore with little touch of white in hair can be classed as old men  and allow  one to sit and also saw women with head and face cover would sit , no way of knowing if old. People now depends on this underground for everyday travel,and number increasing massively for  low fare ,hope for travel fast, ,but other forms of transport like tram almost non existent ,once tried to stop a tram in college street ,didn’t stop ,saw one man running and somehow jumped in, though song about tram went on everyday again in again in underground platform . About Bus ,no double or three tire bus are running, few fast bus just pass by ,no time to see even where those are going to. Private bus don’t stop to let people in, one have to run and jump in. Saw one young man tried to run, his mobile fell on street, bus still didn’t stop. Minibus ,if can get , only other means but again have to jump to get in. Best is walking if have time but pavements are all taken over by traders  and not continuous , road crossings dangerous. For this big city underground metro needs massive improvement and regular maintenance works, And alternative mode of transports .but in general in almost all cities world wide underground trains are overcrowded and are more expensive ."

It is one of the most cheapest mode of transportation also. Where Bus fares are Minimum Rs. 7/-, the metro minimum fare is Rs. 5/-. I would definitely ask people to take the advantage of metro and make it a viable option for their daily commute. Metro Railway of Kolkata is also known for connecting north and south Kolkata in the fastest way."

Connects Dum Dum in North ( now extended till Nowpara) to Kavi Subhash at South, with 25 odd stations in between. Ideal for tourists to explore the city. Gets too crowded during peak hours. Surprisingly, in spite of the underground travel, most of the rakes are still non-AC."

It was the first metro line of the country. Maintains its heritage even today in full swing. Utterly crowded during peak office hours and festival days. A must ride in Kolkata.

Metro_Railway,Saheli Pal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Convenient way of connection,"Unlike other metro of other cities the Kolkata Metro Railway is most travel through underground.It is one of the most convenient transport of the busy city, kolkata. It literally reduces your transport time in a huge extend and mostly it hassle free.Though situation has changed a little bit since last 2 years. The frequency of the metro has been reduced which causes more crowd gathering.The condition of the rail was very nice. But I would like to suggest not to take non-ac metro. Due to the increasing Global Warming of recent years it is really very suffocating and unpleasant if you travel in a non-ac metro railway.Now, come to the ambience of the metro station.It is well decorated and well maintained. Some of the stations is decorated with fresco, sculptures and paintings which u shouldn't miss. Kolkata Metro Railway is something which we must try not only for easy convenience, but also for a joy ride specially if you are a tourist."
Metro_Railway,Mini J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Hop on hop off tour,"The metro proved to be an effective way to know the life of Kolkata. It was first time travel in an underground metro.

Metro_Railway,Ankur M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,The birth of Modern India Rapid Transportation System.,Kolkata metro- the first of it's kind in the entire country is definitely the best mode of transportation in the city. One of the best options to escape the rush on the roads of the city.  It was considered at that time as an upgraded version of the Kolkata Tram. It's certainly the most affordable and most joyful ride in the City of Joy. It's in a way the lifeline of the city. It's nearly impossible to think of the city without this metro. Recently new lines have been added which have helped in it's extension throughout the city.
Metro_Railway,Arko_Shine,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,True lifeline,"The Kolkata Metro railway is like the arterial network for the city. The oldest metro network of India is still the first choice of transport for most people in the city today.Joining Garia in South with Dumdum and Noapara in the North, this is the most convenient and economical mode of transport available in the city - or perhaps the country too.In rush hour though, it is just about reaching destination in time - convenience takes a beating then!The service, in its current path, covers major attractions like - Victoria Memorial, St. Paul's Cathedral Church, Esplanade, College Street, Jorasanko Thakurbari, Sovabajar, Shyambazar, etc."

Metro_Railway,bluevoter,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,"They work fine, but avoid rush hour","Long lines for buying a token and body crushing passenger loads make rush hour a time to avoid the Metro system. I had about a 6-7 minute walk to the nearest station but wished that there were more lines, especially an extension into the airport from DumDum. Still, taking the Metro is far superior to haggling prices with taxi drivers. "
Metro_Railway,sanjay a,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Business,Lifeline in the heart of city,"Kolkata metro is the oldest in India. May be it is not that modern as compare to metros in other indian cities, still it is the best. Kolkata metro runs in the heart of city and it is the best mode of transportation in Kolkata. For the People of Kolkata, metro rail is lifeline. It runs from Noapara in North to Garia in South, hence covers most of the middle of the city. As more metro lines are under construction, whole of the city will be under metro cover in 2/3 years."
