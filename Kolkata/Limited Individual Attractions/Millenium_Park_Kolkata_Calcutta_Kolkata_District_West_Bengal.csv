Millenium_Park,shaveta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Enjoy the river cruise.,"Book a cruise and enjoy the evening/night view of the city. most cruises make a short halt at Belur math so if you're interested you can get down and visit the math. A good break of quite sailing & nice breeze from moving around in the hot weather & crowded places. Do check if there is music, party etc on the boat that day if you are particular about choosing a quite or party ride. Because private cruises sometimes organise customised trips."

Millenium_Park,Vinty K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Needs an upgrade,This lovely place along the river front definitely needs an upgrade and the river here needs a thorough cleaning . The eateries here should be held responsible for the upkeep and waste disposal too else they should not be allowed to operate from here 
Millenium_Park,ASM A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Millennium Park,"Nice place to enjoy the beauty of the river Ganges. It’s a rather small park which needs maintenance. Afternoon is probably a good time to visit the park. One can enjoy the sight of the famous Hawrah bridge sitting on the benches in the park. However, young lovers populate the place and become quite intimate publicly ignoring other people’s presence, something that can embarrass you when you have your kids with you."
Millenium_Park,Sunita,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Best in evening,"It is a nice spot to spend the evening, chatting with companions, while enjoying the cool breeze of the Ganga River flowing beside it. Since, I visited in the afternoon on a cold day of November, it was not so pleasant."

Millenium_Park,Malcolm R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,"Brilliant, but not easy to get in!!","This is definitely one where persistence pays off - you will be told that it is closed and there is no access - or you will be told you have to go to the tourist office - if you can find it - to get a permit - or that it is now only open on Wednesdays or whichever day you are not there!! This all seems a bit daft as entry is free and the guides inside are delighted to see visitors and tell them all about the family, the art, the design etc etc. If you say this is your third visit to try to see it, you have travelled especially from Delhi, you are going home tomorrow, your newly married wife will be soooo disappointed etc etc you may get in - whatever you do, keep smiling!! If you make it, you will not be disappointed - it is magnificent!!"

Millenium_Park,JaideepBatabyal,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Hopeless visit to Millenium Park,Have heard of this place since long. So planned to visit during Bengali New Year.It has rs. 10 entry ticket. However your dreams will crush once you enter. The place is not well lit. The place is untidy. The quality of crowd is below average. If you want to enjoy Ganges...this is surely not the right place. Took tea from snacks counter which taste like coffee. Fish fry costing Rs. 70 when thrown after a bite was not even picked up by street dog. So beware of having food. Overall very dissappointing visit. Will never recommend anyone to go to this park.
Millenium_Park,Jatin Garg,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Beautiful Views but not good maintenance and atmosphere!,"This park is surrounded mostly by couples having romance though the views are great and 2-3 adventure activities.

Also, there is the Mayurpankhi ferry for a one hour trip on the hoogly. It has live band performing on stage while you enjoy the sight. It runs on weekends at a interval of one hour. The ticket is priced at Rs.100 per head. Go to the park on weekends to enjoy the boatride."

Kids can enjoy the rides ! There is sunset cruise on River Hooghly but we missed it. Next time for sure. Riverside needs improvement as it wasn’t clean! but a lovely place for viewing sunset!Food joints were so so ! We opted for chats and coffee! The hurtling of Circular rail was an added attraction!

Millenium_Park,AGNIDEEP,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Spot for Evening Strolls.,Millenium Park is the only place in Kolkata where you get to see the Hoogly Bridge (on your left) and Howrah Bridge (on your right) at the same time. The park is generally not very crowded and is perfect for evening strolls. Entry fee is Rs. 10 per head. Kids will love to be here to enjoy the rides available for them. You can grab a bite  at the eating joint inside the park. Ferry ride is also available  that takes daily commuters on the other side of the river and therefore those rides are usually jam-packed. An ideal place to spend your evening with your close ones.
Millenium_Park,Ankur Chaturvedi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,The Mayurpanki Nao was a great experience........,"Went there to spend the Sunday evening with Family (Self, better half, 2 kids 9 &14 and my Mom). All of us had a great time. This was the second cruise for me and much better than the previous one. We went for it only because the private one managed by Vivada was not available. Tickets are Rs 100/- per head. Free for Children below 3 yrs. There are normally 2 cruises on weekend of one hour each. The 1st one is at 6 and next at 7. Advisable to be there at least 20 minutes before departure. The boat seats about 100 on the upper deck. The seats are normal plastic chairs that most people arrange in whatever manner they want. I would recommend taking a seat in the last row to get the best views! The Live band was surprisingly good. Both the singers Male and Female belted out a good mix of old and new Bollywood songs with an odd Bengali song in between! The best part is the lovely view of the monsoon sky and the cityscape!"

Millenium_Park,Anumita c,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Could Have Been so Much More,"A boulevard along the softly flowing Ganges. The cool breeze blowing, ancient trees with their leaves whispering in the wind. Yup, all that and then add to it hawkers and shady charcters and don't even dare look down upon the banks!

Millenium_Park,Shantanu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Mayurpankhi Nao is the high point,"This is one of the newer parks along the river bank, with a few rides and eateries. The entry fee is nominal at just 10 bucks per person. There is a walkway along the riverside and a few benches to sit and spend some time.....but for the stench from the garbage strewn along the riven bank. The government should take some serious steps to clean-up the banks and prohibit further littering. The good part about this place is the one-hour long boat ride (Mayurpankhi Nao) at 100 INR per person. Well....personally I'd prefer a smaller boat with a more personalized experience sans the live band, but then again......something is better than nothing!"

Millenium_Park,Christopher B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Business,A Spark of Regeneration in a Deteriorating Urban Fabric,"Indeed, what I love about Kolkata is that it seems to be an ancient being living on full of vibrance. It is a ""REAL PLACE,"" unlike Singapore, New Delhi and Bengaluru, which are aping other cultures and urban images. No, this is not the next Shanghai! But this park is very fun in the evening, with regular people and common folk strolling and relaxing here. It's neat and clean and a refreshing open space along the river. "

Probably more exciting for small children than adults. It is not a must-see site. It costs a small entrance fee and  it did not really understand why to pay entrance fee for this location. Nothing really special.

Millenium_Park,dougli86,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Riverside walk,For 10 rupees entrance you can leave the noise and traffic and walk through this park alongside the busy Hooghly river. You can get close to the Howrah bridge but the haze tends to dull the photos

Millenium_Park,gbasu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Millenium Park - Good place to visit to see the Ganges,"Millenium Park is located just beside the Strand Road and beside the River Ganges, It is good place for spending time by watching the river cruise. In the evening it looks beautiful, and in the Summer you can feel the wind flowing . You can have various types of foods like Chicken Burger, Potato Chips, and most favorite Ice cream. You can also book cruise seat from here and enjoy the boating on the river with musics and dance Overall, it is very good place to visit and refresh your mind."
