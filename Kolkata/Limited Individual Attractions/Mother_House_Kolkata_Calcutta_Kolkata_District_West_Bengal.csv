Mother_House,sharmistha n,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Hypocrisy ,"My experience was poor. I felt there was a sense of hypocrisy in their intentions of service.

Mother_House,tamminh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Deserving #1 Ranking!,"This sight is currently ranked #1 of 234 things to do in Kolkata, to which my husband and I cannot agree more.  It was a small, simple place but kept perfectly spotlessly clean; even the restrooms were completely free of odors.  This was shocking for us, when comparing to the many public sights we had visited in India.  Rules were posted clearly and simply about what was permitted.  Otherwise, we were left free to look about.  There was no solicitation whatsoever;  in fact, we had to ask a sister on how to make donations.What made this place so touching and so inspiring are the simple yet clear exhibitions of Mother Teresa's devotion to the service of the poor.  Her words are profound, but her actions spoke much louder and deeper than her words.  The effects last much longer afterwards, causing us to do some more research about her even after we got home."
Mother_House,RameshKN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Real divine place,"The tomb and room of mother teresa is a must visit place and create nostalgic memories about the divine lady.

Mother_House,Bodhi Pujari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Traveling in india,I had planned for some time to visit this place .

Just around the corner from this house you still can see how people live  still today . Very touching place 
Mother_House,Johann R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,In The Presence Of God.,"Kolkata is a noisy place. You can't escape that fact. Every vehicle uses its horn - constantly, continually. Just step into Mother Theresa's home, which is by the side of a busy road, and the noise is somehow quietened. A sense of deep, deep peace reaches out and engulfs you, soothes you, calms you. Sit on a bench, by the side of Mother's Crypt, and you know you're in the presence of the Holy. Words cannot truly capture the experience. So I'll stop trying."
Mother_House,Companion32331321681,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Visit to sisters of charity,Reverred place where Mother Teresa served the destitute with love and care is worth visiting.

Mother_House,Ansu Thankam J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Soul searching,"Missionaries of Charity is one organisation I have heard and read about from childhood. Visiting Mother's house was a great opportunity I had ever been looking forward to. I knew all the stories of mother from my schooldays. Seeing it all for real was beyond words.Indeed I got this chance while working on medical procedures in leprosy patients. Found it a great coincidence. The little museum was heart touching. I reached after 6pm so couldn't see mother's room.Sisters start their prayer at around 7pm. Fortunately I could attend the prayer. Calm, peaceful and was a great blessing.One of the sisters showed me a prayer written for the healing hands.It was a great eye opener when she said the poor sick and needy doesn't need our sympathy but treat them with dignity. "
Mother_House,Yijing Gu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Volunteer for three days,"Photo is strictly prohibited.Most volunteers stay 10 days to 3 months. Some for years. But you are totally welcome for volunteering even just one day.I spent 3 days volunteering with Mother Teresa’s charity, which has been my dream for years since I learnt about her work.First day I was sent to take care of women with mental illness or intellectual disabilities. Some of them were born with disabilities and got abandoned. Some were tortured before that they got severe mental illness. A few of them had some abilities to work, and were also helping around. Most of them weren’t able to take care of themselves at all.We did laundry, bed making and feeding. I could see the light in their eyes when I fed them.When we were on our way to the place and back, many children and some women greeted us warmly, which gave me lots of courage.It’s always a good feeling being able to do something for others, even just a small thing, not to say the great respect you get from it.Second day, I was at children’s house and hospice house. A blind kid wouldn’t want to sleep in bed, but lay on my body, maybe because I’m plump and soft :) A granny who can speak English asked if I gonna come back tomorrow. I said sorry going back home. She was a little sad, asked me to quickly come back so she could see me, because she will die soon. Didn’t know how to respond, could only give hugs.Third day, many women and children came for free medication. I didn’t know how to read prescriptions, so couldn’t really help. If you had some medical experience, you could help a lot."
Mother_House,EndlessCaravan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Holy and Quiet,"Mother House is the the home of Mother Theresa and her final resting place. Much like her, it is small and unassuming, yet very powerful. It is not the easiest place to find as the signage is small and you could walk right by it. It has a small museum with photos and artifacts from her life.You can also see her small spartan bedroom and the room that contains her tomb. It is very holy and quiet with nuns on hand. No photos are allowed, other than of the tomb. It was a very moving place. About an hour is the right time for this site."

Mother_House,Peter F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Spiritual,We had not done our research properly so the museum and Mother Theresa's room were closed. Nevertheless the simplicity and calm of the chapel and her tomb was humbling. There is a story card of her life in the courtyard outside the chapel which my wife and I enjoyed greatly. There are some sisters around and I would encourage you to talk with them as I found that quite moving. Through them Mother Theresa lives on.In our hectic lives we all need a reminder from time to time about leaving a good life and this is somewhere where all of us can remember that.

Lots of gratitude and best wishes to those who follow her and keep her fellowship going.
Mother_House,somersetmackem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Visit to Mother House,"Whilst not religious, more Spiritual, it is impossible not to be moved by a visit to the  resting place of Mother Theresa and wholly inspired by the selfless life she gave. It is wrong to define this as a Tourist destination, and yet that is what it is, but if you are in Kolkata you should visit and maybe you too will have a steelier resolve about helping those in need. "
Mother_House,BeenaDmello,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,More about Mother,A place where you will know what service is and to what extent one can go. Such a quite peaceful campus. You can see Mothers tomb and a museum on Mother's journey. Very heart touching and a bliss to visit this place. Mother's room was under painting so we could not not see. There is a religious article store may not be associated with mother house. Prices bit high as they outsource from kerala.
Mother_House,seedhunter,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Big property, poor maintenance","Very big property but maintenence is big issue. Food is below average in terms of varieties and also taste.

Mother_House,MizzyUmz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A must to visit !,"My family and I were happy that we made an effort to visit Mother House. An absolutely heart warming experience to read all the humbling achievement Mother Teresa has done and to see the simple life that she lead. We met a volunteer in the house who shared her experiences of growing up in one of the homes. Donations can be made in the upstairs office where receipts are issued or you can drop them in the donation box displayed in the room where her tomb is. There are notices around the house that informs us not to entertain anyone outside claiming to be guide but we still got trailed by a lady who tried guiding us to the nearby children's home and even helped to get us taxi. She then requested for some money which we gladly gave, hoping that it would help her in some ways."

Mother_House,Sanjay K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Humbling Experience,"I wanted to visit one of the care giving places , but  thought this would be good too.  It was a bit noisy on the day I visited , as there were prayers going on in the same room as mother teresa tomb. The adjacent room takes you through her journey from albania to kolkata and beyond. Skeptics would say its selective and propagandist...nevertheless i found it informative. ..then there is the room upstairs from where Mother Teresa supposed to have lived and operated. Touching and a humbling experience to reflect on a person's unrelenting effort, pursuing unwaveringly, a life based on her beliefs. Happy that i  made time for this during our short kolkata visit.  Overwhelming but Inspiring "
Mother_House,ShashankaSaadi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,A house to learn thyself,"Mother of House is the resting place for one of the most amazing human beings of human history, Mother Teresa. This house was one of her creation to serve destitute people. It's peaceful, and it gives inner strength. The room Mother Teresa lived is small, simple and without any facilities of cooling. Everyone who ever gets a chance and a little time in Kolkata should visit the place to learn about simplicity and love for human beings who are marginalized and excluded in society. The visit you help you to change your consumeristic character and increase your love for the world. Let there be Lit!"
