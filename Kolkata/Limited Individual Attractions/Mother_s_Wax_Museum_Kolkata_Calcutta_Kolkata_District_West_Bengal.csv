Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Siddhartha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Friends,Must visit place,"A wonderful place just opposite Eco Park Gate no -2.

The timing are Tuesday to Sunday, 12:30pm to 7:30pm. can take snap with famous celebrities from different fields from different corner of the world.  I didn't found Tom cruise wax statue.

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Rehana A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Couples,Visit to Wax museum,"It is in 6th and 5th Floor of Finance Centre and just opposite to Eco Park Rajarhat.

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,A Kundu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Madam Tussads of Kolkata,It is a very poor copy of the world famous wax museum. Some replicas / statues (like Uttam Kumar & Suchitra Sen) are very badly done. 
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Rahul,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Very poor art work. Not worth it.,"This place charges 250/- entry fee per head which is absolutely not worth it. The wax staues are horrid and have no finess. BarringRabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt all the statues are ugly. Its actually a disgrace to the real larger than life personalities. The rest of the concept and the place is designed well. The only thing  we liked was the tatoo lighting studio which was a different experience. The view of the Eco Park from from terrace is wonderful.Please avoid this place and instead spend more time in the Eco Park which is absolutely beautiful."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Suchismita Sen,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Not worth it,Not value for money. I visited with my friend. It took around 30 minutes to cover all statues. However I found its not worth it. Price of the ticket is quite high.

Except some statue maximum statue of art were not looks like replica. Best is Johnny Depp replica in my opine. Laser light room is very attractive. Yoi can cover entire gallary within 2/3 hours. You will see restaurant at the end of gallary and view of Eco park is very nice from there.

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Coastal820768,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Bonsai exhibits,"The number of exhibits are fairly less for a wax museum. But have a fine collection of historically important figures from Bengal, which is to be appreciated. The fare of 250 INR per head for an adult might seem to be high for most people. When you finish the journey within the museum, which consists of two floor levels, you'll end up upstairs right into the terrace where you could get a beautiful if not a slightly breathtaking view of the adjacent Eco Park and neighbouring areas.There are restaurants situated in the terrace/rooftop where you can get refreshments after the museum trip. One restaurant even has a collection of Bonsai exhibits in their front area."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Sunetrika,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,Weekend outing ,Bad idea. No proper markings of the art work. Pathetic souvenir shop. 250 per head. Must fit horror trails. Untrained staff. Poor hospitality. Only dating pairs paradise for time pass. Looking at the roof top cafeteria and kitchen no one can even have tea. Not for classy people. Even much rude to children. Miles away from the standard museums of the kind globally.
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,kamrul h,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Amazing and heart throbbing,"✓ minimumIn a word it is amazing. History of Indian subcontinent, world, science, movie and others reflected in wax statues. The horror movie corner is really matter of hear for horror environment. There is a souvenir corner,  a cafe from where you can enjoy adjacent scenarios. There is a park near the museum. From city only one hour travel by taxi - Uber is available. Follow visiting hour and day in concern website."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,iamArnabPal,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,avoid,Utterly rubbish and disgusting wax models are here in this so-called museum financed by TMC.

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Palmu B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Not worth the money,"Visited this place with my family, the statues are pretty decent but the guards or whatever watching around are wayyyyyyyyyy too rude and impolite. They make us feel as though we are there for free. I know there are people who touch it but when others are not even touching it they shout “DON’T TOUCH” we hadn’t visited to get shouted at. Must say it’s an awesome place to spoil your mood."

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Nilanjan Maitra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,Its a flop show,The wax museum is one of the most highly expected destination for the tourist. It is located just opposite to the  Eco park. The entry fee is bit high. and most of the statues are very poorly made. some of them are beyond recognition. It seems an armature has been used to make those statues. 
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,NI K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Family Fun,"Very neat and clean, well.maintained attraction. Great for spending family time. One thing, as it is outside the city, finding a taxi or tuktuk might be tricky. But you can always hire Uber or Ola-cabs.***Recommended***"
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,abhi0804,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,must visit place for everyone visiting Kolkata,"This is a wonderful museum. Its a must visit place for everyone visiting Kolkata. It will be a wonderful experience for everyone who visits this museum , especially for children . History might bore you if you read a text book but it will be a completely different experience when you visit such a museum and get to see these historical artifacts in front of you.I used to visit this museum regularly during my childhood days. Even now I love visiting this place with my family. This place is used by art students and archeology students a lot. We can see a lot of such students doing there research here. We can see them sit in front of sculptures and trying to draw or recreate them to learn and showcase their talents. Foreign travellers who visit Kolkata come in large groups to this museum to learn more about the culture, tradition and history of India. I am sure it would have been a mesmerizing experience for them as well.There are a lot of things in this which will amaze visitors but I would like to highlight a few major attractions of this museum.We must have atleast half a day to walk , cover and explore everything that is present in this museum. I really love this place and I think everyone should come and visit this place to learn more about our ancestors."

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,anirudh_vengyalil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,""" Family Spot ""","I happened to visit this place when i had a changeover of flight at kolkata, there was around four hours of changeover time so i thought of visiting some nearby place around and then i found the Mother's wax museum near by which is off my list of visit. It has been a very long time i was back to kolkata the place has totally been changed , It totally has a new makeover the smartcity kind. The place looks serene with the eco park on to your right and the wax museum is also right in front of it. One can have the view of eco park from the corridor of the wax museum.To get into the wax museum one must pay an amount of 250 Per head as entrance fee. I dint fist much expect it to be so good but some statues inside looks so real.The wax sculpture were of People from the bollywood, sports , musicians , scientist , hollywood , revolutionist and many more. There are characters of cartoons which the kids would love . There's a room in were you have scary sculptures , the sculptures related to ghost movie and then you have room which they call something like tattoo room its the light that falls over you .Overall the place was great to look around and click many pictures."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Arvind_Yayavar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018,Very Good,"This museum can be covered along with eco park as it is situated just in front of the park, however, one needs to remember that museum is near to gate 1 & 2 of eco-park but entering in the park via gate 3 & 4 will be more suitable. Talking about the museum, it has been built and maintained very decently and one can spend 2-3 hour in it. It has lots of wax statues of almost every famous person in the different field, though some statues are not as good as one can expect still its a must visit in Kolkata."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Rahul B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,A must go family spot,"Located on 5&6th floor of green tribunal office.ample parking space in front of museum for 50rs .entry fee is rs.250 per head.they keep on changing the theme right now theme is fifa football World Cup.life size wax statue of political figure,Bollywood & Hollywood stars,sports personalities,singers,they have separate section for life size ghosts,tattoo laser ,gesture control lots of activity are there.you can enjoy delicious food at cafeteria.bags are not allowed."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Rakibul Huda,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,A must  visit place,"Nice wax status of kids section with popular cartoon characters.Mr beans was amazing. They have other areas like horror room, tattoo lights room ( Good for photography), and interactive gesture games section. There are miniature wax items on sale but the prices were exorbitant.Angelena Jolie and Kate Hudson looked so stunningly real.We went in the evening , so it was pleasant outside in the terrace garden, and the view  of the lights across the lake opposite was nice too.The terrace garden has flowers and a bonsai collection. I suppose the flowers would be a matter of which season your visit is.If you are visiting ECO Park, there is a subway leading to the entrance of Wax museum which is very convenient. Both ways have escalators for climbing up. Overall the experience was good and a must recommendation to pay a visit.  I have seen many wax museums and this is one of the best."

Since then many new wax statues has been placed here with a lot improved quality. I have visited Madame Tussauds Wax museum HongKong too. The quality of the new statues at Mother's Wax Museum are now at par the perfection that of the statues at Hong Kong Madam Tussauds. I have uploaded the photographs from both the museum with captions to differentiate. Although the entry fee has been increased to Rs. 250 per person but its worth."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,AYANANGSHU_HAZRA,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,First of its kind in Kolkata and equally disappointing,This place is Okay for a one time visit but not worth visiting subsequently.

Eminent personalities of Indian politics, Indian and foreign scientists, cricketers, footballers, bolly wood personalities. One full dedicated to the great Satyajit Ray. Hollywood personalities, singers, bengali personalities.It also had an area for life like ghosts.The exciting area was to have photoshoots of laser tattoos on your body.You need a good 2 hours to go through the entire museum in details.Overall an exiting place for selfies."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Sridhar Banerjee,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Good but could have been better,"A small part of Madam Tussard. Situated right opposite Eco Park in New Town Rajarhat it is worth a visit. If you live in Kolkata or visiting Kolkata this is a must see. If you have seen other wax museum abroad then you would be a little disappointed but it’s a good beginning. Inside you need to pay an entry fee of probably  Rs. 250 per head And you could visit the museum. There are so many models some are very lifelike but some are not that good . To name a few, Rabindranath Tagore, Gandhiji, Mother Teresa, Newton and many more. It is definitely worth a visit and when in Kolkta visit it. I would suggest if the weather is cool keep a full day for visiting Eco Park, wax museum and Little India all close to each other. "
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,bcallinv,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Nice place to visit,"Lots of figures and a good way to spend a couple of hours.  After that the Eco park is just across the street.

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Animesh Patra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,"Nice Wax Museum, but can be improved","I would say a decent try , the first of it's kind in Kolkata. A must visit place in Kolkata. This museum is another attraction in Kolkata for children and as well as adults. Not many wax statues there but it’s a great effort to establish a new thing in Kolkata. India’s first wax museum located in an unconventionally shaped modern building in New Town (Just opposite of Eco park,). Dressed in their original attire, these well-done statues provide a great photo opportunity. It is divided between two floors...5th and 6th floor...Entry fee is 250/- INR per person ( above 3 years). Road Side car parking available. But  this Mother Wax Museum is actually quite average, though they have two floors full os wax statues on various celebrities & personalities. The quality of statues is very average, mediocre in some cases. It’s not attractive beyond the age of 4 to 6 year old kids.There is a restaurant , so you can enjoy the food there and enjoy the scenic beauty from the top of the terrace."

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Shilpi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,job well done!,"if i m not wrong this wax museum is the only Wax museum in india. we entered with half heartedness but was delighted that we went inside and enjoyed the wax statues. Many of the statues are from west bengal prominent personalities plus others too... one shud be able to spend about 45mins inside to go through all of them. the entry fee is 250/- indian rupee per person ( above 3 years).few statues were not very convincing but most of them were.Mr beans was amazing. apart from personalities statues, they slso have horror statue section inside itself. we all loved being clicked alongside them with a little bit of fear in our heart, very realistic they were. moving ahead one vill also enter into a room of virtual reality walls... its about ok room but children do enjoy it. if havent seen any Wax museum in life , then surely a must try. Its worth it. "

The Bollywood stars cut a sorry sight...SRK is just bogus 😣😣...Salman can be identified only because of the uniform and goggles😷😷...Uttam Kumar is a laughing stock😖😖...The wax used for Indian characters is of brown and inferior quality...😏😏The entry fee is very high at ₹250 for anyone above the age of 3yrs...😓😓Body tattoo room was a mini disco, just loved that.. Haunted house was pretty awesome.. overall nice experience..For visiting the body tattoo room you need to pay an additional ₹50...😶😶"
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,SquashAddict,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Good museum - worth a visit,"Some waxworks are better than others - but overall it was better than we expected. We read there's a Donald Trump figure - but there isn't (no big loss there). But plenty of famous international and Indian waxworks.......including Ghandi, Mother Teresa. Some cartoon/superheroes too. Professional photos and souvenirs available for extra (at the counter at the end of the tour). The girl at the desk wasn't very helpful or enthusiastic about getting business, but eventually she called the photographer and he came - we were pleased with the photos he took, and within minutes we had framed mementoes."

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Tawhid R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Fantastic Place to spend few hours with your family. Especially with your child,Fantastic Place to spend few hours with your family. Especially with your child. All the Wax Mummies are fantastic. Though some of those needs to be more perfect to be exactly similar to the real person.
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Pritam G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017,Kolkata Wax Museum,"Its Kolkata's Wax museum which has all the famous celebrity either related or connected to Bengal.. If you compare it with Madame Tussaud's it's really poor , But it's nice to have one in Kolkata, Hope they will improve it and get better, It's a fun place to visit with family & kids! Different floors for different genres. Ghost room is scary which is good initiative. Rs 250 , Little expensive ticket prices though.It is situated opposite side of New town eco park. "
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Georgio Valentino Rayala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Interesting Wax Museum,This Museum is located right opposite to the Eco Park in the New town Area. The entrance fee is 200 rupees per person and I went there along with a friend. Some of the wax statues looked real where as some were horrible. Sharukh Khan and Salman Khan statues were real bad. The museum was air conditioned and it was good to explore. There is a Souvenir shop and also a cafe on the 6 th floor.
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,PawanKadyan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Where History comes Alive!,"The most unique statues of historic and current world figures. No wonder it has had a footfall in lakhs within a short time of its opening. MWM 2 has also come up because of the success of MWM. What more can be said about the success of this tourist attraction in the most well planned city in India i.e. New Town, Kolkata. Located just opposite Eco Park, MWM is a must visit for anyone new in Kolkata."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Sohini S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Not so scary house of wax,"Get to pose with Ganguly da, Mithun da, Pranab Mukherjee or even sit beside Tagore and listen to his voice or even Nazrul. Rub shoulders with Maradona, Chota bheem and Big B and a few more. Do not compare quality with Madame Tussauds though."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,_mittal_cauvery18,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Mesmerizing,"It was a pleasant trip to the Wax museum. All the wax statues looked so real, their eyes were speaking. The architecture of the museum was very impressive and meaningful. The moment you enter, you'll see black figures and when you exit, you'll realize the meaning. The museum had a lot of WOW factors. As you keep on moving forward, the best of best keeps unfolding. It was a ""Paisa Wasool"" museum. Truly Refreshing!"
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Harish R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Not Bad At All,"I went with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of displays. While some like Gandhi etc are exceptional, there are a few like Bruce Lee which are a  bit shoddy. However, what I liked was the thematic fusion of many of the exhibits, for example, Einstein and Bose with a scientific theme and backdrop. Quite liked Audrey Hepburn and Johny Depp as well as Bengali/Indian icons like Gurudev, Satyajit Ray and Mithunda as Disco Dancer. Lots of photo opps. Go with an open mind. Its a nice experience after all."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Shubhomoy Mukherjee,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Best option this side of Madam Tussaud's,"This is worth a half day visit at least. Spread over two floors and eventually expected to grow further, the museum starts out unexpectedly by recreating people from India's freedom struggle, Bengali leaders, visionaries like Rishi Aurobindo, artists and poets like Nazrul and Rabindranath. Then you go on to ex-President Pranab Mukherjee, and eventually moving onto movie celebrities from Uttam Kumar to Amitabh and Salman.It seems there is a bit of a struggle to reproduce Indian skin colours and faces.It is in the floor Hollywood celebrities from Jhonny Depp to Mr. Bean that they have achieved perfection. There is a room with a haunted theme too. There is a room with projected geometric shapes that children love to pose in.There is a small canteen and from the balcony one gets an amazing view of the Rajarhat eco park across the road.Definitely worth the travel to Rajarhat."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,MAYANKBIGDELHIFOODIE,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,nice,been 2 many wax museum before liked how they have made itits beautifulspecially horror and cartoon iliked 
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Surya Narayana P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,WORTHWHILE VISIT,The museum is quite far from city and many taxi drivers behave as if they are hearing it for the first time. Best landmark is ECO PARK.  The museum is opposite to  ECO park. Some of the statues do not come close to the actual resemblance of the people. But a good attempt to keep a wax museum in India.
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,sonam904,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Must visit,"A great place to hang out with friends or family.The place has very realistic wax statues of great personalities from all over the globe,it also has a mini scary house."

Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Mahua24,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Very interesting,I found this museum very interesting though as of now there are very few wax models and the museum I am sure will go on increasing the models.Some of the wax sculptures are so real that it is uncanny. One can almost feel that they are breathing. On the whole I liked the place very much. Interesting rooms like the ghost room or the cut outs for taking selfie or the tattoo lights room will be found entertaining by the children.  There are several cartoon characters as well. May be they can have more information about the people portrayed there.
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,IamTaani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,A good attempt,"Mother's wax museum is a concept taken from Madam Tussauds and have wax statues of celebrities and known personalities. Some of the statues are exceptional and almost feels like real. Few are not up to the mark. This is one time kind of entertainment, you can click your pictures along with the statutes and props provided.They have recently upgraded the number of statues.Kids will love it. It will take you about an or 2 to cover."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,Mahuya Puri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,Average City Attraction of Young Kids,"The place is comparatively new and so attract a lot of attention. Though the selection of luminaries across the fields of Literature, Sports, Science, Politics, Kids' cartoon characters, Scary dark room are good - but, the intricacy of the work is not up to the mark. Kids will love to pose and say cheers with the wax-ed celebrities. The fare/ tariff is reasonable. It might just take an hours' time to cover all the areas."
Mother_s_Wax_Museum,RayOn86,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Very bad quality,The wax statues of prominent people kept here are not at all of good quality. You will probably not even recognize them unless their names are printed on the plaques.
