Nakhoda_Mosque,machinat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,Place of serenity and beauty in the heart of old Kolkata,"You can spy the minarets from afar but coming nearer you are swallowed up in the chaos of the bazaar and the mosque is hidden from view. The entrance is through a grand doorway on Zakaria Street. Once inside you are enveloped in the calm and serene atmosphere, a big contrast from the hustle and bustle outside.The place is interesting from an architectural point of view, as it is perhaps the only structure in this style still in good condition in Kolkata. Currently it is undergoing renovation, and one is hopeful that the outcome will be great. Since it is of recent vintage, only modern materials are needed and the work should be easy and can be finished quickly.The architectural details are fascinating, a testament to the workmanship of the artisans from Murshidabad. The interplay of light and shade amid the arches and lattice work is a visual delight. Another delight is watching the huge fish in the wuzu khana, where there are two large pools of water for the ritual ablutions before prayers.Speaking of prayers, it is essential that you avoid going there during prayer times, unless you want to pray there! The crowd of people is massive, as the mosque can accommodate 10,000 people, and for the Friday noon prayers it is packed to overflowing. The best time to go is early morning (up to 10am), when the whole market is empty and the morning sunlight gives a warm glow to the place. There are no restrictions on women or other religions as long as you dress appropriately for a place of worship."

Its really a busy street and Nakhoda Mosque stands on this road with its own elegance. The inside is very vast (a place for 10000+ pupil to accommodate at a time).The halls are really well-built and and will give you a tranquil feeling taking you away from the outside hustle-bustle of the streets.

It gives a nice aerial view of the surrounding, especially Rabindra Sarani.If you're a photography enthusiast then your reward is in climbing few more stairs and you won't only burn some calories to savour that Nehari or Sabzi-Puri just opposite the mosque but will give you some nice clicks!"
Nakhoda_Mosque,Sumit Bhattacharyya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Business,Very nice Off-beat attraction for Kolkata,"Visited the mosque with my guests after a long gap. Looked fairly well maintained, very clean. If you are visiting with any foreign guests make sure they are modestly dressed and avoid the prayer times. One need to take off shoes, which you can leave at the entrance, and its easy to find a watchman as they expect money for their services.As I went with my foreign guests we were very politely and discreetly escorted around the full mosque upto the top floor. Taking pictures was not at all a problem and one should not miss the great street view from the top floor, as it looks out ot the main road below - great view. The guards who escorted us expected money. Any foreigners who would like to visit the mosque alone should be ready to shell out money for the visit. If you are accompanied with any local authorised tour guide you will not be hackled for money, but if you are asked for money, tell the your local accompany to deal with it.A very nice place to be for a change and the walk around the surrounding is unique too. Lady traveler visiting alone might feel uncomfortable so its best to be accompanied by a male members. A great tourist spot in Kolkata with a big change."
