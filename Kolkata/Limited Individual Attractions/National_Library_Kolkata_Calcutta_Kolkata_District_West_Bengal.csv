Groves of trees and the feeling of being alone in a vast cavernous green world is the first feeling that stuck me. The breeze and sudden cessation of the din that marks the road right outside.

But due to lack of maintenance newer editions cannot be found. There are a lot of chairs and tables as well as smaller alcoves where you can spend the whole day with yourself and no one would come to disturb you. For accessing some old and rare books as well as for certain subjects you need permission from the librarian.

I spent entire 3 hours walking around the place, sitting under trees.. reading few pages from my book(which i had bought from college street before coming to this place). Over all a beautiful place to calm down and relax .If you want to visit a quiet place to relax a little and read some books or just walk around enjoying the view .....you should go to this place....Trust me.,... You'll love this.."

National_Library,Sosi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 • Solo,A Library in a Historic building,"Known formerly as Belvedere House, this was the residence of the governor generals or the heads of British Administration, in Kolkata. The library was set up in 1836 , but shifted to these premises only in 1948 . Called national library, it became the property of the central government which is as well, for the building  has been properly looked after over the decadesBelvedere House is a  beautiful house with typical English architecture of the 19th century with a commanding setting over a raised edifice, the rooms on the ground floor now being used to store the books. The smaller rooms are  let out to out of town scholars. The stately rooms with wooden floors  are both awe-inspiring and overwhelming.  These  are mostly used as the reading rooms. Reached by a flight of wide, majestic stairs, with curved balusters, it was the place where the famous film director  Satyajit Ray stood to receive the Commander of the Legion of Honour of the French government in 1989.Set over aesthetically  designed gardens,  it is transformed into a riot of colours during the winter season when dahlias, gerberas and chrysanthemums are in full bloom.Sadly there is no tour organized here , nor is there a tea or coffee cafe, to sit down in the grounds and enjoy the entire place over a cup of hot beverage."
National_Library,2Bookworm_32,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Friends,Certain Improvements Needed,"The National Library is a helpful resource for researchers and book lovers alike. However, it is a government institute and suffers from bureaucratic trappings, common in several government institutes in the State of West Bengal. Particularly, various facilities of the library do no operate on the Saturdays, which seemed to be a convenient time for many working people to visit the library. Furthermore, the instructions on their website regarding their working hours on Saturdays is old and misleading and might confuse many. I love their resources but the stuff and the work culture could definitely improve."
