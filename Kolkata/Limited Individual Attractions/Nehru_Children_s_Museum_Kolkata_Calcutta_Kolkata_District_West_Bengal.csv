Nehru_Children_s_Museum,Greg1717,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,"Fun, Gruesome Insight into India Mythology","We stumbled across this little place heading away from the Maidan, and am glad we decided to pop in.There are plenty of ad-hoc toys and dolls in national dress on the first couple of floors, and a room dedicated to models depicted the ubiquitous Ganesha. The real fun is on the upper floors, which house gruesome and visceral tableau of Hindu myths - the Mahabharata and Ramayana galleries are laden with giants, demons, battles, giant snakes, beheadings, disembowelments, and all kinds of almost-family-friendly fun. No doubt this will go down brilliantly with gore-hungry kids, though good luck explaining the labyrinthine plots!"

Nehru_Children_s_Museum,Avishek Banerjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Remembering old times,"Recently been to Nehru Children's Museum after 2 decades. Earlier my grandfather used to take me there when i came to Kolkata on vacation. Now was my 2.5 yr old son's first trip to the doll museum. The place has not changed a lot, but in general sense requires better upkeep and maybe govt initiative. It is run by an NGO , National Cultural Mission.The museum is a five storied building on JL Nehru Road, close to Rabindra Sadan Metro Station. Out of five, three are museum and other two houses other activities related to children like painting, dance classes ans other simular workshops. Other notable sites around are Birla Planetarium, St. Pauls Cathedral, Nandan, Academy of Fine Arts.The place is a dream land for a kid because it is stuffed with dolls and toys. Left wing gallery and the landing on all three floors are lined with showcases filled with toys and dolls. There are dolls from various states of India as well as various countries. Some are aquired and some are donated. It gives the child a glimpse of the world. Right wing gallery on second and third floor houses even better exhibit. Second flood displays the story of Mahabharat and third floor displays the story of Ramayana through tiny but detailed models depicting various scenes from the epics. The lighting and 3D effect of the figures make it attractive for children. While younger ones ask their parents about the scene, older ones can read the descriptin in gist wtitten in 3 languages. It is a great place to start learning our mythology. The miniature models get embedded in the mind, as it happened to me!Current rates of tickets are INR 10 for children up to 16 yrs and INR 20 for anyone above 16 yrs. In my opinion it is a great place to spend a good 1-2 hrs with your kud if visiting Kolkata or if staying here."

Nehru_Children_s_Museum,KJ_view,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,educative but tiring and a bit boring,"The stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata has been depicted well. But it was a long stretch for kids as there was no other entertainment or music. Instead of keeping dolls in 1st floor, mahabharat in 2nd and ramayana in 3rd..they should have arranged the dolls in the second floor. So as to provide a gap between both the epics. Some of the dolls need to be replaced or repainted as some of them had scary eyes.Entry Fees is too nominal. Rs. 5 for kinds below 12 yrs, Rs. 10 for adults and Rs. 20 for parking.Must Carry food along with you if you are going with kids as there is not even a single food stall in the campus."
