Netaji_Bhawan,Indradeep R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Couples,Meet our Netaji up close & personal ,Wish I could have visited this place earlier. As an Indian born in Independent India and growing up to tales of our freedom fighters used to give me goosebumps. But this man has always inspired me for his sheer love of the nation and focus to bring in Independence. Over the years I read a lot of book about him and the visit to the museum brought everything to a full circle. As you enter you encounter the vehicle which was used to flee from Kolkata when he was under house arrest. The ticket is minimal Rs 10/- and photography inside the museum is prohibited. Well I think this is a  stupid move when a mobile phone is the most powerful tool of communication & can promote this museum to far away land where the you tube channel of the museum cannot reach due to lack of funds and promotion.  A museum of Netaji should change with time and I hope the authorities can see what I am visualising from my vantage point. The museum is well maintained very neat and clean spread over 2 floors. There are no lift and you will have to climb the wooden stairs. The entire life of Netaji will be presented in front of your life. The first floor displays his and his brothers bed room and study room. The next floor has portraits and excerpts of his letter across his life. It also shows his escape route to Europe and back to Japan. One letter caught my attention where he writes his brother that probably they won’t meet again ! This journey across his lifecycle brought tears to my eyes and for a second I wished if it was possible to touch the feet of this legend by getting into a time machine. If you are in Kolkata and you love your country please pay homage this to this General without home we wouldn’t have got our freedom so easily

Netaji_Bhawan,atulya_sinha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"MEET THE ""WANDERER""","Netaji Bhawan was originally the town house of J.N.Bose, father of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It has been converted into a museum dedicated to the Bose family, especially Netaji Subhas. One enters from Elgin Road (just opposite Forum Mall). The ticket counter is located on the right of the entrance. Tickets cost Rs 10 for adults and Rs 5 for children. A small selection of books, mostly in Bangla, is available at the ticket counter. After you cross the ticket counter, you find a glass enclosure on the left, in which a car is displayed. This car, known as “Wanderer”, was manufactured by Audi and has recently been restored by them. In January 1941, Sisir Bose drove this car from Calcutta to Gomoh, which was to become the beginning of Netaji’s historic “Great Escape.”Netaji Bhawan is a triple storied building. The ground floor has an auditorium, which is not accessible to public. One has to go up a fairly steep staircase to reach the first floor, where there are three rooms open to visitors. There are two bedrooms, one of which was used by Netaji and some of his personal belongings are on display there. The third room is Netaji’s study, which has some original furniture. The third floor consists of a large photo gallery where you can see pictures and other memorabilia associated with Netaji. While there are many pictures and artefacts of INA and Netaji’s travels in Europe and the far East, there is just one photo of his wife and daughter. Netaji Bhawan has a great deal of material, but the display and upkeep have much scope for improvement."

Netaji's nephew, Sisir Kumar Bose, drove him out on that historic night and the car in which they escaped is still preserved and on display at this place.

What a great patriot Netaji was. No one must skip this revered place when in Kolkata as it is not only an inspiration to all Indians but also evokes respect from all visitors for the patriotism, valour, sacrifice and devotion of Netaji.

As such, I'm probably far more familiar with Subhas Chandra Bose than the average Westerner would be.  That said, the amount of artifacts and information on display at the museum are sufficient, I think, for anyone to get a sense of the man and his times.  The museum doesn't require oodles of time, but it's also very well done.  Maybe not for everyone, but for people interested in history, I think this is a good choice."

Netaji used to meet other estemed politicians in this building when he was elected Indian National Congres President. Other main attraction is the car which Netaji used to escape from the house arrest by British surveillance team. There are ample photographs of Netaji and his family, colleagues; audio recordings, INA emblems, his coats, hand wrtings, sword etc. for display.I would request the parents to bring specially the kids to Netaji Bhawan. I am sure our next generations will be enriched through Netaji's life and journey. "

Netaji_Bhawan,dmanac,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,Part of Indian freedom struggle,"It is quite nostalgic for Indians to visit the place. It relates to the superhero of Indian freedom struggle, the genius great Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. This place is part of a turning point in history of Indian freedom struggle. Only thing that may put off today's visitor is the lack of ambience and sanctity in adjacent area. There also seems to be lack of vision from government to augment and sanctify the place."

Netaji_Bhawan,Dingle,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Eye Opener!,What a brave hero.  Storey told from a Indian point of view which makes a change.  Netaji was often protrayed as a villian/enemy from British point of view. 
Netaji_Bhawan,Dev1972,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,To get a feel of one of the most power figures of India's freedom struggle,"The house is where Subhas Chandra Bose with his family grew up as a kid and remained connected with thereafter. Its also the house of Sarat Chandra Bose (his second elder brother). The place has a museum that displays good photos on Bose that gives a nice narrative into the role played by Bose incl. his INA days, flight from that very house to Germany and thereto Japan and back to India with the INA. Hainvg being converted from the Bose house does not provide it with the space that can add grandeur to it. But rest assured all those history aficionados who are looking forward to some excitement visiting this place, this place will will surely provide it. The Audi that was used as a getaway to Europe is also there but is right now not on display."

In this modern age such  a rule should be done away with ..atleast photos without  flashlights must be permitted .I regret I came  back without being allowed to bring  photo memories .The book shop is selling quite an exhaustive list of publications on Netaji .A must visit to everyone interested in Indian freedom movement and those parents who wish to instill nationhood in their kids must take them here when in Kolkata ."

It is the ancestral home of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, built in 1909, now turned as a museum. From this house was Netaji started his adventurous and historic escape to Germany, may be in the night of 17th or 18th January 1941, from the verge of house arrest. The plate and cup used by him for his last dinner in this house just before his journey is still exhibited here, among many other archives and personal belongings like shoes, dress, caps, cot, his letters and documents. One of his letters is to his brother Sarath, requesting him to look after his family if something happens to him.The museum depicts details of his early living, political movements, formation of INA and enlightens various views and possibilities on his unknown last years. Rare photographs of Netaji with the then hailed famous personalities including Gandhiji are also exhibited. The museum functions from 11.00 am to 4.30 p.m. It is managed by Netaji Research Bureau. No photography is allowed inside the building. There is a library selling books related to Netaji at the entrance part of the premises. Unfortunately we could not see the German Wanderer Sedan Car driven by his nephew during his great escape, as we were informed that the same had been taken for periodic maintenance.The place is easily accessible by car or rickshaw. The metro rail has a stop at Netaji Bhavan. Brand Factory and Forum Mall are very near to the venue. This is a must visit for those who are interested in our nation’s history and freedom fights."

You can also see his clothes, his gifts, the car in which he escaped etc. I got goosebumps walking on the same steps on which netaji once used to walk & run.But if you want to learn about Netaji than this is not the place. You will see lot of pictures, letters etc but there is no story to connect them.  His personal belongings need to be maintained well as slowly they are losing shine.There is lot of scope for improvement and make it a proper museum."
