New_Market,akghosal,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Solo,Good selection of shops but poorly maintained interior,"Having gone to this place whenever I visit Kolkata (I live abroad), I can say there is a nice selection of shops and it is one of Kolkata's main shopping hubs (for which I've given two stars) but the interior/indoor covers and set of corridors inside the market are otherwise quite dirty and very poorly maintained which is not helped by the fact that the place can get crowded & there are street dogs in the middle of the market. Not to mention there can be some weird/dodgy people in the market (I visited the market last week with my family and there was an old shopkeeper who followed us around even when we told him we didnt need any help - people really need to learn not to pester people if they know where to go or are not interested in seeing a particular shop - and it's best to also take care in case there are pickpocketers).Its a shame because this is a market/shopping centre right in the central part of Kolkata and so it could have easily been a great indoor shopping mall/market (I have visited a few indoor shopping malls in the outskirts of Kolkata and they definitely put this place to shame) catering for all but lack of investment and maintenance have both let this place down (I'm just surprised there’s hardly any plans in place to improve it)."

New_Market,Sukanya D,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Glory Days Long Gone,"Taken over by hawkers selling cheap and tawdry stuff, this is NOT the sophisticated New Market of my childhood. The lanes inside I could navigate with my eyes closed, the lovely pottery and glass items ; the clothing line; bedcovers with exquisite embroider that could easily be used by generations. The central area where there was a canon...our meeting place of convenience. Nahoums run by the Jewish bakers. Flurys giving it stiff competition. Spacious. Shopping was a rare pleasure. They used to say if you show the cash you can get tiger's milk here at midnight. Today? Today I weep. The place reeks of urine. The ceiling may collapse on your head. You are jostled by the crowd and heckled by street urchins waiting to pick your pocket. No standard.. Rubbish stuff on pavement. Old shops closed. I could cry."

But the shopkeeper/ hawker hike a high price if they could realize that you are foreigner; then you've to start bargaining. Otherwise they will give you a fake product with high price. Mostly hawkers make fraudulence a lot but the inside the market, the shopkeepers are very friendly & helpful. But you've to be very cautious during purchase regarding price and product quality.

New_Market,Jayanto_mohanto,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,The New New Market,"I visited New Market quite recently to remind me of the old Calcutta I knew. However to be honest its too crowded and doesn't at all resemble the Calcutta I wanted to see. There is a sea of hawkers on the streets and its almost impossible to walk on the road without bumping into people, hawkers, their wares and the occasional rough biker you come across. The place is too noisy and there is hardly anything which is expected from a major market. Prices are exorbitant and the shopkeepers seem hell bent on fleecing you. There are a few branded shops which are generally invisible due to the flow of hawkers on the streets. The adjacent Lindsay street is full of branded shops but then its is equally crowded and to make matters worse, there are vehicles honking non-stop on the road. The only consolation is the eating joints which still serve good food and there is a Mumbai style Khao Galli right in between the (erstwhile) Lighthouse and New Empire cinema halls.Also the New (New Market) building still has walking space and has variety of choices for the shopper. Do not expect great bargains as the shopkeepers seem uninterested.  "
New_Market,ValquiriaMar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,I hoped more from the New Market,"The way the vendors' approach tourists is a bit scaring. I was dragged down a narrow aisle by two men who tried to force me to buy a scarf for 14,000 rupees, while the same product could be sold for 1/10 of its value in large mall stores. I felt coerced. The same happened with another colleague of mine."

New_Market,Angelo Hamid,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,The go-to place for a shopping spree!,"Everyone has heard of Kolkata New Market. That's where people go to buy anything you can think of at very competitive prices. If you're new here, don't expect all shops to be air-conditioned, tidy or less packed because that will not happen. Instead, you can enjoy the sights and sounds, indulge in some street food and shop to your heart's content.Tip: If your Kolkata trip revolves around shopping, I would suggest you book a hotel near new market. That way, if you have a lot of things to carry, you can just leave them at your hotel, get freshened up and walk back to new market to continue shopping."

Before you buy anything I suggest you to analyze the market. They often tend to rip off you for being a foreigner. Especially for garments products. There are other shops just outside new market which are somewhat better. In case of dry foods like nuts chocolates, try to calculate by your own. My guy had ""miscalculated"" over one thousand rupees. Nearby places are very crowded. Be careful with your wallet. There are many pickpockets. Other than that you can enjoy a nice warm afternoons.

So, its better to roam around to compare the prices and then buy. I found the area crowded as everybody is in holiday mood there. The street foods in the surroundings are awesome. I found the prices of different types of nuts very reasonable there. If you are traveling at Kolkata, I will recommend to reaserve at least a whole day for roaming around the New Market area. Otherwise, you cannot have the Kolkata flavor in your trip."

I have been here quite a number of times and it always feels great to be here. The street shop vendors shout and bargain their way to business, something that turns the shopaholic ON in you, in no time. There are also numerous street food counters all along the market. Also the vicinity of the metro railway makes it very convenient to reach as well."

New_Market,Zoheb H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,A girl's shopping paradise,"Almost any item that a girl/lady can possibly dream of is available at this market. Prices of the items will largely be determined by one's bargaining skills.Needless to say, for a guy like me one can't help  but just only frown at the infinite choices(cheap but worth it) that the fairer gender has access to in this market."
New_Market,Shireen S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,The Essence of Kolkata,"This venerable Kolkata institution is also one that evokes a lot of nostalgia in NRIs such as myself and is a great place to find unexpected little treasures and great bargains if you know where to look and how to haggle. My recommendation would be to go with a local if you do not wanted to be ridiculously cheated as almost nothing comes with a price tag and on the spot verbal quotes are given by the shopkeepers or their assistants depending on their lightening fast assessment of the depths of your pockets or gullibility. However I still choose to negotiate its warren of passages and narrow corridors not to mention the constant chant of the shopkeepers to step into their respective cubes to find various items that are either not available in the multiple glitzy malls that have mushroomed across the city and/or are hugely overpriced at those places. During my last 2 visits I was especially impressed by the quality and variety of merchandise at the haberdashery stores that are located in New New Market ie the section that was rebuilt after a part of the market was destroyed in a fire a few decades ago. I almost can’t wait to go back to stock up on all kinds of laces, appliqués, ribbons, embroidered panels and other goodies. Of course there are lots of other sections that specialize in antiques and handicrafts, gold, silver and stone jewelry, costume jewelry and especially colorful glass bangles, food, cheese and confection, clothes and unstitched dress materials, shoes and leather goods and near the front entrances on Lindsay streets a row of florists specializing in some of the most magnificent and breathtaking bouquets and floral decorations that I have ever seen. Definitely worth checking out this pretty, pulsating if somewhat overwhelming commercial heart of colonial and contemporary Kolkata."

If you have money, and moreover if you know exactly where to go and whom to ask, you can literally buy anything here.It is an old market in Kolkata with a history.It was earlier known as "" হগ সাহেবের বাজার"" (""Hogg saheber bajar"") or ""Hogg Market"" after Sir Stuart Hogg.(Even now the old name can be seen on the main entrance to the old complex, as well as the registration papers at Kolkata corporation offices.)The area around New market and Lindsey street is a shoppers paradise..You have to go there to believe it.From cheap souvenirs to priceless ones.. from clothing,footwear, accessories,food, electronics,forex, the place has it all..You name it.. they have it..Must visit if you are in Kolkata.Get a taste of the modern metropolis combined with the one of the colonial era.."
New_Market,Andrew W,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Stifling Stalkers,"If you relish the idea of losing yourself in a Labrinth of sweat and pestering Penny pushing peddlers, then come knock yourself out. That is if the squalor hasn't already sent you reeling to the ground. They say you can find anything in New Market; anything except the thing you're looking for. But then again if you're up for adventure I dare you to stick your head down this rabbit hole."
New_Market,authorneelesh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,disappointing,"we went looking for typical bong dresses,Braved the crowds but were disappointed as all the shopkeepers were only stocking ""bombay products""what a waste of time!!!!1"
New_Market,Dipeeta D Mukherjee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,"Clogged street with encroachments, although inside is pretty decent","New Market used to be a shopper's paradise in the past, irrespective of religion, caste or creed, for the affluent as well as middle-class people. Even after adequate parking facilities were developed, driving a car to the parking space or coming out becomes a nightmare most of the time. The situation has been worsened by encroachments of peddlers and hawkers on the street, thereby clogging and choking even the pedestrians. Be that as it may, it still is an attractive place to shop, with different types of products available here in wide varieties."
