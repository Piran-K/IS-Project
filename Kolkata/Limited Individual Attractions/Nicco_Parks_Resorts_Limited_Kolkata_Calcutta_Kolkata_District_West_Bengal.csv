Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,PaesFerns,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Fun for entire Family!,"If you can overlook the crowds and minimal standards of cleanliness- Nicco park is a fun day outing for kids and adults. During our time there we even saw grandmothers riding the merry-go-round and water slide!We booked our tickets online which saved us time and spared us the rush at the ticket counter. We bought the basic ticket which offered 13 rides for free. Since we went during the Christmas week, there were lots of people and we had to queue anywhere between 10-15minutes for rides. Inside the premises there are ticket counters and food kiosks at frequent intervals to buy tickets for rides that were not part of the basic package. Plenty of toilets around as well- but they are not the cleanest.We spent about 6 hours there and managed to complete about 7 rides. Kiddo enjoyed it so much , we have been told to go back there again! And this is a kid who has been on rides in europe and disneyland. So yes- go for it!"
Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,Somnaiem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Kolkata's amusement park,"Nice mixture of wet and dry rides. Lots of options. Can spend a full day. Family friendly.Food options are there, must visit. "
Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,Upender,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Nico park review,The cost of the ticket doesn't match the rides. Very tiring overcrowded. Food court opens after 2pm before and staff is not much friendly. Recommended to avoid if children are below 10 yrs
Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,Nischal M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Friends,No management system,"Apart from being a enjoyable park in kolkata, Nicco park has no crowd management system, the line takes very long time to reach into the premises. This is very tiring and makes no sense to enjoy after standing for soo long. Buying online tickets is the biggest mistake. There are 12 entry counters out of which only one is dedicated to online tickets. Worst management, least customer attention, no one picks the call and no one assist to manage the crowd."
Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,akghosal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Small theme park but otherwise good selection of rides,"Small theme park but with a relatively good selection of rides for its size and also relatively well maintained. My only issues with this place although relatively minor are that some of the seating in some rides are not always suitable for taller people (there needs to be more leg space in some of the rides) and that covid rules were not strongly enforced in the park (even though there were announcements and notices that masks should be worn at all times in the park, I saw many people wandering around without masks)."
Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,Tausif,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Fun place for kids.,The options are limited in food court and very long queues for the rides. I guess we visit at the wrong time of year. Otherwise a very fun place for kids. Take almost the whole day.
Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,Apurva A,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Friends,Staff Behaviour not good nor system.they don't know how to behave ,People in que don't maintain decorum . They use abusive words and yell on each other's.No sense of etiquette.

There are only a few high thrill rides, cyclone and skydive being the best among high thrill rides. One can spend some 6-7 hrs here. Do carry caps and goggles and your own swimwear if you wish to go to the water park. Although u do get swimwear on rent and also new ones on sale over there."

This is the place to visit in Kolkata,"If u r in Kolkata or planning to visit there ,u must add nicco park in ur visit.dont listen to anyone it's a must visit place in kolkata .Nick park had two different areas one is for dry package and another one is for wet package but if u want to visit wet o wild( wet area in park)u have to take complete package it's of 750 per person which include both dry and wet package but believe me it's worthy to spend 750 rs bcoz maximum rides are included in it . Plz keep one full day for nicco park as it opens around 10.30 and closes at 7.30 and u will enjoy every moment there so don't keep any more plans for that day as u will be too tired for anything else.According to me first visit the water park , bring ur own clothes if u want to save some money otherwise clothes are available there in rent which cost around 300 to 400 for both shorts and t shirt.i had my own clothes as I m a bit hygienic person.U have to take a locker u will get it on rent room which is closer to entrance the rent is 80 rs but u have to deposit 300 rs first and when u will return the locker key they will return 220 rs to u but u must keep the bill u get during locker registration otherwise u will not get back ur 220 rs.inside there is a kfc outlet and a kingfisher outlet u will get beer pint for 180 rs there and some food too like dosa ,pav bhaji etc which costs 100 to 200 rs depending on ur choice of food selection.Enjoy every ride and water upto 3.00 p.m then get shower and change ur clothes there are two big changing areas for ladies and gents including shower area ,and toilets change ur clothes deposit the locker key get ur money back and get out of wet o wild then get a round of nicco park in toy train  then enter dry area which includes rides like sky diver,river cave,roller coaster ,striking car, caterpillar ride and lots of many more there are few good food spots there get some if ur hungry and after u complete all rides it will be 6.30 to 7.00 pm at last take a ride in air trolly and return back to ur hotel.( Jw Marriott is nearby u can try a wonderful dinner in around 1100 rs ( buffet) in there)."

Nicco_Parks_Resorts_Limited,Sudipta Shaheen,,,,"Nicco park is located in the Salt Lake area spreading across the 40 acres land. A full package of entertainment is Nicco. It is best for kids and young ones, teenagers as well as adults. For a day out with family, one must not forget the name of Nicco park. It remains open from 10 am to 5 pm. The travel route is not very difficult. Friends can go in bike or a family can hire private taxi or cab. Beside Nicco is lot of food stalls too. How can one forget the rides! The best part of this amusement park is Wet-o-wild where we simply have fun in waters. Its amazing to visit there in summer. A lot of free rides are also there. Striking car, river cave, boating, flying saucer and roller coaster are simply brilliant. Another region of Nicco is dry which is also very nice. Lots of passes and offers are also available. Those who are heart patients must just avoid a few heartthrumping rides otherwise the visit is worthy enough with the charge it takes."

It is recommended that you book the entry ticket online to save some bucks. Also,book the entry ticket only as it comes with 12 free rides including MIG plane and Eiffel Tower. You can take unlimited rides. Once inside you may choose the paid rides as per your convinience as it is time consuming due to the long queues which will tire you. Overall you can have a fun time with your loved one's."
