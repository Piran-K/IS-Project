Nirmal_Hirday_Pure_Heart,xlne,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,To give and be given,"I spent my last morning in India volunteering in this home. It was an eye-opening and humbling experience. I was surprised at the large number of foreign volunteers that were gathered at Mother House before my group took a local bus here together. They come from all over the world and some of them have been here for months. I spoke to a chinese guy who quit his job just to come India and volunteer for 3 months.. and he’s not even a catholic! A worthy testimony of how Mother Teresa’s universal love have come to influence people all around the globe.The nuns I spoke to were all kind and gentle people. Personally, I felt that the organization of work duties had room for improvement, but the initiative to open up volunteering stints for as short a duration as a few hours is brilliant. It gives people like me a chance to help out physically as well as be uplifted mentally. Believe it or not, this giving experience definitely go both ways!"

Nirmal_Hirday_Pure_Heart,raudhaathif,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,Humbling and inspiring ,"Absolutely loved the atmosphere of the place, the kindness and devotion of the people, and the beautiful prayer ceremony with which my visit coincided. I was lucky to witness the singing and the sermons, within the few minutes that I was there for, due to my big checklist and limited time in the city.Seeing Mother Teresa's room oddly gave me nervous goosebumps. All the people of the place seemed so full of faith and reverence it was almost overwhelming. Met people from at least seven different countries from Europe, Northern Asia and Africa all there to try and absorb the history of the place.There was a lady outside, in large spectacles, who spoke pleasant English, and asked money for her ""handicapped son"". I almost believed her until her friend spoke in Bengali, tauntingly with a contradictory tone to what she said. She said ""the girl doesn't look as stupid as she is"". They didn't know I could understand Bengali.I'm a medical student in Bangladesh since Jan 2016. I understand well enough.I just quietly walked away as they shouted after me."
