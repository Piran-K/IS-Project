The dada bari which is near  by is where all relegious ceremonies are held. the only constraint is the narrow roads which leads to road blocks at times
Parashnath_Jain_Temple,Juliet C R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Friends,Two wonderful experiences in one location!,"Two sites in Kolkata, right next to each other, can elicit strong spiritual experiences, both very special and very memorable.The Jain Temple is covered with small mirror tiles which glow in the sun, giving it a surreal appearance.  Inside the temple is a ghee candle which has been burning for more than 150 years, and the space is inspiring.  The grounds are beautiful, with fountains and landscaping. We saw monks giving lessons to locals, many families with young children, and devout worshippers in brightly-colored saris.But, as though that were not enough - the Temple is also located along the Ganges River, so that you can walk a few steps and be right at the water!  Touching or entering the water is a personal decision - it is said to be very polluted - but you can sit comfortably and watch bathers in yellow loincloths, and watch this river, the heart of India, flowing by.  I personally stepped into the water, took some in my hand and poured a few drops on my head, the ritual we had been taught - then went back to the hotel and scrubbed!!  I was just fine - but many people chose to just watch.The Temple and the River - two not-to-be-missed sights!!"

Parashnath_Jain_Temple,Leslie B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Solo,Colorful Temple,This temple is quite stunning and apparently the Jains do good works in the community.  It is difficult to see such extravagance amid so much poverty in a city.  I have some moral issues with that in all religions.
Parashnath_Jain_Temple,Liz S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,"Dolly mixture colours, wonderful to see!","I loved this, statues of men on elephants at bottom of temple, yellows and mauves, blues and pinks, extraordinary mix of colours, photos permitted outside temple.  Quirky gift shop. I was there when visiting pilgrims came, rather moving to watch them inside temple. Stunning flowers and plants, escape from the city for half an hour or more.  Don't miss, one of my five essential things to see."
