I will advise others not to visit this shop if you have some self respect & don't want to be badly treat,I had a terrible experience getting medicines from Park Street branch of Life line pharmacy of Kolkata. The staff there are very rude & takes unusually long time to deliver you the medicines. They will keep gossiping and if you complain about being late they will abuse you & threaten you. They will make you feel like beggar as they are selling medicines with some discount.

It is good for westerners who do not want to stray much from what they know because the style of the bars and resraurants is very western world. There is a Starbucks and lots of ""trendy"" coffee shops and stores. It is not my style of travel because it feels like a tourist trap. But I still recommend seeing it especially around Christmas / New Year and at night. The entire street is decorated with lights around Christmas. There is also a very active, very young night life. It  reminds me of New York. Beware of cars if you are not used to Indian driving. Crossing the street is like a game of human Frogger. "

Park_Street,Sumit Kasera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Happening street of Kolkata,"Park street of Kolkata is like Connaught place of Delhi or MG Road of Gurgaon. It is happening place at a very easily accessible location – quite central to Kolkata. The traffic flows one way based on time of day. Despite growth in traffic, it is told that KP (Kolkata police) is one of the most efficient traffic police systems in the country. Even the taxi drivers dread to break rules.Place is famous for its both fine dining options (a number of them adorn both sides of road) and street food including golgappas (or puchkas as they are called in Kolkata). Apart from food, there is night life and designer boutiques and some good hotels including The Park. The broad pedestrian ways allow one to walk easily and relish the old-world charm of Kolkata, the numerous hanging cables notwithstanding. When in Kolkata, have a peak of the famous park street for the eclectic mix of experiences."
