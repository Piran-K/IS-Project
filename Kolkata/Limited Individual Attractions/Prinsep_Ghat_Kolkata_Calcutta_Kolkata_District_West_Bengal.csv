Prinsep_Ghat,Ganesan V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Good boating ride,"We can walk along the side of the lake, good walking trail. Best to go in a bigger boat to see Howrah bridge and it costs less as well, feels safe and very comfortable too."
Prinsep_Ghat,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Magical,"Stand in front of the James Prinsep Memorial with the Vidyasagar Setu as its backdrop. The sky shows its evening colors. The entire effect is magical.James Prinsep pioneered the idea of building a tunnel to drain swamps & decoded the Brahmi script. His Memorial is in the Palladian style – six sets of Ionian columns holding a 40’ white roof.Due to increasing graffiti on the walls, the administration has cordoned off entry inside the Memorial.Sit in the Memorial lawn & then visit the riverside. To get to the Ghat, you've to first cross railway tracks of a railway station called Prinsep Ghat Station. On the other side, stone steps lead to the Ganges.Walking along the Ghat, you can see it's a popular place to meet friends, chat over bhelpuris & watch the Ganges flow. James Prinsep Ghat is a splendid place to evoke – nostalgia, old world charm, life’s calling, spirituality…No entry fees."
Prinsep_Ghat,fitnessmount,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,Perfect place for couple,The Prinsep Ghat and its surroundings are really very beautiful.

Prinsep_Ghat,sudeep912,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,near new bridge,good serene place. nice garden with boating in the near by river. take some good pictures. needs to walk a bit from main road 
Prinsep_Ghat,Anjan Sengupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,An emotional connect for me!!,It was December 1992 when my father took me and my brother to show the then newly built Vidyasagar Setu in a bus from my Maternal Grandparents’ place in Norh Kolkata and we were stopped at the entry of the Bridge as pedestrians were not allowed. My father then had discovered the tiny Railway Station at Princep Ghat on the Kolkata Circular Railway to take us back to Dum Dum Junction and then back home.I had an opportunity to visit the same Princep Ghat and the Railway Station after more than 28 years in March 2021 and my mind was full of the memories of that day and my deceased father.Sitting on the banks of the Ganges just adjacent to the Railway Station has an extraordinary feeling altogether. very nice place to spend some time in Kolkata.
Prinsep_Ghat,hossainimam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Couples,Columns,One the oldest places of kolkata.it provides launch or ferry services across river ganges and circular rail service from dumdum junction rail station
Prinsep_Ghat,Parwathi H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Beautiful Memorial,This is a beautiful Memorial built by the British Raj to honour a very renowned Anglophile - James Prinsep credited with deciphering the ancient Indian Prakrit script . The memorial is very well maintained. We also took a boat ride in the evening in the Hoogly river which was very enjoyable.
Prinsep_Ghat,Coastal820768,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,This is a pretty cool place,"This is a pretty cool place to hangout with friends, with family or with your partner. It's a perfect destination for evenings. I have been to Kolkata many times and every time I get to know a new face of the city. Limited-time can't define the beauty of the city. I like this place especially during the sunset when the natural light amalgamates with man made light sources."
Prinsep_Ghat,Pritam Bhattacharjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Historic Place.,"One of the best historic places of the city, which was once the Capital of India. Located by the Hooghy river, its a great place to relax and chill out and also hang out with friends. This place is also highly recommended for couples; as well as photography."
Prinsep_Ghat,Srikanth_Sudhir,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A walk and a row,"A well maintained walk with views of the two iconic bridges across the Hoogly. One the the landings afford you the option of taking a boat ride which gives you a better view of the bridges. The boat ride is a bit disappointing though. While it lasts 30 minutes as committed (costs INR400), the distance traveled is negligible, so you are basically shelling out the money to float on the Hoogly for 30 minutes. It still does afford gorgeous photo-opportunities though."
Prinsep_Ghat,Mrudula,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Ghat,"Prinsep Ghat, located on the banks of River Hooghly,With the magnificent Howrah Bridge in the background."
Prinsep_Ghat,Sea Dweller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,This is one of the oldest recreational spots of Kolkata.,"Prinsep Ghats is a ghat built in 1841 during the British Raj, along the Kolkata bank of the Hooghly River in India. The Palladian porch in the memory of the eminent Anglo-Indian scholar and antiquary James Prinsep was designed by W. Fitzgerald and constructed in 1843.      The monument to Prinsep is rich in Greek and Gothic inlays. It was restored by the state's public works department in November 2001 and has since been well-maintained."
Prinsep_Ghat,KennethEast,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Wonderful walk on promenade from Prinsep Ghat along the Hooghly,"Fodor's pitched the walk on the Prinsep Ghat-Babu Ghat Promenade.  Thank you, Fodor's!  It was a wonderful Sunday morning walk along a nicely maintained riverside path where mostly locals were taking a morning outing.  We saw few other non-Indians.  Important tip!  Take a taxi, uber or tuk tuk to the Prinsep Ghat!  We tried to walk through the parks to the Prinsep Ghat.  Looks doable from tourist maps. But the roads along the river are major, elevated, and confusing.  We finally grabbed a cab.  You'll come across many people taking their morning bath in the Hooghly.  There are many small boats for hire along the route.  We didn't hire one, but wish we had.  We later took a river cruise instead, which was a disappointment.  The small oar boats looked more interesting.  There are several places where you can exit the promenade.  We walked past the Eden Gardens and then explored the old colonial area near the General Post Office.  It was a delightful walk and served as our introduction to Kolkata."
Prinsep_Ghat,Mitesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,So good,"Prinsep Ghat, located on the banks of River Hooghly, is a majestic structure famous for its Greek/ Gothic inlays."

We paid for a one hour ride but could hardly spend 15 mins because he was rowing the boat at such a slow speed that there was no wind. When asked to go back he suddenly got all the energy to drive it faster. The place has good view of the river and the lighted Hooghly bridge but it lacks basic maintenance. There was no clean place to sit over there.

A two-minute walk away from this structure, across the train level crossing, is the promenade by the Hooghly River. You can hire a rowboat for 30 minutes and be rowed under the long, new Howrah suspension bridge..."

Prinsep_Ghat,Arko_Shine,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,For an evening by the Hooghly,"When in Kolkata, with nothing much to do in the evening, decide to spend your time here, under the Vidyasagar Setu. With the view of the river, lights from above the bridge glistening in the waters, ferries waving across, a pair of railway tracks and that picturesque archway - photographers even choose to do pre-wed shoots here. The cool breeze of the river is sure to take away all the bustles the city offers continuously!"
Prinsep_Ghat,raj,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Business,Visit in Evening,Nice place to sit in the evenings and see the ferries go along. There is a local train station just behind the ghat which you need to cross to reach here. New bridge runs just above your head and gives a good feel of city when the lights are turned on.

Prinsep_Ghat,abhi0804,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,ideal for romantic evening,"This place is ideal for that romantic evening, you have been planning with your beloved. It was built in memory of the eminent anglo-endian scholar James prince, on the bank of the Hooghly river. You can enjoy an evening ferry ride along with a view of the sunset, and the second Hooghly bridge which is an architectural marvel in Kolkata after the Howrah bridge. The second bridge looks splendid in the evening, when its all lit up.This place is an ideal visit for your gang of friends as well."

Prinsep_Ghat,chintan girish modi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Perfect spot for a quiet evening,"I went to Prinsep Ghat in a group of six people. One of our friends had her birthday that day but she was not feeling quite up to celebrating because her uncle was unwell. We nudged her to step out, and take a breath. I think we reached the place around 8pm or so, perhaps even later. It felt so serene -- the view of the water stretching far and wide, no tourists in the background, just us quietly cherishing our moments of togetherness. Friends who have been there at other times say that the boat ride can be a beautiful experience. I would like to check that out sometime."

Prinsep_Ghat,Paroms,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017,Not to be missed,"This is why people go to Kolkata. The river is its lifeline and its main attraction. And if you haven't been to Prinsep Ghat, close to where you now have the Millennial Park, then you really haven't seen the heart of Kolkata. Best time to visit: late summer evening or better still, July or august evening, when the river has all of that gorgeous muddy monsoon water. Go around 4.30-5, wait til the dusk falls, and the lights come on. Its dreamy and magical and wistful! Your heart is full. Millennial Park stretches almost till the Howrah bridge, but you get an awesome view of both the old bridge and the new, the 2nd Hooghly bridge. and the boats floating by or docked. It is what indelible memories are made of"
