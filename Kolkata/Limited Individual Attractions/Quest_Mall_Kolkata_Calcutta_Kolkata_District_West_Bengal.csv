Quest_Mall,DG Pulak,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Solo,Major brands are here ....,"Situated right on the main road near Park Circus. One of the biggest shopping malls over at Kolkata, West Bengal. As per my opinion this place is a nice shopping arcade where you can find large brands showcasing their products. Fantastic place to visit if you are at Kolkata..."
Quest_Mall,Indradeep R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Couples,High street Retail ,"Every large city has a High street Retail to boast off and this mall is Kolkata’s answer to the likes of UB City , Bengaluru or Palladium , Mumbai. The security measures in place to maintain overall hygiene and safety protocols during Covid are in place. I found the security taking special care to disperse crowd gathering together in a group with a smile and politeness. The mall boasts of brands like Michael Korea, Coach, Gucci etc. Some of the items are way beyond affordability of common folks but that doesn’t stops you from checking out isn’t it ? Pls go and browse across the stores to give yourself a happy kick of Retail therapy. Importantly there are enough food outlets where you can afford to eat so it’s a good day outing in the right temperature in the city of joy too. Go and enjoy ! "
Quest_Mall,Mohammad Jobayed Hosen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Family,Quest Mall,The mall is a place of super convenience in Kolkata. You find a large pool of brands in one roof with neat and clean and spacious environment. Food court on top floor is another attraction of the mall. A combination of eastern and western cuisine has made it unique. Sufficient number of toilets/restrooms are there with proper cleanliness and hygiene. A great place for family shopping!
Quest_Mall,NafeeTA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,This place never stops to amaze!,"Undoubtedly the must visit shopping destination in Kolkata. The variety available always keeps updating, and no visit is complete without a visit to Spencer's and a movie watch."
Quest_Mall,A K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Luxury Mall,Great mall. Now has Ferragamo for another 2 weeks. But the Indian designers at Loft have brought their leftovers...it appears... their clothes are full and drab. Would benefit from getting clothes from high end Indian designers in Loft

Quest_Mall,Johann R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"Everything You'd Want, Not Need!","Want a watch that costs an arm and a leg? Or a Fountain Pen? The Quest Mall is for you. And better still, if you visit in December, as we did, most of the International Brand stores offer some amazing deals. We got a 2 for 2 deal on the world's favourite pair ( that's my opinion!) of Jeans. Spend time here and you'd discover the best of Bishra Bangla - hope I spelled that right - and Fab India, which is a shop we always visit when in India. of course all the most luxurious international brands are represented here.We didn't spend much time here, because we knew what we wanted and where to find them at Quest, but I'd imagine you could make a day's outing here should your purse be able to handle the stress!Special shout out to the William Penn shop. It's not anywhere you can buy a good old fashion Fountain Pen, or a Quill Pen, or things that people tend to want, as opposed to need!"

Quest_Mall,Ashish M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Solo,Reasonable mall with grand fascia,It's a reasonably good mall with grand exterior.

The food court doesn’t really have that many options despite reviews to the contrary. So this is his I used the mall, I was in Kolkata for 6 hours, took a taxi to the mall (it was raining all through the day), had breakfast did a bit if a wander,  watched a movie in the cinema ( leather electric reclining seats), did a bit if a wander, had lunch, the. Taxi back to the airport"

This was a mistake.After having been in the crazy streets of Kolkata, with people sleeping all around, you are suddently in a luxury temple.No one in the stores which are even way to expensive for a european guy like me. People are just here to look at those products that they will never be able to afford.And then you have to go back in the outside true life.

Elevators - the waiting time, every time is very long as people call elevator by pressing both (up and down) keys all the time - resulting into elevators stopping at each levels while going up or down. 2 of the elevators do not serve food court and higher levels.

Quest_Mall,Shourjendra D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,"Nice mall,but expensive to say the least","This Mall has been projected as a one stop shopping experience for all your premium needs. Most international reputed brands like Gucci to Calvin Klein are listed here. Make no mistake,that this is just another mall in the city,but way to expensive than anywhere else in Kolkata. I'll give my own experience when I went to buy jeans from Levis store situated inside the Mall. One jeans which caught my fancy was selling for Rs 3600 after discount. I found the price ridiculous. Hence walked away,simply saying didn't like it. Next day bought two jeans of Levis staruss,same model 511 from Mtero Cash and Carry for Rs 1400 and Rs 1600 !! So I got two jeans for the price of one,from the same Company ! Why spend more here ?You will if you want to splurge your undisclosed income !'Restaurants are expensive too. Parking space is huge but refrain from taking your S-class and 7 series as the access way up and down parking lot is a winding way,and you actually may get stuck ! I saw a S-350 getting stuck.The place is a hangout zone for locals. Hnece gets crowded in the evenings as well as on weekends. Frankly,I have been there.Probably won't visit again"

Quest_Mall,Georgio Valentino Rayala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,High End Shopping Mall In Kolkata,"This Mall is located near the Park circus area and is the best place to shop for luxury brands like Canali, Guess, Rolex, Paul Smith, Omega, Jimmy Choo etc. This mall also has the best collection of restaurants like Yauatcha, The Irish House, Bombay Brasserie etc. It also has a good food court but the pricing is a bit expensive. There is also a Spencers Hyper Market which has a Gourmet food section. It also has a Lifestyle store which is great for shopping for clothes.I visited this mall along with my friends and bought a Tommy Hilfiger watch."

Quest_Mall,RamGanesan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Business,Excellent High End mall,"Situated in the prime area this mall is a happening place.  I visited this place during the durga pooja time and it was decorated all over and looked really beautiful. The best thing about the mall is that is very large and is not cramped.  All international brand stores are available at this joint.  Car parking is ample is charged but a few innovative stuff such as paying for the car inside the mall itself is great.  The food court is not very big and does not seem to have too much variety. Though the ambience of the food court is good, I felt it lacked variety. The top floor has a Inox Cineplex."

Quest_Mall,IQCHY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Name the Brand Quest Mall Got It,You just name the brand and you will see that Quest mall got it. This is the place for people like me who enjoy brand shopping. So if you are a brand freak you must visit this place. During my visit to Kolkata I have visited this place every day. I just love shopping and dinning there. Also the best movie INOX Signature brand is there.I have watched lots of movies too in normal mid range and also in INOX Signature seats. I will define this movie experience as 7 star.   They have the most expensive 7 star movie seats which is expensive but the best in town. If you like to spend this is the mall for enjoyment for a person like you.
