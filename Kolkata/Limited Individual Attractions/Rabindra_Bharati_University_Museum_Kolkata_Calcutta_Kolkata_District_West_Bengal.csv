Rabindra_Bharati_University_Museum,Sachin0408,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Solo,Tribute to Tagore,"A Nobel Laureate! His art, His work, His collection and His Life. All tucked away in this massive structure popularly called as Rabindra Bharati University Museum, which as the name suggests doubles up as a university and a Museum to the followers of the phenomena called ‘Tagore’.The structure is maintained well though there is room for improvement. My visit to the Museum was never as a tourist but more as a quintessential citizen of the ‘City of Joy’. A must visit for the lovers of History, Books, Art, Literature and connoisseur’s of Tagore. You won’t be disappointed."

Loved the house with traditional plan,all rooms opening into the courtyard, the typical windows of that era and not to mention the personal collection and artworks.

I knew little about the man until today, but after my visit i feel i have a good general background about him.Open time: 1030 - 1630 Closed MondaysEntry Fee: 50 rupees (foreigners), 10 rupees (Indians) - looks like racial discrimination to me, which i'm not sure Tagore would approve of as he traveled a lot."
