Rabindra_Sarovar,Natalie1204,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,"Clean, green, peaceful","This beautiful stretch of green in the heart of south kolkata is easy but just on the eye but also on the feet. One of the few places in the city where people can go to walk safely (& not pay a fee) while they breathe easy. It’s lush, green and the view of the lake too, is spectacular. At this time of the year, one gets to see a wide variety or migratory birds too, so making it even more special. There are different points of entry and exit and also timings for walking. The park closes for the day at 6pm"
Rabindra_Sarovar,Gouri C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Family,Oasis in Kolkata ,This place is a patch oasis in a city which is otherwise crowded. This is the first time I went there. It was raining in the morning time. So many kids were playing football even in the rain. Some senior members were watching and some were cheering for them. Such a lovely sight to watch.

Inside roads are very clean nice gardens but water in the lake need urgent attention because of muddy water hardly can find water birds. I could not find any Duck, Sniper or Swan on 11/07/21.

Rabindra_Sarovar,Pallabi Barori,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Family,Horrible  people around,"It’s a beautiful place to visit with family, but dangerous if you are alone and particularly girl. I visited there with my didi yesterday, we were sitting by our selves near the lake amongst many other people. Suddenly two guys approached us started staring at us making us nervous and suspicious ( they were not wearing mask even though its covid time). We asked what was the issue since neither me nor my sister knows them. The crowd around us could see that we were getting scared, and when we tried to walk out of the place, the guys cane around and said it was a prank. A prank we were never part of, we did not spot any microphone or any camera around, then what exact kind of prank it was other than just disturbing two sisters having normal conversations at a lake? Although it has security around who would not let people take water and all with them inside of the area, none of them are bothered to check if things like this happen in daylight in a very public place. I was scared, my didi freaked out more than me to be honest, and i did not know what exactly i should have done at that point of time, because I don’t think that in this day such behaviour can be considered as a prank? I mean there is actually no women safety, and if we speak up we are being shutted by the people saying its a prank? Mind it, it was not at all funny, the way they stared at us blankly. I don’t know what should we have done at that situation so we left that place. But I would want mostly females to be prepared for this kind of behaviour there. Also i am 24 years old my ofcouse my didi is older than me, just so that you know the situation."

Rabindra_Sarovar,Sumit Kasera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Nostalgia at Rabindra Sarover,"Kolkata was my birthplace – place where I was born and brought up and where I lived for about 15 years. So when some reunion request came more than 28 years after I had left the City of Joy, I came back to the city. I used to live bang opposite Rabindra Sarover for about 3 years. The years were marked by a table-tennis centre at the Rabindra Sarover Stadium where I used to learn the game. There used to also run a very slow toy train that had disappeared now. There were possibly few boating options too –not seen again! The street food options were customary to the city – the puchkas (Gol Gappas as they are called in Kolkata), Muri, and host of other savouries. And last but not the least, it was the lung of city – a place where morning walkers and evening joggers used to run around.  About 28 years later, the place was almost the same as I had left it. Almost I would say! The growing plastic menace meant that I was not allowed to carry a polythene bag (even with stuff inside it) with no place to keep. Finally, I stuffed the bag below my shirt to carry it along. An NGT warning screamed that no puja, community event or social picnic could be performed at the venue. Inside there were muri walas selling muri (puffed rice with potato, onion and spices). The most notable change of 28 years was that the bank of the lake was converted into a big promenade for people to stroll and have some fresh air. We could see many people walking or sitting alongside. There were dust bins around but I could see trash here and there – overall maintenance could have definitely been better.The water was not too dirty – many years ago we used to swim in it. A pair of ducks were making merry in the water. It was sheer nostalgia at Rabindra Sarover – a place to stay alongside a vast expanse of water, a promenade to take a leisurely stroll and a place to allow the lethargy of city to seep in and a place to savour the mesmerizing beauty of nature."

Rabindra_Sarovar,Dhiraj H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Detoxification zone in Kolkata ,"We have stayed in Kolkata in three stints spanning over eight years and it is a shame that we have never been to this island of peace and tranquillity located in the heart of Kolkata,till today. Although we had good feedback ,the massive crowds during weekends was a put off. So we ventured to this lake area early morning ( and that too on Dashami, the culmination of the Durga Puja festival) for our morning walk. We went through the Southern Avenue gate after parking in the road( there was a temporary no parking sign , for the Pujas). When you enter you see Nazrul Manch, the auditorium , on your left. Then you see the Padma Pukur (Lotus pond)Park which is lake with a nice walkway all around.Yes there are some lotus but I would suggest take just one round and go further towards the huge lake called Rabindra Sarovar. Since it was around 5.45 in the morning the crowd was thin with some morning walkers and young couples relaxing surely after a long night of Puja hopping. You wonder at the large expanse of water which soothes your spirit after experiencing the madness that Kolkata is. There are at least three concentric circles of walkway around the vast lake. The place is quite well maintained given that there is no entry fee. It is open from 4.30 am in summer and from 5 am in summer. It is supposed to be a plastic free zone but we spotted odd scraps of plastic bag and even water bottles. The trees around the lake lends to its beauty. There are enough places to sit. We even saw a police car going around the road inside. There is a lovely garden at the far end of the lake. And you will see rowers from the adjacent rowing club.There is another seemingly private rowing club in the premises.There are thankfully no vendors inside.Do take time and admire the Kolkata skyline around the lake. Would highly recommend."
Rabindra_Sarovar,Kaniz K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Relaxing,"A beautiful artificial lake in Kolkata with trees surrounding all side of the lake is a place to relax, recuperate and rejeuvinate. There are walkways along side the lake. There are benches to sit but in the evening hardly any bench remain free. Couples were closely sitting and enjoying their own world. Many just stroll, walk, jog, run or walk while chatting at their leisure. A lovely scenic place to see the sunset over the lake and nice breeze. No entry fee required. Just walked through the gate. The greenery of the area is very soothing. Cars can be parked outside the gate. We hired a taxi to come but one can take Metro also to come close to the lake park."
