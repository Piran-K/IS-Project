The place as you enter, have  few pictures of old Kolkata on the landing of a staircase,but that is as close as it gets to the Kolkata of bygone era.Even the terrace allegedly where Swami Vivekananda was born have been covered,changed and decorated and thus all charm is lost. Go and have a look at Jorasanko Thakurbari,the ancestral home of the great poet Kaviguru Rabindra Nath Tagore,and you will understand what I mean.They have retained all older items,the building,the structure,the paintings,the memorabilia,everything,yet have renovated and well kept that place.Here Ramkrishna Mission have by their own volition,changed everything and have made a building which is an eyesore in the first place.It is reasonably neat and clean in the inside,but make sure you are not old or inform,as there are plenty of twists and turns inside to have a look at the museum of sorts inside. There are number of rooms,and you have to climb quite a few stairs here and there to finally see them all.Remove your shoes first as you enter,and again wear them as you exit.Pay Rs 10/- as entry fee once you have entered the main door.Photography is strictly prohibited inside (what on Earth for ?),and they threaten people who try to take few snaps (happened in front of me!)Overall a must visit place if you like the teachings and work of Swamiji but as I said,for me it is a once visit place as the main charm of the place has been irretrievably lost due to their over enthusiastic renovation of a timeless heritage place of Bengal"

Ramakrishna_Mission_Swami_Vivekananda_s_Ancestral_House_and_Cultural_Centre-Kolka.ht,Rudranil R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Family,It worth paying a visit.....,It  is a museum and cultural centre maintained by Ramakrishna Mission. This house remained Vivekananda's home throughout his childhood.You will find many interesting facts & details inside this cultural museum.... This is not a place for amusement or part goers.... those who are really interested should only visit inside.... or else just take look from street itself and pass on.... The place is very peaceful so it is better to avoid taking children inside as new gen kids are usually unruly & noisy.....

This is converted to museum.  The museum leads you through his mansion, which was nicely restored (they even describe the restoration process). You see rooms with descriptions, sometimes including statues in various scenes. There were a couple of nice short films but, again, didn't describe enough about his life's work. You can see the history of Vivekanand's family, photographs, clothing’s, furniture, etc."

Ramakrishna_Mission_Swami_Vivekananda_s_Ancestral_House_and_Cultural_Centre-Kolka.ht,My2BareFeet,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Solo,Interesting if you're Indian,"Despite its address on 3 Gour Mohan Road, the building is on the larger street called Bidhan Sarani, just north of Vivekenanda Rd, in the neighbourhood of Simla, north of Kolkata's main centre. Entrance fee is 10 rupees, and shoes come off and are placed on a shelf before the entrance.As a foreigner I wanted to find out more about Swami Vivekenanda, whom I first heard about in the exhibits in Victoria Memorial Hall. I was disappointed when this museum didn't provide much of any content about Swami's life's work.Instead, it provided anecdotes mainly about his childhood and his family members. The museum leads you through his mansion, which was nicely restored (they even describe the restoration process). You see rooms with descriptions, sometimes including statues in various scenes. There were a couple of nice short films but, again, didn't describe enough about his life's work."

The environment is just electrical. The temple is very well maintained-afterall cleanliness is next to godliness. The Lord Krishna is the worshipped there along with Radha and Balaram and Lord jagannath. If you sit in the central hall with your eyes closed for 15 minutes, you will touch the inner harmony for sure. The presence of super power is felt every where there. It makes your mind free of worries and you will feel absolute happiness. A must visit for all the travellers."
Ramakrishna_Mission_Swami_Vivekananda_s_Ancestral_House_and_Cultural_Centre-Kolka.ht,Profvns,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 • Friends,Vivekananda's Ancestral House,"Ramakrishna Mission Swami Vivekananda's Ancestral House and Cultural Centre is a museum and cultural centre is located at 3, Gourmohan Mukherjee Street, Kolkata, India.  The house remained Vivekananda's home throughout his childhood and early youth. This historical cultural centre was inaugurated by the President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.Narendranath Datta or Narendra or Naren was his original name. As a coincidence he was born on 12.1.1863 which happened to be a festival day for Hindus called Makara Sankranthi festival. His family was a traditional family. He was one among the nine children to his parents.  His father, Viswanath Datta, was an attorney at the  High Court in Calcutta. His grandfather Durgacharan Datta was a scholar both in Sanskrit and Persian.He was born in his ancestor’s house. After father’s death in 1884 his aunt, who was also residing with the family claimed the entire property by filing a suit against Narendra's mother (Bhuvaneswari Devi) and others.  He won the litigation initially but dragged on for years in appellate courts. However it ended a few days before his death in 1902. The judgment was in his favour wherein the court awarded complete and absolute legal possession of his ancestral house to him. So until his last breath he was forced to involve in unnecessary litigation. But he was not at all bothered about it. By the time the lis ended in favour of Narendra (by now Swami Vivekananda) it was in dilapidated and in a hopeless condition.It was in 1962 the Ramakrishna Mission authorities acquired the property to make it a museum. In May 1999 the adjacent land was acquired through the Government of West Bengal. A committee was constituted for this task. The said committee managed to collect several millions of rupees.  At present that ancestral home of Narendra houses a museum, a research centre, a memorial shrine, a library, an English centre, a computer training centre, and a charitable dispensary. They are organising seminars and conventions regularly herein."
