Royal_Calcutta_Turf_Club,tumbleweedchris,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Trashy Turf Club,"After skating by under interstate slums and past beggars, you enter the public area of the local Turf Club. This place is by no means royal or even passable as what most people would consider a nice horse track. There are signs for people not to urinate off the stands into local residential areas, patrons spit, patrons chug 8 oz cups of Coke as if they were beer, and litter is everywhere. The track is by no means a typical race grounds and is a poorly maintained racing surface. There is a pit of bookies making odds and taking bets, all while operating out of briefcases full of cash and recording everything by pencil and paper. This place is truly a one of a kind sight, even if it's not a very pretty one. Therefore, I'm ranking it as a 4 for novelty and curiosity, even though the facilities are a 1 by any other standard. It is also worth noting that it might make women tourists uncomfortable as there likely isn't 10 women in the place at any given time. They also take cell phones at the entrance, but I would just tell people you don't have one because I would not trust any valuables left anywhere here."

Anyone can enter the RCTC by paying a paltry Rs.20 at non member stand. If you wish to keep your mobile phone with you, then you have to pay Rs. 450 per phone or else you can keep the same with the locker room provided by Rctc at the entrance. You can bet in Kolkata races as well as the races which are taking place on that very day in other race courses in India, such as Mumbai, Bangalore, Mysore, Pune etc. You can bet on win/place/second horse pool/ forecast/tanala/trebles/jackpot. The best part is the reaction of the crowd as the horses come to finish line the crowd starts to cheer for the horse in which they had placed their bets. It's a must go for race lovers and a sheer experience for anyone who goes there. It's also one of the happening places in town on 01 January every year with lots of people dressed elegantly at the venue with much fun fare and party like atmosphere."

My partner did not have a tie so one of the security guys took him to a lady who was selling ties outside and chose the one he should purchase. We were then allowed in and became members for the day. We were made most welcome by the staff and the other racegoers. We bet on all the races and won 3 so were very happy. Would highly recommend a visit

Royal_Calcutta_Turf_Club,bgautam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,Unmatched thrill ,"On a lush green turf, horses urged by their jockeys in bright colours in full cry will give a thrill that is unmatched in a city life. Better still, concentrating on the faces of the crowd can provide you the glimpse of both worlds. Haves and havenots. While one is jumping with joy having found his choice has brought home the bacon, for the loser the world is lost. Without losing time both the groups quickly get engaged to find the next winner. True you can hardly see more attentive students anywhere these days. And a postgraduate can be found as keen as a school dropout to locate a winner. But be careful there is a saying that no one wins in racing except the authorities who get the tax revenue that is irrespective of the results. As long you can afford it as fun and don't gamble to earn a livelihood, it can remain as a fine pastime and a thrilling day out . Happy wagering and good luck!"
Royal_Calcutta_Turf_Club,RBan26,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Friends,"Haunted by George William's favourite horse ""Pride""","People say this is one of the most popular haunted places in Kolkata.

After he lost his first race, his master had killed him in despair and since then Pride's ghost is said to have haunted the race course. Even today on new moon night, Pride is found my many running in the turf's courseline. However I never got a chance to meet Pride. Visited only once during afternoon and it was a nice experience."

Royal_Calcutta_Turf_Club,Margie9954,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,A interesting way to spend an afternoon,"The Royal Calcutta Turf Club is situated near Hastings.  All races are held in the afternoon.  In summers they start around 2 pm and in winters around 12.30/1 p.m. and the last race is usually 4.30 /5 p.m.  There are two stands.  One for the general public at a cheaper entrance and the other is the members stand where entrance is higher and there is a dress code.The buildings are very much of the Raj era.  They have a very big paddock in which the horses parade before going out for the race.  All the tote boards are very legible and there are totalisers on the gound as well as the first floor of the building.  Betting here is relatively simple compared to other countries - just pay your bet and get a ticket with your bet printed on it.Bets can be as low as Rs.10/-.  There is plenty of seating.  Members can pay for a box to sit in for the season to watch the races.From the stands there is a beautiful view of the Kolkata skyline with the Victoria memorial in front and all the first skyscrapers of Kolkata too!  Of course, the excitement builds up when the horses are put into the gates and if your horse wins you are in seventh heaven.  All in all a great way to spend a lazy afternoon"
Royal_Calcutta_Turf_Club,forestloverNagpur,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,My First and only visit,"The Royal Clacutta Turf Club gave me a very nice invitation as a Special Invitee(along with spouse) for its Monsoon Derby race day in October 2012.I took my own car rather than the one I was using officially and this thing made me move along the diversion route for normal traffic and hence what should have taken me five minutes took lot more time and by the time I could reach the entrance gate after parking my vehicle the races had already started and all the persons whom i expected to meet before the start of the races had moved inside.I could not contact them any more as the mobiles are not allowed inside and if you carry them then they have to be deposited at the entrance gate and token taken from the club staff at the counters.I did that and moved inside admiring the old British style buildings of the club and the race course.I could see a large number of members and visitors inside and of course the horses strutting around with their numbers and jockeys,trainers and owners  before going for the races.There were stalls for eatables.There were many screens from which we could see the odds,the horses,the race and the winnings.There were boards showing the choices for different races by the various newspapers.We went up to the members enclosure and saw the race in progress.From there we looked around at the Kolkata skyline the maidan,the Victoria Memorial and the high rise buildings on the Esplanade and Chowringhee and the new bridge nearby.After that we studied the race books and guessed about the winners.I did get my choices for the horses in the first three sometimes.We enjoyed the thrill of the horse races and I remembered that I had a great love of horses right from childhood as my maternal grandfather had a number of  horses and during visits to his place I used to get a horse for my daily ride.The Monsoon Derby race was won by a horse I had thought would win.When  I went down I was surprised to find that the owner appered to be someone I had played golf with once at the Tollygunge club but I was confused whether actually he was the same person or some one else and in the confusion forgot to congratulate him.In all, the horse races at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club were enjoyable.As I was on the way out from Kolkata being close to retirement it was really a royal experience which I will remember."
