It has been the scene of countless epic Kolkata derbies - East Bengal vs. Mohun Bagan, ever since it was built. Great atmosphere when the stadium fills out. Recently it hosted the final of the FIFA U-17 World Cup (2017). That tournament brought in lot of upgrades in terms of infrastructure - seats for everyone (even 10 years back, when, as college students we went for the derby matches, seating mostly was on the steps). Went to the VIP area with family members (senior citizens) and found very good amenities - clean toilets, and even a complimentary dinner."

Salt_Lake_Stadium,foodie_uncle,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Paradise for Soccer maniac in India,This is the biggest stadium for soccer in India. The building is huge and you can always find some or the other matches being played by local teams. The best part is that even the local matches are being watched by large number of people in the stadium.

Salt_Lake_Stadium,Ronj0210,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Business,"World's second largest stadium, important soccer matches held, just beside EM bypass, and Hyatt. Nice place for morning","Home ground to Atletico De Kolkata Football team. A super big stadium which hosts a lot of different sport events.. including the famous Mohan Bagan Football matches. It is a popular place for morning walkers but has not been well cared for. The place is dirty, scrapped vehicles can be seen and is home to a lot of stray dogs around. If maintained properly this can be a place for tourist attraction. Suggestions from Sports Authority of India next door should be taken and implemented. SAI has been maintaining there property beautifully."

Salt_Lake_Stadium,Dev1972,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Dirty and poorly maintained,One of the biggest stadiums in the country. But is poorly maintained and extremely dirty. Some pockets on its fringes are dens of criminals. No place to visit unless it is hosting a derby and the whole city has converged to see a East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan football match

Salt_Lake_Stadium,Dr Anshuman Das,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,Football,This is the best football stadium in Kolkata at present. Made me famous by the Indian Soccer league matches. But it is in need of maintenance. Also it's located a little out of the city and the commute in peak hours is difficult.
Salt_Lake_Stadium,vikasmardia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Business,salt lake stadium,indias biggest football stadium located in salt lake. very approachable from airport and surrounded with good hotels.
Salt_Lake_Stadium,Avatima,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,The Best football stadium in the city but it has possibly seen better days,"Went to watch an ISL match after my wife got some complementary tickets.There is hardly any ramp and the stairs are fairly large. Water arrangements and food counters are well organised and fairly clean, Lighting in the passage (It was an evening match) was fairly good too. The actual playground seems to have been shortened  a lot compared to my early memories (~20 years). For gates far away from the EM bypass side, another approach road can reduce the match day traffic."
