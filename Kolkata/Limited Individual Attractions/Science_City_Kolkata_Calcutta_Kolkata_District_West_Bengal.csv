Science_City,Rajjak hossain,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Solo,science City Kolkata,"Science City Kolkata is the largest science centre in Asia.It is managed by National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), Ministry of Culture, Government of India. It is located at the crossing of Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and J. B. S. Haldane Avenue (Parama Island) in East Topsia. Saroj Ghose, the first director general of NCSM, is credited with having conceptualised this centre in 1997.[5] This centre was inaugurated by two parts: the ‘Convention Centre Complex’ was unveiled on 21 December 1996 by Paul Jozef Crutzen in presence of the then chief minister Jyoti Basu and the whole centre was opened by the then prime minister Inder Kumar Gujral on 1 July 1997."

Science_City,Anil Das,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Science City - discover amazing facts of Science,A great time to spend with friends and family. Science City is the best place to discover amazing facts of Science. It is a place to know some Mistry of Science. I must recommend this place to those who are curious. And one more thing this is a fabulous place to bring your kids and spend a quality time with your family and friends and for having fun with them. No need to buy all tickets at the entrance as there are counters for all exhibitions inside too. There's a musical fountain and a lot of food and drink options. Car parking is available for 60 rupees.
Science_City,akghosal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Good selection of artefacts & attractions but too much emphasis on Hindi in the audio-based information,"Has a relatively good selection of Science-related artefacts and information and there are some good views across Kolkata from the ropeway. My only problems with Science City (which is why I haven't given it four or five stars) is that some parts could be better maintained and cleaned (especially the eating areas), and that in some attractions, there is too much emphasis in giving the audio-based information in Hindi (without any subtitles or audio in either English or Bengali) which means that it is not particularly ideal or inclusive for foreign tourists (I am one of them, as while I can understand bits of Hindi, I can't speak the language) who are visiting the area or even some locals who want to hear the information in Bengali. Apart from these issues, it was a relatively good experience overall."
Science_City,Tausif,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Good place to visit,"Good place to visit for kids, but too much waiting for most shows. More than half the time we were standing in queues. They must allow online booking of tickets for individual events."

Science_City,Janet B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Visiting Science City,"This is a highly modernistic complex with lots to see and do. The entrance gate brings you into a well-tended garden with pools and animated sculptures driven by water. A cable-car ride takes visitors over the whole complex. One of the buildings, dealing with life sciences, was not open, but in the time we had we got to see plenty. We visited the space and technology building and found the displays extremely informative and well put together. The demonstrations of physics and mechanics using hands-on installations were a lot of fun, and informative too. One great surprise was an up-to-the-day exhibition of the Corona virus, which in mid-February was only just revealing its potential as a pandemic. There were two staff posted at the display to answer questions. This exhibit alone indicated to us the devotion and interest of the museum staff. The upper part of the building was laid out in a descending spiral where the exhibits were based on powers of 10 - magnifying upwards to the entire universe and downwards to the sub-atomic world. We can highly recommend Science City and hope that the building we couldn't visit will soon be open."

There is a special section dedicated to the aquatic world wherein you can learn every minute detail about  various water animals. Some of the most exotic fishes can be seen in these aquariums.  The ground floor of the science city comprises of some optical illusions which are very interesting to look at. It is always so much fun to watch yourself taking a variety of shapes in front of the optical mirrors. It is a favourite amongst kids & adults as well.. During our visit we enjoyed the experiments about the energy ball, ocean waves, quick sand & time machines, which are favourite amongst all the visitors. It also gave us an opportunity to travel to outer space from where we could travel back in time and also entered the age of dinosaurs by being a part of the artificial Jurassic Park. We tried the ropeway as well to get a bird's eye view of the city.Thus science city offered us phenomenal experience & made our holiday worth it."

Recently visited but noticed that its degradation from expected standard. The 3D shows are not up to the mark. The lack of new innovation and thinking.

It is inspiring to know how the National Parks in United States came up on one end, and it intrigues me why we cannot implement the same here.

Science_City,Sadhana yadav,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Rude and rough behavior of a staff who takes the tickets allows entry,Well. Yesterday I took a trip to science city very excited with my husband and five year old son.  There was a long queue and as it was our first visit so there was a bit confusion about the 3d shows. Their cost and timings. We waited patiently and even the man who was giving out tickets was very patient and gave full information to us about show timings. As we advanced with tickets to the gate of entry the middle aged man who was dark complexioned and half bald without giving me any instructions started to scream so badly about the lever that is supposed to be pushed before entering the gates. Actually my five year old son had bent and entered the premises and I was trying to take hold of him. He screamed so loudly and continued it for two three minutes. I was so horrified that I couldn't say anything. But is this the way a staff a gatekeeper who just allows entry talk with a lady. I was very embarrassed and depressed my husband was furious about to argue but it was in vain. We saw the three d rides and behavior of all staff member s was very very cordial. But I must say this man at the entry gate should be taught a lesson of politeness as we r also paying for his service. How can the behavior of the staff inside the premises especially the life of treesWas so cordial and decent whereas at the entry gate such kind of rude frustrated person s there whose only job s too allow entry at the gate after checking tickets. Please let me know how can I file a written complaint against this man because I don't want other ladies to face the same embarrassment. Sadhana yadav

Science_City,Sumit Kasera,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,A good place that could have been much better,"Located bang opposite the ITC sonar and very close to the Mirania Lake is the Science City – a hub to satiate the curiosity of the inquisitive mind. Its website states the goal of the place to be presenting science and technology in a stimulating and engaging environment that is truly educational and enjoyable for the people of all ages. An entry ticket of Rs 50 plus an additional ticket for ropeway of Rs 48/- (really 48?) let us in. Essentially, the Science City consists of two parts, the Science Centre and the Convention Centre. -	The Science Centre complex comprises Space Odyssey, Dynamotion, Science Exploration Hall, Maritime Centre, Earth Exploration Hall and a sprawling Science Park. I-	The Convention Centre complex comprises the Main Auditorium of 2232 seating capacity, one Mini Auditorium of 392 seating capacity and a Seminar hall complex consisting of 11 halls ranging from 15 to 100 seating capacity, an indoor (270sq.m.) and an open air exhibition ground (20000 sq. m). The auditoria’s and the seminar halls are fully air-conditioned. We are told that the Convention Centre of Science City is a major destination in the city of Kolkata for conventions, conferences, AGMs, trade exhibitions and cultural programmes. Not being far from airport and being very close to some top luxury hotels My visit spanning few hours was limited to only few parts of the Science Centre. May be much more time was needed to see the city in its entirety. So coming back to the ropeway, it was a short journey within the large expansive science city. The ropeway seemed old and in dire need for a refresh. It was crowded, and one felt that visitor delight was not a priority for the administrators. The few minute ride left us close to the Dynamotion hall.  One of the good parts of the visit was the “Science on a sphere” a 30 min show that was held in a fairly largish circular auditorium. It tried to explain how the earth looked from far above. Apart from this, there were plethora of interactive exhibits on physical science. I found that the place had somehow not kept pace with the improvements in modern science. Outside the hall, there were some sub-standard eateries. There was lot of litter left by numerous visitors to the place. The large place offered lot of opportunity to walk around – in the nice January winter of Kolkata. Overall, while the intention was good, I felt the place could become a bigger tourist attraction through innovation, modern technology and better upkeep."
Science_City,Rinku B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Great with kids up to 13,"This is a fun thing to do with younger children. The grounds are clean and grean, especially during cooler weather. There are plenty of interactive exhibits and you can usually catch a themed movie. The complexity of the exhibits however are best suited for younger children. Although the shows would engage older people as well. The grounds are good to walk around. I think it is a good way to spend half a day doing something educational in the city."

Science_City,GksRaja,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Lethargic staff,"The science city is planned and made well. The time we entered inside is around 6:30 pm and THE CLOSING TIME SHOWN AS 8 pm. By the time we are entering itself some sections are being closed. We entered a theatre (3D) for the short film THE LIFE OF TREES.  its made for children and not that exciting and educative. After the show at 7:15 pm, when we were out the staff and security started swiching off the other sections and exhibits. When we asked them they recklessly told "" this is like this only and we close one by one sections from 7:30 pm itself. But when I insisted and increased my voice about the closing time mentioned at ticket counter as 8 pm they are simply laughing and making fun of us in the local launguage. Very very disgusting. Concerned authorities should act on this seriously. Its an excellent and rare facility for educating children and people. But unfortunately it is under SARKAR maintenance."

Science_City,Kathy T,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Bad choice ,Such a poorly organised and maintained place. No maps or signage explaining the way around. It's pretty much guesswork. You enter after a serpentine queue only to come in and find out there are more queues for the 3D shows. A place with potential but terribly managed.Only thing we enjoyed was the ropeway (cable car ride). Again there was no indication of wait time etc.Traveller tip - don't take the ropeway ride into the facility. You're better off taking the one out as this is practically empty. 
Science_City,adityainc,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Good but needs to be managed well,It offers great things which every school going kid would love. Though it needs major repair and maintenance work.

Science_City,Lia B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Interesting place with low maintenance ,"We could see how much Indians appreciate this place, because of the gardens, shows and scientific experiences. Comparing to where I come from it was really disappointing. Most of the attractions were not working properly, people used and treated everything really badly. The toilets are disgusting. Didn’t have a chance to see the shows, maybe If I would, I would like a little bit more."

Science_City,Pritam Sadhukhan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,Experience excitement,This is a place where each age group will find something excited according to their own choice. We missed the opportunity to see the space theater as it was renovating else there are lot many new attractions. Maintenance is an issue as many scientific devices are not working else there are many things to learn. We regretted that we started late as we have to rush the buildings in the late hours. Overall anyone will feel delighted after visiting the place.
Science_City,RBan26,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,A learning corner for young children,The time machines are the best of all the scientific rides and shows here. Also 3D shows run in the auditorium. A must go place for young children. Remains very crowded during winter.
Science_City,05lovelife,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Good place for all,The Science of Sphere and the Dark Ride shows are really fantastic and if a kid is 6 and above should love them.For other things in the centre kids should be bigger to understand is my feelings

It has all kind of fun and learning thing that creates an interest in the subject of science.It has also got a sky cab/ cable car that takes you to visit the entire area from a height.

What matters is it’s a name of a city whose existence can be traced back to over two millennia as indicated by the archeological discovery in Chandraketugarh—a place several kilometers away. Since then, this city of joy, love, passion, desperation, protest, and revolution is breathing. Maybe battered and bruised by many historical and social upheavals, but the city and its people are relentlessly in pursuit of living—realizing their dream of what they think is the best of life.History of modern Calcutta started with the advent of British Raj in the form of East India Company appearing in these parts of India and established Fort William. It had been an astonishing journey from a fishing village to a great city of pomp and grandeur. That was one of the earliest signs of colonial British intentions. They came and indeed contributed to the skyline of the city—it became known as City of Palaces. When you travel today, in the midst of modern and recent buildings, you can still find vestiges of colonial India in lanes and bylanes of erstwhile Park Street and Theatre Road and many other places. Travel on foot and there is no dearth of interesting elements you will encounter with. Life is flowing in this city in its own pace. Some says it’s dying; some says it has already culminated to a state of no-return—even then no one ever succeeds to avoid its charm, the vibrancy, and exceptional variety of Calcutta.While traveling, your experience will range from a cultural sojourn to a culinary experience. Walking down the memory lane itself is a worthy tour here. History has evolved in many dimensions; every building and road and roadside shop has a unique story to tell. Love it or hate it—the city will always amaze you."

Kids included..We all enjoyed our self very much..Kids love the dark ride..That has information regarding dinosaur..Kids love their show on human evolution.. every thing about this science city is amazing..We went inside via cable car..We loved the paronomic view it offered us..
Science_City,tumbleweedchris,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Kitsch Abound,"Science City has probably seen better days. There are enormous, cavernous buildings in the complex that are closed (such as the dino building). Because of the giant scope of the attraction, that still leaves plenty buildings and attractions open to poke around at. Of the existing attractions, they are not necessarily in the best shape, but for people that are fans of roadside attractions, it has a high level of kitsch appeal. There are also a few upcharge attractions. I recommend checking out the evolution dark ride. The rest of the upcharge attractions can be skipped. If you like polished, award winning museums, skip Science City. If you like cheesy, kitsch, give it a try."
Science_City,rahulsheve,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Interesting place,"It's one of a kind and very good place especially for students. Still there is more scope of development and installation of tech savvy games, rides & programs. Only problem with the place is availability of quality food. "
Science_City,Chenoa C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Science City,We had a great morning at Science City in Kolkata. I recommend to go early morning from 10am and you’ll get through everything by after lunch . You pay a minimal fee for entry and cable car . Then additional for live shows which are timed .
Science_City,aastha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Interesting place,"This place will be fun for both kids and adults. It has very interesting shows, stuffs and also some rides. The ticket fares are not much. It is also very educative for kids."
Science_City,SRIKAKOLAPU,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,good one,One of the best science museums in India and should be visited with all the scientific things that are over there.Going on weekdays helps with lesser crowd
Science_City,Shoeb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,Knowledgeable expereince,It is a must visit if you are travelling with a kid. Other wise also it is good. There are a lot of activities one can undertake out there. It imparts lots of basic science experiences in a nice manner. It is very popular with the locals as well. Brace yourself for long serpentine queues inside. There are certain shows also they do in auditoriums for which you need to book separate tickets. And yet it requires atleast 6-8  hours to see it and still there is lot which remains
Science_City,Shafqat A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,Amazing,"It is a very amazing place to visit. You can unlock the secrets of science, biology and planet Earth. You enjoy the miracles of glass."
Science_City,namesak,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Business,science lovers,"this is a place for the people who like science based things, it offers variety of scientific tools and instruments. "
Science_City,Indira2011,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Nice place of entertainment,This place has so much to see and do. I love the 4D ride here which usually always has a long waiting queue but is worth it. There are other attractions too. Nominal ticket cost. 
Science_City,arnabc_iitm,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,A trip to science city,"Before we enter we had lots of expectation from this place and most of the expectations are not fulfilled. A day trip to spend the time with your family is nice idea but to enrich yourself and your kid this is not the right place. Most of the equipment are not functioning, few are very old not poorly maintained. I think a total revamp of the place is required."
Science_City,Ehtesham,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,For Kids very helpful FUN+EDU,we went there on April. the Weather is not for us. but we love the place. we sent whole day there. my son love the place more than anything at Kolkata. its a Big Place.
Science_City,MdZaff,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Fun place to spend a day,"Its a great place to learn and enjoy with friends and family. You can spend the whole day here. It can be tiring. There are a lot of things to do. Rides, Shows and a variety of scientific principles on display. A must visit if you are in Kolkata."
Science_City,Mcroops,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,The Old School Science City,After almost 23years I visited Science city and sorry to say it was a major turn down. All the scientific installations are age old and outdated the place is not well maintained and most of the best screenings are non operational due to renovations. The panorama show was abruptly ended due to lazy government employees and overall it’s not an inspiring place atol for kids or adults. Science has gone way ahead then what’s been displayed 😂
Science_City,Andrew W,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Overpopulated attraction of yesteryear,"Science City was a major disappointment. Perhaps two decades ago when its gates first opened this was an attraction that was entertaining as it was informative. But the gloss has dulled, the science stations in disrepair and the experience tarnished with the pressing of thrill seekers crammed into sectioned off spaces. If you're hoping for disappointment walk the gates of Science City. "
Science_City,syed21,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Must visit,"Visited science city with young children,science city is situated near bypass ,I visited nearly a gap of 10years,good thing is that still operating this park very well,must visit place for science lover's and Young kid's."
Science_City,argha2715,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,Science City,As its name science city you can understand what is that place.a place full of interesting things .if you are a science lover then this place is for you.
Science_City,Belasheshe,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Not well maintained.,"For kids it is a nice place to visit. Definitely needs to be upgraded and maintained to attract visitors of all ages. If properly developed, it can be a real tourist attraction in Kolkata."
