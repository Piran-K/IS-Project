Shaheed_Minar,Subhojit P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017,Excellent view during evening,"It's a historical monument and was erected in 1828 in memory of Major-general Sir David Ochterlony, commander of the British East India Company. It can be seen from quite a distance due to its height and look beautiful in evening due to changing colours."
Shaheed_Minar,DrSudhin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016,Tall Tower,This is originally made by the British rulers to commemorate one of their hero Octerlony.  But at a later stage in independent India the state government renamed it in the name of mertyers.

Shaheed_Minar,Srimantakrbazar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,The Qutab Minar of Kolkata!,The oldest minar of of West Bengal. Also known as Ochterlony Monument. It resides beside the Maidan. It's a worth visiting place as it is on the memory of martyrs. The aesthetic work of the monument captivates you.
Shaheed_Minar,Sheel,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017,Best visited early in the morning,"In ANY other city on earth, something like the Ochterlony Monument would be treated as a national treasure. In Calcutta, it's treated as an open air urinal.The Ochterlony Monument (as the Shahid Minar was originally known) stands tall amid the environmental wasteland that is the Esplanade Bus Stand. Bus drivers and passengers litter and urinate freely without fear of censure. You have to be really careful where you walk and it is advisable to visit as early in the morning as possible, unless you REALLY enjoy inhaling toxic bus exhaust fumes. The delightful addition of drunks and drug addicts lolling around at the base of the monument after dark mean you are either very brave or stupid, or both, to try visiting this at night, which is a pity really because it looks even better when its lit up.Instead of attempting to recreate ersatz Big Bens and faux Calcutta/London eyes, the city would do better to protect and project its rich cultural heritage. But that's clearly beyond the very limited imagination of the current dispensation."
Shaheed_Minar,mukherjee_av,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Where past meets the present,"Also known as the Ochterlony Monument, also the Qutab Minar of Kolkata. Its a reminder of the bygone colonial Kolkata. Surrounded by the pristine green of the Maidan, its great for a family outing and also a must for a tourist soaking up Kolkata. Must visit!"
Shaheed_Minar,niya27,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,Near Esplanade Metro Station,"This attraction can be visited by Kolkata metro. Though the minar was nice, the park surrounding the minar was dirty. A major bus depot is also nearby. I found locals come here to chat, relax,  drink tea etc."
