South_City_Mall,Satyajit Dasgupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo,Rooftop Food Court,"The post-fire newly constructed food court on the erstwhile rooftop is a visual delight with its wide expanse, generous seating and reasonably varied food/snacks/drinks on offer.The steep prices are perhaps an indication of the high rentals the food outlets have to pay the mall. The mall owners are trying to cover up the losses incurred due to the fire caused closure. The customers are paying the price.It is worth a visit just to enjoy the ambience of the food court and the air-conditioning if you have to visit the mall for some shopping.If you wish to eat, you can give the mall a miss. Better eateries have opened up within 3 square miles of the mall and they offer much better value for money."

South_City_Mall,Kriti garg,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Solo,Did not enjoy,"The stock seemed old, the mall seemed empty, the renovation was still going on. The good part were the cheap movie tickets for the INOX here, however the extremely high price of the snack bar just dampened the same. Not a really good mall to visit if you ask me..

South_City_Mall,stantp1916,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Welcome to the renovated south city,"We finally had a chance to visit the new and revamped south city mall. Well from the outside there isn’t much difference from the older attire except the entrance which seems different with a larger glass enclosure. Then comes the inside. At a first glance there is no change, then you start paying attention to the details and you will notice significant changes in the shop orientations, floor designing, interior decor etc which now looks much more upmarket than the previous attire. Also passages have been narrowed and space utilisation has been optimised which is good I think. The food court and movie hall are yet to open as on date. There has been substantial addition to overall lighting and therefore the mall looks even brighter. Overall you’ll definitely love this new look of the south city mall.P.S. Prices of most merchandise remain the same as before so no fear of price rise. And yes I did spot some very high end brands to find their place in this revamped mall."

South_City_Mall,Ankur G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,Better than ever- a must visit for any shopper,"Finally, the renovation of East India's largest mall is almost over and its already operating in full-swing with newer shops to unveil this year.South City Mall opened up exactly 10 years back and created a huge uproar among all Kolkatans irrespective of the distance of this place from their houses as it brought in a feeling of festival among everyone. No one had experienced a more beautiful and bigger mall in this city before and almost everything from good food to awesome clothes to books is available here. It's a little expensive if you want to shop the way you want but its worth it as the options available for any product are multiple and there is no compromise with quality. My favourite places on this mall are Pantaloons, StarMark and the food court. You have the Spencers Hyper Store as well so you have the chance to buy alcohol as well without standing in a queue on the road. A great place to hand out with friends any-day but back in 2008 when I was in college it hurt me personally for not having enough money to buy stuff-no regrets now ;) Finally you can also go for a movie date here[FAME] post which you can have lunch in the restaurants on the food court"

South_City_Mall,Traveler-O-World,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,The Top Mall of Kolkata!,"Over the years have been patronising the South City Mall during visits to Kolkata. This place is our location of choice for entertainment (movies in the on-site multiplex), eating (food court and several restaurants) and shopping. In the last review done about two years back, had given a note of caution: the management needs to ""pull-up"" the maintenance of the toilets - several facilities have an ""out-of-order"" board/notice. And, now in 2017, from 1st February, a major overhaul is going to be undertaken for a period of about four months.Look forward to the renovated and rejuvenated ""New"" South City Mall."

There is also a large cinema which has 3D screens available and lots of snack bars. Overall, it is a very good place to go on a rainy day and is easy to get to via buses or taxis but not a cultural attraction."

South_City_Mall,PPK M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,Best Mall in Kolkata,A great Mall with different outlets catering to all the needs of an individual / family along with an opportunity for a perfect retail therapy. You can also pop into to the four screen multiplex or go for the gastronomic delight at the Food Court or at the superb standalone restaurant. A must visit for all. 
South_City_Mall,bharatvaid6900,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Best of Kolkata,"Personally my favorite mall at Kolkata, it is designed in such a way that you get to shop all varieties of an item on one single floor. For example, if you wanna buy shoes - you'll find all brands on one floor. I think that's a great idea as it allows you to quickly weigh in all the available options and helps make a better choice. The food court here is good but, i would really recommend all the single restaurant outlets as they offer some unique cuisine and a great dining experience.Probably the best multiplex in kolkata is also at this mall - the Insignia theatre.On the whole there's a lot to do here and it would definitely be a good day spend."
South_City_Mall,vijayengineer2003,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Variety,Good amount of varieties available in all aspects. Only few options were available for electronics items.
South_City_Mall,SumanKar462015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,Excellent place to spend time ,The place is an excellent place to spend time with anyone but the best possible time would be morning or early afternoon taking into consideration the huge rush in the evenings. There are no places to sit as all seats are taken by afternoon. The shops are good but the best is the star mark bookstall. Ample quantity of books are there.  
South_City_Mall,Neena G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Shopping & movie,South City mall is the perfect place to shop for middle & upper middle income people . U can get everything here without the pushing & nudging of people like in Gariahat .Watching movie is a plus point along with small eats . The minus point bring popcorn is too costly for all to buy .

South_City_Mall,Shireen S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016,BEWARE-DANGER AHEAD,"Who knew that one of the swankiest shopping malls in Kolkata has areas so poorly designed that they are virtual injury zones.Yes indeed, I recently fractured my foot when I tripped and fell in the hallway outside the 3rd floor toilet. I tripped because the floor was so polished and gleaming that I failed to spot a dip/step in the hallway. Since my accident quite a few others have told me that they stumbled in the same spot as they could not see the step up or down on the floor. Fortunately though, they did not suffer my fate. Anyway if this were the US then I would certainly file a lawsuit against the mall for faulty construction but seeing that this is the 3rd world I now have to bear my cross with forbearance.If however, you have had a similar experience then please feel free to share it with others and/or alert the authorities to the dangers of this otherwise upscale mall."
