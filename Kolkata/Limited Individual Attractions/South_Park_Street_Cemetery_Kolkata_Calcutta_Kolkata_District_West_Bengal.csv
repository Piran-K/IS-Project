South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Dr. Parikshet Sirohi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Reminder of the Raj!,"It was one of the earliest non-church cemeteries in the world, and probably the largest Christian cemetery outside Europe and America in the 19th century. Opened in 1767 on what was previously a marshy area, the cemetery was in use until about 1830 and is now a heritage site, protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The cemetery was opened to relieve the pressure on the old burial ground in the heart of the city. The road leading to the cemetery came to be known as the Burial Ground Road, but was subsequently renamed as 'Park Street' after the park around Vansittart's garden house. By the year 1785, the burial ground had been extended on the northern side of Park Street, and by 1840, a vast new cemetery was opened to the east of the Lower Circular Road. The Europeans started to disuse it in the year 1790. It has been confirmed by a marble plaque at the gate which reads ""South Park Street, Opened:1767, Closed:1790""."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Elizabeth V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,A bit of colonial history,Tucked away in the heart of Kolkata in the midst of a residential area is this little know cemetry with the beautiful monuments dedicated to those long gone who contributed to what Kolkata is today.  It is well maintained and worth a visit both for those who love history and those who love to see tombs and bring alive to their minds the loving hearts that raised these monuments. 
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Sunnywin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,"Serene, social history","A lovely place for a stroll, the surroundings are beautiful and peaceful, so green and well maintained. Plus it is interesting to read the inscritions on the gravestones too. "
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,CharlesMcCall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,fascinating step back into time,"Well worth visting - many beautiful tombs from the 18th and 19th centuries, that are a mix of well-preserved and the plants recovering their space.. interesting to see the writings on the tombs and see how many lives were cut short at a relatively young age"
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Linda Davidovic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Going back in time,"South Park Street Cemetery is a must-visit in Kolkata. The tall graves, shady trees and the relative quietness form the bustles of the city makes it a great place to visit for a leisurely stroll. Also great for photography. Ticket price is 20 rupees, but if you have a camera then they will charge you 50 rupees at the gate."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,beadfreak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,My favourite cemetery.,"This was my third visit here. The graves are so interesting so make time to read a lot of head stones. They have their own nursery inside now and are producing heaps of colourful plants. They have a lot more gardeners now and the place is looking good. If you go after 3.30pm it turns into ""lover's lane"" young Indian couples everywhere."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Chris K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Fascinating,This is worth visiting. The guidebook is brilliantly written and you can feel history as you wander around
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Rasputin21,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Visit if you are interested in the history of British India,Left to rack and ruin after Partition.  The cemetery is only now being partially restored.  Many of the graves have lost their identification.  Lovers use the graves for their trysts.  The Trust produces a booklet Rs100 but it is difficult to find the graves named in the booklet which mainly covers the work done.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,A Kundu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,A place where you can introspect,"I went with a friend who has a penchant for history. It was a eerie feeling to be among the dead buried for centuries. Among many, the tomb of Henry Luis Vivian D'Rozio is best preserved. It saddened me a lot to find many people had died at a tender age (of less than 30 / 40) mostly due to lack of medication."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Shaffiabel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Oasis In Kolkata,You can spend a few hours here wandering this Beautiful & Peaceful place. Lots of history & stories to see. Very interesting.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,KennethEast,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Very atmospheric!,Reminded us of the Recolleta in Buenos Aires. A densely monumented remnant of the British Raj in Kolkata.  Our guide pointed out a few notable monuments.  But you visit more to get a general feel for the place rather than to track down famous tombstones.  Not a long stop.  A twenty-minute wander is probably more than enough for most people.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Mitesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Business,Wonderful,It is one of the largest burial grounds and a heritage site in Kolkata and maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Smudgejack,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,History lovingly preserved,"A place to wander amongst tombs and headstones large and small, to sit and think about those who have gone before..Beautiful gardens which you share with crows and squirrels. An oasis from the hubbub which is Kolkata.  Not to be missed if you love history."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,746ballfamily746,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,History,Lots of interesting tombs here to view the past of Kolkata. Some are quite big. This is a also a peaceful stroll from the hectic streets outside. 
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Jeanine,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,A break from the hussle and bussle,Beautiful and serene. The restoration work ruins the atmosphere a little and the path is very slippery. But a must see.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,RandDtravellers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,An oasis in the city,An oasis of calm and green on Park Street.  The memorials are interesting as much for the scale of self importance felt by colonial civil servants and military.  Worth visiting.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Shreya Sharma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Outstanding,The cemetery is outstanding to see from the roadside itself. It is very well maintained by the municipal corp.

South_Park_Street_Cemetery,FJHH24,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A SOMBRE REMINDER OF HOW SHORT LIFE WAS CENTURIES AGO,This was a peaceful place and interesting from a social history point of view.  Sad to see how many infants died from various causes but the memorials were beautiful and a constant reminder.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Mavis57,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Ancient burial ground concealing hidden secrets,"It is sombre and a bit creepy to wander amongst so many decaying old tombs, but the greenery is a relief in the dirt and dust of Park Street. The really compelling thing for me was the incredible youth of most of the deceased which brings home how treacherous the colonial service was to both military and civilians, in the absence of modern medical facilities."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Damien,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,A must for cemetery lovers ,Fantastic graves and monuments A must for cemetery lovers Small entrance fee. Very quite on non road side Well worth a look
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Kritee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Good historical place to visit in Kolkata,A good place to walk around and see the different architectures of the tombs. It is a very silent and peaceful place and I liked the overall ambience.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Shalini M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Gorosthane Sabdhan,Cemetery has always been a very spooky thing for me and i never had the courage to visit this place as a kid. Then one fine wintry morning after having chinese breakfast at Tiretti Bazar me and some friends of mine decided to explore the Southend Park Cemetery. The moment i stepped into the cemetery it took me to the colonial period where i could visualise the Britishers wearing black dress and standing infront of each of graveyard and mourning. It sounds spooky but it actually took me to that period when young children used to die of malaria and other tropical disease.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Jess W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A peaceful oasis away from the exciting chaos,"Lovely spot, good for 30-60 minutes walking and sitting in the shade, trying to imagine the lives and stories represented by the headstones and monuments."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Spicegal123,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,A sobering look at the Privilege of the British,"As a Brit this place is sobering and uncomfortable, which makes it important to visit. Our colonial history saw us take so much away from India to build the wealth of our own country and the grandeur of the graves of some of these colonisers in contrast to how ordinary people were treated is a stark reminder of how we must do better in future."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Kelly D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Hidden Gem,"Lush, green, and quiet. A hidden gem tucked in off the craziness of Park Street. Lovely place for a wander or photos. "

It is one of the first non-church cemeteries in the world. It houses the tombs of distinguished expatriates who were once an integral part of Kolkata’s history. It is located at park street near mullick bazar bus stop & the best part for the visitors are that no entry fee is required. 
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,jim c,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Business,An oasis of calm on bustling Park st,"A wonderful peaceful spot among the colour and chaos of central Kolatta. Interesting too if the English Raj era history interests you with many graves of early English arrivals, most sadly young"
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Cavan R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Quiet and peaceful,"This is a haven of peace in this crazy, noisy city.  There was virtually nobody else there when we visited, so stro;;ing the pathways was easy.  Most of the ""graves"" are in fact huge monuments and mausoleums to British dignitaries in the early 19th century. These monuments are so huge, it is no wonder that they ran out of room in just 20 years.  Now it is just a memorial and honestly of marginal interest."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Avishek Bose,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Best Place to calm your mind,"Kolkata the city of joy, the city runs around from day to night but if you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the busy city life. Just stop-by at South Park Street Cemetery.  This Place is perfect ""if you need a quite place to stop by and think about your something""."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Igirl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,A Glimpse into the Past,"I always like to visit this Cemetery when I am in Calcutta and somehow seem to come across tombs that I have missed on previous occasions.  Since my first visit about twenty years ago, the Christian Burial Board of Calcutta have done a great job restoring the tombs over a period of time.  The pathways and other areas have been tidied up and the many trees and shrubs have come on a treat.A lovely resting place for some of the earliest British inhabitants of Calcutta;  the once great and good and those of lesser importance,  but all honoured and remembered in their own way.A must visit for anyone interested in the history of Calcutta."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,aastha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,A calm place,If you need a few moments of break from the busy city then this is an apt place within it. It is a few minutes walk from Park Street Metro Station. The ticket price is also very nominal. You are allowed to take pictures with your phones without any extra charge. 
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Benjamuna,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Peaceful ...,"Calcutta is a challenge, a wonderful challenge. It's noisy, dirty, colourful, crowded ... In between one needs a little peace and quiet. I found this cemetery just by chance, and spent quite some time. It's a beautiful place, all the tombstones are impressive and the cemetery is well maintained - which is not always the case in India. Historically, it's an interesting place and one should allow enough time to study the tombstones carefully."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,sulekha s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Peaceful,"This place is Very interesting and historical. But I could not walk much , so, i could not see the whole place."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Mikan999,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,An insight to the British community who lived and worked in Kolkata,This is a fascinating record of the foreign community in Kolkata. The graves are reasonably well kept so inscriptions are readable. It is also a tranquil retreat from the hustle and bustle of Kolkata's busy streets.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Super duper 123,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Heritage Cementry,"Whenever we have friends from India and abroad and they want to explore Kolkata. One of the first thing that comes to mind , is the Park street Cementry.It was opened in 1767 . All the tombs have a Gothic and Indo Saracenic style. It has a aura of grandure and yet  isolation. If you read the tomb stones,it touches your heart to find that most of them died at a very young age ..less than 25 to 30 years . Although you may find few around 50 yrs.If you want to experience the history of Bengal,  it is a ""must visit"" place."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Trish W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Amazing place,"This cemetery is very interesting.  Cemeteries are not usually places added to holiday itinerary's but this should be the exception.  My only negative remark is the amount of rubbish, but please do not let this put you off visiting it's a gentle reminder of Kolkata's history and it's people. "
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,K L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,The woman who ate too many pineapples,"Ask the friendly gatekeeper to tell you where to find her tomb. The cemetery has the biggest tombs I’ve seen, but then again I haven’t seen the pyramids."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Penwyllt,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Surprisingly interesting,There are some very large graves and mausoleums here some surprises are the son of Charles Dickens and other Colonial dignitaries all seemed to be trying to out do the other in homage after death. 
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Meredith M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Quiet Amid Chaos,"The South Park Street Cemetery is a wonderful haven of quiet in a chaotic part of Kolkata.

South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Annabelle S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Poignant and peaceful,"Park Street cemetery was active in the late 18th century and contains tombsof British residents in Calcutta, many of whom died very young.

South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Poulomi S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Very green,"A very green peaceful place, its full of trees and creepers and graves. Difficult that there is a street next with full traffic and this place is so silent"
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,zigsterGoldCoast,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,A snapshot of life,This is a well restored cemetery that contains the tombs of mainly Europeans who died in Calcutta in the late 18th and 19th centuries. It is useful to purchase the well researched booklet at the cemetery (100 rupees) which provides some useful history of some of the people who were buried there. This is an extremely interesting place for people who enjoy history.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,John W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Business,Faded glory and tragic deaths,A lovely cemetery if you enjoy this sort of thing. Opens at 9 am and totally empty on the times I visited.

So many people died in infancy or at a very young age in Kolkata during that period.  Itis also an oasis of calm in the delightful madness which is Kolkata"
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Alice C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,How sad that so many died so young,This fascinating place is an oasis for the weary walker.   So well cared for and very atmospheric.   Lots of young couples enjoying the place too!   The welcome at the gate was lovely.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,garhuff,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,A gem if a bit rundown,"This cemetery serves as a reminder of the British elite who came to India to earn their fame and fortune.  Most died young either in battle or from disease.  While less than well maintained, it does provide a bit of a snapshot into the 1750's era in Kolkata, when it was the second largest city in the Empire after London."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Soumyajit Saha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Park Street Cemetery,Park Cemetery is located near the mallick bazaar crossing. It is one of the oldest cemeteries in Kolkata. Here many people from British Era have been cremeted. Now there is a charge to enter the cemetery. Many famous people graves can be found here.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Padmini15,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Out of sheer curiosity!!,I had heard so much about this place and hence decided to visit it on a winter afternoon in December. The cemetery became functional in 1767 and closed down in 1790. Well maintained they charge an entry fee and walking around we had a lot to explore. Henry Louis Vivian Derozio has been buried here. Longevity was a major issue with all those who had been laid to rest here as most of them did not cross forty and needless to say they were mainly Europeans. Probably they succumbed to the heat of the Indian subcontinent. This peaceful environment gives you time to ponder over so many things. One particular tomb was a comfortable bed for an old woman. It was a wonderful experience being here.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,AnanyaMitra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Travel down history,"The very first thing that catches your eyes the moment you step in , is the lush green surroundings. In the heart of the bustling Kolkata traffic, office goers hurriedly crossing over, there lies a place completely enveloped in serenity. The South Park Street cemetery situated few yards from the junction of Park Street & Mallick bazar, along the stretch of AJC Bose Road is a must visit if you want a brief  respite from your busy schedule. A perfect blend of green nature, soundless moments amidst tombs mostly belonging to the period of 1700 ~ 1800 AD. Yiu will hold on to memories of family members lying side by side , resting in eternal peace."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,ritwik b,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,"Quiet,peaceful and historic.",Worth the 20 rupees(50 with camera) entry fee. Try to visit on weekdays to avoid people as much as possible. The true essence of the place lies in it's seclusion.

South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Marianneford,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Interesting Place To Visit But Could Be Better,"The cemetery is very well maintained, whilst also retaining a slightly over-grown natural feel. I stayed for under an hour and found it an interesting place to walk but feel some more information about the history of the place and the people buried there would have enhanced the experience. There is an info board when you first arrive but it is dense paragraphs and very hard to read."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Darmstadt98,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Hidden Gem in middle of the city - Indiana Jones Feeling,We have visited this cemetery already twice and both times it was a fascinating visit. It is an old british cemetery that they somehow maintain but nature takes room so it looks like in an Indiana Jones Movie. Must Do in Kolkata.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Janecharlotte2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Cemetary,"If you love history and wandering around cemeteries don’t miss this.  Really fascinating.  I took a taxi to the Cemetary you can buy a guide book at the entrance, you need to check opening hours."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,KrispyPlymouth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,"Beautiful light, an oasis of calm","Spent about 39 minutes here, wish it had been longer. The light coming through the trees is beautiful. The groundsmen do a fantastic job of maintaining the graves but still allow a feeling of peace and undisturbed nature to prevail. I got some lovely photos here, not only of sunbeams and memorials but also cute little ground squirrels. As we left we were entertained by a local dog howling in unison with the call to prayers."

South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Geralyn H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Have to See it to Believe It!,"We had a private tour of the cemetery with Heritage Walks Calcutta. The tombs chosen and stories told were varied and fascinating. The place is decaying--being reclaimed by vegetation--but that is part of its ""charm"". The trees were lush and verdant, the moss prolific. My husband found it quite photogenic. I found it very atmospheric. Seeing the graves helped to imagine the Calcutta of the 19th century."

Had read Satyajit Ray's Feluda book umpteen times earlier - but thsi was really about being Shabdhan (careful) in the Gorosthan (cemetery). I was accompanying a friend of mine who was visiting Calcutta. He has a special place in his heart for a certain Henry Loius Vivian Derozio - poet, teacher, educator, radical & free thinker - all this before he so tragically died of cholera at the age of 22. We managed to locate his grave & just stood there in silence, thinking about the man who started the Young Bengal movement at the age of 17, brought about social reform and inspired so many young Bengali youth to open themselves to free thought. My country in the days of glory past.................alas, where is that glory now??????????/"

Many of the mausoleums have signs to say that they are endangered due to tree roots.  Lovely location, straight out of a film set like Jungle Book.  In the early morning with the soft light it was very ethereal."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Jo S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Refreshing in the city and full of peace,Not our usual thing to visit a cemetry on a trip to India but so pleased we did. How moving the peoples names so young. Seemed to be British who were part of East India Company and then succumbed no doubt to illness. Huge mausuleums . Beautifully kept with a real sense of history.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Doctorichard,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,An extraordinary experience both poignant and uplifting,"Thanks to the efforts of volunteers over the past 40 years this remarkable monument survives. Thousands of large mausoleums bear witness to the personal wealth of European (mostly British) travellers in the 18th and 19th century who made Calcutta a home far from home. Many died young, very many only in their 20s, but the tributes recorded are both touching and remarkable for the ambition they represent. We enjoyed a couple of hours picking through this little oasis of quiet and times past. Thoroughly recommended if you enjoy a bit of history and personal tales."

Apart from that Henry Louis Vivian Derozio's remains are here.  this place gives us the touch of history and nostalgia, the stories we have heard about the great humans, few of them lying here and nostalgia as we walk down the line so greenery and peaceful. Somehow we realize that end is there for every one of us but it is not that sad and bad. Another reason to be in love with this place is feluda(Bengali will understand)."

South_Park_Street_Cemetery,gargi28,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Needs Care,"Considering how old this place is & the graves date back to the 1800s, its not maintained well at all. I believe there are plans for its upkeep. That would be most welcoming. This could be turned into an amazing place."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,neha763,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Very oldest cemetery ,This south park street cemetery is very old and very interesting point to see.  Entry fees is just Rs 70. Very nice visit.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,NswAustraliaDidi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,A glimpse of history,"British burial ground, of obviously very wealthy people if the size and elaborate design of the mausoleums are an indication. Well looked after with many plants and trees."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Sham N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,A historical treasure,"This was one of the more interesting places I visited in Kolkata.  It is not a fixture on the tourist circuit. Located on the fashionable Park Street, the entrance to the Cemetery is so nondescript that it is easy to miss it.  Once inside, the visitor is transported to a different era. There are numerous mausoleums and they are like the pages of a history book. The stories of individuals making requisite reading and tell us of lives that form the fibres of the tapestry that is India. Many of the structures are in a state of repair and will probably be destroyed by the assails of the weather or the roots of the vegetation that abounds the cemetery. The spot is serene and it is not difficult to spend an hour or two in the quiet surroundings of the cemetery. The architecture of the mausoleums ranges from simple structures to elaborate European designs.  A few have incorporated elements of Indian designs (e.g. Kalinga). This place is definitely worth a visit."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Anthony D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Well worth a visit,This place is very interesting - the graves of the people of the East India Company and others mostly British and most of whom died young. Not just 'a grave' some of these are huge mausoleum type structures. The place is well maintained and good for a hour or so. Definitely worth a visit. Small R50 entry fee.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Eric G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,An Architectural and Historical Curiosity,"An old British cemetery with non-British characteristics and strangely with no crosses around. This is an interesting place to visit, that required half an hour. "
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Royson S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Great,South Park Street Cemetery in Kolkata is one of the earliest non-church cemeteries in the world. Good
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,rwaldstein,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Business,Fascinating piece of history,This is a very fascinating place to visit that will teach you a lot about the history of Calcutta. The grounds are hauntingly beautiful and the graves a peek into the lives of those who came to live here. It's well worth a short visit.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Sophie M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Hard to find and still in use!,"Don't go out of your way to visit the South Park Street Cemetery unless you are really into cemeteries! The entrance can be a little tough to find, it is across from the Institute of Neuroscience. I was also under the impression that the cemetery was no longer in use - not true, it is an active cemetery and we walked into a funeral. "
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,ShashankaSaadi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,It can be a starting point for tour in Kolkata,"This is an ancient cemetery dated back to 1700 centuries. It was closed around mid-1800 century. Nice and quite place to spend few hours, know the patterns of first inhabitants of Kolkata when it was growing a town. I liked it.  "
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Malcolm R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Yet another hidden gem,Although this is mentioned in most guide books - it can be very easily missed - but do not do so - it is comparable to the great cemeteries in Paris and in Glasgow - the vast tombs are overwhelming as are the poignant inscriptions to many very young people who never left India. It is now closed at night - apparently the tourists were disturbing the ghosts!!!
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Paul G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,Nice surprise ,A fellow I met on the street recommended visiting. I enjoyed reading the tombstones and taming photos. The cemetery has unique lighting  filtering
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,RPHWoking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Atmospheric and poignant ,What an interesting historical site to visit right next to the hustle and bustle where you can walk around in piece and quiet spending as much time as you like reading the memorial inscriptions and getting a feel for those that created Calcutta.We arrived early in the morning when the light was perfect for photos.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,SOUMENJANA,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Ghost,Naturally it is a cemetry. All time open. This is more then 150 years old. If you love lonely place you may go.
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Ankur Panchbudhe,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Serene experience walking through this place,"The location of this place is on the famous & busy Park Street. It's ticketed and quite well-maintained (from a tourist point of view).It was a serene and somewhat peaceful experience walking through this place. It's an old cemetery, so you expect to feel spooked or little fuzzy (it's supposed to be one of the most haunted places in India), but during the day, the illusion is broken by the many visitors, a few couples trying to steal some private time and the tall modern buildings on the horizon of this place. We kept reading many of the epitaphs, surprised to find that so many those buried here died very young. There were even whole families buried together, some who died within a span of few months or years. There must be so many stories here to tell.There are a few tombs of note - the one of Hindoo Stuart (adorned with many Hindu deities) and Sir William Jones (probably the biggest tomb), the great philologist who ""discovered"" the link between Indian and European languages."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,Dale Lee N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,A unique glimpse into the Raj,I first visited the Park Street Cemetery back in 1979 - then in a dilapidated state. My last visit was 20 years ago. In many ways the cemetery is like walking into a living history book - a unique glimpse into the East India Company & the Raj in India. I know now that I am ‘old’ - given the age-of-death written on many of the tombstones. An excellent visit in all regards. 
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,John L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Business,Another slice of history - set in stone,"Also known as The Great Cemetery of Asia - the resting place of two centuries' worth of worthies from the time of British India.  Partially restored, but many of the epitaphs are difficult to read, which is sad.  The stone masons seemed to have vied with each other to have produced ever bigger and better monuments, resulting only in uniformity. Savour for an hour or so, but beware the mosquitos (dengue?) at dusk. Also a meeting place for young lovers."
South_Park_Street_Cemetery,David A,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Interesting to some,This is a very ancient cemetery with little interest to most people. Not recommended when there is much more to explore and enjoy in this fascinating City
