St_John_s_Church,MW46Jackson,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Clean Toilets Open to the Public and Free,"The architecture is interesting.  The history is important,  and visiting the graves around the church is quite informative.  But the nice toilets was a wonderful gift to any stressed visitor to Kolkata."
St_John_s_Church,Sea Dweller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,It is the third oldest church in the city.,"St. John's Church, originally a cathedral, was among the first public buildings erected by the East India Company after Kolkata (Calcutta) became the capital of British India. It is located at the North-Western corner of Raj Bhavan, and served as the Anglican Cathedral of Calcutta till 1847, when the see was transferred to St. Paul's Cathedral. Construction of the building, modelled on St Martin-in-the-Fields of London, started in 1784, with Rs 30,000 raised through a public lottery, and was completed in 1787.      Currently, the church is undergoing restoration."
St_John_s_Church,EJR19,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Outstanding restoration,"We couldn’t believe the transformation of a rather rundown, albeit deeply historical, church into a really exquisitely maintained church. The restoration isn’t finished but already the white and gold shows what a fine building it was and is. And the gardens are beautifully kept with the best flower beds I have seen in India since the Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir (albeit on a rather smaller scale!) Do go and admire the way in which Kolkata is, yet again, starting to value and care for its history. Well done all those responsible at St Johns. "

A nice man decided to demonstrate the organ for us, but really we wish he hadn't as there were a number of clashing cyphers so the noise was awful to sensitive musical ears."

I enjoyed visiting this very historic church, being the first anglican cathedral in Kolkata, before St Pauls was built.  The last supper painting was interesting to see.  The gardens were also peaceful to wander and I made friends with some lovely people from Bangladesh ( 2 are in the photo).  We are so lucky to have these religious havens in our cities all over the world.  Where we can go to escape noise and reflect  on our existence.

But this one definitely has something to write home to. First and foremost: the Last Supper picture. Spoiler alert : John has a woman’s blonde hairstyle. Ask your guide why, when you’re there.

The memorials are interesting (even if that to The Black Hole is numbers embellished) as is Zoffany's painting of the 'Last Supper' which, for the time, must have been quite controversial with it's depiction of Father Parthenio, the Greek Orthodox priest of Calcutta, as Jesus, and W.C. Blaquerie, Calcutta's First Police Magistrate, leaning against him as a very catamite like St John.  "

One very sad memorial written by a husband who lost his young wife and infant daughter in the siege of Lucknow. Great painting of the Last Supper by Zoffany. The St John figure looks incredibly like a woman -apparently based on a local very feminine man. He based all the figures on local characters and the Judas was someone he disliked. He caused a lot of controversy - apparently got shipwrecked on his way back to England and participated in cannibalism to survive!There is a memorial to the Black hole of Calcutta in the churchyard

The church is not that spectacular (looks a bit like some of the typical churches of the era in the city of London) but the manicured grounds are nice.

Job Charnock, the founder of the city, lays in rest here. Its more than 3 centuries old. It has many other tombs also. The place was originally a mausoleum where many British lay in rest. The Church has a re-creation of the painting-Last Supper. It also has several tablets devoted to Cornwallis, Minto and Hastings. The tomb of Lady Canning is also here as is a memorial to Rohilla War.

St_John_s_Church,Tapan B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,Visiting for curiosity only,"more of a historical place in addition to an  church , we found ground more interesting , all about history, with burial places monuments of several British men women who were part of a team who happen to travel to India and gradually own it as part of their service to King and country. Amongst them a black hole monument much talked about but perhaps many such were  done by the other side elsewhere or at other times . tranquil church ground few flowers , and shrubs working men keen and happy to direct visitors, inside very quiet peaceful picture of last supper, and hardly any visitor,we noticed  a tall dark man was walking around perhaps a holy man of the church , looked like a figure from past .  but heard him playing magnificient tune in church organ which echoed  on all walls that filled our heart and soul. and one should read a bit history before coming here to understand more of the monuments."

St_John_s_Church,rahulb88,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Architectural masterpiece,"Most people in Kolkata are aware of St.Paul's cathedral, which is definitely a must see. But not just commoners, the traffic guards in Esplanade also have no clue about this monument.Get to Esplanade and take a stroll by the side of Governor's house to get to this monument. Really an architectural masterpiece, the tall strong columns reminiscent of the Colonial era of Calcutta (not Kolkata). Inside the church in weekday mornings, its invariably empty with a person or 2 sitting around. Have a seat in the wooden benches, get a feel of the place. There is a famous painting (the Last Supper) to the left side.Also, there is memorial of Black hole of Calcutta (Nawab Shiraj's history), tomb of Job charnock (founder of Calcutta), and of Lady Canning.Recommend to Visit."
