St_Paul_s_Cathedral,Dr. Parikshet Sirohi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Spectacular,"Located across the Birla Planetarium, the Cathedral is the seat of the Diocese of Calcutta. The cornerstone was laid in 1839, while the rest of the building was completed in 1847. Said to be the largest church in Kolkata and the first Anglican cathedral in Asia, it was also the first new-built cathedral in the overseas territory of the British Empire. The edifice stands on Cathedral Road on the ""island of attractions"" to provide for more space for the growing population of the European community in Calcutta in the 1800s. The architectural design is ""Indo-Gothic"", which is a Gothic architectural style designed to meet the climate of India. Following the 1897 earthquake and the subsequent massive earthquake of 1934, when Calcutta suffered substantial damage, the cathedral was reconstructed to a revised design. The cathedral complex has a library, situated over the western porch, and a display of plastic art forms and some other memorabilia."

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Magnificent!,"Saint Paul’s Cathedral is an Anglican Church & was the first of its kind within the erstwhile British territory, outside of Great Britain. The cathedral was damaged twice in earthquakes.Lighter bricks were used to build the Cathedral but these bricks also could withstand extreme temperatures & natural disasters. After paying an entry fee of INR 10, I walked down to the white facade which looked absolutely magnificent.The moment I laid my eyes on the tall structure, my jaw dropped at its surreal appearance. The interior has a high ceiling, carved pews, frescoes & reliefs. A number of the memorial reliefs were dedicated to soldiers & officers of the British Army who had fallen in the two World Wars & other battles.Seeing the chiselling of marble done so finely was a treat to my eyes. I wish I could have clicked a few pictures but photography was prohibited inside."

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,Rasputin21,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Diminishing congregation,Unfortunately it is obvious that the High Anglican congregation is diminishing and the church is falling into slow decay.  The exterior is marred by the remnants of the general dirt that pervades all Indian cities.  The interior is dark and is difficult to see some of the wonderful wood carvings at the entrance or to go closer to the altar (it is roped off).  The congregation meet in a smaller chapel.  There are many sculptures and memorials to former British notaries and victims of various skirmishes with the native population.

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,John M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Lovely cathedral in the heart of the city,St Pauls cathedral is a lovely cathedral in the heart of the city.  A tribute to British victorian architects. The architecture is something that could not really be achieved in modern India.  The stained glass windows are amazing but cannot be properly seen as only the rear pews by the entrance are available to tourists.  Would have liked to go nearer the alter but not allowed.  Reading some of the memorial carvings and plaques brings back a sense of the colonial past.

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,Johann R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"If You Have Time, Spend It Here.","If you have seen one cathedral, you've seen them all and for most part this statement is true. But it doesn't take into consideration what is actually IN the cathedral. For that, you have to take your time and read everything there is to read on the walls, on the crypts, at the base of the busts, even on the pews. This way you get a sense of history, of the importance of the place.The one I discovered that reverberated within me was the Coventry Cross Of Nails and the Litany accompanying it- ""Father Forgive"". In this sacred place, at the time, it touched me in a very special way."

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,Spicegal123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Interesting look at some colonial history,"The church is interesting in that it gives a insight into colonial history - to the extent I can't believe some of the gravestones are still there as they have such a ""them and us"" attitude in the inscriptions, but this tells much about how the Brits treated India and it's people. It can be quite uncomfortable to read how your ancestors treated people, but it's always a reminder to do better in future."

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,MJ.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Beauty and Peaceful Atmosphere! - You just can't miss to see this.,"On the next day of Christmas which was 26th December 2018, we decided to visit this Church.Our decision wasn't wrong at all. It was around 11.30am, we went in our car to see this beautiful Church. There is a parking space available inside the gate.When we got down of the car, all we could hear is nothing but the birds and the peaceful atmosphere. Since, it was the very next day of Christmas, there was a beautiful and a big crib still available for people to see it.We entered the church, and ensured we put our phones on silent and also, ensure not to click any photographs as per the instructions mentioned there. There is loads to read to understand the history of the church. The church is so big and so beautiful, your heart suddenly feels the peace and the positive vibes coming from it. Those old benches to pray are simply extraordinary. When you go right ahead and see the setup you will simply be mesmerized.The church is huge and has an extremely high ceiling. When we came out after praying, we noticed there were few counters to make charity and one small stall was put up to buy rosaries and other things.We did go with our 1.5year old and it was not bad at all. But, if you wish to go please ensure that your child is not cranky, as you may not be able to enjoy the peace and place.To summarize, do visit this once atleast once, as it's only 10mins walking distance from Victoria Palace and 2mins by cab.Don't miss both the beauties.

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,JKPImageFusion,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Unique Cathedral,This large decaying cathedral isn't quit the typical design (in any category) I believe it would be considered Gothic revival but it is missing many of the common features. It has a large iron span roof and unusual shape. Interesting space with lots of history.
St_Paul_s_Cathedral,simonalamona,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Average place to visit,"Personally I would say you do not come to India to see western stuff. However, this city has a big western heritage and this is a good place to witness it. Since it is in the Victoria Memorial area, it's worth a quick stop to learn about the british past and the religious background imported from Euorpe to understand India as it is."

St_Paul_s_Cathedral,KSRamanathan22,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Spiritually enthralling,Reading the inscriptions by various British captains and other military men in tribute to their fallen comrades in parts of India and beyond was an experience that touched me deeply and that I hope never to forget.  The power of these words in the chambers of this holy sanctum moved me beyond tears.   One particular inscription detailing mankind's shortcomings and the desire to be forgiven by the Almighty was a moment I will cherish forever.  Kolkata has preserved much of its British and Christian history in ways I have not experienced in other Indian cities and St. Paul's is a perfect example and testament to that.
