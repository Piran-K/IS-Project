Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Mallika M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,"  Nice location, beautifully showcased building and very Helpful staffs!!!! ","Without doubt one of the favorite wedding destination during my time in kokatta. The staff were extremely friendly, and front desk staff's like Raj, Shang, Yogeah, Riky and Sandeep took extra effort to help me(appreciate this!). Special thanks to that beautiful girl (forgot ask her name) for doing the incredible job of making our room silently at 6 in the morning and to the staffs for bring waterbottle late at night.  Few thing they could change is .....tea cups and use of single plastic bottles. They could definitely go more green. Over all it was a very good stay ."

Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Sanjay D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020 • Family,"Day Out - Rajkutir , Swabhumi","Recently I have been to Raajkutir in Swabhumi. Had heard lots of reviews about the place but could not manage to visit . With apprehension during Covid , one fine day we planned a lunch date to Rajkutir. About Location : Well maintained Property of Ambuja with very few people in the restaurant. Safety : With Covid in mind , Place was well Santizied. Tables were arranged with good gap in-between. Cutlery are Santizied and comes in wrapper. You yourself have to open it. Food : We were served herbal tea and it was surely a surprise but very much needed. .My Family liked the gesture. Menu  was loaded with Indian and Continental dishes to choose upon. Since we prefer Continental , We started with Jali Kebab , Chicken brochate and a bowl ,Cream of chicken soup. On main Course - Keema Roti , Phulko luchi with alur dum , Ghee Mutton roast , Dhakai Morog Pulao . Very Much recommended. Price : Average Cost of Per item is around Rs 350 . With group of 5 People , it's will be Rs 800/head. "
Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Aimster84,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Amazing venue for our wonderful Indian wedding,"Wow! Words can not describe the venue, hospitality and atmosphere of this beautiful place. (But below I do try!) My family (the UK people) arrived and we have stayed for just under a week. The hotel is incredibly clean, the rooms well decorated and the staff go above and beyond. Any problems have been sorted out promptly and the staff have gone out of their way to make us feel comfortable. My Indian husband and I have been had the joy of experiencing a wedding tasting menu, many breakfasts, the wedding buffet, and the especially organised lunch - thank you Sankhadeep Sen - see the photos below... it tasted even better than the photos look. Several family members have used the spa facilities,  which as an avide spa user, has to be one of the best massages of my life. The spa receptionist, brilliant and very knowledgeable.  So many thanks to all the staff, so many who I have come into contact with; Sankhadeep and Aman- lunch was amazing. Thank your female staff as well, I'm sorry I didn't catch their names."

Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Rajadas2014,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Not a good shopping mall,This is nothing but a small shopping mail with a very limited option of shopping and dining. One movie theatre also there. The main attraction building is not available for general public which can only be accessible via rent for any occasion. so nothing is special for this place. A lots of good shopping place is available in Kolkata. The surrounding place is also not good and clean. Mani square shopping mail (near about 1 km from here) is good option for recreation. It is only attractive for rent and meeting purpose.

Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,JAIDEEP_BANERJEE,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,You must keep one evening for this place in case it is your first visit to Kolkata,"The place is just opposite to Hyatt International / Salt Lake stadium on EM Bypass..make sure you visit the place in evening only..keep your expectation level minimum on this place and I am sure you will like it..1) Most of the days there is a cultural programme organised in the evening , which is free for all.. Usually the programmes are of good quality and give you a feel of Indian culture..do watch it sitting on the gallery..2) There are lot of shops selling traditional Indian things.. some of the items are comparatively over priced , however, if you like something , do some bargaining..3) You have food courts serving fast food there from different parts of India.. I don't say the foods are of the best of it's kind..but really worth trying for once...You may have your dinner here as well, if you prefer to have an early light Indian dinner.."

Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,RBan26,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,Losing its grandeur day by day,"Located on EM Bypass, well connected though roads. When inaugurated, it used to be one of the hot destinations of the city. But with time, it's losing its glamour, bringing down its grandeur slowly. The open air audi inside is very good for professional cultural performances. The shops inside I found to be too expensive compared to Eco Park Biswa Bangla Haat. There's no reason to take entry fees to Swabhumi after so many years. There is also an adjacent cinema hall, but with no food available.  "
Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Partha Kundu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Could be better,"Few stalls selling handicrafts, but nothing new or innovative. Could have been better with the choice of wares. The ambiance is good for a evening or holiday jaunt. Limited options for food though.  "

Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,mastafia,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,"All ""heritage"" closed now. Still, a nice park. But no ethnography or such.","Even the website is confusing about what this place really is. A banquet place, or a heritage place for arts and crafts. Anyway, all workshops/shops now moved to City Center mall and other nearby places. For heritage, go rather to Dakshinapan."
Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Shourjendra D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Still drab,"This was a happening place earlier on. Tonight, we had a Doctors Day celebration party at Rangmanch,one of the banquets of SwabhumiCar parking was inside this time,and at level 3,which is higher up,as the lower level gets filled up quite quickly.Banquet hall and the ACs were decent though and we had a nice time. I am calling it a drab place as there is apparently nothing to do inside. You roam about,buy some knicknacks and just while away your time on those stone staircases or garden.Its situated at Kadapara,opposite Hyatt Regency,Kolkata and beside Apollo Gleneagles Hospital,EM Bypass.Location was its pretty easy to reach,but there's almost nothing to do inside.Check out my snaps and the Hyatt Regency hotel at night"
Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Dipeeta D Mukherjee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Family,Great place becoming not-such-a-happening place anymore,"Swabhumi used to be a very different place in the past, with lots of events (conferences, parties and T.V.-shooting), with good infrastructure and amenities. However, for reasons not known to me, it has become a different place now, although the atmosphere is good."
Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Sachin0408,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Nothing Great About it.,"Swabhumi - The Heritage Plaza: The site is synonymous as well as famous for the various auditions that are conducted here for the Indian Television Reality Shows. You can see a swarm of people / contestants queuing outside the so called Heritage Plaza many times a year. After all the TRP’s are huge ways to attract viewers to the idiot box. So every time they come to hunt for talent for Indian Idol, India’s Got Talent, Dance India Dance or the likes ‘Swabhumi’ is their ideal choice. Its sprawling campus and open space gives them all the space they need to conduct the audition.The structure is not more than a decade and a half old. I remember frequenting this place before I left Calcutta in 2005 along-with friends to catch a movie in the nearby multiplex Inox.  People and the websites might boast of its structural elegance and the handicraft shops inside; or for that matter the food stalls but trust me there is nothing worth spending your hard earned rupee, dollar or pound here. You are sure to find better and original stuff outside if you have a perfect guide to take you around or if you do your homework well."
Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Sarkar2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Family,Ideal confernce venue,Undisturbed wide open area with lot car parking facilities.Excellent open arena to hold cultural  programmes in the evening...Auditorium can accommodate 500-600 participants...  
Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Chandan144,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Friends,No longer in demand,"This place was at one point of time a great happening place. Corporate parties, exhibitions an impromptu plays were part of the daily routine. Not any more. For reasons unknown, Kolkata seems to have shunned this place. "
Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Shankhadeep N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015,Impressive infrastructure and that's it.,"I had a show in Inox and given that this one is not part of any mall. I had find some other alternative. This place is just next door. Good place to sit in peace while u wait for your show at just Rs. 15. I was there at evening and it had practically no shop open. Given its huge size, with some accurate background music it would feel nothing less than a ghost house. Don't get me wrong when I am saying ghost house, place has excellent infrastructure and very well lit. It's kind of infrastructure you come across when you're visiting a five star hotel. By the way Hayatt is just across the road. Given that all shops closed and very less activity of ideal people here. It becomes a perfect place for love birds. So if you are bored of sitting on grass in gardens then sitting on bench and marbels can be a welcome change. "
Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,bishwaksen,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,Just a Shopping Place,This is kind of a mall but designed differently. There are a number of shops which sell ethnic handicrafts. There are also some food joints. Its located on top of a sort of a small hillock so the views are ok.

Swabhumi_The_Heritage_Plaza,Shourjendra D,2.0 of 5 bubbles,,Drab place,"Car parking though on the opposite side of the road is a nightmareWalking up the endless staircase is another nightmare.There should have been elevators/escalators for the old and the infirm.Few shops are located which sales nicknacks,mostly girlie stuff and at a high price.Food court is okish,and thats about it.Mostly a hangout place for youngsters"
