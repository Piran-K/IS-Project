Tagore_House,Coastal820768,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,homes of Bengal,A must visit to delve into the era of Tagore. This is the house where Tagore breathed his last. The house is now a museum which shows some aspects of the life of the Tagores as well as the then joint family homes of Bengal. A beautiful place to be and explore. Location: Very much within the city and easily accessible.
Tagore_House,Brun066,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Museum to visit!,"It's difficult for non-specialist people - even if they are of good culture - to have an adequate knowledge of the literary work of Rabindranath Tagore; but also, simply,  of his figure. In this case this museum is an adequate means to deepen the knowledge of the character and, through it, of some nodes of cultural discussion in India in the last century.From the museum - which coincides in part with the house where Tagore was born, then finally died - it's clear first of all that Tagore is a representative of the classes not only more educated, but also wealthier, of India. If I have understood correctly, his family was part of the category of ""zamindari"", that is the major landowners, traditionally also charged with collecting taxes - on behalf of the central power - among the local population. Tagore is therefore undoubtedly favored by his economic means in acquiring the cultural depth that will eventually lead him - in 1913 - to be the first non-European obtaining the Nobel prize for literature.Through the museum reconstruction, the different phases of his formation and af his cultural interests emerge, often summarized in the formula ""universalism"". Used to seeking what unites Indian culture - in which it was born - with other cultures, Tagore constantly repudiates nationalisms (cultural and other), on the other he deepens the links between his culture of origin and the others. In the rooms of the museum stands out in particular - but not only - its long-term attention, for example, to Japanese culture.Particular space is also given to his travels, which brought him especially in the last decades of his life to visit dozens of nations.The esteem of writers, politicians, scientists (there is a picture of him with Einstein) is attested by the amount of contacts documented in the museum. I don't know which other literate can present - as in the museum you can see - pictures with three different US presidents.Overall, visit this museum: you will enrich your culture and your sensitivity."

Rabindranath Tagore and his home is displayed so beautifully. His paintings, poetry and life flow from room to room. Take your time you need a few hours to truly absorb this amazing man's life and family home. Shoes are taken off and set down. Bags are   handed in to a cloak room given a token to identify your possessions. Safe , clean, and a real asset to the city. This building is well maintained so excellent for Architecture, and art and history enthusiasts."

I was touched to see all these and remembering reading his poems as a student. And thought about how life experience can make a person an extraordinary artist. 
Tagore_House,YDM2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Couples,very inspiring,After visiting this place you feel very inspired reading about Mr Tagore. What touched me was the mental strength this man had. At the age of about 40 he lost about 5 family members within approx. 5 years and still managed to write some beautiful novels and poems and win the Nobel price. The music played is very very soothing.

Tagore_House,Andy F,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Couples,Average,"If you've never heard of India's most famous poet Tagore, this place will mean nothing to you. If you have heard of him, you're not going to be over-impressed.  They have preserved his home as a memorial.  It's quite large, with lots of rooms to shuffle through - his study, his bedroom etc. Lots of photos & artefacts. It just didn't ""come alive"" for me."

Tagore_House,babutvm,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,Memorial of Tagore - the greatest writer,"It is the big ancestral house of Rabindra natha tagore. After visiting this museum I felt that he was highly respected outside India. He travelled a lot from east to west in ships and cherished the cultural, philosophical and literary heritage of India. It was in this house he lived and wrote many books. His bed furniture, photos, paintings and his writings all are exhibited."

Tagore_House,Pop P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,Tagore's birth and death place,Knew very little about Tagore and his works before visiting here. Learnt from the museum that he was regarded as India cultural ambassador during his time and until today. Tagore's literatures have been admired worldwide and they made him a status of international celebrity. See a collection of old photos and Tagore's famous quotes in the museum and get inspiration to explore more of his works.
