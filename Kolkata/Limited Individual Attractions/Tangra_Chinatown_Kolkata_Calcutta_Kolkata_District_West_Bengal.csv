Tangra_Chinatown,Aparajita B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Ok to try some indian chinese offerings,"This was another place i was planning to visit after hearing so much about it. After the visit i don't think its worth the trouble. Local chinese restaurants are a better choice..Place is so conjusted, difficult to park. Many restaurants all around the place in almost every nook and corner..Food is ok. It is mostly indian chinese version and lacks authentic oriental touch. Portions are big and priced not that pocket friendly... one of those old calcutta stories better heard but not tried."
