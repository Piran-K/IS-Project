The_Agri_Horticultural_Society_of_India-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Be.ht,gudnuse,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,"An Oasis in Alipore, Kolkata","The Agri-Horticultural Society’s garden and Nursery  is located on Alipore main Road, within walking distance from another renowned tourist location- The Zoological Garden and two major institutions such as The National Library and the Eastern Command Hospital. It is definitely the pride of Kolkata having its origins during the British rule . The garden is well maintained and is a joy to hundreds of local residents who patronize it and enjoy its benefits. There are well laid walking paths all around the place, lined with trees and shrubs and flower beds which turn into a riot of colours during winters . To a lot of local residents the day does not start without an invigorating brisk walk around the sprawling garden taking in the beautiful sights and amid the chirping of many bird species such as Black headed Oriole, Rufous Tree pie, Cuckoos, Babblers to name a few. There are nurseries with rows and rows of potted plants , a dedicated rose garden, a bonsai garden, a herb garden , an orchard with rare trees all carrying the names of the genus , an orchid garden and a large pond at the entrance . The five fountains in the pond when  active is a glorious sight . In short , this is a garden that should please everyone regardless of age .The A-H Society has a membership roll with annual fees for the use of  garden facilities. Non-members are allowed admission on payment of a small fee of Rs 20/- every visit. I thought it is indeed a good idea to charge a small fee from non-members , which ensures vagrants and other undesirable elements are kept out . There are well maintained toilets inside . One could buy potted plants and flowering plants from the nursery. The A-H Society is famous for the annual flower shows it conducts on more than one occasion. These flower shows draw large crowds to witness the massive variety of flowers, orchids and bonsai . The next flower show is scheduled for 9 to 12 Feb 2017 . The A-H Society is a must visit for nature lovers ."
