To find the webpage, simply Google ""virtual tour of Victoria Memorial Hall."" You may also download the Google Arts & Culture mobile app.To being with, the entrance had a grand garden that was well-kept, and I noticed that it provided free WiFi. After that, I entered the museum. It provided a lot of information on the artistic history of Bengal. Its huge walls, mind blowing architecture, statues, and manuscripts caught my eye. It had priced paintings that were eye-catching, especially the ones that depicted the yogic postures and artworks of famous painters. I liked the rare photographs that reflected India in British times.I found an arsenal of artillery to be very attractive and has been showcased throughout the entire interior. They displayed British rule and architecture precisely and beautifully, even in black and white.To conclude, it was very informative, and the virtual served the purpose. This virtual tour will surely leave you wanting for more!"
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Saurav Mitra,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,PRETTY BAD BEHAVIOUR AT THE DEPARTMENTAL CANTEEN AT VICTORIA MEMORIAL PREMISES.,"Very ill behaved staffs at the departmental canteen, we entered the canteen to ask whether the canteen is operational or not, the person replied that can't you the see the board outside!This is the way , you all reply! No sense of hospitality. May be they are aware that Tourism Ministry is not bothered, no actions would be taken! Can they reply such a way to foreigners too?!A successful tourist attraction is actually a blend of everything elements of hospitality."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Sounhakan M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,#newage #Virtualreality,"Experience The Virtual Tour To Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata.I was always fascinated about the evolution of the internet and I'm amused by thinking what all can be done while sitting at the comfort of our home. With this I have decided to make a visit to the Victoria memorial hall.Come with me as I walk you with my narrative to the virtual experience.Queen Victoria's marble statue had got all my attention directly from the entrance. As a person with lot of love and interest to arts and paintings, my fingers on the mouse started to automatically scroll to the top inside of the central hall with a variety of paintings giving an idea about the Britain courts in the tombsComing to Antiques....I quickly imagined myself as a person who was living with those armoury and the legendary cannons stored in the memorial, wahh! That would have been great if it was real. But let's come back to realityThe photos of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa along with his student Swamy vivekananda brought peace with in me, and this also reminds me of a famous quote “Talk to yourself once in a day, otherwise you may miss meeting an intelligent person in this world.” - Swamy Vivekanada.After this virtual experience, I’m sure that I’m going to make a visit to The Victoria Memorial Hall directly. Will also urge you people to experience the virtual worlds."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Akanksha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Victoria Memorial Hall Virtual Tour,"I came across this spectacular Victoria Memorial Hall virtual tour, which has a stunning collection of western paintings, rare photographs, Indian paintings, and manuscripts. I could literally see the details of amazing paintings, many of which were made by Indian queens, which I could even zoom into. I could see the beautiful architecture, and I could feel that I was literally in it. It was thrilling. I could even see fine details of the swords that were used by our great kings, and it gave me chills. I could see the western sculptures, which were finely made. And I could experience the great, breathtaking richness of Indian architecture just by looking at the amazing photographs. I appreciate this wonderful technology that allows me to see and feel these heartwarming creations from the comfort of my own home. This is a must-see!

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Dolly,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,""" A truly Memorable Monument""","I finally got the chance to visit Kolkata, and when I did, there is no way I would have missed visiting this astounding memorial, which is known for its majestic British architecture and beauty that attracts thousands of people from all over the world. This memorial truly reflects the standing record of the history that was made in the memory of the deceased Queen Victoria. The statue is built of white Makrana marble that is eye-catching and worth looking at. The walls of the museum also had various scriptures written in different languages, including English, Sanskrit, and Urdu. It also had a lot of valuable collections, such as artefacts and cultural and historical paintings, including those of freedom fighters like Subhas Chandra Bose. This place is so inspiring, and everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Sunnywin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Amazing building and grounds,"The building is stunning as are the grounds but I was a little disappointed by the content, not a good museum. "
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,KNKD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Couples,A monumental memorial,"Kudos to the authorities for the maintenance of this mammoth structure and the calming well maintained gardens and water features around it. One can purchase a ticket to enter the garden area only and enjoy the duck ponds, shady trees and benches. The flower beds are beautifully maintained as well. The structure looks fresh and almost brand new, the inside exhibition was well put together and in theme (we visited around 15 August). Pick a map of Kolkata and postcards from the seller, to send to family and friends on your way out of the gardens."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Iconic,"The Victoria Memorial is an iconic structure & is synonymous with Kolkata! Even the rain couldn’t dampen my excitement of visiting. For the Victoria Memorial, two kinds of tickets are available – one for the gardens (INR 10) & one for the gardens + museum (INR 30).The pathway is flanked by gardens on both sides. A statue depicts Queen Victoria in her later years sitting on a throne.I absorbed Netaji’s life stories, ideals & beliefs in the Irrepressible Subhas gallery. You'll ponder how less we know about Netaji.The Royal Gallery on the ground floor consists of oil paintings from the British Raj. The other set of paintings I liked were by the Daniell duo; they traveled across India & documented what they saw in their paintings.As you exit the Victoria Memorial building, go to the first floor to see Biplobi Bharat Gallery. It contains aspects of the Indian freedom struggle that haven’t been given their due importance in the mainstream narrative (Revolutionaries & Armed Resistance). Take your time reading through contribution of Naval Mutiny, formation of significant associations etc.Drive around the Memorial at night; it looks even more marvelous with its illumination."

Its rich heritage history has got it all in this one masterpiece. Structured with white marble, this beautiful monument has a lot to reveal. While doing a virtual tour, I felt that it has some of the finest architecture of all the historical sites in India. The paintings on the walls are so attractive and the carvings on each pillar are so detailed. It is adorned with different sculptures and the dome in the centre of the hall is really astonishing. Its premier art gallery is wonderful. Having a virtual tour of the Victoria Memorial was really a treat to the eyes. I had an overwhelming experience and am really excited to revisit this place again in the near future."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Shriram Saini,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Alive and Vivid,"Exploring Victoria Memorial Hall was like going back hundreds of years back and living in there. Once I started reading history with respected paintings, it becomes more alive and vivid. The environment all around the hall made it more real. For me, it was heartwarming to see how people were living in the past. Audio and visuals didn't leave me alone anywhere. Sculptures surprised me each time I saw a new one. Thomas Daniell's illustrations of history were fascinating to see and imagine from his point of view. Not just inside, but the outside garden was also beautiful and well managed. Regardless of whether a person is a history enthusiast or not, moving around will certainly be a pleasant experience."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Vidisha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Virtual Tour,"Today I had the opportunity to sit comfortably on my sofa and visit the Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata. This was made possible through the virtual tour offered by the website. At first, it took me a few minutes to understand how the virtual tour works, but once I got the hang of it, it was one of the most interesting and unique experiences I've had so far. Even though it was a virtual tour, I was able to notice the beautiful white marble structure and how the architecture was a mix of British and Mughal styles. The massive museum building is divided into sections, and even though it was a virtual tour, I was able to visit different sections. Each section has different exhibits with statues, portraits, national leaders, and weapons. In addition, it contains rare and original works by William Shakespeare. For me, this virtual tour was one of the most enriching experiences of my life."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,DozierAbroad,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Was history of Calcutta; now ode to Netaji & colonial assassins,"In the past few years, the exhibits here tracking the history of the city have been removed, and a history of Indian revolutionary figure Netaji have been installed. The very last room, tucked away upstairs, is an ode to assassins and would-be assassins of British officials. It seems calculated to stir not only national pride, but a seething, lasting and present-day resentment at being invaded. Next to the memorial to one young would-be assassin, a plaque poses questions like, ""Would YOU have the courage to do what this young man did?"" As the only (visible) foreigner visiting, I noticed that people were glaring at me by the end of it. I fled."

There are many things present in the hall which must have been used for decorations during the living of Express Victoria in the Memorial.A lot of photographs from the era when Kolkata was Calcutta.

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Karan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,My first Virtual Tour- Victoria Memorial,"I graduated from Kolkata, and  Victoria memorial was our perfect escape from the chaotic and hectic college life. Whenever we wanted some peace, it was our ‘’adda’.But in the last three years, I have not been able to visit Kolkata even once, and hence my wish to visit the Victoria memorial one more time was escalating day by day.And I am not here to just share my grief, to be honest, I have something really interesting to share with everyone who has been longing to visit a place for a long time.What if I tell you that you can visit that place from the comfort of your home.Yes it's possible, Today morning one of my friends sent a link to me that was supposed to provide a Virtual Tour of Victoria Memorial.At first, I got so excited and went back down the memory lane, cheering all the time I had spent applauding the beautiful galleries and the soothing garden, with birds adding their melodies, ahh it was all perfect.But then I thought that no, a “virtual tour” of my favourite place, how will it be able to match all the beautiful sights that are still in my head,  will the experience be any good?I took a shot and ended up spending two hours virtually visiting my old ‘adda” and I can't emphasise enough how refreshing it was.I never believed that a virtual tour of a place can give you such a detailed and enriching experience of the place, and now since my hands are already dirty, I am gonna visit so many more places.So that was my first and definitely not the last Virtual tour experience, so you too go ahead visit the websites of your favourite place and sit down and visit."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Gazal Chawla,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Had an amazing virtual tour of this historic property.,"The VICTORIA MEMORIAL can now be browsed online through Google Arts and Culture website and the best part is it gives a 360-degree view of the museum to virtual visitors. The moment I got to know about the virtual tour, my historophile heart had to watch it.I started off with the entrance hall and I was in awe of the attractiveness that lies within the museum, it is made in the memory of Queen Victoria, and her broad sculpture was at the onset itself. There were two more figures in the left and right corners themselves. The most promising part about the tour is that it gives its virtual visitor an arrow and the cross sign to navigate throughout the museum, and also a compass to revolve around the property. The entire hall is made of white marble and a floor of white and black patterns gives a similar structure to that of the Taj Mahal. There are various galleries in the museum showing different sculptures, and paintings of old times(including paintings by Abanindranath Tagore and Gaganendranath Tagore), antiques of armor and arms, etc. While noticing the museum I saw lush green laws encircling the memorial which could be the finest place for a morning walk.If you are a person who admires artifacts and has an emotional connection with the historic culture and want to advance your familiarity with history you should definitely have a virtual tour of this memorial made of white marbles consisting of an extensive art collection."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Preeti uttam chandani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,My visit to one of the best architectural designs.,"This was the first time I ever visited Kolkata and Victoria Memorial Hall. I have fallen for this museum. It is one of the best architectural designs I have seen from the British era which was built in the memory of Queen Victoria. It has a wide variety of western paintings and Indian paintings. I was hypnotized by looking at the black and white photographs, as they were surprisingly very clear and it was a treat to see them in real life. There were several volumes of manuscripts from Buddhist texts to Sanskrit texts. It also has a collection of old royal dresses, swords, guns, and shields. For this one and a half hour, I lost myself in this beautiful museum while discovering something new at every corner."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Nikita L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Virtual Tour of Victoria Memorial Hall,"It was challenging for me to decide where to begin and where to stop because I have never visited a museum or taken a virtual tour. I made the decision to explore this area of Victoria Memorial Hall virtually, so one morning, with a cup of tea and a book by my side, I began roaming across the hall—of course virtually.I landed in the hallway, where the wonderful architecture and abundance of things to investigate made me feel a little intimidated. With a sigh, I began dragging my cursor around. Huge windows that provided a royal treat for your eyes allowed you to enjoy the spectacular ceiling views.I struggled to find my way through the hallways and eventually found the rare photographs and paintings section, where I saw a dozen images that had a different feel and showed Kolkata at the time it was governed by the British administration.The museum takes us back in time and helps us recall the struggles that our ancestors faced with some of its paintings by eminent, well-known artists like Abanindranath Tagore and Gaganendranath Tagore, and images that tell us stories about the people of Kolkata.We become emotional and more concerned about our country as a result of our love for the architecture and the beautiful work of the British government, as well as our fascination with art and our curiosity about how people lived here during the reign."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Fit n Smiles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Please do not miss this place when you come to Kolkata. Place to remember forever.,"I live in kolkata. As a calcuttan I have visited Victoria Memorial Hall several time since my childhood. Then we would come here from school. When I grew up, I used to go with friends or family. But every time I go, it feels good and the same kind of interesting. The Victoria Memorial is a part of Calcutta and a masterpiece of British architecture and sculpture. Calcutta cannot be imagined without it. Yet the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata is the first destination for any foreigner. The collection has also increased over time. Recently, I have been fascinated by the collection about Subhash Chandra Bose. I asked everyone to visit here at least once in their life."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Shivam Mathur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2021,Worth Visiting,"Victoria Memorial Hall is a very interesting place to visit. I am not a historic lover but this place is just incredible. The lush green gardens as themselves very beautiful.Inside there is a museum with a lot of paintings, a display of armory, guns, and other things which are of great interest to anybody. It took me an awfully long time to really look at things and to crown it all and the magnificent statue of Queen Victoria takes your breath away.The Victoria looks even more beautiful by the night and the special sound and light show is held every evening at the gardens of the memorial.The only drawback of visiting this place is, that the hall is very far away from the other main gate and you'll have to take a walk to the hall.So, It is a worth visiting place for the ones who are looking for a historic tour."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Banshidhar S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Victoria Memorial Hall,"The Victoria Memorial is a monument to Queen Victoria, located at the end of The Mall in London, and designed and executed by the sculptor (Sir) Thomas Brock. Designed in 1901, it was unveiled on 16 May 1911, though it was not completed until 1924. It was the centrepiece of an ambitious urban planning scheme, which included the creation of the Queen’s Gardens to a design by Sir Aston Webb, and the refacing of Buckingham Palace (which stands behind the memorial) by the same architect.Like the earlier Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens, commemorating Victoria's consort, the Victoria Memorial has an elaborate scheme of iconographic sculpture. The central pylon of the memorial is of Pentelic marble, and individual statues are in Lasa marble and gilt bronze. The memorial weighs 2,300 metric tonnes (about 2535 U.S. tons)[1] and is 104 ft wide. In 1970 it was listed at Grade I."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,mayu k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,A virtual tour worth visiting.,"First things first, excellent job done by the Indian Museum and Ministry of culture by including the virtual tour of this lovely monument. The page is quite user friendly and is available in 2 languages that is English and Hindi. I feel they also could have included Bengali as another language because Victoria Memorial is the Pride of West Bengal, and the native language being not included on the website is a letdown for many people of West Bengal. Apart from this, the pictures they have added are very clear and descriptive. You can also view individual pictures of different artifacts separately in different tabs to get a detailed view. The menu option in the site is not be visible until and unless you press the button, which I think should be corrected as they can make it more user friendly by making the options visible throughout the virtual tour. You can very easily navigate through the virtual tour and experience the beauty of the monument while being seated at your home. The 360-degree view helps you experience everything available in the monument and leave no stone unturned. This is the third museum in the country to go virtual and is being run by the ministry of culture. Victoria Memorial has a vast collection but only 13% of the collection is displayed in the museum due to lack of space but with the help of virtual tour we can also see other artifacts and collections which are not available even for the visitors of the monument. Visiting this website was a wonderful experience for me, you must also visit if you haven't yet, you will have a great time."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Mrunmay Arbune,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,virtual tour to Victoria Memorial hall,"Victoria Memorial Hall is one of the most beautiful museums in Kolkata. The museum building is a masterpiece of British architecture. The building was erected in memory of Queen Victoria during the reign of Lord Curzon, the British Viceroy. The Victoria Memorial is a spacious hall built of marble called Valhalla  (concept of heaven in Nordic Culture) of India. The gallery's galleries feature masterpieces from the colonial period and photographs from the same period. As Calcutta was the early capital of the British Government, many Viceroys of India lived in Calcutta. Some of them are beautiful marble statues of Viceroys such as Lord Curzon, Lord Robert Clive, Queen Victoria. The arsenal in this museum is also very beautiful. It has many swords like Samsher, Pulvar, Zafar-Takiya, Dhop, Firang, Goliya, Udepuri, Khanda and so on. They have Mach-Lock, Flint-Lock, Cap-Lock as well as British guns like Mozzer like guns to beautifully carved cannons. If you want to experience the art of the Colonial period, you need to visit this museum at least once."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Rishabh Tulsani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,"A euphoric tour to- Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata","Firstly, tbh I did the virtual tour of the museum site, and as I roamed in the galleries with clicks of my mouse, it led me to visualize the events I know in technological and historical space in chronological order. In almost every hall, there were statues of great people like Late King George V and Late Empress Victoria, and also many rare pictures and paintings of our history's great people and their stories. In this as well, I was envisioning where we have come from paintings and sculptures to Social Media and now moving towards NFTs. This virtual tour in itself is a perfect example to envision how far we have come from traveling to far different places to visit their memorial sites to now visiting those places at our homes only, that too with so immersive experience which makes it seem indifferent from actually visiting it.The site had a tonne of information on the region surrounding, and also the places and people that are relevant to it. From the history of Bengali Art to the British Rule, it was all packed with euphoric feelings and let me think critically about what is the purpose of preserving things of history and its stories. It let me connect dots and put perspective to my thoughts as to where technology has taken us so far and where it is headed now.Tbh I didn't find any answers about the future part, but I have gotten to the conclusion that certainly our history will always be going to be a part of what's about to come as the saying goes, ""The past is never dead""."
Victoria_Memorial_Hall,VINCY F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Virtual tour of Victoria Memorial Hall.,"I visited one of the iconic monuments, Victoria Memorial Hall, which is located in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. A memory dedicated to Empress Victoria now turned into a museum. On entering the museum, I observed that it had a collection of swords, shields, and weapons. The piano and boat were worth taking a look at. The museum had huge statues of Late Empress Victoria, Late King George V, Late brigade surgeon Henry Elmsley, and Late Mary, Late Robert Clive. It had captured stories of the beginning of independence that showed up in museums on its walls.The museum provided a lot of information on the history of Bengal artistically. Its huge walls, architecture, statues, and manuscripts caught my eye. It had prized paintings that were eye-catching, especially the ones that depicted the yogic postures and artworks of famous painters. I liked the rare photographs that reflected India in British times. They showed British rule and architecture precisely and beautifully, even in Black and White. The buildings, bridges, vehicles, and life, in general, were captured elegantly by Bourne Shepherd as well as Johnson & Hoffman.I loved touring Victoria Memorial Hall and would recommend it to people who are either planning to visit West Bengal or who want to visit a historic place. This place will surely leave you wanting more."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,Ghumakkad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,"A virtual tour of Victoria Hall, Kolkata","As the name itself screams, a visit to the Victoria Hall will give you many glimpses of Kolkata from the Victorian Era. The virtual tour starts in a hall. The first thing that caught my attention was the hall’s architecture. Everything, starting from the pillars, gigantic window openings to polished floors speak the language of castles, the kind of accommodation Empress Victoria must have been living in back in 1921 when this masterpiece was constructed. But, the fact that the British were the people who were running our country back then, was reminded to me as soon as I took my eyes off of the admirable architecture.On the right, was a nicely sculpted statue of Robert Clive, the first Viceroy of the Presidency of  Bengal, Rest in Peace. Right behind the sculpture was a door that opened up the view to some rare photographs from the era when a camera used to be a luxury.A lot of photographs from the 20th century capturing the spirit of the joyous city of Kolkata caught my attention. The contrast in those photographs was brought out in a manner that was like none other I had ever seen. On one side there were the rich aristocrats from Britain and on the other side were the people of India who worked hard and earned their bread every day.Moving on to the other side of Robert Clive, Rest in Peace again, was a huge collection of paintings from India and the West as well as the manuscripts. The attention to detail in these exhibits was just impeccable. I kept on getting awed as I moved from one painting to another.That is all I can accommodate in the current situation. Stay tuned, though. There is lots coming your way related to the virtual tour."

Victoria_Memorial_Hall,VIJAI KUMAR,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,The disgusted visit to Victoria memorial,"awesome historical building and its surroundings. One feels proud of the architecture.  However there is nothing done on this premises , to facilitate tourists. No car parking facility near the premises. That means that the local tourists also have to hire taxi. There are no guides around to tell about the monument.  The foot paths, laid with pebbles,  are very uncomfortable. Overall the place seems to have been neglected from tourists point of view"

Tickets come in two forms. One is intended for only the garden tour, costing only 10 rupees, and the other one is with the additional entrance to the Victoria mansion, which adds 20 rupees more.GARDEN VISITThe garden itself is about 64 acres of land, as the memorial is situated on a vast area, and is adorned with various seasonal flowers, creating a wonderful ambience to roam around in. This is a common place of hangouts for families, couples, or the youth. There is also a very eye-catchingly big pond and a beautiful fountain on the premises.MEMORIAL MUSEUM VISITAs you approach the mansion, you will see some statues depicting motherhood, at the top of the porch, one being very prominent, along with some smaller sized ones. Despite being around since the early 20th century, the marbled building is still well managed and well organized in its appearance."

The Royal gallery displays the life and works of the British royals while the Calcutta gallery showcases the history of this lovely city.Last but not the least, the place boasts of an amazing garden sprawling across acres of land.No doubt, the Victoria Memorial is one of the most sought-after destinations in Kolkata.

Lord Curzon proposed the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens.

A time machine that takes one back to the years before the First World War although only built in 1921. It is a tribute to its eponymous dedicatee. Extracted nay blackmailed into contributing, India was generous in its tribute to her. The building is instartlingly white Indian marble. Ornate and rather elegant. Once past the bronze of Victoria Emperatrix , one steps into a vast echoing hall surmounted by a galleried cupola. The first sight is a beautiful statue of the young queen. The ground floor is full of loot, portraits of the dignitaries of Victoria’s India, watercolours by her sailors, cannon, a wonderful black marble table mounted on four bronze howitzers, weapons of the period of British rule.Upstairs I found an exquisite exhibition of Indian miniatures that took me a full hour to see properly."
