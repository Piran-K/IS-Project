0,Gurdwara_Pathar_Sahib,M&M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Incredible,"Must visit.. history is unbelievable… . It is popularly believed that Guru Nanak vanquished a demon who was trying to crush him with a boulder.However, the boulder that the demon rolled down turned soft and melted and instead of hitting him, and took on Guru Nanak's shape. In 1970, a boulder was discovered that is believed to be the one in the story with Guru Nanak's shape still carved in it. The Indian Army, along with the local people, constructed this gurudwara to pay homage to this event and all cars passing this route make sure to stop to pray and seek blessings."

0,Gurdwara_Pathar_Sahib,Prasanna N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Where Devotion is Duty....,"The Indian army guards the frontiers of the nation which Cris crosses a Kaleidoscopic terrain. The threats faced by the soldiers who are on duty 24/7 are not limited to the hostile neighbours on either side of our boundaries. The inhospitable weather and treacherous terrain pose an equally mammoth peril to the safety and security of the troops. When the fight is against Mother Nature, impeccable training and superior equipments are not the sole means of facing the challenge. Divine intervention is also solicited in equal measure. The Pathar sahib Gurudwara is one such source of godly support.The Gurudwara is located astride NH 1 about 18 KMs from Leh city as we move  towards Kargil. The origins of the Gurudwara is associated with the encounters which Guru Nanak had  with a Demon during his return from a trip to Yarkand in Tibet around 1517 AD. The demon rolled down a boulder  which  transformed into a lump of molten wax as it hit the Guru resulting in his body frame getting etched in the boulder. The encounter ended with the demon shedding his barbaric ways and seeking the blessings of the Lord. The army in the late 1970's attempted to lay a road which ran right through this boulder. All attempts at shifting or blasting this boulder came to nought. Finally, the Lord presented himself in a dream to one of the officers and directed him to consecrate the boulder. Thus, the Pathar sahib Gurudwara came to be maintained by the Indian Army.A visit to this temple is akin to visiting any army unit. The cleanliness and orderliness is of an immaculate standard. As one enters the temple a small moat with perpetually flowing water cleanses our feet. Saffron colored headgears are offered to the visitors as covering the head is a compulsory practise in the Sikh culture. There is a Langar which offers delecious food between 11 AM and 2 PM while tea and snacks are offered all through the temple timing which is between 6 AM to 7 PM. What holds our attention is the stone plaques cemented in the walls of the temple and the portraits all of which have been gifted to the temple by the various army units which have had a tenure in Ladakh. It is their way of thanking the almighty for having protected them from the vagaries of nature and ill will of our enemies. The temple is  staffed by soldiers of the Units stationed in Ladakh. The management of the funds is entrusted to a select unit which is deployed in close vicinity to the temple.The motto  of Indian Army is ""Duty is Devotion"". In this holy site which is looked upon as the presiding deity of all army units in Ladakh ""Devotion is a form of soldierly Duty""."

0,Gurdwara_Pathar_Sahib,Nlay,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Peaceful and Holy Place!,"Located at a Distance of around 25 Kms from Leh city on Leh Srinagar Highway, Gurudwara Pathar Sahib is a well maintained worshiping place. Constructed and maintained by The Indian Army, Gurudwara Pathar Sahab is said to have been blessed by Guru Nanak Dev, the founder Guru of the Sikh faith. According to legend, the place was terrorised by wicked demon who used to live here. When Guru Nank Dev visited the place after heaering the prayers of local people, the demon tried to kill the Guru, when he was meditating, by rolling a huge boulder down the hill. However, the demon was surprised on seeing that the stone turned in to warm wax and came to a halt against Guru Nanak's back.  The stone can be seen at the worship place with imprint of Guru Nanak Dev on it."

2,Gurdwara_Pathar_Sahib,Global Traveler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Rare Place of Sikh Worship: Must Visit,"According to a local legend, once a wicked demon lived in the area who terrorized the people where the gurdwara is now situated. The people prayed to the Almighty for help. It is said that Guru Nanak heard their woes and came to their aid. He settled down on the bank of the river below the hill where the wicked demon lived. The Guru blessed the people with sermons and became popular in the area. The locals called him Nanak Lama. Seeing this the demon got into a rage and decided to kill Guru Nanak Dev. One morning when the Guru was sitting in meditation, the demon pushed a large path (boulder), down from the hilltop, with the intention of killing the Guru.  but when it touched the Guru's body, it softened like warm wax and came to a halt against Guru Nanak's back. Thinking that the Guru had been killed, the demon came down and was taken aback to see the Guru deep in meditation. Guru Sahib advised him to get rid of his wicked ways and asked him to lead the life of a noble person. This changed the life of the demon, who gave up evil deeds and started serving the people.Guru Nanak Dev thereafter continued his holy journey towards Srinagar via Kargil.e Pathar is on display at the ground level and a Holy Guru Granth Sahib is on a hilltop. A twenty-four-hour langar( Free Food) and tea with prasad is provided to all worshipers visiting here. Very reverend place. Must Visit "
