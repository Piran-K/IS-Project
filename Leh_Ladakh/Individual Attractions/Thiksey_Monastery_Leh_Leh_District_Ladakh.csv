0,Thiksey_Monastery,Apolonia70,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,An imposing structure,"This was the monastery I most wanted to visit. As we stopped to take photos before entering the grounds I marveled at its size and grandeur.  Sadly, no-one informed us that the monastery wasn't open that day - usually is.  The monks decided to have a day off to do archery so we were unable to visit the place at all. We walked across the road to the monastery restaurant for lunch instead.  Lunch was good and vegetarian only. Luckily I had seen many monasteries during my week long travels so didn't feel too disappointed."

0,Thiksey_Monastery,ArindamC_Kolkata,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Short visit to Thiksey Monastery,"We visited Thiksey on 22 May. It is a steep climb with lot of stairs. If you are not acclimatized at Leh, you may feel uncomfortable climbing the stairs. My suggestion is not to rush and move slowly. The artefacts are nicely preserved and the place is worth a visit."

2,Thiksey_Monastery,Traveller Mehedi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Largest monastery of Ladakh,"Thikshey is a twelve storied monastery which is situated 19km away from Leh. It has 49 feet tall Buddha statue. This monastery is similar to ""Potala Palace"" of Lhasa, Tibet. It is considered as the biggest monastery of central Ladakh. Thikshey monastery has an assembly hall, a nunnery for ladies and some temples. You can enter this monastery by a short climb or through the main gate. I felt some breathing issue during stair lifting. The rooftop view of Thikshe valley is wonderful. Do not miss it. If anyone wants to join morning ritual/prayer here must be reached withing 7 AM. Entry fee : 30 Rupi/INR"

5,Thiksey_Monastery,knoesenm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Exceptional sight,When you drive here the monastery looks very small because you don’t yet see its entire structure. Once you see the full facade you will be mesmerized! It really does look massive and high. You get to drive high up before you enter the main gates and start walking. There are many steps to take here before you get to the temple of the futuristic Buddha. There are two temples here to visit. The views from the top terrace is amazing.
