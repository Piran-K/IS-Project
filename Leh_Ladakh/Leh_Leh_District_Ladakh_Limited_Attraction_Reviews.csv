Pangong_Tso,Ali Asgar B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-22,Diwali Trip,"We visisted Pangong Lake in October 2022 when tempratures were _8 at the lake. the lake view is mesmerising and you don't want to leave from this place. the lake has crystal clear blue waters which changes colors during morning, afternoon and evening. If you are visiting kindly take enough winter clothes as electricity is very limited so you won't get heaters for full day. also there are no electric geysers in hotels for hot water."

Pangong_Tso,Subhendu S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-22,It's a Heaven,"Exotic place. Every one should visit once in Life, those who are having very sound health. Aged person should avoid. Though I have not faced any difficulties but my wife, my sister, friends have faced problem. Oxygen Cylinders should be available with you, if you are visiting & spending night here. "

Pangong_Tso,Shoven Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Friends,What a beauty 🤩,Wow.... landscape view with transparent water and chill weather. Biking to pangong ..wow. Some part of the road under construction but yes must go place.
Pangong_Tso,Faisal M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-22,Pangong Lake,"Beautiful lake and landscape, off-road experience, different terrains, beauty of nature changes after every turn on the road,  extreme weather conditions..No electricity, (but generators will work for few hours)  no telecom/data networks,"
Pangong_Tso,Sachin Mahadeshwar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-22,Pangong Lake,"Most beautiful place in Ladakh. As suggested by a friend, do visit the place before sunset to see the Blue water. Fading light view is just awesome to see how the Blue lake turns to a black tinge. Drivers paradise. Awesome weather and really happy to see the locals taking care of the place.."
Pangong_Tso,Narayantravelogue,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,Trip to the Paradise,Drive from Nubra to Pangong was scenic with ever changing landscape.  The first sight of Pangong Tso was just superb.  The lake as said and written in various reviews keeps changing colour as the day goes. Mountains around look majestic.
Pangong_Tso,Aimless Vagabonds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,"Great place to visit, think before you decide to stay the night!","Pangong Tso has slowly become one of the highlights of Ladakh, and sans doubt, it is one of the most eye pleasing destinations. Talking about a stay here- Unless you are adventurous, I would recommend doing a day trip of the Pangong Tso and not spend the night here. Being remote, you have to make do with limited water and basic food."
Pangong_Tso,Manik Dhodi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Solo,Canvas in a Canvas,"The places is beyond words. Atleast I can't fine the appropriate words in the vocabulary to describe the beauty of Pangong lake. It is like many canvases within one big canvas. The colours of sky, water, and the mountains are unbelievably beautiful and one can't just stop looking at them. I could spend hours and hours just looking around as well as listening to the sound of water and breeze. Though a 24 hrs stay is enough here, but one can spend day after days to enjoy the beauty and calm here. "
Pangong_Tso,Rajesh Malhotra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-22,Paradise on Earth,"Its a most picturesque spot in the world. 130 km long lake  extending into China, surrounded with mountain rang. The color of the lake water changes with the sun giving rainbow effect..."
Pangong_Tso,Ruchirz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-22,If there is one word- its Mesmerizing,"Pangong lake is absolutely mesmerizing. Though the approach road is under construction and takes time to reach there, once you catch a glimpse of the lake, you get fixated to the surreal beauty. Clear blue sky, crystal clear waters, lovely mountains. In all an absolutely must visit"
Pangong_Tso,Chrisagtk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-22,Heaven on earth,"I was on my solo bike ride. Place was just beautiful. Road trip was bit nasty because of rough road as widening road was being done so most of the road was not patched, a bumpy ride but it was worth the trip as I finally saw the lake. "
Pangong_Tso,Ravsh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Ok Ok,"A mixed experience. Its a huge lake lengthwise-actually a small very small sea. Go there only if you enjoy beauty of nature, want to do meditation etc. Otherwise its just a lake. No activity at the lake except a few three idiot type activities like bum pose, scooter, ladakhi dress etc. There are numerous basic tents, cottages along the lake to stay-mostly average, lack of electricity, etc.-don't look for luxury. I would suggest at least a day's stay to enjoy the view as journey from both Leh and Nubra is 5-6 hours with some bad patches of road en-route. No shop except few restaurants. Road from Nubra along Shyok river is more beautiful, though road condition is not that good. Again travel 5-6 hours on difficult roads only if you like natural beauty."
Pangong_Tso,84robertantony,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,What a Lake,"Lake looks amazing when sun is out, at night, one of the clearest views of the Milky way and bright stars. all in all an unique experience "
Pangong_Tso,Ramesh Ramakrishnan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,What a View!,The tough journey is rewarded with a Unforgettable view of changing colours of the lake. Don't skip this place.
Pangong_Tso,NayantSavani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,A sight to see,A calming serene lake with changing colour as per the sun rays. With mountains on both sides this lake is just 30% within India. A lot of tents and cottages have come up in this area for tourist to stay over. There is no full time electricity and food is available in each tent area. The place get cold and is very windy. Walking on the lake path is an experience. The 3 idiots famous final scene was shot here. Some share the opinion that it could be a day return journey fro Leh. Tend to agree with that view. However the roads leading to Pangong Tso is rough. Even coming in from Nubra valley carries the risk of being blocked out if water melting its was causes the roads to become non navigating.
Pangong_Tso,Avinash Chandra A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,Most Beautiful Lake one would ever see,"it was mesmerizing, as beautiful as expected. sun rise was amazing and the lake is one of the best. The journey from Nubra Valley is tiring but worth it."
Pangong_Tso,Sandeep,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,Not Seen before,"The lake is around 5 to 6 hours journey from Hotel Grand willow, Leh. very calm, cool  soothing lake, never seen before in life."
Pangong_Tso,Amit Singh S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,Heaven on earth is Pangong Tso,"The lake very huge with different colors at different times of the day, plan to visit in early hours as it gets chilly winds after 17:00 and one cannot stay near Pangong lake.Those who are panning to stay near this place should book accommodation in wooden cottage as normal tents won't protect you from spine chilling cold during night time.There will be no power after 22:00 so charge your electronic devices before hand or carry power banks. Moreover there will be no mobile network (Jio, Airtel or BSNL) available in this area so plan accordingly."
Pangong_Tso,Sanjiv Pandey,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Friends,Amazing place,"What a place!! One has to see it to believe it. Road from  Leh to Pangong and beyond is being widened, not that it is in very bad shape as of now. Crystal clear water, cold as ice and changing hues with every passing minute – it is not easy to describe this magical lake. Accommodation here is basic because the government does not want to leave a permanent dent on the natural beauty perhaps. Tents and wooden cottages only. Our place of stay, Virgo Cottages were spic and span. Haider, the caretaker and Ajay, the cook from Jharkhand were amazing. Ajay cooked good food esp. the egg curry and Aloo ka Paratha were sumptuous. No network here. Jio works a bit at some isolated spots and of course, BSNL. Vodafone doesn’t work at all in Ladakh. Govt must tell these operators to have few satellite phones to take care of any emergency."
Pangong_Tso,Aditya B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun-22,Scenic views like no other,"After the grueling journey from Leh to Pangong by road (which is really bad if you have motion sickness or weak back), you witness the natural beauty which makes everything worthwhile. The lake and its colors are cannot be replicated even on a canvas. Its the uniqueness which makes visiting this lake special. See it to believe it."
Pangong_Tso,SandeepGadgil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,Superb! The lake looks blue and beautiful even when it's cloudy,This is an amazing place. Just be mindful that it can get cold and windy and can have light snowfall (enroute) even in May. So be prepared. But a must-see location
Pangong_Tso,vikramkanodia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun-22,Main attraction of LEH!!,"Beautiful view, worth visiting. The experience to reach there is awesome. We started early morning from Hunder and the route is amazing, army controlled, need to apply online pass before travel inside LEH"
Pangong_Tso,Isha G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun-22,Magical place; Ernest request to tourists to keep this place clean,"The lake is truly magical and is a natural wonder. I have seen similar lakes in new zealand, but Pangong Tso surpassed all expectations.The journey to this place is a bit hard  because some roads are broken and are being constructed again, so the ride is quite bumpy. But that's true for most places in ladakh outside leh.I stayed overnight in a camp there and could not sleep. Perhaps it was due to low oxygen level which did sometimes make me uncomfortable. But we did not need an oxygen cylinder. It is an individual preference whether to stay overnight or return the same day. we definitely did not want to travel so much same day so stayed overnight.I also want to urge tourists to keep this place as pristine as it originally is and not throw plastic bottles and chips wrappers around."
Pangong_Tso,thisisshail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Amazingly beautiful - huge blue water lake,You have to see it to believe it - surrounded by mountains this blue water lake is a picture perfect destination for all ages
Pangong_Tso,Aka,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Friends,The view took my breath away..,"The view took my breath away in scenic way as well and in literal way too…I experienced immense breathlessness at night after a meal, so it’s advisable to take oxygen cylinder. This place is worth visiting once in lifetime just make sure you return safely!"
Pangong_Tso,travellerZ6006SK,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Friends,Horrible journey,Overhyped lake..treacherous journey with the world's filthiest toilets en route.Horrible roads and stray dogs all over Leh and vicinity
Pangong_Tso,Samrat Mitra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,LADAKH....HEAVEN OF MOUNTAINS,Just awesome...tso camps are superb in decoration as well as boarding. The rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable. The food is really good and delicious with so much variety every time. The management is also great. We kept our luggages at the hotel and it was beautifully managed by them. I would absolutely recommend anyone staying in Leh to stay in this second home and have the best homely experience away from home.
Pangong_Tso,Deepak_01,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun-22,Excellent magical lake & night sky full of stars,"A must visit in this sector for the serene & mesmerising lake.The vibrant green-blue turquoise colours of the water is truly amazing.The lake looks endless with picturesque mountains on the other side.The shooting spot with yellow scooters & multi coloured 3 seaters are allover the stretch  for clicking pictures.Accomodation in Pangong is very basic with tents,except for a few wooden huts.Night temperatures are sub-zero with low oxygen & heavy winds.One has to carry oxygen cylinders and plan accordingly based on individual health conditions.Else,skip the night stay in Pangong.But the night sky view is an extremely magical experience with bright stars & milky way  ,seemingly very close, which should never be missed."
Pangong_Tso,PoojaNoida,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Majestic Pangong,"Must visit place in Leh. Extremely beautiful, colour changing lake and mountains. Opposite side has snow peaks.By the time you reach Pangong from Nubra, it's already 3-4 pm. Though the mountains have sunlight but lake becomes dull. Best is to stay overnight at some wooden cottages, star gaze at night and checkout from your cottage around 9 am and enroute Leh, beautiful colours of lake can be seen. A clear, sunny day adds to its beauty.It's warmer also in the morning as compared to the evening time. Night becomes chilly and you need to be wrapped head to toe.Facilities are basic but if you are well wrapped, the blankets and hot water bottles provided by the cottages are sufficient. Food is good.Ample of small food joints/ dhabas are on the way to Pangong. Food is not a problem. But some stretches of roads are kutchha in between which makes the journey to and fro little tiring. Takes min 5 hours."
Pangong_Tso,533arpitm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,Worth the hype,"Some touristy spots leave you underwhelmed, but not this one. Wish there was a way to spend more time here. Absolutely loved it.."
Pangong_Tso,MaithiliSave,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Beautiful,"It is very beautiful lake. Loved it, but you need to take a pain to travel by gravel road. We visited at around 3 pm. Saw beautiful blue- green colours of the lake. We stayed in tents at the Lake. I think that can be avoided, there is nothing else to do. You can spend around 2-3 hrs at the lake, take pictures. If you decide to spend a night, book a cottage instead of tent. It is very windy sometimes at night and very cold."
Pangong_Tso,Arvind 1990,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,Some very useful tips about Pangong Tso visit,"1. Best time of day to visit Pangong lake is between 12.0 Noon to 4.0 PM. We visit the western bank of Pangong Lake, so in forenoon when we click photos with lake in background, the sun is in our back side and faces and hills in background remain shady thus photos clicked do not look great.It is also the least windy time of the day, so one can shed woolens and click some memorable snaps.2. At Pangong never ever stay in tents. The nights at Pangong are quite chilly and windy which make stay at tents really a horrible experience. Now a lot of wooden huts are also available at Pangong, which make a better choice to stay there. At least they save you from the winds and comparatively much more comfortable.3. Do not go with high hopes about the accommodation in Pangong to prevent any disappointment and grudges later.These are temporary arrangements with bare minimum facilities. All of them offer the same basic amenities irrespective of your package.Do not get fooled by great photos available on travel sites of these camps, these are fake. So do not waste your time in choosing one over other. They all are almost the same.4. At Pangong electricity remains available between 7.0 PM to 10.0-11.0 PM only so carry your cameras, phones and power banks in fully charged status or charge them during these hours.5. Mobile phones do not work in Pangong. Forewarn your relatives and friends before leaving for Pangong that you will remain unreachable for next one day.Even the camps at Pangong do not have any kind of communication facilities.6. Why to stay at PangongA lot of your friends will advise you that with all these limitations it is not worth to stay at Pangong at all. But I beg to differ here as journey from both Nubra Valley and Leh to Pangong is approximately 5-6 hours long.Thus, doing Nubra-Pangong-Leh or Leh-Pangong-Leh in a day means 10-12 hours of travelling time on dangerous mountainous roads which is hard on you and your driver both.Apart from this at Pangong instead of enjoying the unparalleled beauty of the place and clicking some lifetime memories you will keep on worrying about getting late.You are here not to participate in a race but to enjoy and relax with your family and friends.Therefore, take it easy and appreciate the pristine beauty of majestic Pangong Tso tension free.Happy Journey"
Pangong_Tso,V B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Friends,Filthy toilets treacherous roads. Overhyped,Filthy toilets on way and at lake. Treacherous roads with extremely bumpy areas. Perilous car journey with several cars noted to have fallen off the cliff. It is an overhyped place and not worth the journey 
Pangong_Tso,MADHU PRASAD K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,Serene and wonderful Place,We had high expectations on our Trip to Pangong and it met most of them . The whole atmosphere is serene and view of the lake surrounded by mountains is breath taking.  The lake looks in different colours and cant believe that this place is in India.  The weather is cold you need to be appropriately dressed.  The restaurants are not that great.
Pangong_Tso,Sai K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Beautiful place,A must visit on your trip to Ladakh. Great for Photoshoot. Visit during morning hours. Sunlight gives that beautiful blue colour to the lake. Stay not advisable. Washrooms in poor condition.
Pangong_Tso,DEBASHISHMUKHERJEE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-21,"MESMERISING PANGONG AT 14,500FT","Oh!!! What a beautiful, serene, captivating landscape. The beautiful 150km long lake east west , with around 30 km within India is a mesmersing natural splendor worth capturing on the lens and treasuring as memory. The sheer blue of the sky and the hue of the lake changing colors as per the  time of day and the mood of the sky, is a sight to behold. The best approach to Pangong Tso is from Leh, through the 17,900ft Chang La pass , then reaching Durbuk-Tangtse. From this last habitat the distance  to the lake is around 45 min drive, through the jaw dropping landscape of Changthang plateau. The stay at lake is not recommended as there are very few accomodations and the altitude is so high, it can cause various types of altitude related sickness - viz., pulmonary edema, cerebral edema and acute mountain sickness . Beware!!! Old people should avoid a prolonged stay at this height."
Pangong_Tso,Nagmani2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Solo,Solo bike ride to Pangong Tso lake,"It was my solo bike ride to Pangong lake from Gujarat (Mithapur). It is always said that Journey is more beautiful than the destination. But when u reach at this destination,  u will find that its difficult to judge which one is more beautiful. In my opinion, both r equally beautiful and rewarding. Experiencing this lake can't be described in words, but felt only.. It's great, truly amazing. I didn't have much time and had to return same day, hence I couldn't enjoy much. But in my next trip, I will. If you have time, plan staying there. Everything is available there. Temperature during day time was between 10-12 celsius. Night may be a little colder. So nothing to worry about cold, one can enjoy even with kids. High altitude sickness may happen only at higher passes like Khardungla, Changla, even if u r staying there for longer. But it's advisable to carry medicines to counter this problem."

Pangong_Tso,MokshA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Friends,Must visit when in Ladakh !! ,"What a beauty!!!! It seems like the mountains has a blue carpet between them. Words are less to describe the peace this place has to offer. It mesmerizing. Weather was extremely cold upto -6° at night and the water too is very cold even on hot days.The Hotels, Tents around Pangong are very basic, some of them do not have even power backup . Please do not expect any luxury in these stays. Bathing is also not a good idea if you are not used to extreme cold. Also, if you have health issues, staying here is a risk, but at times you will not have an option also, since it's based on how your iternary goes. We reached Pangong in the evening, and hence, we had to stay, since night travel was not possible towards Changla pass. Our phones were completely dead, even the bsnl ones. The locals over there has established business for clicking pics on 3 idiots scooters, trunks etc. and Kareena's red choli. For scooter they said one person for 200, but we bargained for  4 PPL for 300."

The beautiful clear water with different shades of blue and green stretches as far as the eye can see. It's a salt water lake and the water is very cold even on a hot day. Would be a very tight schedule if one is planning to visit this place on a day trip. Better to book a camp in Spangmik (and not Lukung) for an overnight stay. But it's a must do in Lakadh, at least once."

Spangmik is another option to stay, away from maddening crowds, not lake facing but still closer plus additional benefit of cars going till tip of lake unlike Lukung.Keep portable oxygen, saridon with you if you are staying overnight, if visiting closer to winter months, opt for wooden cottages rather tents, else you might fell ill because of cold winds."
Pangong_Tso,dratultyagi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-21,It's a MUST visit place,"Stunning, Amazingly beautifulI have no words to describe beauty of Pangong TsoRoad to Pangong from Leh is poorly maintained and a patch if too bad to drive. But still it was worth driving."
Pangong_Tso,अvishek Lama,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Solo,Must Visit,Spangmik Village and Mann Village are the best places to stay if you are planning to visit Pangong Lake. These villages are little at a distance from the starting point of the lake. But the good thing about the stay is they are less crowded. You can enjoy a quiet evening with your closed ones and click amazing pictures at the lake.
Pangong_Tso,SavitaSinha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Friends,The most beautiful place in the world,"The first sighting of Pangong Tso from our vehicle was unbelievably beautiful. As we got closer, it was wonderful to see the changing colours of the clear water. Surrounded by surreal mountains this beautiful lake looks neverending. The long coast line ensures that you can always find an exclusive spot to enjoy the place in solitude. Be sure to wrap yourself up well as the wind is pretty chilly here. An absolute must to visit when in Ladakh. The only downside was the amount of accumulated garbage thrown by visitors at the parking lot. Such a shame to disrespect such a wonderful place."

Pangong_Tso,amit c,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-21,No words for this beauty,Its a must visit place for anyone visiting Ladakh. The best stay options are also not good enough but nevertheless its better to stay one night as day trip can be very hectic and it wont justify the time you can spend at this lake. We went near the lake twice during our 1 night stay.
Pangong_Tso,Rahul D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Couples,Pangong tso,"Beautiful serene as we all know, but nothing out of world. Chadratal and similar lakes at lesser heights are more beautiful to pangong. It’s much hyped but you will not regret visiting there. Try to have a small picnic there.."

Pangong_Tso,Shardul,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-21,Beautiful Blue Lake,"Very beautiful place. It has gained more attention after the movie 3 idiots but I am positively surprised that it hasn't become as touristy as I thought. It reminded me of Crater Lake in Oregon, USA but it's a lot bigger than Crater Lake. Additionally, it gives you a sense of being around Indian-Chinese border. We stayed nearby to enjoy Sunrise and Sunset"

Pangong_Tso,Destinoglobal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May-21,Good Camping Experience,Pangong Lake is not the easiest place to stay. It gets very cold by evening and one needs to be dressed in layers to combat the cold.  Advisable to stay in Wooden Cottages than in canvas tents.  The lake is worth visiting and is a wonderful backdrop for your pics.

Pangong_Tso,nadimpallii,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan-21,Surreal,We went to Pangong as soon as it opened in 2021 and man it was surreal.We had the whole frozen lake for ourselves for a few hours.We just got lucky i suppose.Had a lovely breakfast at durbuk with good company of cousins and group.A must visit ! if you are in ladakh.The lake is simply impossible to describe in words.
Pangong_Tso,Vivek,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-19,Amazing Scenery,"The drive to Pangong is beautiful, long and at some times trying (mainly the patch of 15 kms before and after Chang-la). The rest of the roads are in exceptional condition! Hats off to the Border Roads Organisation for the excellent efforts!The drive is long but in no way boring - beautifully hued mountains, yaks, frozen streams, marmots, kiang, ducks, the prized pashmina goats, horses and various other colourful himalyan birds give you company on the way! And the lake is nothing short of heaven - never seen so many shades of blue at one time! Its almost as if god's taken to the paintbrush with a blue pallette!Do stay overnight or two (if u can!). U will be able to see how the lake changes colours during the day depending on the position of the sun. There is a campsite - Camp Watermark which is there at the banks of the lake in the most idyllic settings and is actually quite good and well managed! The feeling of experiencing the sunset and sunrise at the lake is simply impossible to describe in words...Even though May is supposed to be early in the season and quite cold - we were very comfortable at night even with our 8 year old son. A pair of thermals with a heavy jacket is more than sufficient to keep you warm on the outdoors even after the sun sets. Don't make the mistake of attempting to stay overnight at Pangong without having spent atleast 5 nights in Leh. We had a good number of people suffering from altitude sickness at the campsite - a real pity when u can't enjoy the pristine surroundings. Trying to do the lake in a day trip just would not do justice to Pangong. Quite simply put we stayed there for a night but just didn't want to leave!!!Pangong is stunning, a treat to the senses and simply a must-do on your visit to Ladakh!"
Pangong_Tso,Kousik M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-19,Pangong the heaven on earth,"We visited Ladakh in October (10th to 17th) 2019 and went to Pangong from Nubra Valley on 13th October.  In October temporary stay options at Pangong gets closed, so we stayed at Tangtse ( Pangong Residency). We visited the lake in the afternoon with bright sunshine making the beauty of the lake awesome. Different colour of the water makes it heaven like feeling. We stayed for an hour or so and due to cold wind returned to Tangtse. The road from Tangtse to Pangong is also nice with wild horse seen frequently."

The light and sound show along with laser is a must visit.

Hall_of_Fame,Hadi1004,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Informational museum. Helpful soldiers.,"For non-locals, you have to pay 500 Indian rupees for entrance fee which also includes the light show there which only starts at 8pm (if I'm not wrong as we visited the museum in the afternoon). And pay another 20 Indian rupees to bring in your mobile phones. Need to pay by card, they don't accept cash. Fortunately our local driver was agreeable to use his card to pay. There are also guides provided who are veterans but unfortunately they don't provide English-speaking tours. Good thing that the informational boards (about the culture and history of ladakh, and past wars with china and Pakistan) and artefacts (e.g. captured items like guns and diaries from the other countries) inside the museum are written in English.We went on a Saturday and there were loads of people especially in one of their main indoor area. Abit worried since none were masked except for us. There is also an outdoor area which isn't much.Also, we have to commend the efforts from the young soldiers who tried to converse and explain the info to us in English even though English is not their strength. Overall an enjoyable and educational visit. "
Hall_of_Fame,ROOPshila’Shaggy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Proud patriotic well-labelled museum honouring our defence personnel.,"Gives one Goosebumps to witness the Defence gallantry! Ticket window closes for like much till 2:30PM , charges per head are 250 ₹. Earlier the same tickets could be used for Zorawar Fort within a week. Not any more . Also remember that too ekting charges are payable only by Card . Yes, an ex-service MA’M can be hired as a guide by a group of five for an extra 500. Another tip is to take the roun from the opposite direction , because every one rushes to the right side room & it becomes too congested there. For mobiles & cameras extra charge are levied. The washroom is clean in the far corner nd of the car parking . Also the Aroma Cafe is a good place to spend your waiting time ."

Gurdwara_Pathar_Sahib,Prasanna N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Where Devotion is Duty....,"The Indian army guards the frontiers of the nation which Cris crosses a Kaleidoscopic terrain. The threats faced by the soldiers who are on duty 24/7 are not limited to the hostile neighbours on either side of our boundaries. The inhospitable weather and treacherous terrain pose an equally mammoth peril to the safety and security of the troops. When the fight is against Mother Nature, impeccable training and superior equipments are not the sole means of facing the challenge. Divine intervention is also solicited in equal measure. The Pathar sahib Gurudwara is one such source of godly support.The Gurudwara is located astride NH 1 about 18 KMs from Leh city as we move  towards Kargil. The origins of the Gurudwara is associated with the encounters which Guru Nanak had  with a Demon during his return from a trip to Yarkand in Tibet around 1517 AD. The demon rolled down a boulder  which  transformed into a lump of molten wax as it hit the Guru resulting in his body frame getting etched in the boulder. The encounter ended with the demon shedding his barbaric ways and seeking the blessings of the Lord. The army in the late 1970's attempted to lay a road which ran right through this boulder. All attempts at shifting or blasting this boulder came to nought. Finally, the Lord presented himself in a dream to one of the officers and directed him to consecrate the boulder. Thus, the Pathar sahib Gurudwara came to be maintained by the Indian Army.A visit to this temple is akin to visiting any army unit. The cleanliness and orderliness is of an immaculate standard. As one enters the temple a small moat with perpetually flowing water cleanses our feet. Saffron colored headgears are offered to the visitors as covering the head is a compulsory practise in the Sikh culture. There is a Langar which offers delecious food between 11 AM and 2 PM while tea and snacks are offered all through the temple timing which is between 6 AM to 7 PM. What holds our attention is the stone plaques cemented in the walls of the temple and the portraits all of which have been gifted to the temple by the various army units which have had a tenure in Ladakh. It is their way of thanking the almighty for having protected them from the vagaries of nature and ill will of our enemies. The temple is  staffed by soldiers of the Units stationed in Ladakh. The management of the funds is entrusted to a select unit which is deployed in close vicinity to the temple.The motto  of Indian Army is ""Duty is Devotion"". In this holy site which is looked upon as the presiding deity of all army units in Ladakh ""Devotion is a form of soldierly Duty""."

Constructed and maintained by The Indian Army, Gurudwara Pathar Sahab is said to have been blessed by Guru Nanak Dev, the founder Guru of the Sikh faith. According to legend, the place was terrorised by wicked demon who used to live here. When Guru Nank Dev visited the place after heaering the prayers of local people, the demon tried to kill the Guru, when he was meditating, by rolling a huge boulder down the hill.

The people prayed to the Almighty for help. It is said that Guru Nanak heard their woes and came to their aid. He settled down on the bank of the river below the hill where the wicked demon lived. The Guru blessed the people with sermons and became popular in the area. The locals called him Nanak Lama. Seeing this the demon got into a rage and decided to kill Guru Nanak Dev. One morning when the Guru was sitting in meditation, the demon pushed a large path (boulder), down from the hilltop, with the intention of killing the Guru.  but when it touched the Guru's body, it softened like warm wax and came to a halt against Guru Nanak's back. Thinking that the Guru had been killed, the demon came down and was taken aback to see the Guru deep in meditation. Guru Sahib advised him to get rid of his wicked ways and asked him to lead the life of a noble person. This changed the life of the demon, who gave up evil deeds and started serving the people.Guru Nanak Dev thereafter continued his holy journey towards Srinagar via Kargil.e Pathar is on display at the ground level and a Holy Guru Granth Sahib is on a hilltop.

One can do rafting, boating or canoying, otherwise just sit there and enjoy the view. Given the footfall, facilities need to be improved.

While there are so many fascinating spots in this region that can catch the eye of the wanderlust, the river confluence of Zanskar and Indus is nothing short of a glimpse of heaven.The green-tinged Indus river originates in the Tibetan Plateau near the Manasarovar range, whereas the shiny blue Zanskar has its source in the Zanskar valley. Both the rivers kiss each other near the scenic Nimmu valley, that falls between Leh and Kargil.  The rivers are clearly distinguished by their colours and the confluence can be best viewed during the spring-summer months, from March to May."

Cannot get into the water, too dangerous. There is a small restaurant at this point - only Maggi was available when we visited.There are many attractions on the way to this place - The Hall of Fame museum, The Magnetic Hill, and a couple of other view points.

In the summer season, Zanskar is swollen and rapid, while Indus is comparatively calmer. In the winters, it is quite the opposite. Zanskar slows down, its flow is light and is completely frozen at a lot of places, enabling the legendary Chadar Trek. While Indus flows fast, with ice floating on it. Be it the summer or the winter season, the confluence of these two magnificent rivers is not a sight to be missed when you are in Ladakh.

This is a popular tourist place in Leh and mostly quite crowded also.The interesting part being that, in the Zanskar river you can do rafting during summer time and the same river freezes into a thick ice sheet named as Chadar in winter.

The Indus River takes the pride of being the longest river in the region. It originates within Tibet and flows through the entire Ladakh and further into a good part of our Western neighbour's territory before merging into Arabian Sea. Though we get to see the river's splendid beauty at various places in Ladakh , it is at Sangam that we get to flavour it in all its grandeur.The place is about 20 kms from the Leh airport on the road leading to Kargil. It is the point where the Zanskar River which flows from the Southern parts of Leh meets the Indus. A bird's eye view of the confluence can be seen from the NH 1. It is a sight to relish with two Rivers embracing  each other to form a giant Y shape. The ideal time to watch this scenic spectacle is in March -April bracket when the snow has just started melting. The Zanskar attains an emerald hue and the point of confluence looks like a giant canvas in the hands of a Divine artist. We can also get to the banks of the Indus River from where white water rafting is conducted on the Zanskar River. The best package would be a 28 kms rafting which costs about 2000 INR. Every bit of the rafting route drenches us in adventure and adrenaline rush. There are about 7 rapids. The  rafting commences from Chilling and the drive along the Zanskar River to Chilling is  an added bonus.  We can relish the beauty of Zanskar as we progress along this road. A change of clothes and Towel needs to be carried along for the rafting trip. "

Shanti_Stupa,robagdivad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-19,"3 days in Leh, Ladakh region","Our main suggestion: do not book anything in advance accept directly the accomodation that suits your needs. We stayed at Gomang Boutiqe Hotel, and this was a great choice. Once you arrive you will see how you feel ( high altitude) and depending on that you can plan your stay and the places of your interest direclty in the hotel or anywhere downtown ( plenty of opportunities) this will be surely the cheapest and most meaningful for your stay. We booked a package tour (quite expensive) at a tour agency ahead which turned out to be a mistake we made.On the first day you have to give yourself time to get used to the high altitude.We went in the afternoon to Santhi Stupa and the Leh palace. Both worth the visit! The second day we visited the meeting point of Indus and Zanskar river. This was amasingly beautiful. All the other programs booked and suggested by the touragent were not really interesting (war museum, a small sikh temple) so we were back in town 2 hours later. We asked the guide to take us to Hemis monastery (40 km to other direction -60-70 min drive) wich was very interesting.  For that day I would have suggested to go further the road after Zanskar-Indus meeting point to Lanayuru monastery (till the monastery it is3 hours drive).The third day we went up the Khardung La pass to 5600 m. We were back to our hotel in 4 hours, but you need some rest again after the high altitude. It would have been a nice program in the afternoon to visit either Thiksy or Hemis monastery.As a summary: if you plan to go to the Leh-Ladakh region don’t book a tour ahead. Choose a hotel and ask there for the permits to visit the passes, and book there a driver or anywhere in town."

It was already dark and already had a regret to have not been able to visit here during the day. A few steps to the stupa and the regrets to have come here just vanished. A sparkling 360 degree view of the city was a soothing experience to the eyes with the clear sky and stars. Now i call it a dual visit as the thought of how the city looked during the day kept hovering through my mind.  So just the day we were to leave we decided to head to the stupa and yes again it will leave you startled. the perfect view of the city, clear blue sky and the Khardungla pass at the back .. all of it was the cherry to the trip and time i had in Leh."

Shanti_Stupa,2013Deborah2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,just a first bite of all the beauty you will see during your trip,"arrived in Leh on Thursday morning, we decided to go up to Shanti stupa to see the view over there. You can reach the top climbing the stairs ( a lot of stairs),  or going by car/bike from another road.  We decided to climb the stairs...bad decision! Our fault, people told us to not practice physical activities on the day of the arrival, to allow our body to acclimatise to the altitude, but we thought was not going to be a problem for us. guess what? my friends got sick for the altitude and lack of Oxygen. So my tip is, once you arrive in Leh, spend at least one full day in total relax, read, drink a tea with friends, go around by car, but don't climb 500 stairs to reach the shanti stupa. take care of your body and follow the advises of the local people.  If you do that,  your trip will be the trip of your life. going back to shanti stupa, the view over there is nice and i suggest you to go and visit it, but reaching the stupa by car ( if you want to go on the first day of your arrival)."

Can be avoided.The dunes are also not that great as the repeated walk by camels on the same route has flattened them.The ATV ride nearby is much more scenic and enjoyable. You get to drive on the actual dunes. It's a long route and very picturesque. We personally enjoyed this a lot. It can be done singly with a helper which costs 1000 or 2 people together along with helper, which costs 1200.Second best activity after Pangong. Must do.."

Then second person will sit & camel will rise slowly. First it will straighten up its front leg, so you are bound to collapse backwards, then it will straighten up hind legs, so you may fall on camels first hump.

Beyond the leisure and monastic side of Ladakh, there are stunning silver sand dunes of Hunder in the Nubra Valley region. Like an oasis amidst the cold desert, Hunder Sand Dunes are beautiful beyond imagination. Located at an altitude of 4,000 meters, the desert is cut across by a gentle stream and the beautiful countryside. With such stunning landscapes against the backdrop of the snow-clad mountains, the Hunder Sand Dune looks nothing less than a fairy world. Beyond its beauty, the dunes are home to the Bactrian Camels, the major key players during the ancient silk route, and Pashmina Goats. You can also go on a safari on the Bactrian camel that will take you back to the time when trade was quite prominent in Central Asia, and to the remote village of Hunder."

Mountains on both sides, for as far as you can see and in the middle of it all, lies these sand dunes with double hump camels! Not only can you enjoy the view, you can also rent a ride on these camels, though I found it a bit expensive at Rs.1000 per ride. There is also a beautiful steam running through the valley which adds the cherry on top of it and makes for a beautiful picnic site. There is also one canteen in this park with seating area where one can satisfy their hunger pangs. Prices are very economical."

Although we were driven to this place to ride on the two-humped Bactrian camels, the area itself makes for a good evening walk. There is a good stretch of grassland, and a nice stream with clear water that flows by - one can dip knee high into this and the water was not very cold. Just a short walk through the grasslands brings one to Sand dunes that are very much desert terrain. This terrain goes for a fair distance upto the mountains. And since this entire area is in a valley, the surrounding mountains make for good viewing. We werent too keen to ride the camels, but it seemed like a crowd puller. There is a cafe as well for a nice cup of tea and some eats. It was also nice to note that trash bins were kept at reasonable distance of each other in this area to encourage tourists to keep the place clean.Of the few places to see in the Nubra Valley, this is a definite recommend, particularly for a nice evening stroll."

Its face is covered and uncovered only once in a year during the festival time. The Spituk Gompa was founded in 11th century by Od-De, the elder brother of Lha Lama Changchub-od. The Gompa was named Spituk (exemplary) by Rinchen Zangpo, a translator came to that place and said that exemplary religious community would rise. Initially the Gompa was run according to the Kadampa school then during the reign of king Gragspa Bumide he converted it to Gayluk Pa order. Many icons of Buddha and 5 thangkas can be visited in this 15th century monastery. The Dukhang Hall is the largest building and has two rows of seats running the length of the walls to a throne at the far end. Sculptures and miniature chortens are displayed on the altar. There is also a collection of ancient masks, antique arms and fine thangkas. Higher up the hill is the Mahakal Temple, containing the shrine of Vajrabhairava.

From the parking lot, one has to climb a flight of steep steps to reach the top where the Gompa is located and this can be difficult for senior citizens. We saw a giant prayer wheel on our way up. Inside the Gompa, a monk was beating a drum and chanting prayers. Apart from Buddha idol, we saw different idols of Kali Mata though the face of the goddess was covered. Locals often refer to this place as Kali Mata Mandir. Devotees have offered tetra pack fruit juice, Mazza, Coca-Cola, Oil bottles to the goddess which was quite an unique sight for us. Beautiful view of the mountains and the river flowing down the lush green valley was just mesmerizing and makes the climb worth it.

Spituk_Monastery,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Great Views,"A multi-level monastery that offers breathtaking views at every bend, the 14th century Spituk Gompa is one of the prominent monasteries of the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Spituk Gompa contains both old temples and those built in the 1970s. Ancient thankas (traditional wall hangings) are preserved here, some having been taken from the Potala Palace and Lhasa after the Chinese invasion.We were confused when the locals referred to the Gompa as Kali Mata Mandir. Actually the largest temple in the monastery, standing above the other temples near the crest of the rocks is the Gonkhang. Although another name for this temple is Kali Mata, the temple is not dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, but rather to Mahakala, the fiercest Buddhist guardian divinity.The Gompa has several statues and paintings. The views of the surroundings including that of Leh Airport is marvellous. You can drive upto a certain point. There is parking space. A lot of climbing through stairs is needed to explore the place. But the experience is worth it."

The temple itself is at the top of the hill (more great views) and is made up of three small rooms. The one on the right is full of burning oil lamps and the final room has a series of large brightly coloured statues, but the main central room was my favourite as it was far more atmospheric than many larger places we visited.

Multiple mud-brick buildings tumble merrily down a steep hillock towards Spituk village on the Indus riverbank. The prayer hall contains yellow statue of  Buddha which is made up of copper as per the local people's tale. The steps going to the monastery are quite raw form and it seems the entire place is not maintain properly by the concerning people.

There's a sign that said photos of the military area is strictly prohibited but I find that really hard to comply if one were to take photos of Leh from there. The monastery offers 360 degrees of view which were enjoyable. The distance from Leh makes it a must visit and can be done it less than an hour."

Leh_Royal_Palace,Aimless Vagabonds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,A must visit attraction for history and culture buffs! Look out for the stairs,This was the main establishment of the Namgyal kings and is a no miss for history and culture buffs! The palace however has 7-9 floors which are connected by narrow and squeaky wooden stairs. This could be a problem for someone with breathing problem or knee problems. Also parking could be a hassle here as the narrow road leading to the Palace are lined by tourist cabs.

There are a total of nine floors, the last floor closed to public.  Most of the artefacts are not on display, as there is construction work going on.  The roofs are low, and there are benches on every floor to take rest.  A great place to visit to feel how the royalty lived in the palace some five hundred years ago.  A must visit."

Leh_Royal_Palace,Debabrata G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,Good place well maintained,We were at the Leh palace today for a visit. The motorable road goes all the way up to the entrance. You need a ticket to enter. There are 4 more levels once you have entered. The view from the levels is amazing. I would not say that the inside of the palace rooms was very impressive - mostly modern artefacts. But it is worth looking at the architecture of the building and understanding the logic of how this was built.
Leh_Royal_Palace,Redfred320,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun-22,Well worth the 20-30 minute hike uphill from the pedestrianised market area,"By starting in the corner of the L-shaped pedestrianised market area, you can follow your nose (in some ways by the smell!) through the winding alleys of an older part of town up to the palace that you can easily see above you. It takes about 20-30 minutes and assumes you are altitude acclimatised. Although none of the original interior artefacts survive, there is an interesting exhibition of the best heritage sites across  India, and the Buddhist shrine within is well worth taking off your shoes to go inside.  Best of all are the views from the top of the palace across Ladakh, and the plain and mountains beyond. There appears to be an entry fee to visit but when we went all the offices were closed so we entered for free. Worth a short hike to visit one of the main attractions of Leh."

Leh_Royal_Palace,Tannu D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-19,leh palace,"Leh Palace is a former royal palace overlooking the town of Leh, Ladakh, in the Indian Himalayas. The palace was constructed circa 1600 by Sengge Namgyal. It is nine storeys high; the upper floors accommodated the royal family, while the lower floors held stables and store rooms. Much of the palace is in deteriorated condition, and little survives of its interior decorations.The Palace Museum holds a rich collection of jewellery, ornaments, ceremonial dresses and crowns. Chinese thangka or paintings, which are more than 450 years old, with intricate designs still retain the bright colours derived from crushed and powdered gems and stones. Stuctures around the palace's base include the prominent Namgyal Stupa, the colourfully muralled Chandazik Gompa and the 1430 Chamba Lhakhang, with medieval mural fragments located between the inner and outer walls.The palace is being restored by the Archaeological Survey of India."

Leh_Royal_Palace,Piainindia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-19,Worth it for the stunning views from the open terraces,"This was our fourth visit to Leh and we finally decided to visit the Leh Palace. Well, we kind of tripped onto it ... we were trying to find our way to the Museum and somehow got onto the track leading up to the Palace. By the time we realised where we were headed, we just carried on up, higher, and higher and higher.We would stop every now and again to regain our breath and were struck by how the view changed each time. The Palace charges Rs. 25/- for Indians and Rs. 300/- for foreigners. Wish this discrimination would stop and everyone would be charged the same amount.There are 9 levels and narrow stairwells going up. The highlights of the Palace are the open terraces where, once atop the 8th level (you're not allowed up on the 9th level for some reason), you get the feeling if you reach out far enough, you might touch the sky. It could be fascinating at night!On one of the levels, there was a room with a sign saying, ""Toilet"". It's a 'den' with lots of sand covering the floor and you just 'do your job' (and probably cover it up with some sand?). Only thing is, have someone stand outside the door to keep it ajar so the sunlight can filter in.We enjoyed the walk back down the main road to the village/Leh city.Would we do it again? Nope, once was good enough for all the experiences had :-)"

Decorated wooden beams and pillars. Windows adorned with intricate wood carving. One gets a birds eye view of city of Leh. So far so good. Coming to maintenance; its really shocking that one of UNESCO world heritage sites is mainained so poorly. No electricity, no guides, not much of descriptions. In absence of electricity major part of the palace is plunged in darkness. Most of the photographs cannot be seen due to darkness.

But if you are visiting the palace I have a suggestion for you. Walk to the Palace from the market. Ask anyone and they will mostly point towards a narrow passage and ask you to keep going that way to reach. And trust me figuring out your way through that is an amazing experience by itself. 😊

Leh_Royal_Palace,Kat T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Cute but come prepared,"This is the main attraction in the town of Leh itself. Getting up to the palace door requires going uphill by around a long detour. A road (and taxis) lead up to it until about 50 meters outside the gate, then the road ends and you have to walk across a bridge. Tickets (about 300 rupees per foreigner) are sold at a small window on the side of the footpath. Once inside, the property itself is partially restored (mostly the front-facing side, where the windows looking out to town are) but some areas are derelict. Mind your head as you go up & down the stairs. Best view is at the 7th and 8th floor, looking back out into town from top of this palace. No toilet on (or near) premises, except for a hole in the wall (about 3rd floor) -- no running water either. Call it an authentic experience. The pillars & wall ornamentation (restored), the old photo display (about 5th floor), the view into town are all truly stunning though -- particularly if you compare with Tibet and Sikkim, etc. There is a small ""monastery"" (really, it's a temple hall) on the 4th floor with magnificent statues."

There are 8 levels and some steps are wooden and quite challenging to get up and down with. Getting to each level is worth it for the views of Leh.

Leh_Royal_Palace,mark10r,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-18,Good way to experience Leh history.,A walk up the hill to the well restored OLD palace via steps on the edge of old Leh is agree at way to build your readiness for trekking but take your time and visit early in the morning to avoid the heat and take water. Only a section of the palace is open but make sure you visit the temple room inside with its classic masks.  If you are feeling energetic and keep going up further the temple further up is beautiful and gives you stunning views over the Indus Valley. Again slowly slowly but the effort is worth every step.

The Leh Palace is also one of the tallest buildings of its time with nine stories in all.Leh Palace has now been turned into ruins due to the Kashmiri invasion that took place in the 19th century.The leh palace entry ticket is 25 rs per person but nothing special to see there. The tracking took around 2 hours too and fro but from the top the view was awesome and cannot be explained in words. You can see entire leh from top, also you can see shanti stupa which is far from there."

As you are aware that Leh is located at high altitude which lead Acute Mountain Sickness. Be careful about it and it may hit you as soon as you land to Leh Airport. Please keep one thing in mind that Leh Airport is Air Base also so please don't click any photo there and same time stop others to doing same. If you feel some vomiting sensation or dizziness then don't hesitate to tell your trip partner or local people and ask them to take you to hospital. It is very common for high altitude place where oxygen level is very low due bare land (no trees) or few plantation location. Let's talk about Namgyal Tsemo Gompa. Namgyal Tsemo Gompa is located near Leh Palace. You can spend easily there upto half an hour to tkae better pictures otherside of Leh City.  It has higher height as compared to Leh palace. There is a entry fee ( ~ INR 20/-) for visiting this place which is very less as compared to other places. You can take camera without any additional fee. You can club this visit with Leh Palace.Best time to visit this place is around sunset or sunrice time. so that you can take nice sunset/sunrice views pictures.

Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,918John,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,My symbol of Leh,"Perched on a hill dominating Leh, this Gompa for me is the iconic symbol of Leh. It is visible from all directions and makes a great impact. I never tire of looking at it and is so striking at all times of the day. It is easily accessible by taxi from the Main Market. It is possible to walk to it through the Old Town, but the approach is steep and slippery because of the loose stones. It is wise to take it slowly and use a walking stick. Alternatively, go by taxi and walk down the hill to Chubi, making your way back to the Main Market. In the Prayer room is a huge statue of the Buddha. Usually it is open during the morning but not necessarily each day. Before visiting Tsemo Gompa, I usually buy a string of Prayer Flags in the market and them with the many other strings of flags as an act of reverence for the site, remembrance of family and friends, and a wish for peace and love for the world. It is worth while sitting quietly for some moments enjoying the view and the silence. It is a magical place."

You can reach it by private taxi via a blacktop road. Or, if you do not mind the climb, start to walk up a winding track which starts near the Namgyal Palace.It is one of the high points in and around Leh from where you can have an excellent view over the city, and towards Zanskar Mountain Range. Sometimes you will find other visitors, sometimes no one. Try to get there when the monk in charge fulfills his duties, so that you can visit the rooms, too."

Once you reach the top buy a ticket and enter. Shanti Stupa is clearly visible from top. There is Climb the small wooden ladder which takes you to the absolute top of Tsemo Gompa and you'll experience a nice panoramic view of Leh. Worth going for an hour and relax.
Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Jason,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Solo,Beautiful Namgyal Tsemo,Situated high above Leh Namgyal Monastery is well worth the trek.  You can walk to the monastery from Leh Palace up a winding track.  I took the route of walking up to the right of the Monastery to visit the prayer flags from where you get a fantastic view though the climb is not too easy. Also if you visit Shanti Stupa in the late afternoon and the weather conditions are good you will get a fantastic view of Namgyal Tsemo in the evening light.
Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,interstellar1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Friends,Excellent panoramic view of entire leh city.,"This monastery is the highest point one can go in the leh city to have the bird eye's view of the city. One can reach here after a round about journey covering a small portion of khardung la pass road. We also saw trekkers climbing upto this height also from the city, but i personally won't advice anyone for this trek until you are thoroughly acclimatized in leh.I found this place more fascinating than shanti stupa in term of views it offers. We also spotted a high altitude bird ""black billed magpie"" on the hills of this monastery.This is by far the best place to have nice snaps in leh city and a perfect spot for sunset."

Such genneroua offers may cost you nothing but means a lot to them - maybe a packet or two of biscuits, snacks items , bottle of water etc which otherwise would not be needed by you once you reach your destination ..A beautiful drive and an unimaginable scenic place to see .... The roads on either side has been kept in excellent condition by our BRO Team and their workforce .. It's a great place but usually travellers skip it only because on the way to Leh - travellers are anticipating more to reach Leh ASAP and evade acclamatizarion issues . While travelling from Leh towards Manali- they are in hurry to cover up the lap to reach their destination ASAP ... "

Tanglang_La,Izz Shariff,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,Passing through all the pass,"I think ladakh need to come out with a stamp or passport book so that you can remember how many pass that you pass through throughout the journey. I can say, most of the peak are alike, but no harm to stop and snap a photo. Really enjoy my journey in Kashmir (srinagar and ladakh). Spectacular view."
Tanglang_La,Ashish Dugar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Best riding experience amongst the high passes of Leh/Ladakh,"Taglangla undoubtedly has the best roads if you want to compare khardungla, changla, baralacha, nakeela, etc etc. Hence, the ride comfort is much much better in comparison. No compromise on the view and nature that you can see around.However, do not plan to stay to long at the peak (5-10 mins max), due to air pressure and lack of oxygen. I personally experienced more breathlessness at taglangla in comparison with khardungla, even though, khardungla is marginally higher altitude."

Road from Here on till Leh was awesome!!  I am glad that I was able to reach Leh well on time as there was a time when I was thinking that we will have to halt some where on the way but it was because of desire to see and cross Thanlangla during day light made me concentrate and I kept going!! But do carry Oxygen,  even the fittest of you can start feeling dizzy and showing signs of AMS!!

Even if one doesn't go to Tso Moriri or Tso Kar, it is worth going to this pass. Excellent view through the road journey, photo ops from the hairpin bends and a cup of hot coffee in one of the three parachute restaurants once on the top, is an experience that one needs to do while in Leh.

With temperature of around 0 degrees, it was very difficult to be at this pass. We could hardly stay for 8-10 photos before we got into the car again :)Since we came from Manali, we saw Rohtang pass as well.

It is a windy and cold place with the usual temple and pennants that are a part of every pass. The roads are very well maintained but the place is usually deserted as people only stop there for a photo-op on the way or while returning from Leh. Excellent all round view and a deep sense of achievement lingers after you cross. Take some time to stop and appreciate the efforts that go into maintaining the place."

Twice by road from Manali side & ending at Srinagar. The highest  motorable  Pass from both side is TANGLANG LA about 375 kms from Manali & 115 kms from Leh. Immense beauty Of Grater Himalayan rivers,mountain peaks,glaciers, lakes,amazing creations of nature can be seen & all this make you addicted.I was lucky to cross this mighty pass TANGLANG LA (+5300 meters) 3rd time while I was coming back from Tsomoriri, Kyagar tso via Tsokar traversing Rupsu plateau. So i can boost that I have seen almost entire beauty of Ladakh. At Tanglang La for any breathing problem army medical facility is available.One should avoid moving fast on all such passes.I will advise all the traveler & nature lovers to visit Ladakh by road at least once but with strong will power & proper acclimatization .Minimum +15 days are needed for this memorable visit."

Magnetic_Hill,arvind1000,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Worth stopping for shortwhile if anyway in the vicinity but not a stand-alone attraction ,"Magnetic Hill is a ""Cyclops hill"" located near Leh in Ladakh, slightly beyond Pathak Sahib Gurudwara but before Nimu. The layout of the area and surrounding slopes create the appearance of a hill. The hill road is actually a downhill road. Objects and cars on the hill road may appear to roll uphill in defiance of gravity when they are, in fact, rolling downhill."
Magnetic_Hill,AnujaMangle,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,Optical illusion experience,"Well this is one of the unusual sight I have ever noticed. The reason behind such a name is its property to take a static car up the hill. It is also said the aircraft travelling on top also increases its altitude when passing from this point. Initially we felt it is some kind of magic, however after talking to few locals we figured that it is due to its optical illusion which makes the car looks going upwards."

There is a mark on the road where the vehicle run towards uphill without engine power. There are some theories behind this mystery. Some explained hills around this area have magnetic interference that's why vehicles run automatically. Another theory is about the optical illusion that means actually vehicles run towards downhill but we see uphill. Isn't it amazing? But local people believe that once there was a gateway to haven. It was a great experience. It is a popular tourist spot in Ladakh. Now ATV ride is available here and there is a cafe for tourist.

Prayer_Wheel,smlec,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Potentially fast purification...,"If you are Buddhist, then any chance to spin a string of beautiful prayer wheels can be a blessing.  For those who are new to the Buddhist tradition, prayer wheels contain hundreds and sometimes thousands of blessed ""Mani""-prayers, printed on paper kept within the wheel, itself.  For every clockwise rotation of a prayer wheel, then, the world receives hundreds or thousands of  ""Mani-Prayers"" or 6-syllable mantra--Om Mani Peme Hung.  According to the 14th Dalai Lama, purposeful recitation of this simple prayer can purify our actions, speech, and thoughts when we seek to build and integrate altruism with wisdom.  When spinning a prayer wheel, one can recite this mantra or simply hope that all sentient beings be happy. To actually spin a large prayer wheel, such as the line of those at Leh's Fort Road, use the handles underneath the wheel to spin it clockwise (as if looking from above).  If a prayer wheel is already spinning upon your arrival, you can try to increase its spin with proper timing by using the lower handles, though it is common to simply put your palm towards the wheel and go on to the next one.  Of course, it is best to not stop a wheel that is already spinning.  "

Prayer_Wheel,faziy m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov-16,P W,"A prayer wheel is a cylindrical wheel (Tibetan: འཁོར་, Wylie: 'khor) on a spindle made from metal, wood, stone, leather or coarse cotton. Traditionally, the mantra Om Mani Padme Hum is written in Sanskrit on the outside of the wheel. Also sometimes depicted are Dakinis, Protectors and very often the 8 auspicious symbols Ashtamangala. At the core of the cylinder is a ""Life Tree"" often made of wood or metal with certain mantras written on or wrapped around it. Many thousands (or in the case of larger prayer wheels, millions) of mantras are then wrapped around this life tree. The Mantra Om Mani Padme Hum is most commonly used, but other mantras may be used as well. According to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition based on the lineage texts regarding prayer wheels, spinning such a wheel will have much the same meritorious effect as orally reciting the prayers."

This is also where the snow leopard roams in dead winter but vanishes into the heights with the onset of summer and tourists.Anyway, as is well known, he is an elusive, almost invisible beast! You can drive in up to a point to enjoy the sanctuary which is not what you normally expect a sanctuary to be considering the inhospitable nature of the region's topography. The rest of the park is for those who are physically and mentally equipped to trek through it. Except for remote villages there is absolutely no other habitation in the park, which is a good thing. "
Hemis_National_Park,667marians,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,"Markha Valley, independent trekking","We did this trek starting from Jingchan, thus the trek comprised passing of two high passes: Kanda La (4973 m) and Kongmaru La (5287 m). Not many trekkers do it independently, most of tourists hire at least a guide, and majority prefer “sahib” trekking, which means that all gear is carried by a caravan of donkeys and mules. Still, this trek can be done fully independently and actually you have not to be very fit to complete this amazing route. In every village there are several homestays where accommodation and meals are available. So, it is not necessary to take tents and food. The only exception is water, and it is a good idea to have sterilization drops to sterilize refilled water and not to buy new bottles, which is not good for the environment. The cost of room and meals (this includes dinner, breakfast and packed lunch) in 2016 was 1000 rupees/person. This price was the same in every village, except for tents in Nimaling, where it was 1200 rupees/pp. Here is our itinerary, with modifications to the routine schedules offered by travel agencies, and some tips and tricks. We did this trek in the beginning of September are there were only a few tourists on the entire route. In high season (July-August) there are probably more tourists and a possible shortage of homestays.Acclimatization in Leh before the trekUsually, it is recommended to stay in Leh at least 3 days before starting the trek. This is because Leh is situated at the altitude of 3,500 m, which carries a high risk of altitude mountain sickness (AMS), and this risk is even higher if you start ascending when not properly acclimatized. Thus, these 3 days of rest are recommended. Still, most travel agencies on the 1st day of the trek take tourists from Leh (3500 m) up to Yurutse (4150 m), or even to Kanda La base camp (4450 m). This seems to be too fast ascent, and indeed you can find many reports by people complaining of AMS symptoms at such an itinerary. Our plan was to shorten acclimatization in Leh to 2 days, but to add one day of trekking at a lower altitude before crossing Kanda La pass.Acclimatization Day 1If you arrive to Leh by air you will be immediately hit by thin air and low oxygen concentration. It is better to do almost nothing at this first day, as even going upstairs can be a big challenge. All planes land in Leh in the morning, so you will have full day to relax. After half day of  rest we had a short (and slow!) walk in the afternoon.Acclimatization Day 2It is a good opportunity to check your acclimatization. There are several opportunities of a short trips within Leh city. One is to visit Leh Palace and then Namgyal monastery. The monastery is about 300 m above Leh, thus it is a good acclimatization trip and because of the visiting, you will not ascend too fast. Then, in the other part of Leh, there is a picturesque Shanti Stupa, at a similar altitude as Namgyal monastery. Also, you can visit the town, do the shopping, buy or rent trekking equipment. It is a good idea to arrange transportation for the next day, it can be done by hotel staff (taxi prices are fixed, so it does not matter who arranges the car; bargaining is not an issue in this part of India).Trekking Day 1. Jingchan-Rumbak (altitude: 3850 m)You can start your trek if you are somewhat acclimatized. If you still feel weak, suffer from headache or other mild symptoms of AMS, you should stay in Leh for another day (or even descent to another location downstream the Indus valley). Jingchan-Rumbak trek is quite short, so it is not needed to take a taxi early in the morning. I would recommend taking the taxi directly to Jingchan. A cheaper option is to take a bus to Spituk and then walk to Jingchan. Still, it would be a boring walk on a tarmac through a desert in full sun. The trek to Rumbak should not be difficult. The altitude gain is about 400 m, and even if you walk very slowly it should take 3-4 hours including rests. The proper path is usually obvious, yet in some areas there is more than 1 path (in a case of doubt follow the boot tracks or the freshest donkey poos). After several kilometers there is a parachute “restaurant”, where you can have some tea or instant soup. There is a bifurcation of the treks at this parachute restaurant. The path to the right goes towards Yurutse and most of trekkers follow this trail. Instead, we went to the left towards Rumbak village, situated at a lower altitude than Yurutse. There should not be a problem with finding a homestay in Rumbak, since not many tourists come here. Trekking Day 2. Rumbak-Yurutse (altitude: 4150 m)Also a short and easy day, about 2-3 hours maximally. There is only one house in Yurutse. Since there are only a few rooms available in Yurutse, it is better to start the trek early and arrive to Yurutse before the arrival of organized tourists, who start their trek from Jingchan. It is very easy to find the route. Firstly you backtrack your yesterday trek up to the parachute restaurant at the bifurcation (again a good opportunity to have a nice cup of tea), and then you should follow the obvious path towards Yurutse. The only problem is crossing a small stream just after the restaurant. In September it was not necessary to remove shoes, yet in July and August there can be more water and fording may be inevitable. In the afternoon it is possible to have an acclimatization trip to the Kanda La base camp. There is a parachute restaurant here and it is possible to have a cup of tea before returning to Yurutse.Trekking Day 3. Yurutse - Kanda La (altitude: 4973 m) - Shingo (altitude: 4130 m)This is probably the most difficult day. Although Kanda La is lower than Kongmaru La, but altitude gain is higher. The other problem on day 3 is that you should take quite a lot of water, since it is not available above Kanda La base camp (half an hour from Yurutse) until Shingo village; 3 liters per person is a must. A heave gear and low oxygen concentration are not good combination. The trekkers from organized groups carry only a small backpack, while the remaining things are carried by mules. It is possible to hire some mules in Yurutse to carry your backpacks to Kanda La, and we met some independent tourist who did it. There is a lot of wildlife in the area of Kanda Laː marmots, blue sheep, Himalaya hares, and eagles - just look around you. Descent from Kanda La is quite easy and there should not be a problem with finding the way. There are 3 homestays in Shingo (we stayed at Khangpa-pa homestay, with hot shower possible). Some guidebooks suggest further descent up to Skyu, but it would be at least 3 hours of trekking (possibly more, taking into account that you will be tired after crossing Kanda La).Trekking Day 4. Shingo - Skyu (altitude: 3400 m)Easy day, 3-4 hours of trekking. A descent though colorful canyon to the Markha valley, with obvious path and no river fordings. In Skyu there is a nice small monastery and ruins of a royal palace.If you do not want to have a relax day, it is possible to walk towards Markha village. There is a homestay in Sara, about 10 km from Skyu. In high season it is also possible to stay in a tented homestay, which is a few km before Sara. Both options would shorten a long walk from Skyu to Markha (still, in high season there may be a shortage of beds).  Trekking Day 5. Skyu  - Markha (altitude: 3800 m)It is a long day of trekking in a nearly flat terrain, more than 20 km, and at least 8 hours (usually more) of walking. The route goes along Markha river and it crosses the river several times. In September it was not necessary to ford the river, but in the summer, when more water comes from melting glaciers, be prepared for many fordings. Usually it is not difficult to find the proper path. However, Markha valley is built of loose sedimentation rocks that are constantly and quite fast carved by the river. All trails that are situated at the slopes above Markha river are doomed to be destroyed by erosion (in a years and not centuries perspective). You should not use a path hanging above the river without fresh boot tracks on such a path, since it could be a dangerous trap. Also, many details of the trek depicted in the guidebooks are no longer valid because of changing terrain.In Markha, the biggest village in the valley, there are about 20 homestays, so there should not be a problem with accommodation. If you have enough time, it is possible to visit local monastery.Trekking Day 6. Markha - Hankar (altitude: 4000 m)This day you will continue ascent along Markha river. Unless the locals are building a bridge across Markha river, there will be at least one fording. Look where other people cross the river, and if nobody is seen – you should use the widest section of the river (not the narrowest one, since wider part of the river will be shallower, and the water will flow not so fast). Use trekking polls for security. About 5 km after Markha village there is Umlung village with several homestays and a parachute restaurant. Before Umlung village you will see a monastery unbelievable built on a high rock (worth visiting if time allows). In Hankar there are some homestays in the lower part of the village, and another homestay in the upper part of the village, with a nice view at Kang Yatze – the highest peak in this area (6400 m). Trekking Day 7. Hankar – Nimaling (altitude: 4850 m)Difficult day, about 12 km and 850 m of altitude gain, but with superb views and a lot of wildlife along the trek. First few kilometers involve navigating along Markha stream, with a possibility of some fordings (depending on water level and status of the path hanging above the stream). Some 2 km after upper Hankar the valley divides: to the left goes a proper trek to Nimaling, to the right the trek via uninhabited Langtang valley.In high season there should be a parachute restaurant ata  campsite of Thachungtse (in September it was closed). Still, it is a good idea to have a rest in Thachungtse (4250 m) before the steep climbing begins. There are a lot of picas (a smaller version of marmot) in this area, playing on the rocks.After a steep ascent you will finally arrive to small lake at the altitude of 4700 m. If you climb a few meters above this lake you would encounter other lakes, and a view towards Kang Yatze is simply breathtaking. After several more kilometers of walking among picas and marmots you will reach Nimaling. Here there is a tented restaurant and a lot of tents to stay in. Accommodation in Nimaling is slightly more expensive compared to other villages; in 2017 it was 1200 rupees per person, meals inclusive. Nimaling is perhaps the only place where having a sleeping bag is a good idea, since it can be really very cold and windy at night (the tents are provided with blankets, as other homestays are, but the place is really cold).If the weather is good and you are not in rush (and not frozen after the night) it is possible to stay in the area for one or two days. Local trips may involve a walk to Kang Yatze base camp (5100 m) or even ascending the slope above Nimaling (6000 m; no rock or ice climbing needed to get to such a high altitude).Trekking Day 8. Nimaling – Kongmaru La (altitude: 5200 m) – Chokdo (altitude: 3850m)A long day. Although Kongmaru La is the highest point of the trek, there should not be a problem with trekking to the pass, which is almost 400 m above Nimaling. You should cross the stream and the route to the pass is obvious. As you will ascent, the views toward Kang Yatze and neighbor 6000+ m peaks, and also distant Zanskar Range are fantastic. Also, there are plenty of fearless picas and marmots (except for the moments when an eagle approaches and tries to catch something for lunch). After a short break at Kongmaru La and obligatory breathtaking vistas, there will be a long descent through beautiful colorful canyons. The descent is similar to the trek from Shingo to Skyu (Day 4), still it is much longer. Finally there will be a parachute restaurant in Chuskyumo and a few kilometers further down homestays in Chokdo. If it is not late and you are not very tired, it is possible to proceed to Shang Sumdo village and return to Leh by taxi the same day (see Day 9)Trekking Day 9. Chokdo – Shang Sumdo (altitude: 3800m)An easy 2 h walk downhill. Once you approach the village you will see some taxis waiting for tourists (it the guidebooks you can find descriptions of Markha trek ending in Hemis, but currently the road begins in Shang Sumdo and probably it won’t be very interesting to walk among cars). Yet, it may be a good idea to have a break in Hemis and visit its famous monastery, just ask the taxi driver for a possibility."

The starting point is around 25 kms from Leh town and will take around 75 mins. The road to park is amazing views of the valley and really a very adventurous road. Hardly any traffic throughout the road journey.At the starting point of the trek , it is barricaded and chained and no vehicle can go beyond the starting point. It is around 8 kms to the Hemis National park and will take 3 hours to reach the Park and half the time to return.Initial around 2.5 kms of the trek is a decent mud road and rest all is typical trekking path .Throughout the trek, U will get wonderful views of the mountains and water streams.You are sure to meet many fellow trekkers , few of them from overseas.

For a start, it was an unforgettable experience and will forever remain so !The harshest winter months begin towards the end of December and continue for over 45 days, so there we were in Mid Jan, the warmer temperatures being around (minus )- 10 deg cel and peaking to ( minus)- 25 deg cel at night ! And we were in tents camping by the side of the frozen River Indus !The terrain is mountainous. altitudes range from 11500 feet at Leh and nearly 14000 feet at Rumbak.Moderate to Good Physical fitness is needed as well as an adequate amount of preparation by reading up on AMS ( Altitude Mountain Sickness ), Sub Zero Temperature Outdoor Living, Suitable Clothing and Gear for such climate, etc. The more prepared you are, the easier it is to adjust.Diamox ( Acetalozomide ) tablets are advisable under doctor supervision, of course. makes it easier to acclimatise, we feel, although it does have its own side effects...decathlon india bangalore outlets provided us with sufficient options to shop for suitable clothing and other gear.Do not even think of trying to adjust with clothes you may already have or jackets you may already be using !! It is a completely different world out there and your clothes and gear are important enough that they may even be termed ' life saving '.So, no compromise, if it is expensive, then so be it, after all , you only live once, and surely you would want to get back in one living piece, isn't it ? ! :)Snow leopard sighting was the icing on the cake for us, but there were many other beautiful species which we enjoyed viewing in their natural habitat ! The landscapes are breathtaking ! The rivers are frozen solid, even the waterfalls are iced ! The most beautiful people of Leh-Ladakh will forever be etched in our hearts and memories !"
Hemis_National_Park,Tomeslice,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Friends,AMAZING(ly cold) Park and Nature Reserve,"BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO SPOT THE ENIGMATIC SNOW LEOPARD. What else needs to be said?Oh, the fact that there are numerous other observable species of mammals and birds (we saw snow leopards, stone martens, himalayan weasels, blue sheep, wolves, red foxes, two species of pikas, woolly hares, lammergeiers, golden eagles, himalayan griffons and others, for starters).Seeing the wildlife is made possible only with certified companies (we used Exotic Travel in Ladakh led by Phunchok Tsering) and local spotters. They spend HOURS UPON HOURS scanning the gargantuan mountains for wildlife, particularly for snow leopards.We were there in October, but the prime wildlife season is closer to the middle of the winter, namely February. Keep in mind that mots of the time you're CAMPING in the park, so bring HOT clothes, coats, layers of clothing, thermal underwear, thermal sleeping bags, gloves, scarves and equally importantly - binoculars and/or scopes and a GOOD camera if you want to capture anything, as most of the animals and birds are found very far from you.You will be very very cold most of the times and there are no regular bathrooms, but out houses and your cooks will sometimes give you hot water to wash your face and hair at your request. Only recommended for EXTREME ADVENTURE seekers. To maximize chances of snow leopards stay at least 7 days.TIP - Eurasian Lynx - one of the rarest cats (perhaps equally as difficult to spot as the leopard if not more) can be seen with somewhat reliable chances if you spend a few days around Kandala campsite which is around 4500m on the way towards Kandala pass. There are actually 2 campsites within a kilometer of each other - the higher one is supposedly better for the lynx. We were there for a day and a half but didn't luck out on the lynx."
Hemis_National_Park,damvilram,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Solo,Spot snow leopards,"Hemis reserve has the maximum concentration of snow leopards that one can see in India. Winter especially December to February is probably best for sighting this rare species as they come down from higher altitudes in search of their prey, the blue sheep. The landscape is one white sheet with frozen rivulets that one has to criss cross inside the reserve. Hemis national park is about 30 Kms from Leh and one has to get permits for entry ( which is pretty cheap at Rs. 20). I went through WWF India for the trek but there are private operators who arrange for the snow leopard trail. The camp is as basic as can be with tents. As can be expected, there is no power or telephone which is bliss! Toilets are the Ladakhi type which is dry . Bundle up with enough down jackets and protective gear to manage extremely cold and snowy conditions with temperatures touching minus 15-18 degrees Celsius. One great adventure in winter that one should not miss."

En route one crosses Rangdum and the Penzi La high altitude mountain-pass. Padum in the Zanskar valley is the final halt and the place gives ample peace of mind and a wonderful view of the Zanskar range of the Indian Himalayas. Hotels are few in the Zanskar as the place is still not preferred by Indian tourists owing to its remote location.

Chose this trek wisely since the season you do this trek (winter) is the harshest at the time in entire Ladakh region. But if chosen to trek this beautiful valley through Zanskar then you have almost made to one of the best treks of your life. Winter in Ladakh region is harsh and the sub zero temperatures can reach as low as -30 to -35 making it difficult for your body to cope. Be prepared to face the extreme cold with adequate warm clothes and carry essential medicines to combat any discomfort during the trek. Daily trek of 10-15 kms with your backpack or rucksacks can be tiring so pack only essentials. Get yourself acquainted to sleep in sleeping bags.Chadar trek is mostly organized by well experienced trekking or mountaineering clubs and they should provide the details of do's and dont's well ahead of the trek. Have your trek planned with additional buffer days as the weather can get worse sometimes and the trek can be delayed or postponed or even in some cases can be cut short. There are frequent flights to Leh from Delhi and Srinagar and chances of these flights getting cancelled is a common affair during winter due to bad weather.Ladakhis are friendly and you can experience that in the trek crew or the porters who keep their spirits high to support you along the trek.Chadar trek has turned out to be one of the most memorable trek of my life and its one of the treks I recommend only for people who are fit and have a strong will to complete the trek.Your main enemy through out the trek is only the severe cold !!"

Stok_Palace_Museum,Tyche75,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Solo,Odd but worthy museum,"Perhaps because the museum is within the royal palace (still occupied by royals), when you visit it, you are basically led around by an attendant.  This can be helpful if you have questions about some items, such as the queen's crown (a very elaborate item!), but it can also feel a bit stifling.  I found the items within to help me better understand some of the history I had read about Ladakh."

We were excited to visit this but alas it was not open for the season yet and would be open in a couple of days – should be open by now for sure (check). If so, its worth visiting to see how royalty at Leh stay in the palaces :). A nice cafe at the entrance with a grand view of the STOK range to enjoy.. have a coffee/ tea and soak it in.Next to the palace you will see a ~70 feet High seated Gautama Buddha statue and temple, constructed and consecrated by HH the 14th Dalai Lama in 2016.

Apart from that there is a royal palanquin, kings armoury (which was very primitive, like wooden bow and arrow), king and queen’s crown, wooden royal throne and jewelries.  Some of the jewelries are studded with turquoises- a precious stone from Tibet. Turquoises are more expensive than gold, and as per Ladakhi custom it is given by bride's family to the bride during marriage. There is a Chorten or stupa, made in the memory of someone from the royal family. The museum also has 500 year old measuring instruments, locks etc. Apart from the museum there is a temple containing lots of idols - Hayagriva, White Tara, Green Tara and Amitavus. Hiyagriva literally means 'having neck of a horse'. He is the yaksha attendant of Avalokiteshvara . His special ability is to cure skin diseases. Tara is born from the tears of Avalokiteshvara as he saw the sufferings of the universe . Green Tara protects devotees from danger while White Tara gives longevity, merit and wisdom.

Matho_Monastery,SomnathSarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-15,Tibetan traditions kept alive,"The Matho monastery was estd in the early 15th century. Destroyed by Muslims in the late 16th century (during the reign of Akbar), it was later rebuilt. The prayers and rituals of this monastery are in direct continuation of Tibetan practices, as the earlier monks of this gompa were trained in Sakya and Ngor in Tibet. The monastery is famous for its annual festival held in Feb/Mar every year, during which two monks enter a trance and become oracles.The monastery has a European style toilet at the parking lot. The steps adjacent to the Matho Gompa School are to be taken to enter the main complex. There are vibrant flowers inside the main complex. Bright yellow and orange flowers dominated the display. One temple of the monastery has a gorgeous statue of the Maitreya Buddha - the most gorgeous and glamorous in Ladakh in my opinion. There is a throne for the leader of the order. The frescoes here are bright and large, and can be photographed (no flash of course). The monks were very helpful and gave time to all the tourists, no matter in how many small groups they came, over and over again, and also patiently and gently answered all queries of the tourists. The museum has a rich and vast collection, and would require min 30 minutes to glance through. There is an entrance fee to the museum, but not to the gompa. The view of the snow capped mountains from the gompa is a treat."

It is also famous for its oracles. During festivals, the Cham dance and the act of oracles are breathtaking. The acts of oracles under the influence of supernatural powers, leaves everyone in awe and fear as the oracles often run barefoot on the parapets of the monastery roof."

It has a very strong reputation for oracles and it gathers a huge crowd for the festival in February. It has a museum of tantric practice, which maybe an encouraging condition if you're a practitioner. It charges admission fee.The statue of the Buddha Maitreya in the prayer hall shows a unique and extremely elaborate refuge tree.

Shey_Monastery,ghosal_rg,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Shakyamuni,"15km from Leh town. Climb as usual. On the highway. Only rubbles left of the palace. After covering lots of tortuous lanes, you reach the monastery inside, desolate, pay 30 bucks per head, visit gold copper, large, beautiful statue of Shakyamuni , stained thanks and go back to your car."
Shey_Monastery,GauravChand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Monastery and palace in bad shape,We visited Shey Monastery on the way back from Thiksey monastery.  The structure looks in bad shape and looks like it may have been damaged during some bad weather or an earthquake.  There is not much climbing.  There is a Buddha statue.  The palace is also there.  A visit provides some good views.  This attraction can be skipped if visiting other monasteries.
Shey_Monastery,Peregrineri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,"Interesting, but not well preserved","I first visited here several years ago, when more of the palace was open. Now only the upper hall with the Buddha statue is open. I have always heard of it referred to as Shey Palace. There was one monk there, collecting the Rs30 admission fee, but I didn't see others. The only other activity there that I could see was a hall with many oil lamps. If you go in there without shoes, your feet will get sticky. There's no sign about shoes there, so maybe they are OK. It's disappointing that the place seems to be getting no restoration work done.It's not accessible, You have to walk up quite a few stairs. You get a great view from up there, though."

Shey_Monastery,Tropicalstorm,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Palace with a monastery,Quaint place. More rustic and quaint than other 'mainstream' monasteries. Going through the alleys of this place you feel as if you are in a magical movie like doctor strange..Don't forget to visit Shey Mosque which is half a kilometre BEFORE the Shey Palace (when coming from main Leh market on the leh-manali Road). This mosque is the first mosque in Ladakh built by the Muslim scholar and preacher Shah Hamdan. He came from central Asia to Ladakh via the Silk Road route. This mosque is very old and basic. The ceiling is made up of small bamboo like wood closely huddled together to keep the temperature warm in winter. The small garden outside is beautiful. It has hand made wooden shelters along with hand made benches.

From the parking lot, one has to walk on a inclined path to reach the entrance and then climb a steep flight of steps to check out the palace and the beautiful main temple dedicated to Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha is in sitting posture and the idol is huge - one can view the Lord from a lower temple and again from the upper temple which has a entrance ticket of 30 rupees per person. We also saw a room where hundreds of small & large oil lamps were lighted and it was a beautiful sight. The view of the surrounding valley and mountains from the top is breathtaking."

Even from the parking you have to climb some stairs to reach the Monastery, I was almost out of breath when I reached at the top. There are different beautiful views at the top, wind blowing strongly. Many Photographic locations. you will also find many Stupas there. A soon you entered the temple, you will find a huge Buddha statue with awesome painting on the wall, describing stories of Buddha. I was shivering when I saw the eyes of Buddha statue, it was like he entered my mind, I could not move for sometime. A peaceful place."

Shey_Monastery,Granthalok,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Enchanting views from atop,"As you set foot in Leh, the sheer beauty of the place is sure to get you going either on a photographing spree or on a sight-seeing sojourn. But hold on… it is prudent to just curb this urge since Leh is situated at quite an altitude and requires acclimatization at least for a day. This day should be spent leisurely, with visiting tourist spots commencing next day onwards, and that too in Leh.  Ideally your first spot should be visiting the Shey Palace or Monastery located on the Leh-Manali Highway.Situated on a hillock, which requires climbing some steep steps, visiting Shey Monastery is a pleasure in itself. There are beautiful views from the top, with open fields, dotted with poplar trees. There is a highway running beneath, and the traffic running smoothly is a sight to behold. There is complete silence inside the monastery. It is declared a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of India. There is a copper-gilded statue of Lord Buddha which is almost 40 feet tall. It is a treat for researchers and history-buffs."
Shey_Monastery,PatrickBuijs,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Small monastery worth a short visit.,When you are near it do give it a visit. Its one of the smaller monasteries in the Leh area.

Shey_Monastery,Digantjhala,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,A smaller version of the Leh Palace,"About 8 kms from Leh, this was the palace of the king earlier. Be warned, there is a lot to climb before you reach the actual palace and monastry. Nothing great about it, but why go up till Leh and not visit a well known point?You will get good panaromic views from the top of the palace.There is a small Tibetian market on the road just opposite to the entrance. Do visit it if you are interested in buying souvenirs, however you might get everything at a cheaper price in the Leh market.Also, do not forget to glance at the holy pond just behind the market. Though it is pretty dirty, there are quite a few varieties of fish, birds, etc in it."
Shey_Monastery,Chiragjain17,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Couples,Great views around,Both Shey monastery and Shey palace lie on same hill. This monastery is also same like any other monastery but the view is great. You will find Indus river flowing near to the hill and this gives good views. It houses Shakyamuni Buddha statue and it is worth watching.The one bad thing is you need to do some trekking to reach at the top and enjoy the views.
Shey_Monastery,Pulkita,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Undiscovered way that goes up to beautiful views,when you happen to go here... there is this little way going up. just as you reach the end of the steps and you think you have reached the monastery... ahead of you is the line of bells that you must turn clockwise... straight ahead goes to the back side and on your left you see a big (I'm sorry i dont know the name of those things you turn for good luck) if you're at the beginning of the monastery... look right and you will see a way going up in the rocks and stones. we climbed all the way up and were welcomed by dazzling 360 degree views of the valley and the mountains. its beautiful. a must for adventure seekers. we loved climbing up.  ofcourse the monastery itself is breath-takingly beautiful. The little lamp lighting room is also divine. must visit.

Shey_Monastery,Shailesh_cs3,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,A Good Visit,The Shey Monastery and the Shey Palace complex are structures located on a hillock in Shey and I would recommend a visit for sure. The monastery houses the main Shakyamuni Buddha statue which is a 12 metres (39 ft) icon covering three floors of the monastery  - Said to be the second largest in the region. Importantly we were intrigued by the Chamber of lamps in the monastery – whereby you see hundreds of them lighted in a room – that is all black because of the soot. Something that we didnt see in other moanteries – so do check it out while here.
Shey_Monastery,Saurav S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Lovely statue and monastery ,A good place to visit. Not too far from the city.

Markha_Valley,Franka v,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,"Great, but especially because of the Ladakhi Women’s Travel Company!","Great experience, really recommend the Ladakhi Women’s Travel Company I booked the trekking with! They made sure I had an authentic experience (staying in the homestays and translating instead of camping) even though the Valley is getting more crowded these days and also helped me doing other treks besides Markha Valley (that I even recommend more!)."
Markha_Valley,Julian R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,Tips for independent trekkers,"Without doubt, this is a premium trekking place and the best region to walk during the northern summer months. I did this trek on my own and I want to share some of my experience, adding a little more info to what it is already said here. So let's start by parts:TransportThere is a big taxi lobby imposing prices and avoiding competence. So strong is their rule that the capital Leh is full of adverts asking for partners to share costs to see the nearby attractions (it is crazy because a fleet of tourist buses will solve all this mess and I bet a lot of people will leave Ladakh missing key places because of this problem). Anyway, at the beginning of the trek in Zingchen and at the end in Chokdo there will be taxis waiting for trekkers. In general local people resort to hitchhiking, because public buses are scarce and not reliable, so in case of needing transport just hitchhike and always reasonably pay the driver. In the case you encounter some taxi driver demanding explanations, always tell them that the driver of the car is your friend and this is not a transport service.GuidesFor an experienced trekker is not really necessary, the paths are clear and you can get nice detailed maps from Android apps like Maps.me and Osmond. I used both on my Mobil phone and do not have many problems. All the paths have the same patron: they follow riverbed; and in the extreme situation of losing your bearings, remember that all the rivers flow to the Zanskar river and Indus river and those rivers had roads and plenty of villages. Also, you can look for piles of rocks and signs of human activity to find your destination. The only problem I had was to find the best place to cross the rivers, so expect to wet your feet especially in the spring season and rainy days.Local People and safetyReally nice people, always asking where are you going and telling you the correct path. When arriving at a village just tell the folks ""Homestay"" and they will find you a room (remember they have a rotation system so everybody gets a fair share of the tourist business, so you are not able to choose accommodation). There are no beggars and everybody is busy working in the fields or building houses and stone walls (summer is the only chance they have to use concrete because the summer weather do not freeze the water, on the other hand the increasing rainfall is pushing people to changing from mud houses to concrete ones). There is a heavy presence of the Indian army along the Indus valley, but they will not interact with tourist unless you enter or take pictures of their facilities.HomestaysMostly all the local Homestays are managed by women, meanwhile men are away in the cities to earn money, these women are very busy because also take care of children, old people and livestock so keep your demands in balance with the situation. Do not expect luxuries: there are squatter compost toilets in small stalls away from the main house. And there is no running water nor bathroom so ask for water for washing (do not expect hot water nor privacy to wash). The kitchen is an important place, always wait to be invited to enter and do not sit in the Ladakhi tables as it is considered quite umpolite. Using Homestays instead of camping reduce the environmental impact on the ecosystem and help the local to improve the economy. Also is a key factor to preserve this national park because peasants will depend less on their livestock and this change will give more space to the snow leopards preys. So avoid the luxury tour agencies who bring less income to the villages.Altitude adaptationA lot of people come to Ladakh as a side trip from the lower regions of India, but this is an error because they are ill prepared and the urge to see as much as possible in a few days ruin the trip because of the high altitude. Usually they start the trek in Chilling to avoid the Gandala pass, but as soon as they reach the 4100m the altitude sickness appears and the trek is really uncomfortable, especially in the Hankar, Nimaling and Chokdo stretch. I recommend spending at least two weeks in Ladakh to enjoy thoroughly this trek; spend a few days in Alchi-Uleytokpo area (the lowest terrain in Ladakh at 3000m), making day treks to the surrounding mountains. For example the first day I did the trek Sumdo-Charatse La (3700m), Yangtang, Rizon Gorge, Uleytokpo and the next day the trek Mangyu-Mangyu La (4137m)-Hipti-Leh highway.. You can return to your accommodation by hitchhiking and rest comfortably a low altitude. Afterwards you can go to Leh (3500m) and spend a couple of days doing some sightseeing to the nearby attractions. Then you can start the Markah trek with some guarantee of almost no suffering altitude sickness. When climbing high passes above 4500m, those people non allergic to ibuprofen can take one 600mg pill several hours before the climbing, to help the body to adjust to altitude and prevent mountain sickness.DogsThere are dogs everywhere in Ladakh mainly in urban áreas, but beware of the dogs because a lot of them are feral, so do not pet them. On summer days they live from the food dumped from tourist establishments, but during the harsh months of winter they turn on wildlife and attacks on humans are not uncommon. Because killing as a method controlling the dog population is not accepted by the locals, a sterilization campaign has been stablished but their effects are yet to be seen.WeatherLadakh and more specifically the Markha trek, let you to walk on high altitudes without snow and not needing technical climbing knowledge. The temperatures are surprisingly warm when the sun is shining, only above the 4.100m when the wind is blowing the body fells the chill cold wind so a light windbreaker and water resistant jacket is needed. Above 4.800m under these same conditions the body loses heat quicklyso is necessary to cover all the exposed parts of the body; so lightweight gloves, balaclava and neck warmer are needed. and if the weather turns cloudy you will need a light fleece jacket. Just to get an idea, in mid August 2019 above 4800m (Nimaling Camp area) the temperature dropped below zero during the nights and snowed for several days.Crossing rivers.One of the main complaints of the Markha Valley trekkers is the river crossing, usually the path follows the streams, so sometimes the bridges are washed away by flash floodings and unexpected streams can appear after a rainy day. So remember to cross always trough the widest place of the river and always downwards the river flow. Water trekking shoes can be useful but there are so many crossings that they are not worth it. So a lightweight hiking shoe with extra grip sole and quick drying are the best choice for trekking this area (if you want to climb a 6000m summit you will need boots). If you must cross rivers and get your feet wet, at the end of the day trek you can ask the Homestay owner to dry your shoes in the kitchen room. Also, you can use adhesive body warmer when the trek is over to regain some warmth for your feet.NimalingNimaling is worthy staying another day, mostly all the trekkers spent one night and continue the trek to Chokdo because the altitude sickness makes the stay unpleasant and want to finish trek as soon as possible. If you are used to the altitude I suggest to spend at least one more day to do some day treks on the area. I recommend two hiking summits if the snow line has receded enough: the Konga Ri (5754 m) and the Reponi Mallai Ri (6116 m). The Konga Ri is a hilly summit at the end of the Markha valley just follow the river, pass the Dzo Jongo Basecamp , then continue through moraine landscape and when you reach a lake, the south hillside is the Konga Ri. You can attempt to climb to the summit through the scree without using crampons. The views are fantastic and you will be immersed in a real Himalayan high peak landscape.The Reponi Mallai Ri route is posted on wikiloc. But if the snow it is too deep I recommend to trek at least till the Kang Yatse view point at 5.200m, to see a spectacular view of the of the Kang Yatse massif and its glaciers. Just go up the hill, follow the small stream that goes behind the Nimaling camp (about 2 hours), this route is also available in wikiloc.Other Ladakh Homestay TreksLadakh has 3 homestay treks: - The Markha trek: the most well-known trek- The Sham Trek: from Likir to Temisgam can be done in 3 days. I recommend to add one more day and end the trek in Skindiang. The highest point is 3800 so this is an ideal trek for altitude acclimatizing. This trek it may be less appealing, but it's really worthy because the villages are really nice and the accommodations are more comfortable.- The Lamayuru to Alchi trek: it is a 5 day trek between remote villages, old monasteries and dramatic landscapes.I will try to add the last 2 mentioned treks to Tripadvisor. Just with the aim of spreading the visitors flow and their money so all the local communities gets a fair share of the business and these remote villages improve their way of living.Managing garbageLadakh has a ban on plastic bags but not in water bottles or other plastic items sold everywhere. There is no proper waste management so carry back to your country, your own garbage (specially plastic packaging and batteries). When trekking make use of the Homestays bins to throw the rests of the day packet lunch and also use hiking water bottles because all the Homestays provide safe drinking water. One more thing, there are some trash open walled holes along the routes and they are a shame because the garbage is not picked up and it spread all over the place, also wildlife rummage these places so do not use them."
Markha_Valley,Daniel B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,Great walk,We suggest to start from Zingchen rather than Chilling. It took us 8 days (with one day exploring at Nymaling). We were 7 (3 children) autonomous. No need to take a sleeping bag but take a silken bag. There are plenty of wild life to see.Mostly friendly homestay.
Markha_Valley,Kaalpurush Apu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Beautiful Markha Valley.,"One of the most beautiful, historical also challenging trek in Ladakh. It takes 6 to 7 days to complete the trek. The trail head is Skiu Village which is easily accessible by car from Leh."
Markha_Valley,wonderingcorse,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-19,homestay trek- general information 1,"I have just come back from trekking Spituk to Hemis and here are some general points:1. do you need a guide? shortly, no. the trail is clear, there are other trekkeres, groups and locals to follow and your best friend- horse manure- will never fail you. of course, a good guide will enrich the experience and will give you much better understanding but for the purpose of finding your way, you are fine by yourselves.2.equipment- go as light as possible. if you want a sleeping bag for emergencies, fine but you are unlikely to use it. good sandals are important, great sunglasses and hat as well as waterproofs.3.start and finish- the road goes now all the way to Zingchang so you can skip this part (from spituk) and avoid the night there. take a taxi and walk to Rumbak to spend the first night. on the other side, most trekkers take a taxi back to Leh from Chokdo. of course many variations are possible and most people begin the trek in skyu.4.villages with homestay: Zingchang, yurutse, ganda la base camp (tent), Shingo, Skyu, Sara, Chalak, thilispe, Markha,umlung,  Hankar, Tuchungtse (tent), Nimaling (tent), Chokdo, shang sumdo. some of these villages like shingo and chokdo work on the rotation system meaning even if there are 6 homestays in the village, just one is recieving guests at any given day.5. costs: the price is fixed all over the valley at 1200 rupees for a room,dinner, breakfast, packed lunch, lots of tea and free purified water. Nimaling is an exception at 1400."

Markha_Valley,Lovers_paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,The Tea House Trek In The Ladakh,"More famously known as the Teahouse Trek of the Ladakh, the Markha Valley Trek commences from Leh to Skiu via Chilling. From Leh to Chilling, easy transport is available whereafter u hit the ropeway due to a broken bridge. The trek route is very interesting and the landscape is very fascinating and unique. From Skiu to Markha, it is an easy trek with almost flat walks on most part of the trail. The views throughout are breathtaking with different and unique rock-scapes and structures of the mountains formed by wind and water erosion."
Markha_Valley,royjay2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,The Famous Markha Valley Trek,"The Markha Valley Trek is one of the most popular treks in the Ladakh. There are incredible sights and surreal rock formations, timeless villages, snowy mountains and delightful Buddhist gompas. The Markha Valley trek is by no means an easy one, there are two passes of 4900 m or higher to negotiate, coupled with a possibility of snowfall in the higher reaches, even when the passes are trekkable."
Markha_Valley,Fernenanda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,One of the most amazing treks on earth!,"Markha Valley Trek is one the most amazing trek routes on earth IMHO. Everyday the scenery changes so you'll never get bored, and the level of wilderness! Don't expect wi-fi let alone telephone signal here, even the locals still have to use satellite phone. It's better to go by camping than homestay, taking into account the distance from village to village versus campsite to campsite, it's better not to exhaust oneself with a too long distance in a day at that altitude. From Skiu village to Markha village is a 22km walk while from a campsite beyond Skiu village to the next one before Markha village is only 18km. As well as if one starts from Hankar village to Nymaling, it's a rather gruelling 11km walk from 4,000m to 4,800m altitude compare to a 6km walk if one comes from Tachungtse (which is still very tough, believe me).We went with Wild East Adventure and I couldn't recommend them to you enough. A very professional team (the guide, cook and horseman), the guide could speak very well English and took very good care of us. The food they prepared for us was always delicious and you could state your preferences in advance so they could prepare ingredients for you. Beware that meat would get rotten in couple of days though so you'll only be left with vegetables, not that it's different with homestay option. I'd say camping food is better than homestay food, if you like yummy stuff like me."
Markha_Valley,cecibono,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Perfect first Himalayan trek!,"If you’re looking for your first trek in the Himalayan mountains then Markha Valley is the one! It can easily be done without a guide but if it’s your first time trekking in the area I recommend hiring one in Leh, so that he can tell you more on the history of the country and help you out in case of need (there are some river crossings and you never know how you’ll react to altitude). Markha Valley trek is great not only for the amazing views but also because it can be done without carrying all the heavy camping stuff. You’ll sleep on homestays along the way that will provide food (dinner, breakfast and packed lunch) and warm blankets at night. The only thing I strongly recommend to bring is a sleeping bag for the last night at Nimaling camp as it’s really freezing up there and the blankets they give you are not enough to keep you warm!They usually suggest to do the trek in 5 days but we did it in 4 as the first stage they usually recommend (Chilling to Skyu) is really short (2 hours with an average pace). If you’re relatively fit I think is a good option to do it in 4 days as it follows:day 1: Chilling to Saraday 2: Sara to Hankarday 3: Hankar to Nimalingday 4: Nimaling to Shang Sondu (cab to Leh)"
Markha_Valley,Roxanne,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Unguided Markha Valley Trek - Chilling to Chogdo,"Just got back from the Markha Valley trek – it was really great. We were told the more common starting point of Zingchan wasn’t doable due to a recent mudslide because of heavy rain so we started from Chilling instead. You don’t need a guide or porters for this trek – it is quite easy to follow the valley and unlikely that you would take any wrong turns. Most of the groups go unguided but we did see a couple of very large groups (20-30 people) with processions of ponies carrying all of their tents and food –it made me happy we chose to do the trek on our own. Our route was Chilling – Skiu – Markha – Thachunstse – Nimaling – Chogdo, staying nights in Skiu/Markha/Thachunstse/Nimaling. Our day 1 was short, just a couple of hours of trekking and in hindsight we should have trekked further. Skiu to Markha is incredibly long and flat (20km+) and I recommend having a bigger first day and pushing on from Chilling to Sara or one of the few random homestays past Skiu. I also recommend that people stay the night camping (there are tents available) in Thachunstse instead of Hankar – we found a lot of people on the trek stopped in Hankar which is a couple of hours before Thachunstse and at a lower elevation. Pushing on until Thachunstse on day three helps you adjust to the higher elevation and breaks up the big climb into Nimaling. We didn’t have issues finding accommodation in any of the villages. When you get into a village there is generally someone around to greet you and then you are assigned a homestay based on the village rotation – unfortunately sometimes this means you end up walking a little ways outside of the village to your homestay. Prices for August 2018 were 1200 rupees per person/night in all places apart from Nimaling which was 1400 rupees. This includes dinner, breakfast the next morning and a little lunch pack for the following day. If you have any dietary restrictions I recommend bringing your own food as not much English is spoken and there were no meal options – breakfast was bread with condiments, lunch was usually bread with a boiled egg, boiled potato, chocolate bar and juice box and dinner was usually rice, dal and vegetables. My last but perhaps MOST IMPORTANT tip is to book a taxi from the end point Chogdo back to Leh before you finish your trek. We were told during the trek that there were taxis waiting at the end but there were none and also no phone reception in the village to call one – we had 7 people stuck waiting around for a couple of hours. We were told hiking to the next village to find a taxi would also be unlikely due to the time of day (around 4pm). There is phone reception on the high pass (Kongmaru La) so you can call and book one before you descend – from my understanding taxis have to wait 3hrs for you to arrive so this gives you a bit of a buffer. The trek itself was challenging but very beautiful – the biggest issue was the altitude and I’m glad we spent a few days in Leh first to adjust before trying the trek as it was still hard to breathe at times.If you decide to do it good luck, I'm sure you'll be fine, and don't let people in Leh bully you into a tour as it's not that difficult."
Markha_Valley,lizdiscovers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Amazing trek; it is like walking in a movie scenery!,"We just returned from our trip to Ladakh. As part of our 12 day stay we did a 8 day Markha Valley trek with Dreamland. The most amazing experience! The trek is varied and the scenery amazing. It’s like walking in the Hobbit, Lord of the rings and Narnia at the same time. Quaint little rivers, green valley’s and interesting rock formations. The trek is a 3 rating and although fairly easy provides interesting challenges such as crossing rapid streaming rivers, narrow climbing trails, and a serious trek to Kongmaru La (steep incline and decline from time to time) I would personally not want to do it without a guide, yet for the experienced hiker it may be possible. My review on our trekking agency will be posted with Dreamland (which we can certainly recommend).If you visit Ladakh, really would recommend a trek of at least a few days in Markha Valley to see the scenery and visit the villages. It is an amazing experience"
Markha_Valley,Akriti Mattu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Markha Valley Trek,"If you truly want to enjoy Markha Valley, plan a trip longer than a week to Leh and go trekking at Markha Valley. Its a lovely route and the trek is moderate. The guides are quite good at their work and the overall vibe is excellent."
Markha_Valley,Alan H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Amazing Scenery & Homestays,"Took a 6 day guided tour here to go over the Kongmaru La pass. The scenery in the valley is breathtaking. Absolutely stunning mountains, fields and villages unspoilt by mass tourism. It may be the most popular trek in Leh but you barely see anyone until the Nimaling camp before the pass. Until then it’s mostly Shepard’s and locals waving Jullay at you. Homestays are brilliant as well and the locals are so friendly.  Would recommend to anyone to do as a great cultural experience as well as a physical test (it is by no means an easy trek unless you are 100% acclimatised). "

Markha_Valley,Atanu G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Mesmerizing Markha,"One of the most popular treks in Ladakh which you can do solo without any porters or guides. You will enjoy homestays in himalayan landscape with ladakhi villages. It involves crossing of high pass of Kongmaru La 5274 mts and walking on the banks of the Markha River crossing it a few times.ItineraryDay 1: Reach Leh Rest and Acclimatize – Better to take rest on hotel/guest house which helps to acclimatize. Ove night stayed at Hostel.Day 2: Sightseeing around Leh and Acclimatize – Visited Shanti Stupa, LEH Palace, LEH Market which all are within walking distance of LEH Bus stand. Overnight stayed at Hostel.Day 3: Drive Leh to Chilling and trek to Skiu (3366m)– As a solo traveler managed to hitch hike till Chilling. Crossed the river in a trolley. Hiking to Skiu (7 Km). Overnight stayed at Skiu. Very enjoyable homestay. Day 4: Trek Skiu to Markha(3700m) –Crossed Markha river several times to reach Markha village. Stayed in Monastery. Enjoyed delicious home looked ladakhi pasta. Day 5: Trek Markha to Thachungtse (4265m) – Stayed in Thachungtse in tent. You can also opt for staying in Hankar. Small ladakhi village on your way.Day 6: Trek Thachungtse to Nimaling (4720m) – It’s the base of Kongmaru La. Overnight stay in fixed tents who will provide you food and hot tea as many times as you like. Enjoyed snowfall.Day 7: Trek Nimaling to Chogdo over the Kongmaru La (5130m) – Kongmaru La is the highest point of the trek. Enjoyed a lot with light snowfall. Reached Chogdo in afternoon and enjoyed homestay with delicious ladakhi food.Day 8: Trek to Chogdo and drive to Leh – 2 hrs drive to Leh. But I opted for visiting Hemis monastery on my way back to leh.Day 9: Fly back from Leh- Fly back to Mumbai with amazing memories."
Markha_Valley,Ankit C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,The Astounding Markha Valley Trek,"I recently went to this beautiful trek which is supposed to be one of the best in the region.  It was a 7 day group trek with friends booked via Bikat Adventures which I would be reviewing in a different post. I landed in Leh 1 day before starting to acclimatize with the altitude. The best thing about the place is its untouched gorgeousness. You get to see the dry arid mountains and surprisingly in the next instance you will find wide streams of pure water. The monasteries, comfortable homestays and Ladakhi cuisine are the other major attractions. However, this place is not connected via motorable roads and anybody who wishes to visit has to trek for atleast one day. I reached Markha valley on the 3rd day of my trek after walking through Ganda La Pass starting from Spituk. Several cafes run by the locals are on the way from both sides. The terrain is not difficult but it is suggested to wear high ankle hiking boots. Trust me, your ankles will thank you. Another thing to note is there is no network available anywhere however there is facility of satellite phones near Markha village. The nights could be shivering especially if you plan to stay in a camp which is the only option at Nimaling and proper thermals should be packed."

The Stakna monastery lies at a distance of 25 Kms from Leh on the left bank of the river Indus. The monastery formed part of the one of the many religious estates offered to the great scholar saint of Bhutan called Chosje Jamyang Palkar in about 1580 AD by the Dharmaraja Jamyang Namgial who had invited him to Ladakh. The monastery was built on a hill shaped like a tiger nose  and so its name was given as Stakna (Tiger nose). The most important image in the monastery is that of the sacred Arya Avaloketesvara from Kamrup (Assam). There are about 80 monks in residence. The successive reincarnation of the Stakna Tulku act as the incumbents the monastery and they continue to fulfil the fine responsibility of upholding the teachings of the Dugpa order. The branch monasteries attached to Stakna are those of Mud and Kharu and that of Stakrimo, Bardan and Sani in Zanskar."

The sight of it as one approaches is striking and very photogenic. It is a small, compact monastery and has a serene atmosphere. Usually one of the monks is on duty to show visitors around. There is a Prayer Hall and several small rooms where old artifacts, statues and holy scriptures are stored and displayed. The paintings in the one room are very old and not well lit to protect them, so having a small torch handy is useful. The views from the roof are spectacular.

I was there when the monks were having a praying session, so I decided not to enter the praying room even though my guide said it was ok. I which I could go up to the rooftop to see the view it I wasn't allowed. I would say it is best to view Stakna Monastery on a rod from direction of Hemis so one could skip this if on a limited time for more famous places like Thiksey but should at least stop for photos from the road from Hemis direction."

While there isn't much to see inside keeping in mind its much littler than different religious communities in the territory, it has a charging position on the slope and with the stream circling the front of it and the mountains behind it make for a staggering setting. From the top of Stakna Monastery visitors can have a striking perspective of Indus valley and waterway.

The layout reminded me of a Moroccan Riayad- although all other similarities stop there. Stakna oozes antiquity and atmosphere- well worth a visit.
Stakna_Monastery,Soulrtip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 • Solo,Will Affect Your Mind Positively.,"Stakna Gompa appears to be an exotic location. It emanates its aesthetic power form far away.  It attracts your attention from a distance like a mysterious jewel situated on a top of a hill.It is a functional Drukpa lineage monastery, which means it is fertile ground for realization for tantric adepts and initiates. It is not geared up toward accommodation of tourists — it doesn't charge an entry fee, but relies on donations and probably wins the hearts and wallets of those who comes.To get there you need to cross a mighty Hindus river and it has a great effect of leaving something behind. The monastery is well maintained and offers a feast for a sight even for those who might not be a Dharma practitioner — the murals are very elaborate and rich in details, the ancient lineage masters statues and stupas with holy relics are on par with elegant work of arts. The energy of the space on the monastery grounds works to one's advantage as well — the backdrop is a Hindus river on one side and a Stock Kangri Massif on another provides an excellent conditions for letting go of the ordinary world — it offers a space to liberate you. Just Powerful and Positively Impressive Place!"

Small but visually impressive, Stakna Monastery looms impressively just 800m across the Indus from Km449 (where Leh–Thiksey buses terminate), though the gompa’s winding access road adds another 900m. The narrow suspension bridge is just wide enough for small taxi-vans. The name, 'Stakna' literally means 'tiger's nose'. The monastery was so named because the outcrop on which it stands is shaped like a tiger's nose. Stakna belongs to the Drugpa Buddhist sect and was founded by Chosje Jamyang Palkar in 16th century, the great scholar saint of Bhutan. Inside the Gompa, four rooms with vivid new Tantric murals are worth a visit. Behind the main prayer hall, smaller shrines which still has the 400+ year old sandalwood statues, original frescoes and statuettes of the Bhutanese lamas who founded the monastery. Climb to Stakna's roof to get a fantastic 360-degree breathtaking view of the Indus valley including the view of the Thiksey Monastery.Visited June 2011"

Highly recommend!

Phyang_Monastery,Antje K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,Especially great during the summer mask dance festival,"Even though Hemis is most famous for its annual mask dance festival in the summer, Phyang is actually a much better choice for viewing monastic dances. It's a short distance from Leh off the Kargil road, it's been beautifully restored in the last few years, and the dances happen in an intimate courtyard setting, with mostly local visitors. Squeeze your way through the small entry gate and find a place to sit in the shade. If you are lucky, you may even find a chair in one of the upper-level galleries. Most tourists try to arrive in the morning, but if you go in the afternoon, there will be less of a crowd, and the dances are just as spectacular. The costumes are made of rich colorful brocades and the masks are very expressive. Even the clowns look fantastic while doing their local dances and playing jokes on kids."
Phyang_Monastery,KGB777,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Solo,Another attractive monastery,This one is just a few kilometres off NH1 and can actually be seen from the highway.

Phyang_Monastery,Resident_N0n_Indian,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2012 • Friends,"Nice, but similar to others","Phyang monastery is very similar to other monasteries in Ladakh, but it is very picturesquely perched on a hilltop, and is close to Leh if you can hire a taxi, so it is good to visit. Although at least 100 monks belong to the institution, almost all of them are posted away at Dehra Dun, so there are usually only two caretakers keeping the keys and opening rooms for tourists, which gives it a lonely abandoned feel. There are several rooms to see and all are different and beautiful, except the dark one that is different and spooky. The view from the gonpa, of the village spread out is gorgeous.The monastery festival in July is packed with tourists. I didn't like it but I can see why some would enjoy the spectacle of it."

Its about 10-12 kms from Leh, and you got to take a turn from the main highway (to Manali) and travel for 3-4 kms inside to reach the monastery. This monastery is more than 200 years old. Due to some removation work going on, we could see only 1 out of the 3 chapels there. There are lots of fascinating statues , artefacts to see in the monastery, and to know more about the history, there are also some books available. Apart from the monastery, you also get a fantastic view of the ""windy patch"" of Leh, since the monastery is on a hill-top."

A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may also serve as an oratory. A large number of beautiful monasteries are in the Ladakh, all of which are worth seeing when on a Ladakh trip. Hemis is the richest and the largest monastery in Leh. Some other very beautiful monasteries are at Thiksey, Spituk, Alchi, Lamayuru, Diskit, Likir, Stakna, Sankar, Mulbekh, Phyang, Matho etc. There are some very beautiful monasteries in the Zanskar as well like the Rangdum Gompa, Stongdey, Pibiting, Karsha, Shargole, Phuktal, Sani, Zongkhul, Stagrimo etc. All worth a visit when on a tour of the Ladakh and the Zanskar."

Diskit or Likir have a larger than life size avatar of Maitreya Buddha along with beautiful paintings and frecos. These are the 4 favourites that I found had something unique and all of which had spectacular views from the top!I took my 73 yr old aunt who climbed to spots as much as she could.

Basgo monastery is old but situated amidst beautiful hilly landscape. Likir monastery is big and rich. Alchi complex showcases excavated historic temples.

The best is to spend some time in each monastery, see also the museum (e.g. Matho, Stok) and avoid the commercialized Hemis. From the taxi stand in leh you can book a taxi to see two or three monasteries in one day. The drivers have a tariff card, so you do not have to bargain. They wait patiently one or two hours for you to finalize your visit. The further away monasteries like Lamayuru or Rizong require a whole day."

All in all that seemed an apt introduction to this over-commercialized monastery which not only sells entry tickets at nearly double the price of any other monastery but also threatens you with a hefty fine for taking photographs (even non-flash photographs are not allowed).  Of course it is a picturesque place, but for me the atmosphere was vitiated by this subsumed feeling of aggressive commercialism which seems out of place in a Buddhist monastery.  Other monasteries that  we visited (Thiksey, Diskit) were much more pleasant and welcoming."

The place is situated on a hillock 2 Kms off the National Highway 1. Though a plethora of monastries exist in Leh the crowd which swarms them during peak tourist seasons kills the charm that exists in these historical sites. The Basgo monastry is an exception to the class commercialisation of Buddhist workshop places. The monastry encompasses Three Temple's one each for Lord Maitreya, Serzang and Cham Chung. They are believed to be various incarnations of Lord Buddha. The ruins of Cham Chung Temple and the serenity and cleanliness of the Basgo temple premises portrays the necessary evil that Tourism and publicity is for these ancient monuments. The temple is a must see for the shutter bugs as it presents a panoramic view of Nimu village. The NH 1 winding up the road is another image which can be clicked a million times.This temple is not on the popular tourist routes. To locate it one needs to start moving towards the road leading to Kargil.  An enquiry with any localite of Village Nimu is the right way to locate it. The route to the temple is narrow and winding up a hillock. So the driver needs to be extremely cautious. "

There were only few more tourists other than us. From the parking lot, we first walked on a hilly road and then climbed a flight of steep steps to reach the top. Entrance tickets were priced at 30 rupees per person. We saw a beautiful giant idol of Maitreya Buddha and found that devotees had offered biscuits, juices, Coca-Cola to the Lord. The paintings on the inner walls were still clearly visible and beautiful. Also the view from this place of the surrounding mountain landscape was just mesmerizing."

But we made it and I am so glad that we did. The views all the way up are awesome. The huge Budhha statue is one of its kind. There is a sense of serenity and spiritualism in the monastery. The frescos inside the monastery tell a story. Be sure to ask the monk about it. There is a fee per person that you have to pay for your visit which shouldn't be a big deal.

The monastery is sited on crumbly mud mountains ravaged by rain; am sure much of the monastery has been washed down the Indus. Be that as it may, whatever remains is worth a visit. The couple of temples one can visit house Maitreya Buddhas (also known as Chamba in Ladakh). I remember two exquisite thankas in the temple with the massive Maitreya; sadly there wasn't enough light in the temple for photographs. The whole setting was pretty eerie in the fading evening light amidst a whistling dust storm."

Basgo_Monastry,SomnathSarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,A Fragile History Capsule,"The monastery (once part of a fort complex), built of clay and stone, is 40 kms from Leh. Enlisted among World's 100 most endangered heritage sites by the US World Monument Fund, this is a must see. The complex was once part of the famous castle of Basgo Rabrtans Lharise Khar, but all that now remain are three diff Maitreya Buddha temples. The first temple on the right is the Chamba Maitreya temple (1450-90), housing a large Buddha idol of clay reinforced with discarded cotton shreds and paper. and of course delicate fresco paintings. This temple is maintained by the Hemis monastery. The 2nd temple in the middle is the Serzang temple (1600-22), consisting a copper-gold large Maitreya Buddha idol. This temple is owned by the Basgo village, its conservation being undertaken by the Basgo Welfare Committee, which was awarded the UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Award of Excellence in 2007. The 3rd temple to the right is the Cham Chum temple (1600-15), built by a Muslim Balti princess to offer her namaz, but later converted into a Buddhist temple when she converted to Buddhism. This small shrine is in a state of decay, with the inner walls containing wonderful frescoes showing cracks. Local volunteers are trying to preserve this structure under the aegis of the Tibetan Classics Translator Guild, New York, USA.The 1st and the 3rd temples offer beautiful views of the fort complex and the surrounding mountain and village. The temple complex is a bit of a maze, and one can lose his way and descend to the nearby village, if not mindful. Entry fees are charged at the 1st and the 2nd temple.Vehicles reach the gate of the complex, and it is not much of a climb around. Will take around an hour to visit. There is a basic waterless toilet arrangement for both the sexes at the parking lot."

Basgo used to be the capital of Ladakh afew centuries back. There are three temples bunched together close to the castle/palace ruins. There was some work happening on the topmost temple and entry could be limited. It should not deter you from a visit. Basgo makes for a quick detour from the highway and can be done in less than an hours time. The highlight of the visit to little Basgo is the surreal castle ruins strategically perched on a steep hill. The temples do require some steep climbing and is not wheel chair friendly."

The road up towards the fort rises quite steeply & crosses a stream as well. It is a good idea to go to Basgo in the evening. Walk up the last stretch as the sun paints the fort in golden colours & you will be rewarded with an amazing spectacle as the low light of the sun falls on the mud-brick fortress ruins. Once again a steep walk up the stairs to the ruined monastery Chamba Lhakhan. You would be lucky to get the monk to open the door of the temples for you. In the walls & ceiling of the monastery are magnificent original wall paintings, similar to those in Alchi. Light is very low, but the details can be seen.Climb down to the second temple called Serzing Lhakhang which is slightly older and smaller than the Chamba Lahakhang. It is very dark inside. This temple has a huge statue of Buddha which is so big, the head is hidden by the upper story of the temple. Unfortunately one cannot climb to the topOne of the best places to visit in Ladakh for the culturally & photographically oriented. Virtually no tourists and so you can soak in the beauty all by yourselves. Strongly Recommended."

Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,SomnathSarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,Honest Monks,"The gompa is 40 kms from Leh. Estd in 1664, the gompa is run by the Nyingma pa. Situated on a hillock, it has a honey comb appearance from a distance. Inside, there are several floors, so one should be prepared for climbing some steps and carry a bottle of water. Inside there is a 300 yr old statue of Vajraguru Padmasambhav, some exquisite frescoes, strange potted plants, a small but very rich Tantric museum. The museum's  chief draws are ancient parchments in both Sanskrit and Tibetan, damru made of human cranial bones and yak skin, ancient weapons and cooking utensils. There was a huge skeletal head of an ibex, the biggest I saw in Ladakh. But the jewels were the young monks on the top floor. One young monk was experienced in Tantric practices. I exchanged some experiences in meditation with him, to my full satisfaction. We had dropped a bag containing INR 40k, realised our error after 2 hours, and barely had our vehicle been parked, when a monk called us out from the top floor. He said he had opened the bag in search of some mobile phone or phone number, but finding none, he had kept the bag in his safe custody. We plain land dwellers cannot easily imagine such honesty. A truly humbling experience in front of such true hermits."

There is also an interesting museum with an impressive haul of artifacts. This is arguably the best monastery around Leh so well worth a visit.

It is something different and worth visiting. During our visit to this area we went to Pengong Lake. What a sight!!! It is almost 140 km long lake with width ranging from 3-5kms. One third of lake is in India whereas two third is in China. One can see blue strip of water with very tall barren 'Green/Blue' mountains on the both sides. What a nature's phenomenon!!!! We were told that this lake freezes completely during winters and one can walk over it and up to some dist can drive a vehicle over it!! Wow!!! Otherwise from Leh it takes almost 5 to 6 hours on very picturesque but an adventourous route. But it is worth a visit once you reach the Lake site. However one must undergo 'acclamatisation period of minimum 2-3 days' as advised by Doctors before you venture out, even you may be fittest person."

In some aspects the country moves at a slower pace, with the post moving at a slower pace, and if you really desire to immerse yourself in India you have to understand that everything does not go at the speed of light a la the U.S. Workers may be eating right in front of you, while you sit in a chair waiting for post on one letter, but that is the custom and it is all part of the experience. I promise everything will be sent and delivered, just a bit slower :)"

Ek toh those hills have such different colours - sea green, megenta! The Zanskar rivers flows from between those hills on both the sides. So, I was just left to wonder how exactly the monks or anyone must have gone inside those caves, because those hills are very steep and rocky and really dangerous. "

Saspol_Caves,SomnathSarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,Caves hiding treasures,"The Saspol caves can be visited while visiting Alchi. There are two ways to visit the caves - park the vehicle opposite the SBI Saspol branch and take a 30 minute walk through verdant fields of wheat, rye and vegetables and wild flowers, over sole-deep water coming from the molten snows, through the village, exchanging pleasantries with the local people as their gardens and residences are passed (the people are charming and helpful) OR to take the vehicle straight to the foot of the hill containing the caves, through a rough road on the left few hundred metres before arriving at the SBI. The first one is highly recommended for its leisurely charm.On the top, there are remnants of an ancient fort and four caves, the main one marked in red and white. The main cave is the easiest to reach. From the bottom of the hill, it is about a 200 m climb to the  top, up a steep incline along a narrow loosely marked path of gravel, that slip as one steps on them. Good shoes with strong grips are needed. At the top, the path gets a bit too narrow for comfort, with irregularly shaped stones acting as steps. There are no handrails anywhere, so NOT recommended for young children and the elderly and ones suffering from vertigo. But the climb is worth the labor and the risk, because both the view as well as the contents are worth it. The rock cut caves and the paintings within date back to the 13th century, and are among the oldest ones on display in Ladakh. It is a miracle that without any maintenance they are still surviving, though badly damaged. Tourists may kindly shut off the flashlights while taking photos, to preserve the paintings for out future generations. There are no guards or guides around, so one has to resist the temptation of using the flashlight inside the dark cave, illuminated by a single lamp. Switching on the museum mode in digital cameras is the best option inside. The paintings are the same as in the other Drukpa monasteries. They are endangered- the walls of the caves showing wide cracks, and flakes of the paints falling off. The government has taken no steps whatsoever to protect them, quite surprisingly. One must take care to close the ricketty door  of the cave shrine while leaving, to protect the precious contents from the vagaries of the weather.The views from the caves are breath taking. The meandering river Indus through the snow capped mountains presents a wonderful photo op. The chill in the air, and the near absolute silence broken occasionally by the cry of a bird - the experience is unforgettable.One can even meditate inside the cave, as  the caves are seldom visited by tourists. The locals, however, care to keep a lamp burning inside."
Saspol_Caves,itsindia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,For any visitor interested in early Buddhist paintings,Saspol caves are situated on the hills behind the Saspol village settlement.

Tibetan_Market,Rahul Ajmera,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Family,"Antiques, winter-wear & stones","There are a lot of Tibetan markets in Leh and all of them have the same stuff on offer. You will find antiques (many from Delhi), winter-wear (from Tibet) and so-called semi precious stones, whose authenticity is difficult to verify.The market is good to visit once. Most goods are overpriced considering that it is a flea market, which really ruins the experience."
Tibetan_Market,Sirisha D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2012 • Friends,Good antiques,Good variety of antiques but the prices quoted are abnormally high. Bargain hard. Ask only 30 or 40% of that they have quoted. Mostly you get it if you increase your price 10-20 INR. The precious stones they show you may not be real. Don't buy unless you can judge by yourself.

For those too enthralled by the beauty of this little lake and wishing to stay overnight, one can ask for a tent. Frequented by many migratory birds, and kiang , marmot, geese, yak-  if one is lucky to spot these here. It is easy to be tempted to linger on here, however, since Tso Moriri is usually the destination, one must move on !

While often such decisions proved right for me, this is one occasion where I was never overwhelmed with the extent of the outcome of such a decision. Surely a Journey of many lifetimes. But even in that many go stratight to Leh after a overnight halt at Sarchu or Jispa. We decided to halt more and divert ourselves via Tso Kar and Tso Moriri. While both these places turned out to be absolute gems, but the sheer surprise on the way to Tso Moriri from Tso Kar was the gradual emergence of glistening blue waters suddenly from nowhere in the backdrop of the rugged mountains scattered with patches of snow. We indeed missed reading about this hidden gem and hence wasn't at all expecting it and its sheer beauty and that too without any expectation and the divine serenity made it a never-to-be-forgotten experience. we stepped out from the the, and apart from clicking a few snaps, just stood there in the vast expanse of Himalayan desert with this oasis in front of us and no one but we and our car."

Amitabh Bachan and written by Sri. Manoj.  Eyes get wet when you pay your respects to the brave 114 army personnel who kiled 1400 Chinese warriors and laid down their lives very happily for their country.  Those days the mortal remains of these great warriors could not be taken to their family.  All of them were cremated here.

It is one of the highest mountain roads of the country.The pass links China's Tibet Autonomous Region and India’s Jammu and Kashmir state. Located in the Himalayas, the road to the summit is gravel, rocky, tippy and bumpy at times. It’s impassable in winters. The climb is simply terrible with a notorious lack of oxygen that tests the organisms and a high degree of steepness. Most people feel altitude sickness at around 2,500-2,800 meters. Near the pass oxygen is in short supply. Stay away if you are scared of heights. Drive with care as this is a mountain road with hairpin curves and dangerous dropoffs. The road is narrow and heavily used by military vehicles. The road is called Rezang La Road. Rezang La was the site of the last stand of the 13 Kumaon Regiment during the Sino-Indian War in 1962."

Rezang_La_War_Memorial,NarendraNSC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,The soldiers Mecca ,"The story of Rezang La is perhaps the most touching story in the annals of modern day wars. The place at which this memorial stands is where mass cremation of the 114 soldiers who laid down their lives, fighting a Chinese force, almost ten times their numbers was done. The place of fighting is about 40 minutes away, but not allowed to be visited as it is on the Line of Actual Control.This group of soldiers died fighting in Nov end and then froze there itself in snow (literally). Their bodies were recovered in Mar next year and cremated. What is most touching and gives a glimpse of what the Indian soldier is made of is that all but two of the group died fighting..... surely they would have known seeing the sheer number of Chinese and yet they decided to fight till the end instead of choosing to abandon.It's a must visit not because it looks great but gave me an opportunity to reflect on whether I was doing my bit towards the country and the soldiers.BTW, I also took a pledge never to enjoy a bonfire in my life. Guess why?? I came to know that since there is no wood in the area (for two hours after that I kept observing but didn't find a single tree) the cremation was done using boxes in which ammunition is provided.... when this was insufficient, they used the office furniture!!!!!!May your sacrifices never go in vain....

Leh_Market,Peregrineri,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,I liked it better before they over modernized it,"I do like that it's now a walking mall, which it should have been since many years. (This happened just in the last few years.) However, to make the new mall, they tore down some beautiful old trees. And many of the buildings have been renovated in a way that destroyed the beautiful, traditional Ladakhi architecture. And it is heavily tourist oriented now, which also detracts from the charm. Still, if you go to Leh you have to go there. I do love the ladies who sit on the sidewalk selling their vegetables and apricots etc., though it makes me sad to see tourists running up and sticking their cameras in their faces without even asking if they mind."

Tso_kar_Lake,ThePrateekSethi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Great lake for birdwatching!,Another one of ladakh's gems. The place is a bird watchers paradise. The salt deposits on the far side are also an intriguing visual of natures many formations.

We saw two black neck cranes in all their glory. Underrated but a very important lake from a ecological perspective. Ladakh never ceases to amaze you!"

Tso_kar_Lake,exploredaunexplored,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,check the salt deposits on the way to Tsokar,We were told we will get to see a lot of migratory birds at Tsokar lake and that was one reason we chose to drive through this route instead of the shorter Chumantang route. No birds when we went. the lake gets over before u get the feel of it. more interesting are salt deposits on the way to the lake. After seeing few tals on the manali leh highway and post pangong and tso moriri this seems to be a put off. its pretty but nothing extra ordinary. I would advise take the chumantang route as it might save u some time.
Tso_kar_Lake,Mahua S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,Desolate beauty!,"For the recreational tourists expecting a thriving bustling spot to indulge in sporting activities, this is not the place. Tso Kar is lesser known lake, on the Rupshu plains, with banks crusted with salt, brackish water and seemingly no population of wild life or tribes. Its size keeps fluctuating depending on the season. The lake used to be an important source of salt for the Changpa tribe. If you are lucky you may spot the Changpa tents near around. The lake in the forenoon casts a spell on the travellors very easily. Picturesque and still, two mountain peaks offer a breathtaking backdrop to this desolate beauty! Not a place to stay, but a place to stopover and fill your soul with its sight."
Tso_kar_Lake,shashindrak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,A DREAM DESTINAION,"I was lucky that during my 3rd visit to Ladakh I could able to to visit 1 more wonder of Ladakh i.e. Tsokar while coming back from Tsomoriri via Sumdo, Puga. This high altitude saline water lake is situated at an elevation of +4500 meters in Rupsu plateau. Tsokar is a salt water lake covering about 20sq km. Changpa nomads were exporting salt to Tibet from this lake, The temp. varies from -40 degree in winter to + 30 degree in summer.As usual through out the trip tremendous scenery is on grand scale.In 2 days Leh - Tsomoriri- Kyagartso- Tsokar _ Tanglangla can be covered.The entire area is paradise for trekkers."
Tso_kar_Lake,AbhinavDave,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,Very old lake..huge salt deposits!,"This was an interesting place to visit - the lake itself is drying up and leaving a large amount of salt deposits on the lake bed. It's in the middle of nowhere, even for Leh.I was told that it's a very old lake. It's worth a visit before it disappears completely (hopefully not!)."
Tso_kar_Lake,Charline091,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,Land of nomads with less tourist,"I love this place and it's region. Because this is the region where Himalayan nomads stay. So on the way you can visit nomadic tents made out of Yak wool and schools with beautiful Himalayan faces! The lake and it's surroundings beauty are can never be expressed enough. lush green pasture with birds, kyang and many more animals to witness according to your luck! so test your luck"
Tso_kar_Lake,huys25,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Drying up and loosing its attraction soon,"This is a popular stop when travelling from Keylong in the direction of Leh, since there are no othe places for overnight camping.The lake, however, is drying up and the water has retracted beyond the swampy grasslands, as compared to 5-8 years ago when the lake was still full.Because you hardly can see the water, the rating for the lake I consider poor but around the lake some wild horses or Black Headed Cranes, and the greatly eroded mountains are interesting.We were the last visitors (end September) to the Lotus tented camp before it closed for the winter until May next year. At night it was freezing already."
Tso_kar_Lake,Avijitsen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,High amount of salt Deposits,"On our way from Tso Moriri towards Sarchu, we halted here to admire the beautiful frozen lake of Tso Kar, its quite smaller than the famous Pangong and Tso Moriri lake, but nevertheless quite beautiful due to its remoteness and if lucky one can spot wildlife too."
Tso_kar_Lake,shubha22,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,Amazing lake,Tsokar lake is one of the most beautiful lake I have ever seen. Although to reach there is bit hectic.You will not find much people there. You can have soulful talk to yourself in this place. It's calm quite and beautiful scenery.
Tso_kar_Lake,Sushmita Biswas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,A tough terrain to thrive,"We , a group of 8, reached Tsokar from Jespa ....took about 13 to 14 hours of non stop drive. The terrain massively changed from mere mountains to a severe cold dessert...A few in our group got sick here....its the highest place in Ladakh which is inhabited...something around 18,600 ft above sea level.The tents we were offered were gud...the service was also gud ...they helped us with all the possible they could.Should indulge in very light food...lOts and lots of water is must.I enjoyed the stay...yet i would say, its much a skippable place."
Tso_kar_Lake,angtravel18,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Not impressed ....,"..... by either the lake, surrounding scenery or the camp itself.Firstly, it is a long drive - over a terrible dusty road - from the main Manali-Leh highway. And when you get there, the lake is unimpressive - small with little in the way of birdlife - and the mountains in the background are not spectacular. I was there late summer, so little in the way of snow. The land is dry and unattractive with little vegetation. The lake cannot be seen from the campsite. The campsite on first appearances looks great! No so!Positives: tents are large and clean, and there is enough bedding. And a hot water bottle was provided.Negatives: nothing in the tent on which to put night-time essentials like water bottle, alarm, torch, spectacles etc. Small table recommended. Also nowhere to put suitcase except floor (back-breaking for older folk!). Tents SO close together that you can hear everything from the people inside on both sides! And one cannot even get between them to get to the ablution facilities. The toilet facilities were really poor. They are some distance from the tents; in poor condition: some tilting over, doors that don't close properly, no paper, no adequate lighting for midnight visits, no running water in 2 of the basins. All in all well below acceptable standards.The dining tent was not too bad: large and comfortable., but no heating (and it gets COLD here!). Dinner and breakfast were acceptable considering the distance that ingredients must come from.The staff were friendly and helpful."
Tso_kar_Lake,Amit S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,Visit only if you think about wildlife. ,"I was here with my wife in September 2015. This lake was not so great compared to pangong and tso-moriri. The salt deposits were all around the lake. That's the reason why one can find lots of wildlife activity (mammals &  birds). If you are not a wildlife enthusiast and have already visited pangong and tso-moriri then this lake won't interest you. This was the coldest place in my whole trip, the water in toilet got frozen at night ;-) if you are travelling from tso-moriri to Leh then definitely you can take a short trip to Tso-kar on the way.

Tso_kar_Lake,RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Couples,"Relax, meditate or just get lost - go to Tsokar Lake","This lake is located near Thugje village and has camping sites, home stays etc.we just passed by this lake enroute from Two Moriri to Leh via Taglang La pass. The place is extremely pictursque and bereft of humdrum of cities. A great spot for nature lovers and photographers. You may spot wild animals near the lake. This used to be a source of raw salt for people of Ladakh a few years back. There are very few restaurants who serve very basic food."
Tso_kar_Lake,syamantak_mukherji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Family,The Thundering Tsokar,"By far the best place to see wild life in Ladakh Tsokar glistens like a jewel oasis amongst the vast expanse of the dry arid terrain. If you drive carefully you can access this place from Jispa in around 6-7 hours after crossing Baralacha Pass, Suraj Taal, Sarchu and Paang, If you are there in mid june then five star camps awaits you with luxirious rooms and attached toilets, But if you brave a little more chill then a visit from Leh ( around 4-5 hrs away ) in Nov - Feb may reward you with majestic views of the Kiangs, Marmots, Red Foxes, Wolves and the very very elusive snow leopards. Avifauna like ruddy shelled ducks, siberaian black necked cranes are all present some as residental and others as migratory. The stay itself is a bliss as you see the salt water lake glistening like a pearl and surrounded by mountains with snow on top of it. Be a little careful and carry an oxygen cylinder and some mountain altitude sickness pills before venturing out. Acclaimatisation for 2-3 days in Manali and Jispa is essential. Due to the salinity of the Tso Kar, most of the resident fauna is found in its tributaries and in Startsapuk Tso. There are large breeding colonies of grebes and Brown-headed gulls, and some Strip geese, rust geese and terns. In the vicinity of the lake Black-necked Cranes and Tibetan grouse are relatively common. The basin of the Tso Kar and the adjoining More Plains constitute one of the most important habitats of the kiang, Tibetan gazelles, Tibetan wolves and foxes; there are steppe marmots in the higher reaches. The Tso Kar is connected by an inlet stream at its south-west end to a small lake, Startsapuk Tso, and together they form the 9 km2 More plains pool, which is dominated by the peaks of two mountains, Thugje (6050 m) and Gursan (6370 m). From the geology of the More Plains, it can be concluded that the Tso Kar in historical times ranged up to this high valley. Until a few years ago the lake was an important source of salt, which the Changpa nomads used to export to Tibet. The nomadic settlement of Thugje is located 3 km in the north. Due to the high altitude, the climate is extreme in the winter; temperatures below -40°C are not uncommon. In the summer the temperature rises above 30°C, with extreme fluctuations during the day."
Tso_kar_Lake,Cyril Kuhn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,For the adventure seekers,"This lake is one that is rarely visited (thank god for that!) but infinitely beautiful. It is tiny in comparison to Tso Moriri or Pangong Tso (the more popular choices) which are both quite vast but no less pleasurable to visit. The lake is quite a walk away from the main road largely because each step is double the effort for the sand keeps shifting under your feet and letting you sink in a little. As you get very close to the lake there is mud which is deceptively loose so one must watch out as one will otherwise sink in and get this very smelly grey mud on your shoes. However i have never been to such a strange lake which quite literally stinks (of sulphur) and where you cannot really enter the water because the mud close to it is too soft. A bizarre but extremely fascinating and beautiful little lake. For those who have time and are truly out on an adventure to see something extraordinary, this should definitely be on your list. A little off the main Manali - Leh highway, you can either start making your way there from Debring or otherwise if you are visiting Tso Moriri it is a good idea to head back this way, i.e. via Tso Kar and then Debring."

Tso_kar_Lake,Dhruv6373,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Beautiful lake - but too small to consider it as a must visit !,"Very small but beautiful lake.  This simple and short words define the Tsokar lake. I passed it on my way to Tsomoriri which is a much larger lake and equally beautiful. There are a few lakes in this region and Tsokar is sure not worth spending your night there nor specially visiting the place. Though I would not want to take the picturesque location and the beauty away from my words. It sure is very peaceful and serene location to laze and relax. In simple words, if it's on your way, do visit Tsokar, otherwise don't consider it as an itinerary must travel spot."
Tso_kar_Lake,Vishalda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 • Friends,A blessing to be here,"Tsokar is not 'touristic' like Pangong Tso or Tso Moriri and perhaps this is what makes ""TsoKar - White Lake"" so blessed because it's small, pure and personal. Yet another beautiful gift of Mother Nature. There are only a few yak sheds, a monastery and a couple of nomadic families in the surrounding. An overnight camp here is recommended. Also recommended is to be on Diamox"
Tso_kar_Lake,nowdrifting,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2013 • Friends,Heavenly at sunset,"Reached Tso Kar driving from Tso Moriri via Sumdo village - end September 2013. The late rays of the setting sun, struggling to peer through the clouds, the proximity of the mountains with their peaks proudly rising above those clouds and yes, the quiet lake awaiting the onset of the winter. What a sight !"
Tso_kar_Lake,Pratik_krp,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Couples,Best place to watch High Altitude Birds,We had visited this place when we were returning from Tso Moriri to Leh. This place is 30 Km. west to Leh-Manali highway so anyone can visit this place from Leh-Manali highway.This place is also having tent accommodations for night stay.This is salted lake of Ladakh. Surprisingly this place is having more birds than Tso Moriri. Because of that this place is popular for bird watcher.
Tso_kar_Lake,dranujkiran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun-11,The hidden gem of Ladakh,"If you thought Pangong and Tso moriri were remote , wait till you see this stunning , desolate lake in the windswept '' back of the beyond '' area of Ladakh . There is precious little evidence of civilization here ; only the Gods in the heavens above . The accomodation is on the western end , near the exit to the Manali Leh Road [ 3kms from the lake ] . A row of fairly sturdy and new tents that may or may not be there . Advance booking is a must from Leh - even then be prepared for very basic food and camp like toilet facilities . But the Lake makes up for it .  It is some 200 feet higher than tsomoriri and encompasses a condiderably greater marshy area . Excellent territory to see the Black Necked crane - once considered one of the rarest birds in the world till some relatively large colonies were discovered in Bhutan and Tibet . There will be only 3-4 breeding pairs in Ladakh Summers so it is a priveleged sighting .  Kiang will be seen here for sure . They come down for a drink in the evening and maintain a very studied arms length from the local feral ponies . The best way to see this lake is to come via Tsomoriri and depart via the Morey Plains and Tang lang la pass to reach Leh by the ZManali road . Please do not land here in late afternoon as the availability of accommodation is never assured . So keep enough time to carry on to Leh .  Do not miss the native sulphur mines on the way in .Ironically , though very few people come to see this lake , it is clearly visible from the plane approaching [ right side ] or departing [ left side ] Leh Airport ."

I keep hoping they will realize that this doesn't help them. Yesterday, I went to buy mangoes from a guy I don't usually buy from. His were the best looking mangoes in the market, but he refused to sell them to me with the ridiculous excuse that they were 'hard'. In the past he has refused to sell to me on similar specious excuses. Maybe he was saving them for his regulars, but then they shouldn't have been out on public display."
Library_Road_Vegetable_Market,Mastco78,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Magical place,"I think this is probably the center of the city. I would stay close to this road as it has many options in restaurants, cafes, and some shops. Definitely very touristy but you still flavor the local culture and at nights they have some activities. While I was there they had a traditional show with music and dance, they invited attendees to join the dance show, it was pretty unique. For photographers the market is a great opportunity to capture nice shots. The streets around it also have many surprises, fresh baked bread, the tibetan market, the Sikhism temple, etc"

Personally, I try to buy as much as possible from the ladies in the main bazaar. The guys who have these stalls on Library Road are some of the most rude and unfriendly people I've met in Ladakh—probably the only rude and unfriendly ones, come to think of it. The quality of produce is, of course, variable, but that's to be expected. They want people to buy larger quantities and not try to pick out the best. It used to be in one big shed farther up the road, but they tore that down and the stalls moved down nearer to the library."

Stok_Kangri,Nick B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,When brothers unite,"Climbed it this summer with my 3 close cousins. This one ticks all the boxes, scenic beauty, challenging , amazing people on the trail and more. We heard it may close down for a bit on account of ecological damage so if you do manage to go please respect the mountain. Do not underestimate it though, it is on the boundary between trekking and climbing and altitude speaks for itself. We got rain lower down and snow from base camp onwards so made the last section technical with use of ropes and crampons etc. the summit ridge is steep and exposed and tricky  under snow and ice, so you need to be comfortable with at least a class 3 scramble. Summit day is also long with 1200 meters to climb and you need to summit early morning if snowed in or you turn back. Little objective danger though I. E no hanging seracs etc. I suggest the Stok la route which is prettier and longer and much better for acclimatising as you cross a 4900 meter pass and descend ahead of climbing. Take the time to acclimatise well or you will suffer and hate it on summit day. Overall truly amazing and also keep a few days for Leh and surrounds as this is a culturally fascinating area."

Stok Kangri peak located at ladakh at an altitude of 6153 mtrs and is a hotspot for trekkers.The trek starts from Stok village located approx 25 kms from leh town. Very beautiful trek with variety of landscapes. The trek leads from stok village to chang ma, mankorma and stok kangri base camp. Acclimatization is the key factor for this trek. One needs to get proper acclimatize before and during the trek to complete it. The trek grade is moderate to difficult. the day of the summit is very challenging and the trek is of difficult level. Having a rest day/training day is good a base camp before attempting the summit. for summit one needs to start the trek midnight around 12:00. If snow will be there one needs crampons, harness and ropes to climb.The view from the summit is amazing with kang yatse peak, karakoram ranges, mountains at tibet all are visible. I loved the experience of this trek and able to make the summit."

Not much technical, but still quite challenging, an expedition to this peak can be considered as an initial test before going on to capture higher and more difficult mountains. But that doesn’t mean Stok Kangri is a cakewalk. This mountain stands at an altitude of 20,128 feet (6,135 meters), the trek still requires great mental and physical stamina. The breathtaking scenery throughout the trip does make all the hard work worth it in the end. Try the eight-day expedition from Adventure Nation to see the best of Stok Kangri."

This is world's highest trackable peak. This is really good tracking peak in summer but in winter it's become some technical and difficult to climb. Those who are doing above 8000 meter above peak they preferably doing Stok Kangri winter expedition. It is situated in Hemi's reserve area. For this you have to go to Stok village from Leh by road. Tracking start from Stok village. You can reach Mankorma base camp in one day, you may set advance base camp to next day. for summit you have to cross one glacier which have found crevasses, you have to ropeup to cross over. It's really so good and amazing experience."

Its got a very calm and peaceful atmosphere, there are hardly any people around except for few who wahs their cars and clothes there. The ghats have been constructed nicely , the red stone structures are attractive to look at , but thats it, theres nothing much even the water of teh great Sindhu river is not clean there, as its a ghat a small stream they have diverted. Overall its a place where you can stop for half an hour, dip your legs in the cold waters and move on. Considering its Sindhu Darshan place they could have done much more and ensured that its clean and maintained well."

Our guide-cum-driver laughed at my silliness but I was so enthralled that I could not care less."

If one is looking for a spot where they can dip their feet in some icy cold water of the indus river then this is the place. Not technically a riverside , this is a ghat were usually local villagers come to wash their clothes or their cars.. The water isnt purely clean or suitable for drinking but yes it is completely refreshing when you soak your feet in the glacial waters.. A good place to lounge around and sit in the sun during the day or in the evening. Do give it a try :)"

The animals here are primarily those who are not capable of any work, due to old age or disabilities, and have been abandoned by their owners. Not only do they get medical care and food here, but are also kept safe from street dogs. There are some baby donkeys here too mostly born here only and some pregnant ones as well. The male species are distinguished with red ribbons, while the female ones with yellow.

Best to approach from the outskirts and cross the bridge. There were about 20/25 being cared for on our visit. All looked in good shape. Best NOT to arrive with 2 kilos of carrots in a bag if you don't want a donkey mugging - they can bite. Would be better to give food to the staff so it can be given out in a more orderly fashion. They are sweet little creatures and most like to be petted. We left RS500. Im sure they're grateful for all the help they can get. All they need in Leh now is someone to take care of the dogs .... 😕 "

After much asking around and lots of walking from that rather misleading sign, we reached the Donkey Sanctuary. And it was worth all the effort. The place is much different from what rest of Leh offers you. The people of Ladakh are kind and friendly, and so are its donkeys.

When they are old and/or injured they cannot do their job and are mostly abandoned. This is a place were donkeys can get good care, food and love, to spend the rest of their working life in peace, and the injured are treated to go back to earning life. The area is in the higher part of Leh, with views of the mountains and the Shanti Stupa. The donkeys welcome visitors in a friendly way. We took carrots for them which were eaten quickly. We  walked around, could touch and stroke every animal and interact closely. Of course donations were accepted with many thanks, but we didn't feel pressed to give. I'd advise to take children here, they'll love to be close to animals, In  Leh,there aren't  so many possibilities to see and touch those. A lovely spot for good views as well."

Serving as a ‘Wazir’ under the ambitious Gulab Singh, Maharaja of Jammu, he subdued the Gyalpo ruler of Ladakh followed by successful campaigns at Kargil, Baltistan and Skardu. The Zorawar fort still lives on as a legacy of this warrior - the indomitable Zorawar Singh, whose military prowess and expertise in mountain warfare has become stuff of legend. Constructed in 1836, Zorawar fort is a national monument now maintained by the Indian Armed Forces. The fort also houses a museum dedicated to brave dogra and ladakhi warriors. Entry is free. Traces of a moat is visible round the fort, which is constructed with mud and stone as per local style. Inside the premises , the army maintains stables.

His battles with the Chinese wherein he succeeded in driving them out of Ladakh is chronicled by many historians . He was a trusted General of Maharajah Ranjit Singh and led an expedition to prevent the Chinese and Tibetan armies from annexing Ladakh. We were told that there is a sound and light show but no one could guide us about the timings. The fort today houses some Army offices and quarters.

Lotsawa_Lha_Khang,Chetan Kanakia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-15,Path to self realization with solitude as your soul guide.,"For the Indian tourist many of those who expect a ""tourist"" destination which brims with Shopping or money spending activities beware..This is not a place for you ! Welcome are those who seek solitude, a  method to connect with the inner self and that with the aid and tool what the great Buddha left a treasure trove of knowledge a glimpse into the 600 year old miniature paintings on the wall and the narrow lane which can have no more than 2 bicycles across is the path to oneself. A generous monk if requested would take you around and explain to his best the purpose of the Alchi temple and the very fact that little has changed here makes you wonder that this is what it could be when the advancement of generations are kept away and true civilization blooms. A short walk to the south of the temple leads to the river side faced by a steep cliff that overlooks the monastery. Not many luxury offering hotels here so make the bookings well in advance. In fact it would be more than inviting to stay here a few days and begin to realise what lies within is much more than what lies beyond."

Rangdum_Gompa,Prasanna N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,A world in its own right,"   Ringdom Gompa is located at the gates of Zanskar valley about Twenty Five kilometres short of Pensi La pass. The monastery which belongs to the Gelukpa sub sect of the Mahayana sect is astride the NH 301 at the peak of a hillock. The Gompa was established in the 17th century by Lobzang Geluk Eashy Takspa who is regarded as the Eight reincarnation of Nari Rinpoche, younger brother of HH Dalai Lama. The Gompa was established during the reign of King Tsewang Namgyal. This was the first Gompa to be established in this region which subsequently led to the birth of Gompas all across the Zanskar region. 	  The Gompa has under its fold a school which offers education up to Class Eigth. There are 39 students in the school presently. The Gompa is regularly endowed with generous assistance from foreign as well as Indian nationals and organisations. The Lions Club, Italy and Casa Del Tibet Italy have established a clinic within the premises of the monastery.  Ulli Salbrechter, an Austrian national was instrumental in renovating the Gompa in the year 2012. A Delhi based NGO 18000 Ft has been extensively contributing to the betterment and welfare of the students studying at the Gompa.	  On 07 July 2000, the Gompa was the target of a militant attack. Militants originating from Kishtwar abducted and killed three monks and a German national. Post this incident the Army has been maintaining its presence as the sentinels of the Zanskar valley. In addition to offering security to the locals, the Indian Army is also actively engaged in executing a plethora of people friendly activities in the Zanskar region.	Though there are a few places to do an overnight stay in Zollydok village close to the Gompa a more comfortable option would be to stay put at Kargil and visit Rangdum and get back. The Gompa is about 5 hours drive from Kargil.Alternately one can plan to hit Padum Valley and take an Hour's break at the Gompa on the way up or down.    This year has already seen a lot of snow and the winters will be extended and severe. The best time to visit is from mid June till mid August."

It is better to reach this place early, by noon so that you dont miss further attractions. The journey along the shyok river and Siachen river gave us mesmerising scenic visuals. There were many bird sightings against the backdrop of barren mountains. Leh berry grew in bunches and we could pluck some and eat them on the way. The hot springs was very well organised and private pool rooms created separate for men and women. Our women pool was small, neat and clean. The Men's pool was not that clean because some indian group of men who just came out when our men went in had peed all over the walls and it was stinking of urine. One man was bathing naked too causing embarrassment to others. The lady caretaker was kind enough to allow our men to join the women's pool as family because no one else was there. Sulphur springs are very good for curing skin problems and the Ladakhi people also cure joint pains in sulphur springs.We dipped ourselves in the hot pool for 20 minutes. Not only all our tiredness vanished but also we felt like stoned completely when we came out. I have been to many hot springs across different countries but the privacy and cleanliness offered here beat all else."

Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,janaknmistry,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,First and the Only step in Siachen,I wasn't aware about this location initially but when we stayed in Nubra valley for the night it was one of the locals who gave a brief about this place which is not too much of a de-tour from Hunder to Leh but it is worth every second of when you travel and visit this springs. The route to this place is shyok river bridge which is the only bridge which connects Siachen army post to the world by road. A heavily guarded bridge which when crossed would take you to the other side and in to some of the less known villages which are so very different than the one on the route from Manali - leh or Leh to hunder. Sulphur Springs do not have a great flow but they are sure super relaxing. Worth the visit if time permits 
Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,HelyDoshi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-15,Not worth the visit,"We travelled for more than 1 hour from our Nubra hotel to reach the Panamic Hot sulphur springs. They were really not worth the drive. There was a very small stream of hot water and that was it!!! there was a nice restaurant there with a lady serving all the famous Ladhakhi food like momos, thukpas, thick Ladakhi bread with goats curd. The food was what we enjoyed there more compared to the hot springs. :)"

Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,frmsgp,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Average place,"I didn't liked the fact that they have commercialised the place for hot water instead of having it in natural form. The water was coming from a storage tank, so I thought it is being boiled somewhere. The fact was that they were storing the hot water in the tank & then sending it down through the pipe in the bathroom. I couldn't smell of Sulphur at all.The washroom available was dirty however for taking bath they had lots of rooms, separate for male & female"
Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,RahulCMeka,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,Go....Relax....Rejuvenate....Don't dare to miss this!!,"This being my first visit to any hot springs....I was so excited and this place has amazed me.J&K Tourism has built a new structure during 2013-14 to divert this chemical rich water for a better use. Inside this structure, a separate mini pool / pond was built for men & women and continuous flow of fresh hot water was ensured. A nominal fee of about INR 30 will be charged to use this facility for about an hour. Changing rooms are available though no facility of bathing towels was made, you can store your valuable safely. A bath in this water helps in curing some major illness including joint pains etc which were more detailed / displayed at the entrance of this building.Only thing you have to do at this place is to Relax.We are four of us on a bike trip in Ladakh and was surprised to have this facility as were are highly exhausted because of our travel through extreme conditions of Himalayas. Our visit to Panamik has helped us feel fresh and were rejuvenated.No restaurant / hotel is available to serve you food. Staff at that place has offered us some snacks at nominal cost.You will be highly disappointed if you go by the words of your tour guide / travel agent, as he will never insist you to go inside this facility. All the guided tourists visited at that time of our visit, returned from that spot in less than 10 mins by just having a look at the origin the stream of Hot water. They have certainly missed a fortune!!"
Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,VidPamsKris,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Couples,Not worth the effort,"Panamic hot spings is in the panamic valley and if you have seen hot springs before, this is not worth the effort. Even if you have not seen a hot spring, it is not worth the effort if you are on a typical 5 day tour of laddakh. First, it extends your travel time to an additional 4 hours (from Leh) and second, the place has nothing to offer other than a hot water spring. The so called medicinal bath is not worth the effort as the water can be too hot to handle and bath tubs aren't that clean. Instead you can spend the additional 4 hours enjoying the scenic Nubra & hunder Valley."

Inspired by one of us who plunged into the spring, all of us plunged & it was just too good. The place was not crowded so we really did have the SPA effect. Came out rejuvenated & refreshed.. On a small hike up the stretch behind the building, we did find the springs we had been dreaming about.. Came down, only to be served by fresh momos from the small restaurant aside .So, do not miss this place.."

The last bit of the road not being good at all. Your cab driver will ask you for about 2000 extra for this (we settled for 100) but this wasn't worth even Rs 500. Climb up a few slipper steps and you will see a small trail of hot water coming out of a small opening in the hill and disappearing about 150 cms down the line.If you want to take a bath you have to pay and bathe from  a tank where hot water is pre stored, Some overpriced momo is sold if you want to have a quick snack.This place is better avoided"
Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Indie-Brindie,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Couples,As much charm as a Romanian orphanage,"Avoid this sad shabby affair. The 'baths' are housed in a concrete block with about as much charm as a Romanian orphanage. The male 'changing cubicles' were stuffed full of broken furniture, and the water in the baths was only ankle deep when we arrived. I took one look at it, decided that I stood a good chance of picking up a foot infection and left. Whilst I waited for my travel companions who gamely lay down in the inch deep water, I wandered round the back. Here there are open tanks and pipes. It would be so much better to adapt and create a bathing pool under the open sky. I suspect, however, that their preoccupation with segregated sex bathing is what has resulted in the orphanage style blocks that they currently have. We tagged the Panamik hot springs and Sumoor monastery onto our 2 day Nubra valley excursion for an extra £20 (split between 6). Don't bother! They are both a waste of time. Stick with Diskit monastery and the Hunder sand dune camel rides and buy a beer in Leh with what you save"

The moment we entered the building to visit the so called Natural hot water spring I had the sinister feeling that we were cheated. We entered a small room with a small bath tub like concrete structure. There was a pipe from which hot water was coming out , a small bucket was inside the tub and .........that was it. It was nothing but a bathroom with a small cemented tub. We were completely shocked and clueless. Travelling 40 kms one side which took us around 80 minutes to see such big joke was completely unexpected.We spent total 5 minutes and came out."

Considered to be sacred by the city's residents,  the tree was the first tree to grow in the area. At the time of the Guru's visit the high desert had no trees as only small shrubs and bushes would grow at the high, arid altitude.

It answered a lot of our questions regarding the various hues of the Ladakh Landscapes. Mr. Phunchok Angchok (  Founder and Collector) , was present at the time and he patiently ( and humbly) answered all our questions. We were amazed by his vast knowledge on the subject.His collection was so amazing, that we took more than an hour to cover.I sincerely hope the Government /officials in Ladakh assist him in properly establishing a Permanent Museum. That it can become one of the Major tourist attraction in Leh is a given with the right publicity!After all, who would'nt be interested in understanding the topography of Ladakh- one of the main reasons why tourists come to Ladakh in the first place!!!A big Thank You to Mr. Phunchok for adding more Flavour to our mesmerising Ladakh Trip."

Ladakh_Rocks_Minerals_Museum,Sahana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021 • Couples,Very informative and a marvelous achievement by one man.,"We happened to visit this place by chance. And I must agree that it was worth visiting. It has a wonderful collection of stones and rocks and all done by one man, without any support from the government. He was sweet enough to explain everything in detail and left us baffled about things we didn't know. With no educational background of geology, the sheer enthusiasm and interest that has led to such a beautiful place is just awesome. A must visit."

Ladakh_Rocks_Minerals_Museum,Damia Benet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Amazing,"It is extremely rare to be in the middle of Ladakh and find a Rocks & Minerals Museum of such a good quality. Not only because the specimens are gorgeous but also because the owner, Punchok, who invite me to have a cup of tea and explained the project, knows about the scientific side of it. He has contrasted the speciments according to the Moh's scale and their specific weight. The minerals are identified and its task due to their scarcity is not easy at all. The description of the specimen is accompanied with a definition, what makes it very engaging for the general public but also for schools or anyone who wishes to learn a bit more about rocks and minerals.As I am an enthusiast of minerals I asked Punchok to do some mineral chasing around Ladakh, as my schedule was tight, we had only one day, but it was sufficient time as to see beautiful quartz, pirites, hematites, garnets and rock formations. Punchok knows his land milimeter to milimeter and since he has been a rock and mineral collector by nature since young, he knows the best where to find them. Another good point is that he is a local and has been working in the region as a teacher, so he is respected and is the perfect guide. My experience was just unbelievable; to meet Punchok and his glorious museum was beyond any expectation! Thanks Punchok, hope to see you again!"

De_Pashmina_Emporium,Sheena D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,Wonderful rug with grest service,"We found Omar's website on internet when we decided to buy another Indian rug. It was a big decision to buy an expensive, large silk rug without having seen it other than photos and answers to our questions to Omar. It was a bit of a challenge getting the bank send the money, (but that is probably a good thing  given the scams you hear about).Omar was very patient about this with lots of questions from me!The rug arrived within a week to Scotland and is absolutely beautiful. We had to pay VAT but hope to reclaim import duty ad it is categoruzed as handcrafts. Would definstely recommend."

My wife and I spent about 2-3 hours and Omar was so helpful, so accommodating and most importantly so genuine. He made it very clear that we were not under any obligation to buy just because we were looking at quite a few pieces. He literally ""rolled out the carpet for us""! We ended buying one Kilim and one mix of Kilim and carpet. It was a lovely experience to see and hear about the different carpets and Omar is so knowledgeable, polite and warm...."

I think that perhaps he is a master salesmen - so good that you don't even realise you are under his influence! Anyway that is fine because the reason you stepped into the shop is because you're interested in Rugs and Pashminas and if you walk out of there with a purchase it will be a quality item that you can admire for a lifetime.

I walked in, planning to settle for a cushion cover since I was sure that I wouldn't like the shawls, and the carpets would be too expensive and too much of an hassle to ship abroad... But ended up buying a carpet for my new home and 2 shawls in the end. Not sure if it is the best price you can get in town, since I wasn't in the mood to check any other shops where the people try to push you to buy something, but definitely a must visit for the wonderful service by Omar and the beautifull items. He listens well to your preferences, is honest about the products and willing to accomodate to your wishes."

Truth be told, I only wanted to compare the prices I had seen in another shop, but I ended up staying in bus shop for more than an hour. Omar took the time to explain to me the different types of shawls that were sold, and I felt that physically differentiating between the softness of the shawls and textures helped me appreciate why prices were so different! I ended up buying 3 shawls at a reasonable (I hope!) price and enjoyed my cup of Kahwa tea he offered me. No pressure felt at all, no hard sells. "

De_Pashmina_Emporium,Vivien C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Wonderful place to buy a carpet or pashmina in Leh,"When you go into this shop to look at carpets or shawls, you will get so much more than just buying something from Ladakh. Omar is such a gentleman and in tune with his customers' needs, so he quickly understands your preferences and selects certain items which he knows you would like. This helps one choose from an overwhelming array of neatly folded items on shelves upon colourful shelves of stacked carpets and shawls. Omar would never badger you in order to make a sale. This doesn't mean though that you won't receive the most professional, informed and generous attention when you are looking at the exquisite items in his shop. He has a very good eye and collects, amongst hundreds of different shawls and carpets, some of the most unique once-off carpets.  If you are like me, you will go into this shop quite a few times before you actually buy something. Looking for that special carpet that just ""speaks"" to you is a pleasure and takes time - and Omar and his team know this. You will be treated to cups of Kashmiri tea in the process. I was really lucky when I was invited to share a delicious Kashmiri feast, seated on the floor, surrounded by all those beautiful carpets with his team one evening.  I give you, your shop(s) and your team 100% Omar."

De_Pashmina_Emporium,Janet J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,great shop with excellent quality products,"my experience of Omar and all of his colleagues was one of professionalism, honesty, and excellent salesmanship….the latter meaning that Omar is passionate about his products and his knowledge and love for them is a winning combination…one wants to own one of his pashmina's or carpets because he gives each of them his time and care and imparts this to the purchaser.  He will tell you all he knows but he will also tell you what he might not know i.e. he might not know exactly the age or origin of a carpet and he will say so as opposed to saying what on might want to hear.  He has a fantastic, trusting work ethic and deserves to be noted as having one of the finest shops in Leh. Going there is pleasant, reassuring buying experience - even the tea served is excellent! Thank you Omar & your team"

In the end, we both bought - he bought a small tribal prayer carpet and a Pashmina, while I bought a simple dark blue Pashmina with a subtle paisley pattern woven Ito it. Omar gave us all afternoon.

However,  De Pashmina Emporium was the first where I was offered a cup of tea, and soon Omar and I  were sharing our backgrounds (he of Srinigar, me of New Zealand). Omar has a passion for the many carpets and pashminas you can find in his shop, an unhurried manner and a way of drawing you in. He is very knowledgable. I was the only person in the shop and there was no pressure to buy - but I did take home a beautiful pashmina at a fair price. When travelling, it's the stories we remember, and going to De Pashimina Emporium is a great way to add a fresh page to your travel diary. Recommended."

De_Pashmina_Emporium,Sid B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,"Excellent, informative experience","We ended up spending the entire morning and afternoon at one shop, the De Pashmina Emporium, run by a Mr. Omar Yaseen. We were just observing the enticing display of vibrant colors and textures of shawls displayed in his shop window as we were strolling around Changspa Road, and he saw us looking, so with an irresistible salesman’s charm and his soft blue eyes and quiet melodic voice, he slowly drew us in, like a fisherman reeling in a reluctant fish! He made the sale perfectly – he sat us down and explained the different qualities, what an actual pashmina is (from the wool of a pashmina goat, which can only be bred at high altitudes) and how to tell the authenticity, as well as explaining the other qualities which were blends with other materials like other goat wool and silk, and then how the cheaper ones were rougher as they contained ‘viscous’ which are impurities. He also offered us ‘kahwa’ tea, the famous Kashmiri tea with cinnamon and cardamom and other aromatic spices which gave it a distinct taste. We liked his stuff so much we got shawls for everyone, and he was so good that he even got us to buy a huge carpet for our new house! And then another! The shawls we got were warm and comfortable and a big hit with our family. I recommend this as an essential shopping stop for all who visit Leh. Thanks Omar!"

I was very undecided about what to buy because I wanted to buy everything what I saw! Great service and great products."

We met Omar several times and bought several carpets the past couple of years.We feel he is a true gentleman. His service is excellent. We were looking for a certain carpet size and he kept searching and followed up 6 months later to share some options. I feel that his kindness and patience are a real pleasure, as most shops don't have such attitude or service. His selection is also very diverse and extensive. Yet, if he can't help you, he even directs you to another shop.We are happy customers!"

De_Pashmina_Emporium,Eliza S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Solo,Design Lovers - Exceptional Quality & Service a store in Ladakh to not miss,"Omar keeps a gorgeous collection of high quality authentic shawls and rugs. I absolutely fell in love with his unique collection and the essence behind the craftsmanship and the rawness of the trade that the area is so famous for. Every rug has a story and for me it was with great pleasure to hear these stories and support local craftsmanship and the artisans. I first visited Omar's emporium in 2012 as a young traveler with a fine eye for design. I work in the design industry and to this day I can still not count the amount of compliments I receive every time I wear one of the shawls I purchased from the store. They truly are pieces of fine art work. Omar the owner is a wonderful person. His charisma and passion for his business, family, friends and customers is outstanding.I was in Ladakh for over 3 weeks trekking and on every return to Leh it was with great delight to visit Omar and his store.

I went in expecting the typical hard sell of most other shops I td gone into. instead I was offered a cup of tea. one cup of tea turned into 3 and 2 hrs later I left having purchased nothing but having made a fast friend. after that I introduced friends to Omar and his beautifully sourced wares. many have purchased said wares including me. I returned to Leh in 2012 and when I came into the shop it was like seeing family after far too long. I was immediately invited to Omar's birthday party and returned to the shop a number of times in the week I was there. I had my eye on a particular carpet in the shop that was beyond my budget at the time. Omar insisted I take it with me and send the payment when I could afford it. He is a good and honest business man but best of all, a friend"

Not only did we have a great conversation about culture and life in India, we found Omar to be quite honest about his products and was willing to negotiate on the prices. I chose one of the cheaper Pashmina's but the quality has held up and I am still using it almost a year later. Highly recommended. Thank you Omar!"

It's under the supposed protection of the Archeological Survey of India and theoretically closed to the public for now. However, the fence is broken in one or two places, so anyone can walk right in with no problem. No one was there when I went.It's quite an old stupa, and because it's crumbling they've plastered the stupa walls. There's some graffiti, and no way to go in. You can only walk around it. The location is peaceful, with nice views of the mountains."

Pangong_Tso,Aimless Vagabonds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,"Great place to visit, think before you decide to stay the night!","Pangong Tso has slowly become one of the highlights of Ladakh, and sans doubt, it is one of the most eye pleasing destinations. Talking about a stay here- Unless you are adventurous, I would recommend doing a day trip of the Pangong Tso and not spend the night here. Being remote, you have to make do with limited water and basic food."

Atleast I can't fine the appropriate words in the vocabulary to describe the beauty of Pangong lake. It is like many canvases within one big canvas. The colours of sky, water, and the mountains are unbelievably beautiful and one can't just stop looking at them. I could spend hours and hours just looking around as well as listening to the sound of water and breeze. Though a 24 hrs stay is enough here, but one can spend day after days to enjoy the beauty and calm here. "

Pangong_Tso,Ravsh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Ok Ok,"A mixed experience. Its a huge lake lengthwise-actually a small very small sea. Go there only if you enjoy beauty of nature, want to do meditation etc. Otherwise its just a lake. No activity at the lake except a few three idiot type activities like bum pose, scooter, ladakhi dress etc. There are numerous basic tents, cottages along the lake to stay-mostly average, lack of electricity, etc.-don't look for luxury. I would suggest at least a day's stay to enjoy the view as journey from both Leh and Nubra is 5-6 hours with some bad patches of road en-route. No shop except few restaurants. Road from Nubra along Shyok river is more beautiful, though road condition is not that good. Again travel 5-6 hours on difficult roads only if you like natural beauty."

Pangong_Tso,NayantSavani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,A sight to see,A calming serene lake with changing colour as per the sun rays. With mountains on both sides this lake is just 30% within India. A lot of tents and cottages have come up in this area for tourist to stay over. There is no full time electricity and food is available in each tent area. The place get cold and is very windy. Walking on the lake path is an experience. The 3 idiots famous final scene was shot here. Some share the opinion that it could be a day return journey fro Leh. Tend to agree with that view. However the roads leading to Pangong Tso is rough. Even coming in from Nubra valley carries the risk of being blocked out if water melting its was causes the roads to become non navigating.

Moreover there will be no mobile network (Jio, Airtel or BSNL) available in this area so plan accordingly."
Pangong_Tso,Sanjiv Pandey,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Friends,Amazing place,"What a place!! One has to see it to believe it. Road from  Leh to Pangong and beyond is being widened, not that it is in very bad shape as of now. Crystal clear water, cold as ice and changing hues with every passing minute – it is not easy to describe this magical lake. Accommodation here is basic because the government does not want to leave a permanent dent on the natural beauty perhaps. Tents and wooden cottages only. Our place of stay, Virgo Cottages were spic and span. Haider, the caretaker and Ajay, the cook from Jharkhand were amazing. Ajay cooked good food esp. the egg curry and Aloo ka Paratha were sumptuous. No network here. Jio works a bit at some isolated spots and of course, BSNL. Vodafone doesn’t work at all in Ladakh. Govt must tell these operators to have few satellite phones to take care of any emergency."

Pangong_Tso,Isha G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun-22,Magical place; Ernest request to tourists to keep this place clean,"The lake is truly magical and is a natural wonder. I have seen similar lakes in new zealand, but Pangong Tso surpassed all expectations.The journey to this place is a bit hard  because some roads are broken and are being constructed again, so the ride is quite bumpy. But that's true for most places in ladakh outside leh.I stayed overnight in a camp there and could not sleep. Perhaps it was due to low oxygen level which did sometimes make me uncomfortable. But we did not need an oxygen cylinder. It is an individual preference whether to stay overnight or return the same day. we definitely did not want to travel so much same day so stayed overnight.I also want to urge tourists to keep this place as pristine as it originally is and not throw plastic bottles and chips wrappers around."

The rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable. The food is really good and delicious with so much variety every time. The management is also great. We kept our luggages at the hotel and it was beautifully managed by them. I would absolutely recommend anyone staying in Leh to stay in this second home and have the best homely experience away from home.

Pangong_Tso,PoojaNoida,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Majestic Pangong,"Must visit place in Leh. Extremely beautiful, colour changing lake and mountains. Opposite side has snow peaks.By the time you reach Pangong from Nubra, it's already 3-4 pm. Though the mountains have sunlight but lake becomes dull. Best is to stay overnight at some wooden cottages, star gaze at night and checkout from your cottage around 9 am and enroute Leh, beautiful colours of lake can be seen. A clear, sunny day adds to its beauty.It's warmer also in the morning as compared to the evening time. Night becomes chilly and you need to be wrapped head to toe.Facilities are basic but if you are well wrapped, the blankets and hot water bottles provided by the cottages are sufficient. Food is good.Ample of small food joints/ dhabas are on the way to Pangong. Food is not a problem. But some stretches of roads are kutchha in between which makes the journey to and fro little tiring. Takes min 5 hours."
Pangong_Tso,533arpitm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,Worth the hype,"Some touristy spots leave you underwhelmed, but not this one. Wish there was a way to spend more time here. Absolutely loved it.."
Pangong_Tso,MaithiliSave,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Beautiful,"It is very beautiful lake. Loved it, but you need to take a pain to travel by gravel road. We visited at around 3 pm. Saw beautiful blue- green colours of the lake. We stayed in tents at the Lake. I think that can be avoided, there is nothing else to do. You can spend around 2-3 hrs at the lake, take pictures. If you decide to spend a night, book a cottage instead of tent. It is very windy sometimes at night and very cold."
Pangong_Tso,Arvind 1990,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May-22,Some very useful tips about Pangong Tso visit,"1. Best time of day to visit Pangong lake is between 12.0 Noon to 4.0 PM. We visit the western bank of Pangong Lake, so in forenoon when we click photos with lake in background, the sun is in our back side and faces and hills in background remain shady thus photos clicked do not look great.It is also the least windy time of the day, so one can shed woolens and click some memorable snaps.2. At Pangong never ever stay in tents. The nights at Pangong are quite chilly and windy which make stay at tents really a horrible experience. Now a lot of wooden huts are also available at Pangong, which make a better choice to stay there. At least they save you from the winds and comparatively much more comfortable.3. Do not go with high hopes about the accommodation in Pangong to prevent any disappointment and grudges later.These are temporary arrangements with bare minimum facilities. All of them offer the same basic amenities irrespective of your package.Do not get fooled by great photos available on travel sites of these camps, these are fake. So do not waste your time in choosing one over other. They all are almost the same.4. At Pangong electricity remains available between 7.0 PM to 10.0-11.0 PM only so carry your cameras, phones and power banks in fully charged status or charge them during these hours.5. Mobile phones do not work in Pangong. Forewarn your relatives and friends before leaving for Pangong that you will remain unreachable for next one day.Even the camps at Pangong do not have any kind of communication facilities.6. Why to stay at PangongA lot of your friends will advise you that with all these limitations it is not worth to stay at Pangong at all. But I beg to differ here as journey from both Nubra Valley and Leh to Pangong is approximately 5-6 hours long.Thus, doing Nubra-Pangong-Leh or Leh-Pangong-Leh in a day means 10-12 hours of travelling time on dangerous mountainous roads which is hard on you and your driver both.Apart from this at Pangong instead of enjoying the unparalleled beauty of the place and clicking some lifetime memories you will keep on worrying about getting late.You are here not to participate in a race but to enjoy and relax with your family and friends.Therefore, take it easy and appreciate the pristine beauty of majestic Pangong Tso tension free.Happy Journey"

Pangong_Tso,DEBASHISHMUKHERJEE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-21,"MESMERISING PANGONG AT 14,500FT","Oh!!! What a beautiful, serene, captivating landscape. The beautiful 150km long lake east west , with around 30 km within India is a mesmersing natural splendor worth capturing on the lens and treasuring as memory. The sheer blue of the sky and the hue of the lake changing colors as per the  time of day and the mood of the sky, is a sight to behold. The best approach to Pangong Tso is from Leh, through the 17,900ft Chang La pass , then reaching Durbuk-Tangtse. From this last habitat the distance  to the lake is around 45 min drive, through the jaw dropping landscape of Changthang plateau. The stay at lake is not recommended as there are very few accomodations and the altitude is so high, it can cause various types of altitude related sickness - viz., pulmonary edema, cerebral edema and acute mountain sickness . Beware!!! Old people should avoid a prolonged stay at this height."
Pangong_Tso,Nagmani2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Solo,Solo bike ride to Pangong Tso lake,"It was my solo bike ride to Pangong lake from Gujarat (Mithapur). It is always said that Journey is more beautiful than the destination. But when u reach at this destination,  u will find that its difficult to judge which one is more beautiful. In my opinion, both r equally beautiful and rewarding. Experiencing this lake can't be described in words, but felt only.. It's great, truly amazing. I didn't have much time and had to return same day, hence I couldn't enjoy much. But in my next trip, I will. If you have time, plan staying there. Everything is available there. Temperature during day time was between 10-12 celsius. Night may be a little colder. So nothing to worry about cold, one can enjoy even with kids. High altitude sickness may happen only at higher passes like Khardungla, Changla, even if u r staying there for longer. But it's advisable to carry medicines to counter this problem."

Words are less to describe the peace this place has to offer. It mesmerizing. Weather was extremely cold upto -6° at night and the water too is very cold even on hot days.The Hotels, Tents around Pangong are very basic, some of them do not have even power backup . Please do not expect any luxury in these stays. Bathing is also not a good idea if you are not used to extreme cold. Also, if you have health issues, staying here is a risk, but at times you will not have an option also, since it's based on how your iternary goes. We reached Pangong in the evening, and hence, we had to stay, since night travel was not possible towards Changla pass. Our phones were completely dead, even the bsnl ones. The locals over there has established business for clicking pics on 3 idiots scooters, trunks etc. and Kareena's red choli.

In fact is was both the most expensive and the worst meal we had. They try to be an 'upmarket alternative' to the traditional restaurants but the sheek kebab and tandoori malai, come on... you cannot serve that like this in this portions and with this (lack of) entourage. The waiters are good. "
Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,InMobi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Great place ,"I visited this place recently during first week of September with my father,wife & brothers (5ppl). Entire fort road and few other places were displaying live music night A4 sized printouts.Hardly two waiters were serving the entire lot and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to serve the starters despite of the owner/manager being informed. Here starters looks like main course and main course is just like starter. The owner comes and asks how's the food and fails to apologise on third class service and raises his own voice.With a nominal amount of 2650/- bill we walked out with a horrible experience ever on Leh ladakh Tour.If this is the only last option to eat food pls ensure you place an order with a very short height guy (waiter) north eastern may be. He seems to be little helpful only.The ratings should go in negative. It's not a restaurant but only a Bar for limited drinks."

Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,Lokeshg87,,,,"We visited this place for the Indian Classical Music night for which they had put up posters in the market. The place was easy to find and the atmosphere was good. The interiors were well done and the terrace seating was excellent. We ordered a steak, paneer tikka and mezze platter. The former two were excellent while the latter was okay as they had slightly altered the recipe. The presentation of the food was as good as it tasted and the music just made our appetites grow. Definitely recommend this to people looking for good food that is both tasty and clean. Meal for 2: Rs 750-900 without the drinksP.S. They do serve a variety of alcoholic beverages for those who are interested."

Ladakh Pashmina
The classic Ladakhi shawl is among the most exquisite textile, ever woven, the product of consummate skill and artistry applied to one of the world’s delicate fibres. It has been an object of desire for Mughal emperors and sikh maharajas, Iranian nobles, French emperors, Russian and British aristocrats and eventually for the increasingly prosperous bourgeoisie created on both sides of Atlantic by the industrial revolution. It has left a permanent imprint on the aesthetic sensibility of modern world from a motif developed in the ateliers of Ladakh shawl designers."

Quality is very good and everything is genuine, exactly what they say it is. You will never get cheated by these people.  There are no aggressive salespeople to deal with, just some wonderful, friendly Ladakhis. Even local people shop here. They source their pashmina directly from the nomads of the Changthang Plateau.

Kamzang_Journeys,viralimm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-19,Bicycle tour Ladakh 2019,"Wonderful trip. Cycle-eat-relax-repeat. I had met Kim Bannister and Lhakpa Dorji previously, but this was my first trip with them as formal leaders.  Kim and Lhakpa have all of the logistics for fun and relaxing Ladakh travel completely dialed in. The itinerary was challenging but not overly so, with the flexibility to ride in the support vehicle completely open at any time. Very importantly, our two drivers were 100% calm and safe.  Cycling ranged from 4 to 8 hours a day. The team uses cell phones and, when necessary, small radios for communications to coordinate camps and timing.  Each cyclist also has a personal radio for potential emergency use, but in reality, even though we had some tough days, there were zero emergencies. Camp is set up and struck efficiently by the crew.  Basically snacks and drinks await on arrival in the afternoon, with large, comfy personal tents set up in nice locations and your personal gear stashed inside. It has been said an army marches on its stomach, and for any trip of this sort, the food is of paramount importance.

Trekking with Kim (Kamzang Journeys) is such a treat; treks are well organised, carefully planned, and the attention to comfort in camp is second to none.  An individual tent for everyone with no single supplement and it's a large tent!  Plenty of room to have your kit in your tent with you and move around with head room for getting dressed.  Duffle bag to protect your kit bag during the day (when it's on a pony/mule).  Three good - and varied - meals a day ... choice of breakfast options; lunch while walking; unlimited tea/coffee in camp in the afternoons. Dinner is lovely soup ... a varied (largely vegetarian) dinner with soup, main course and vegetables/sides, followed by fresh fruit or a pudding.  Dedicated dining tent which is also a place to sit and relax out of the sun if needed ... rugs and camp seats make life homely and biscuits are there for snacks between meals!  Kim and her crew are a constant ... we've used the same horsemen since my first trip; only one change in crew members over that time ... they are a happy and professional team and it is like trekking with a group of friends.  Safety and hygiene standards are excellent too and I've never had a 'tummy bug' on one of Kim's treks!  Ladakh is fabulous and well worth the visit ... her July/August treks are particularly nice as the long summer days mean you are getting up in daylight, and coming home into camp in sunshine in the afternoon so hair can be washed, clothes etc and all will dry before dinner! It's also a lovely temperature ... cool nights and warm sunny days.  Perfect!"

Kamzang_Journeys,Dean S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Solo,Trekking in Ladakh,"I am back from a trek in Ladakh with Kim and Lhakpa and their team from Kamzang. It was my third trek with them (2 in Nepal and this one in Ladakh). The trip was well organized with only minor glitches, the food was good, the tents comfortable (even with a lot of rain and wind only minor leaks), and adequate support staff and animals. Ladakh is austere, gorgeous in its own way, and also a lot of work with the high elevation (the entire trek is above 4000 meters) being a challenge for me. Kim and Lhakpa do a good job of taking time to get people acclimatized as much as possible and they are flexible enough to deal with both fast and less fast (I might as well say slow) trekkers such as myself. They put a lot of emphasis on safety, and give everyone personal attention as needed. I highly recommend their services, for both Ladakh and their other treks in Nepal and elsewhere. Details available on ."
Kamzang_Journeys,MaleSolis,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Solo,The real thing,"If you want to experience the true nature and common daily life of these regions, you should do it with Kim and her team in Kamzang Journeys; in 2003 I went with her to a pilgrimage to Kailas with first stop in Katmandu; her plan for the journey proved the best one and we had the fortune to complete the circumambulation when other Westerners had to go back due to climate conditions.When I decided to visit Asia again in 2007 I did not think twice and booked with Kim for a journey in Ladakh and the Markha Valley, a small group and made one of my best friends to date.Her dedication and love of the region, the people and their culture will give you the real thing, so your experience will be rich and whole, the true Himalayas."

Ju-Leh was perfect from the moment I contacted the agency by email until the end of the trek. Staff in office is very friendly and helpful, they answered all my questions and send useful documents and advice.The trek was wonderful. The guide Dorjey and staff were great and the group was composed of people of all nationality and there was a great ambiance and we had good fun all together. We went through beautiful landscapes and there was nobody else... just the beautiful mountains and us !Dorjey, the assistants and the horseman, all were wonderful people who did everything to make us comfortable. Special mention to our cook who cooked excellent and varied food everyday, really amazing.I recommend Ju-Leh to anyone who plans to go to Ladakh and especially for solo traveller who want to join a group it's a great option. Thank you to all !"

We had 2 weeks in Ladakh, a mix of visits and trek in the Markha valley for 8 days. From first emails exchanged with Dawa to the end of the Ladakh trip, everything was perfect. The Ju-Leh team is very professional, great staff in office, friendly driver and amazing team during the trek with a warm thank you to Rigzin, the best guide ever! I highly recommend Ju-Leh for your next adventure in Ladakh"
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Deborah Y,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-22,Rumste to Tsho Moriri,"Ju-Leh does a fairly competent job at a great price.  The office staff are very helpful.  The cook and assistants did an amazing job.  The food was outstanding as is the scenery of the hike.  The guide lacked maturity and leadership.  Campsites on night one, four and eight need immediate attention. The first night we slept on the Indian highway. I had ear plugs for the truck noise, but it was not a great way to start the trip. Campsite on night four at Tsho Kar Lake had some of the poorest water I have ever drank in my life.  I have no idea how no one got sick.  The small water creek had huge amounts of trash, and the well was so nasty that I felt sick just thinking about drinking the water.  Ju-Leh needs to take personal responsibility and clean this up or change the campsite. Campsite number eight is just ridiculous.  Everyone in our group called it the Refugee Camp.  I think refugees are given better facilities than the Tsho Moriri camp.  We easily could have camped in the upper village where other groups were camping.  It was beautiful there.  The worst part about having such a terrible last camp is that it was the last impression of our week.  The hike is challenging and stunningly beautiful."
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Maria R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-22,Trekking and visit of Ladakh during 3 weeks,"We travelled during 3 weeks in Ladakh in July-August 2022. Before the trip, we had a very good communication with Dawa who helped us select the most suitable trek for our group (we selected the trek from Rumtse to Tso Moriri Lake) and also arranged various cultural tours (Indus valley, Nubra valley).As soon as we reached Ladakh, Dawa, Stanzin and the team took care of everything. During the tours, our driver Lobzang was a great companion, always smiling, sharing stories and information about Ladakh, it was a beautiful introduction to this beautiful region and its culture.Then, during the trek, our guide Padma and his team (assistant, cook, horseman…) were wonderful and did everything to make the trek very comfortable. The food prepared by the cook Rigzin was just amazing, better than in restaurants in Leh! The landscapes during the trek were amazing, overall an unforgettable experience.Ju-Leh Adventure is a very professional agency with a friendly and dedicated team.

Ju-Leh Adventure played a great role in organising a perfect itinerary for us. Looking back, we never thought we would be able to complete the Markha trek, especially once we reached Hangkar village. Here I would like to thank our guide Stanzin for motivating us and it is because of him that we managed to do the impossible. Markha Valley is beautiful and our jeep tours to the lake and other valleys were truly memorable. I would definitely like to go back to Leh and choose Ju-Leh Adventure and Mr Stanzin for organising our tour."

Ju_Leh_Adventure,Moog,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Final Markha Valley trek of the season FANTASTIC!,"In October 2018, a group of 7 of us completed a 5 day trek in the Markha Valley with guides Rigzin Tamchos and Dorjay. The whole experience was amazing; the scenery, the guides, food and the support from Ju Leh Adventures from the beginning to the end of our trip. On the last day before the crossing of the Kongmaru La pass, there was a snow storm, meaning that our ponies could not make the crossing over the pass with our belongings. Our guides carried the extra weight themselves at high altitude. Our heroes! Many people have outlined what to expect on this trek, so I won't go into details, however if there are any vertigo sufferers out there (I have horrible fear of high narrow paths and edges), please note that this trek is suitable, as there are no vertiginous spots. The whole thing is through a river valley. The only time I was a bit affected by vertigo was on the last day on the way down the pass on the paths towards the end of the trek. We weren't on a high ledge, it's just that the paths were narrow, and due to there having been a snow storm the day before, they were icy. Our guides and my group mates were very supportive and I really didn't have any problems at all. This was an amazing trip and I would certainly recommend it."

We like trekking, so we wanted to take part in an organized trekking. We found Ju-Leh Adventure on tripadvisor, and we arranged the trek via e-mail. It was a four day trek in the Hemis National Park from Chilling to Stok with two high altitude passes. It was a very nice trip, the organization was excellent, the guides (Rigzin Tamchos, and Rigzin) were friendly, helpful and well qualified. We enjoyed the whole tour. We hope we'll participate another Juh-Leh Adventure trek :)"

With Stanzin we've been able to create a truly exciting custom mountain biking program that we've done this autumn. Despite the unexpected bad weather, the Ju-Leh adventure team showed true professionalism, honesty and versatility, and we managed to get the most out of our wheels, leaving traces on some of the most incredible singletracks in Ladakh.Here is the place to distinguish our guide - Dorjee, who showed a lot of spirit, knowledge and temperament. Besides the extraordinary knowledge of the mountain, he revealed and showed us the rich traditions and lifestyle of Ladakhi people. Respect, Dorjee!

We decided to go with Ju-Leh Adventure and it was the best choice for sure!We had contact with Stanzin approximately 4 months before arriving in Ladakh, we explained our project to him and he gave us the best advice and the best options so that the trip could cover all the things we wanted to see.Stanzin is a great person, really taking care of his customers, understanding and flexible. He came to meet us at the airport on the first day and again at our hotel in Leh at the end of the trip.He also has a great team working with him. Our driver was named Dorjey and we spent 5 days with him exploring the most amazing places of Ladakh. We also went for trekking during 3 days with Rinchen and this was a great experience. Crossing the Ganda La pass was really challenging for some of us but we will never forget emotion when reaching the top of the pass. We would have never done that without Rinchen's support and we can't thank him enough for that.Thank you to Ju-Leh Adventure for making a dream come true!"

He also suggested to include a small trek (which we didn't think about initially because we are not very sporty) and this was an excellent idea too.Once in Ladakh, the staff was very nice and caring. Driver Motup was friendly and always safe on the road. We also enjoyed very much Namgail's company during the trek and the visit to Lamayuru. It was clearly the best choice to book our trip with Ju Leh. Thank you all!"

Everything was very well communicated to us in advance, with a very detailed planning. Upon arrival in Leh Ju-Leh took good care of us, we could immediately tell we were in good and experienced hands. After a 2 day (much needed) acclimatization period, we went on a 5 day trek to Markha valley. Transport was well arranged with friendly drivers to drop us off and pick us back up at the beginning and the end of the trek. During the trek we were lucky enough to have Nawang as our guide, a local Ladakhi with many years of experience. He lead us through the beautiful Markha valley along the Zanskar river. He explained us a lot of about Ladakhi culture, and the region in general. In the evenings we stayed at home-stays in little villages where Nawang cooked us delicious local dinners. In the end the trip was everything we hoped it would be. The only thing we underestimated a bit was the high altitude. Good to take the time to acclimate well, and buy some medicine for the first 1-2 days."

The guide Nesang is from Zanskar and knows his region perfectly. He always chose the best way and was helpful when the path was difficult. He is also an outstanding cook and prepared better meals on a simple camping burner than other cooks in restaurants.Ju-Leh is an agency that cares for their customers and thanks to their whole team we had a wonderful time in Zanskar.

Ju_Leh_Adventure,Therese B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,"""Amazing experience on trek and side trips""","Even before we left Canada, the itinerary that was provided to us, with great suggestions for changes was well put together. Upon our arrival at the Leh Airport, there were 2 people to welcome us and get the trip off to a great start. During our frequent office visits, the staff were patient with all our questions and accommodated our trek changes to enable us to enjoy the Ladakhi Festival.Our drivers, Stanzin and Sangdup, were excellent, accommodating with all our photo stop requests and great at answering all the questions we had on route. The trek, our highlight, was incredible. Certainly the weather helped but we had a superb team, Rigzin(guide), Nirajan (cook), Lokender(assistant) and Rigzin with his 9 horses. We didn't speak too much with Rigzin, but his cute horses with their lovely bells were so appreciated in carrying our gear, food etc so that we could enjoy the hike with our light daypacks. We were so lucky to have such a skilled chef as Nirajan. The variety of healthy and flavorful food he produced was amazing. Producing a cake on the last evening was such a surprise! His samosas were #1. I appreciated his soup he made me on the day I wasn't feeling too good. Lokender, seemed to be able to do whatever needed to be done, always smiling, singing and playing beautiful tunes on his flute. Rigzin, our amazing guide was so knowledgeable on the flora and fauna, enhanced our understanding of Buddhism and life in the Markha valley. He ensured our safety on the trail, assisted us with river crossings, and made sure we were doing fine hiking and not having issues with the elevation. Even on the day he wasn't feeling well in Markha, he took us on a short hike and arranged a visit at the school. Visiting with the kids was a highlight for me.We have come home with such incredible memories (even though some are on my camera somewhere in the Markha valley) which we have already shared with friends, family and colleagues. Thank you for all your combined efforts to show us how beautiful the Ladakh area is. We'd be back in a heart beat!Sincerely, Therese and Pat Bryan, North Vancouver, BC, Canada"

We received the itinerary on 10 pages, with full information about places, overnight stays, altitudes, time requested, as well as recommendations what to take in the trip etc. It was very useful and got feeling that we are in right hands. When we arrived to Leh, we met our give Tashi, that was really caring, helpful, he was good guide, explaining a lot about buddhism and tibet. We even visited his family. We had 3 days trek in mountains, + 4 days trip to Nubra and Pangong Tso by car. I would like to recommend Ju-Leh Adventure, because they are really flexible. Due to snowing in mountains, we had to return to Leh one day earlier, and agency organized it quickly, with no-delay, no additional charges. They were proactive in organizing tour trough monasteries with just few hours pre-advice. Thanks to Ju-Leh Adventure and special thanks to Tashi. "

We have to confirm: their high rating is fully merited - in fact it was perfect. They are very well organized. It starts with their quick reply and detailed itineraries. During the trek they used horses and all was taken care of: things like a waterproof bag for the backpacks (a small detail but something you often miss), kitchen tent, toilet tent, thick mattresses, climbing gear, wake up tea etc. (By the way, they boil water for you on the mountain to drink, that worked fine, we didn’t get sick.)We (2) were joined by a guide, cook, horseman and a helper. Our guide Jigmet was funny, knowledgable, easily adapted to our level of fitness and made a dream come true. During the trek we were spoiled with the food of Lobzang. It felt like we were dining in a 3-star restaurant and this at 5000m. If there would be a Nobel Prize for cooking, he would deserve it.Highly recommended!!!"

We did not regret our decision to use their services. They were very patient (esp. Dawa) with our constantly changing itinerary. There were three of us initially doing the popular Markha valley trek, but in the end there was only me and my guide Tenzin after day 1. Everything was organized well. My guide made sure I stayed in well appointed homestays and I had a room all for myself. There was never a point where I felt unsafe, neglected or my concerns unheard. Nothing but praise for the company Ju-Leh and my guide Tenzin. Ladakh is a fantastic area full of grand sweeping vistas. This was all the more evident because I was well taken care of."

She helped us find the trek that most suited what we were looking for and suggested a 2 day acclimatisation trek to help us prepare for the high altitude.Unfortunately upon landing in Leh my fiancé was struck by food poisoning, but Ju-Leh provided us with options and we ended up shortening the 2 day acclimatisation trek to a single day. Our guide for the single day trek (Chospel) was warm, friendly, & knowledgable.The 7 day trek was challenging due to the high altitude but our guide (Lotus), cook (Sukhan), & assistant (Sanjay) made sure everything ran smoothly and attended to all of our needs, turning a challenging experience into an enjoyable one.Some other positives to note:- The tent they provided us was larger than the tents we saw provided by other trekking companies which added that little extra bit of comfort- Our horseman seemed to regularly arrive at camp first, which helped us secure good camping spots- The food was amazing, in particular we looked forward to the soups each day which hit the spot after a long day of hiking. Other highlights were the french fries, fried rice with stir fry veg, momos, as well as a cake (yes, a cake!) that was baked on the last night to celebrate finishing the hikeOverall I would not hesitate to recommend Ju-Leh to friends, family, & anyone else interested in trekking in Ladakh."

Everything was just perfect from beginning to end. Our driver was a very good man and always cautious on the curvy mountain roads. We visited around Ladakh for 4 days and it was very interesting. Then we did the Markha valley trek for 6 days, reaching a maximum altitude of 5200 metres. Rigzin was our guide and he is a great person. He clearly loves his region and it was great spending time with him and listening to all his stories. He is very friendly and was always taking care of all our needs. For anyone going to Ladakh, I recommend Ju-Leh Adventures and ask for Rigzin to be your guide."
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Johan B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Zero Altitude sickness knowledge.,"We choose to book a trek with a guide first (only?) because we felt we needed an expert with us for our first time at high altitude.I unfortunately had an episode of vertigo and balance loss at 4100m, that could lead to cerebral endema. During that episode our guide had no opinion (for the first 10 min he stayed 50m away), and only stumbled the dangerous advice to maybe stay at the same altitude and rest for one more day.I'm happy I read online before and could talk to other hikers about altitude sickness so I was able to take the right decision to go down immediately.I believe guides should do their homework and learn the theory about altitude sickness, it is their responsibility, it could be a life or death matter.Apart from this our guide was moody, distant, introvert. He didn't give information about the trek, the culture or the nature. He also didn't hesitate to share his dislike of the Marka valley. Maps and GPS could have done the same job. Ju-Leh managers are very nice but their teams are not professional. Stanzin seems like a nice guy but he maybe should do an other job. My advice is: if you plan to trek in Ladhak take the time to read online about altitude sickness, and if you know how to read a map you may not even need to pay for a guide (paths and homestay bookings are easy in the Markha valley)."
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Stanzin G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,A wonderful trip,"Dear Johan,

Thank you for your review. We regret that you were not able to complete the Markha valley trek and we understand your frustration. Indeed, this trek is considered as fairly easy and it is usually suitable for anyone who is reasonably fit. However, the guide cannot be held responsible for your inability to adapt to the altitude. His priority was to ensure your safety and despite what you claim, this is what he did.

Your guide Stanzin Angbo has attended altitude safety trainings and mountaineering courses. He has been above 6000m more than 15 times. He was therefore perfectly qualified to guide you during a simple Markha valley trek.

General recommendations to prevent altitude sickness are:
1) Take 2-3 days of acclimatization in Leh (3500m) before starting the trek -> you took 4 days.
2) Avoid ascending more than 300-400m a day -> you trekked from Chilling to Hankar (4000m) in 3 days, increasing your altitude by 500m over 3 days.

On the 4th day of the trek, you started walking from Hankar and after ascending approximately 150m you felt the first symptoms of altitude sickness. In case of mild symptoms (dizziness in your case) it is recommended to stop and rest where you are. Half an hour later, your dizziness was not going away so your guide advised to go down back to Hankar and spend the night there. You had spent the previous night in Hankar without any problem so it was safe for you to spend one more night there. Your guide was only giving you the opportunity to rest and acclimatize one more day at 4000m so that you could continue the trek the next day. Unfortunately, you panicked and overreacted (maybe because of the stories you had read on the internet before) and you decided to stop the trek.

I can assure you that you were in good hands with your guide and that he had the situation under control to keep you safe. It's a pity that the guide did not give you this impression and we will make sure that he improves his communication skills in order to deal efficiently with anxious clients.

Safety is our utmost priority:
1) our guides are trained and experienced
2) our trekking and climbing itineraries are designed to allow for gradual acclimatization to altitude
3) oxygen bottles and pulse oximeter are provided (for more challenging treks)

Best regards,
Stanzin"

,,,,,"We booked a 10 day trip with fixed departure with a group of people we did not know (apart from me and my wife), and we really enjoyed it.We took the Rumtse to Tso Moriri trekThe whole experience, the views and nature were gorgeous, but concerning the organisation this was also flawless, the materials they used where good quality, the guides (Rigzin and Sonam) were nice, professional and proficient in English and the cooks they brought cooked every night excellent dinners for us in these difficult circumstances.Also the booking experience is very nice, as you get immediately a reply and they respond very quickly to any kind of question. It might not be the cheapest organisation around, but it does guarantee a great experience!"
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Susan W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,5 Day-4 Night Trek through Markha Valley,I recently was part of a 6 person group to trek the Markha Valley from Chilling to Chogdo. The trek was amazing with spectacular views and lots of variety in terrain. We lucked out with moderate weather for the most part. We had 3 nights of Homestays which were very basic but all part of the experience.The last night was in a tent in a Campground. Food was also basic but fueled us well enough for the amount of trekking we had to do each day. There was a good size lunch to take each day.Our guide was Tashi and he did an amazing job looking after our group. He was very kind and attentive to our needs. He lead the group at an appropriate pace always hanging back to support anyone who was struggling. He seemed very well liked by all our Homestay owners. I would highly recommend Tashi as a group guide and would like to take this opportunity to thank him for taking such great care of us.Ju-leh Adventures was a great company to go with. Borrowed sleeping bags were in great shape. Horse train brought our personal stuff safely every day. We had a couple of meetings before the trek where all our questions were thoroughly answered.This was a great adventure with friends and I thank Ju-leh Adventures for the part they played in making it such a success.
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Lange212,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Top Notch!,"Was booked on a 5 day trek through the Markha Valley a few weeks ago. The guides came and met us at your guesthouse just outside of Leh the day before our trek to answer any questions we had and to meet our group. They were awesome! Experienced, confident and personable. They next morning they were right on schedule with well equipped vehicles, loaded all our gear and we were on our way! Unfortunately, I had a gastrointestinal issue that prevented me from continuing on the trek. I had to call it quits the morning of day 2:( The guides arranged transfer for me back to the guesthouse. One of the guides accompanied me all the way to Leh. I felt terrible that he had to leave the rest of the group but he was so professional and I really appreciated it. The rest of my group continued on with the other guide. They had a spectacular trip! After a couple of days of rest, I was well enough to join up with the other half of my group who were doing a 4 day trek in the Sham Valley. Juley sent a vehicle to the guesthouse, picked me up and I was able to join that group for their last day of monastery visits. I was so well taken care of by the guides, drivers, trek planners. If you are planning to visit the area, I highly recommend you contact Juley Adventures! :)"
Ju_Leh_Adventure,XLhehe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-18,"Fantastic trek, great guide, once in a lifetime experience","We booked online, from France, a trek in Laddakh with Juh-Leh adventures. The email exchanges have been very clear and efficient, and reassuring as it was our 1st trip to Laddakh not to mention 1st trek! We kind of booked the flight and trek last minute. We have been welcomed at the airport, then installed at our lovely hotel recommended by Juh-L adventures. 2 days to rest and then started an amazing trek in the Himalaya with a perfect guide and sherpa for our friendly donkeys taking care of our luggages. We did a trek just the two of us, not a group one. We slept at homestay plus an unforgettable one night tent experience by minus 10 degrees at more than 4500meters of altitude! We have never been sick with the food, which is very simple in a good way and different from what you can experience in others parts of India. We are both 45 years old and in a good shape and made it to 5300 meters! Merci Juh-Leh adventures, it has been perfect from A to Z and we miss Laddakh!"
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Amal M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,"6 day Markha Valley Trek, Chilling to Shang","Four of us - my son, his girlfriend, their housemate & I - planned and booked our trek in Markha Valley over the internet, 4 months in advance, with no recommendations other than Trip Advisor reviews, and we are very glad we chose Ju-Leh. Their responsiveness and professional communication from Dawa right from the start was impressive & gave us some confidence. Their planning letter and trek itinerary were quite professional and very informative, and helped us a lot in visualizing our trip and packing for it. Once we got to Leh, and met Stanzin, all was arranged quickly - our guide Padma Namgyal was very well organized, and we got off to a smooth start. Our home stays in Markha valley were chosen well, we had no hardships anywhere, and fortunately the weather cooperated. We had 4 ponies to carry our backpacks, and a local horseman, who was also very good. Our 6 day trip from Chilling, with stops in Skiu, Markha, Hankar, Nimaling & Chogdo cut out the Ganda-La climb and allowed us to alternate easy and hard days, with just one major climb on Day 5 to the top of Gongmaru La. Padma gave us a lot of tips and help on the hard days, so we managed well overall, and there were no major problems with the altitude. A few of us in our group suffered dehydration on day 4, but recovered by the day's end with oral hydration salts and glucose. Our guide had a full first aid kit, so no worries there. Since we finished early on Day 6, we had a chance to tour the Hemis monastery, and get back to Leh after lunch. Ju-Leh helped us after the trek as well to get us Protected Area Permits & arrange a car to take us the day after up to the top of Khardung-La pass. Stanzin actually came by to meet us at our home stay the day before we left Leh, to ask us for feedback, a very nice gesture on Ju-Leh's part. All in all excellent support by Ju-Leh for our first Himalyan trek."
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Varun G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,"Very professional, efficient and delightful!","We had the best vacation of our life organized by Ju-Leh! They were great in their communications while planning our trips: They provided well written itineraries with maps and beautiful pictures that made our decision process easier.During our trip, everyone we interacted with was very knowledgeable an delightful to work with. Especially our trekking guide Tashii and our chaffeur/guide Sangdup. They both made our trip to Ladakh a very memorable one.Thank you Ju-leh for showing us the beauty of Ladakh!"
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Richard B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Fantastic Custom Trek and Sight-seeing tour,"My wife used Ju Leh for her Ladakh holiday and this is her review:We were two female travellers and booked our custom Ladakh holiday through Ju Leh.  Dawa answered all of our emails promptly and found us accomodation at Hotel Omasila where everyone was friendly and helpful and the view from our room was heavenly.  We had 2 days to acclimatise - (more would be better, if there's time) and then 3 days trekking which was FANTASTIC.  We had a custom trek and decided not to do the high pass but had the most wonderful detour to Rumbak village instead.  Rigzin was the best guide ever and everything was better than we could have hoped for.  Gyapo with the ponies did all the heavy carrying.  There was an unloaded pony should we have required a ride and Rigzin carried oxygen just in case.  The homestay hosts were always sweet with plenty of food and nice rooms.  Sandup drove us on our sightseeing day and was an excellent guide and safe driver.  Our change of itinerary was accomodated without a fuss and everyone at Ju Leh from start to finish was fantastic.  We didn't want to leave!We want to go back - stay longer; trek more.  We would definitely use Ju Leh again."
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Alan H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Markha Valley Trek - Amazing,"I joined a group of 7 to do the Markha Valley trek on a set departure date. Our guides were Rigzin and Lumdup and besides the trek being amazing itself they were fantastic. The trek itself is not easy, some tough days including the day of the pass and subsequent climb down, mainly due to the altitude, but Rigzin and co were brilliant in helping everyone in our group along every day. No task was too small and they were constantly filling us up with mint/milk tea the whole time and negotiating the best accommodation in each town for us. The Home stays are fantastic and the families so welcoming. I would not hesitate to book with ju-Leh adventure again.  "
Ju_Leh_Adventure,Andy_Noi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Incredible Experience!,"We have just returned from Ladakh where we did a 6D/5N jeep tour of Zanskar. The tour went way beyond our expectations thanks to the organisation of Ju-Leh, with a particular mention to our guide Nawang who was immense throughout. The trip is certainly not for the faint hearted, but one I throughly recommend. Throughout the planning process all at Ju-Leh replied promptly to our emails and gave us solid advice on all our queries. I have no hesitation in recommending the company to anyone and when we return to Ladakh I will certainly be in touch with them again."
Ju_Leh_Adventure,John R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Markha valley trek with extra side-trip to Stok-La,"We arranged an 8 day markha valley trek from zingchen, including an extra side trip from Rumbak up to Stok la on day 2 of the trek. Group of 2 clients with a guide and pony to carry our baggage. The whole experience with Ju-Leh was excellent - very professional and prompt reply to our initial query, wonderful local guide called Tashi. We amended the itinerary at the last minute (cutting out the final night of homestay and the final day's short trek from Chogdo to Shamsungdo, and instead arranging a monastery tour the following day from Leh) - this was organised by Ju-Leh without any fuss or extra costs. The trek itself was absolutely phenomenal - incredibly beautiful and varied scenery, and the extra trip to Stok La (a very dramatic pass at 4860metres) was well worth it.I would very strongly recommend this company."
Ju_Leh_Adventure,EricBrighton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Markha Valley Trek,"I recently completed the Markha Valley Trek with a group of 4 others. I organised this through Ju Leh Adventure who were great.From my initial enquiry to to arranging  a hire company for walking poles, rucksack and sleeping bag, their organisation and communication was prompt and efficient.Our guide was Sangay and the assistant guide was Lundup. Both were really knowledgeable, friendly, fun and always around to help you if you needed them.The home stays were basic but perfectly OK and the families were very friendly and the food was good and plentiful. There were blankets but I’d recommend taking your own sleeping bag.The toilets are holes the ground so bring your own paper and wipes.You are provided with a bucket of hot water for your shower on most nights which is very welcome.The night camping st Nimaling is also basic but you do get to meet other trekkers in the communal dining hut.The trek in the last 2 days is hard going and you do need to be fit. It’s also very rewarding.I’d definitely recommend the trek  and would certainly suggest you check out Ju Leh Adventure."
Evergreen_Arts_Emporium,yaroslavabibabo,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Looked reputable but still cheating,"We visited this shop in mid-September with my sister. Out of all shops it stood out, looked more professional. Father and son woking there gave us very nice impression. No pushing, knowing their business. They even helped us with other shop cheating (we bought ring with faked stone and could get money back after checking stones with them). They have special tool to check real stones. So my sister found 2 similar silver rings with tiny diamonds. They were tiny and low quality but that rustic style were charming. So we bought both for less than 80€. I was concerned about stones setting but older seller told that every stone is properly set manually. They also said that if they lie then they will give 100000 Rupees back. Could be great to record his words and come back. Next day we flew to Varanasi and during one day one stone fell out. Then we discovered that they all were glued. I was so disappointed. I tried to call that shop but numbers on their card are not answering. I tried for a week. I reached manufactory frim same card, man told that he will contact them and they will call back. Never happened. In one week ring lost 2 more stones so we went to some goldsmith in Delhi, who made it worse, basically destroyed both rings. Now we decided to order new rings and use all stones from these ones. Surely we will do it at home.The moral: go to this shop only if you know your stones well or you have some pro with you, or you dont care about being cheated. Shame. I really felt those people are nice and professional. Big disappointment."
Evergreen_Arts_Emporium,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Solo,Good collection of items,"During our trip to Leh, we had visited this shop which is located in the main Leh market. They have a decent collection of Kashmir shawls and traditional Tibetan jewellery. Different types of interesting Tibetan masks can be found here along with wall-hangings, statues etc. Good place to buy some home decor items and gifts for your friends back home."
Evergreen_Arts_Emporium,Peregrineri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Solo,good shop for Kashmiri shawls,"This place has quite an assortment of beautiful Kashmiri and other shawls (not so much of the local pashmina, though. This isn't the place for that.), jewelry etc. I found the quality to be good. They will be opening a much bigger place just opposite their current location within a month or two."
Evergreen_Arts_Emporium,gogandhi44,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 • Friends,Friendly One-Stop Shop,"The guys have Evergreen have all your bases covered: thangka tapestries; turquoise & other rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets; beautiful cashmere and wool scarves, shawls, and sweaters; singing bowls; statues & figures; masks; wall-hangings... Just about everything you might need/want to buy to bring home for yourself or as a gift. Most things are also available in a range of prices & qualities, so you can be sure to get what your budget accommodates.My friend and I first visited the shop for some scarves and found the staff very friendly, patient, and helpful. We started with a thoroughly negotiated purchase of 5 scarves on our first visit, bringing the price down to what we were quite happy to pay given the quality of the products. We returned on several later occasions to purchase more scarves, shawls, sweaters, wall-hangings and even some socks. We did our shopping around Leh and found that prices everywhere (thanks to the shop-owners' union) are relatively consistent, and so we were only too happy to remain loyal to the guys at Evergreen whose service (ample free tea to assist our decision-making) was excellent. Their patience alone, as we spent hours in the store poring over the different wares and options, was admirable enough to merit our happy patronage."
Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,BfromG,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-22,Ladakh in September,"We did a motorcycle tour through Ladakh organized by Greater Ladakh Tour.  They were excellent, friendly and took very good care of us.  The landscape was, as expected, stunning. We did the standard stuff including Nubra, Pangong Lake, Khardon-La, etc.  Punstok and Sonam were extremely helpful and took care of all our needs.  We stayed at the Chantsa in Leh.  Comfortable and centrally located with a couple of adorable Shih-tzus.  if you're picky about the accommodation, let them know and they will find more ""upscale"" - to a limit - lodging along the way.  All in all, a highly recommended trip, still off the beaten path."

They took money from us for booking pangong tso hotel and when I reached there I got to know that they haven't booked hotel for us . Later I have to book my own accommodation.  When I reached to the hotel which Mr sonam has booked , hotel staff was cursing them that they Don't pay the money on time and they both are completely fraud . 2. At Nubra valley they booked magpie camp for us which lacks basic facilities like wifi , proper lighting . At the end I have to take alternative accommodation I.e hotel saser LA  which was very good and was having all the facilities. If you are going to Nubra valley avoid taking magpie camp accommodation at any cost . It will not cost more than 1500rs but these fraud travel agent will tell you that they have booked for 3500rs .3. Airport drop was included in our package but they never provided us the same . They tried to extort extra money from us for Airport drop 4 hours before our departure.  These people are highly unprofessional and avoid booking any package with them .I highly regret booking my package with these unprofessional people .The services which I have got is not at all worth the amount 73k which I have paid ."

Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,ashishvetmed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,My experience,"I travel quite widely around the world and have had all kinds of experiences with tours and tour operators, ranging from pathetic to blissful. This company managed by Panchok Tsering tops my list of most blissful experiences. My Ladakh tour and trek trip threw all kinds of challenges from the beginning to the end. My friend fell sick and we kept changing the itinerary. Finally, we had to abandon the trip half way through as I had a personal emergency. Throughout the ill-fated trip, Panchok kept his cool, answered all our questions, and even partially refunded the tour cost. Frankly, I wouldn't have been so generous if I were him. Panchok knows Ladakh in and out and personally makes sure everything is going to plan and customers are happy. In a remote place like Ladakh subjected to severe weather conditions, flexibility and empathy are key to customer service and Panchok goes beyond the call of duty and commercial considertions to make you happy. I would whole heartedly recommend his tour company and hotel."

Tours include a stay at hotel Greater Ladakh Residency at Leh. The hotel is newly built and has comfortable rooms. Staff is very courteous. Food was superb. However, our tour was ruined by an errant driver (Stanzin) arranged by the travel agency which was with us for Nubra valley and Pangong tour. He drove the vehicle at very high speed  on mountain roads and ignored our pleas to slow down. I strongly recommend that fellow travellers should ask for experienced and mature driver for their tour especially if you are travelling with little children."

He made sure that we enjoy to the fullest from the beginning and at every place and stay. We visited Leh during a bit off time, that is in winter and everywhere we could just see snow. The roads were slippery but they made sure that we are equipped with proper tires and maximum safety. There are many more things that I would like to write I guess, but for now I would say ""I am looking forward to see you soon Phunsuk!!"""

Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Sankalp Agrawal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,AMAZING ARRANGEMENTS FOR LADAKH BIKE TRIP,"Our trip was organised by Mr.Punchonk and his colleague Sonam..Founder of Greater Ladakh Tours and Travels. I got their contact from TripAdvisor Only. After watching their reviews on TripAdvisor I decided to go with them only. We were a group of 8 People.Tour was organised in this way:Manali-Jispa-Leh-Nubrah Valley-PangongLake-Leh-Kargil-Srinagar.Manali-Jispa-Leh was done by Private Traveller arranged by them. Driver was very knowledgeable and very much friendly and traveller had ample of space as it was 12 seater and we were just 8. Stay at Jispa in a tent was awesome under the stars shining on our head in the dark night. Food provided was average.Next day we departed early from Jispa and Reached Leh in the evening by the same traveller. Hotel booked in the Leh was very good and their hospitality was incomparable. Hotel had good lawns,parks and outdoor sitting with big tables. We really enjoyed that evening in the leh.Next day Mr.Punchonk came to our hotel and provided us a local sim for few days so that we can contact pur family members because other states sim doesnt work there except postpaid connections. He came with 4 Bullets(Royal Enfield Bike commonly known as Bullets in India) and all the Riding Gears for all the riders. For him Safety and Enjoyment both is equally important. He then suggested me to visit local tourist places of Leh that day and took us to the various famous places of leh and surroundings Like Shey Palace,Rancho School,Various Monastries,War Memorials etc. That day we had so much of fun with a relaxed and cool mindset. We also rode our respective bikes for approx 50km that day and got accustomed with it. At the end of the day we came back to our hotel and had sumptuous dinner placed in buffet by the hotel.Next day Early Morning A Jeep Came for us as in Backup Vehicle whose driver was very funny and helping. We left for the Nubrah Valley with our respective bikes and partners following that Backup Vehicle. Backup Vehicle had all the major bike parts including Tyres,Rims,Clutch Plate,Breakshoe etc which can be utilised if anyone of us need that. He was carrying all our permits and helped us in many ways. He knew everything about the routes,places,temperatures,and Oxygen Availability etc. We climbed Khardung-la- Pass with all ease with our bikes and reached Nubrah Valley in the evening. That day we did some camel ride and stayed in A tent. They also organised a Bonfire for us. We enjoyed a lot but were tired too because of riding around 140km that too on rough and off roads.Next day we started our journey to pangong lake and this days was the most scary and adventurous. We had to cross several Water and River Crossings. I once fell down while crossing a river with my bike but my backup vehicle driver immediately came to rescue. In that small accident my Rim of the front tyre of the bike got damaged and he immediately changed it with a backup one which was kept in backup vehicle. As soon as we got the first Glimpse of Pangong Lake.. We were overjoyed and happy to see that All Blue Water lake.. Another 135km was accomplished by us. There also we were provided a tent stay for the night with good food..In evening We took a hell lot of pics over there and enjoyed a lot. It was the coldest place which I felt in the whole trip.Next day again we took some pics of us with that Beautiful Giant Blue Lake and then departed for Leh..It was 160km Travelling. But Riding Bike for such long hours had now become an easy task for us and we were enjoying it. Several Water Crossings we passed..Crossed Much more Passes and reached Leh again and checked into the same hotel again by 4PM.Thereafter we surrendered our bikes to Mr.Punchonk with all the riding gears.Next day He arranged a minibus for us which took us to the Kargil..and From there they took us to the Srinagar. We were tired a lot so we could not enjoy Srinagar and Kargil Much and the Bus Driver was also not supportive and friendly but since it was on our wishlist..we did it.And then after the next day of reaching Srinagar we took our flights back to Kolkata with happy memories.Suggestion: Do not include Kargil and Srinagar in your trip..it will unnecessarily prolong the duration of the trip with a tired mind and body. Its not like Srinagar or Kargil are not good, but they require atleast 4-5 days to enjoy those places. Mr.Punchonk & Mr.Sonam are the best buddies to book the trip for Ladakh. Thumbs up 👍 for them that they managed the trip in such a great manner. Thank you Greater Ladakh Tour & Travels and People of J&K for being so nice and welcoming."

Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,YP Kishore,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep-19,Ladakh trip_Aug/Sept 2019,"We were a big group of 18, ages ranging from 11 to 64. The group consisted of 3 kids and 15 adults. Travelled with Greater Ladakh Tour & Travel. A big thank you to Mr Punchok Tsering for organising everything so wonderfully well. Requested him to arrange pick up on arrival at Delhi airport in 4 Innovas and transport us to Chandigarh . He organised everything right from pick-up at Delhi airport on 27th Aug 2019 to dropping us at Leh airport on 6th Sept. I corresponded with him on Whatsapp for nearly 6 weeks prior to the tour and not once did he pressurise us for money in any way. In fact it was the other way around. I was asking him when to transfer the money to his account and Mr Punchok was saying ""baad mein kariye sir, no hurry"". I paid him the last few thousands on the day prior to our departure. The hotels he gave us, especially the one in Leh (Hotel Chantsa was outstanding) were uniformly good. The only day which we felt was very difficult was on the 4th day when we travelled from Jispa to Tso Moriri lake and some members of our group fell sick due to AMS. All four Innovas were equipped with oxygen cylinders right from Jispa onwards and he also provided water bottles in all vehicles. All in all. I would rate Mr Punchok's services with 5 stars.I can say with conviction that I will definitely go with Mr Punchok and his team in our planned future visit to Leh when it's a bit colder (probably in April/May a cpl of years later)"

Whatever we want, he always supported to make it happen. Everything in this motorbike trip was very good, but if there was something that need to be improved to be a perfect trip, it was a motorbike condition. we had a few problem with some bike had some engine problem and it caused our group waste time, even tour mechanic tried to repair but it did not work well as it should.I am not overly optimistic.A driver picked our group up at Srinagar Air Port on time, then after motorbike trip, drop off at the air port in Leh as schedule."

They organized a tour and a trek for us and services were very far from what we expected. The most shocking part was when we realized that they were planning to make us drive inside a national park whereas it was clearly forbidden. When we told our guide that we wanted to walk instead of driving where we were not supposed to, he almost laughed at us. Punchok should give more awareness about environment to his team, that's also what clients expect."

Mr. Phunchok Tsering, owner of Greater Ladakh Tours was a gem of a person. He had sent us detailed itinerary on whatsapp with price details much prior to our visit. We were a group of three and the prices were reasonable for a taxi (Innova) tour around Leh including major places like Khardung La, Nubra Valley and Chang La and other places in and around Leh. Namgyal (our driver) was excellent and made up on time at every place despite the road blocks and punctures. When we were stranded near Shyok Valley and couldn't return on the same day, the owner immediately arranged another homestay at Tang Se, around  some 55kms from Pangong Lake. They even provided us two motorcycles on our request at no extra cost instead of the taxi on the last day which was a really fine gesture.Overall, we were very much satisfied and would definitely recommend all to consider Greater Ladakh Tours on your visit to Leh."

It was a fantastic adventure in a most beautiful place.For the first part I needed a bike with a very comfortable pillion seat so I used a R.E. Classic 500 and for the rest I used a R.E.Himalayan. Both bikes were new and never missed a beat.I have travelled riding bikes in many other countries in Asia and I can easily say that Mr Phunchok has provided the best service I've ever had.I highly recommend his professional services: Organizing good bikes, The support car, The permits, Hotels, Taxies, Tickets and specially: a fantastic and caring guide who is also a most brilliant mountain's rider and driver.For the people reading this, Ladakh is beautiful.

Behold that moment for it turned out to be the turning point for the whole trip! These guys were having some good reviews on internet and the fact that they are from leh itself reiterated my faith in them. We were 4 in total, i.e 2 couples and planned for a 9 day/8 night trip. Mr. Phunchok tsering, the alpha of the team greater ladakh, helped us by chalking out a great itinerary for the whole trip. It included 1day at srinagar, two days enroute to leh from srinagar and rest of days in leh and surroundings. Everything was arranged and all the guys involved were so hospitable that i cant imagine how the trip would have ended without them. Kotroo palace houseboat at srinagar was the stay arranged in srinagar and it was a nice beginning for the trip to come. Stay in kargil at dzojila was another good  arrangement.Hotel sand dune at nubra was also welcoming after a tiring days journey via the Khardungla pass and all. All staff in these hotels were cordial, friendly and helpful. And what can be said about hotel oriental in leh! Oriental was a home away from home. We stayed there for 5 nights in total and each time coming back  there was like coming home. All the staff were cordial and helpful,and the owner/s was itself a gem of a peraon. We wish to be back there ma'am😊Our rider Namgyal was another revelation. We could simply close our eyes and rely on this guy for driving through the extreme terrain of ladakh for he is an expert driver. All the good things happened in our trip bcoz of the efforts put in by the ever smiling Phunchok in organising everything. The best thing was the flexibility available in the plan for we could customize it in between the trip also. The ladakh turned out to be one of the best trips we had and all credit goes to the meticulous planning done by Phunchok and team. We would recommend this guy for anyone in need of a good time in ladakh. Moreover, i heard he is exceptional in providing bike tours and treks in ladakh. So, thanks phunchok for the wonderful memories and hope to see you soon in another trip to leh. 😊"

Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Sunshine452701,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Best of Ladakh!,"I traveled to Ladakh in August of 2018 with my dad and booked 7-days tour with Greater Ladakh tour and travel.  They provided us with the best of Ladakh tour with Shanti Stupa, Lehl Palace, Stok Kangri, Pangong Tso, monasteries and many more.  Phunchok and his group were very accommodating to our needs for this trip and flexible to change anything in our itinerary without adding additional costs.  Phunchok arranged transportation for us to and from Leh airport and we were taken to our accommodation at the beautiful Hotel Oriental (see review here: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297625-d1165223-Reviews-Oriental_Guest_House-Leh_Leh_District_Ladakh_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html); he met with us later that afternoon.  After checking to see if we were interested, he arranged for a transportation to Shanti Stupa, Leh Palace, and Leh Market (note these weren’t part of the original itinerary).  We had planned a trek to Stok Kangri base camp but had to cut it short by one day (due to altitude sickness).  Our guide Gyaltsen (who had summited several mountains in the region) was extremely patient and understanding with our pace of getting up to Mankarmo base camp; he even arranged the kitchen staff at Mankarmo to make ginger soup to help with mild altitude sickness.  Having one extra day- the guides arranged additional monastery tours for us.  Then, we were off to Pangong Tso which still feels surreal. Thank you Greater Ladakh tour and travel for such a memorable trip!"

Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Himanshu S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Most memorable experience ever,"There are few trips where you remeber people more than the place. Never thought i would be citing leh as an example in such trips. Greater Laddakh tours gave us the beautiful experience which we yearn but never get. These guys (Mr punchok tesirng specially) made sure we didn't had to worry about a single thing while we were there.Given that we just had to corroborate on phone, the expertise with which he planned and executed our vacation was amazing. The hotels were simply fabulous and the car, bike/scooty were well maintained and economic.Even in a time of snag where we were stuck on khardungla because of bad weather resulting in cancellation of hotel in nubra, mr punchok made sure that we had another beautiful hotel waiting for us to rest peacefully without additional cost.The only way i can find for returning the favour to mr punchok for such a memorable and care free vacation is by writing this review.If you are visiting leh laddakh please make sure you at least call Mr punchok once.I assure you he will convince you for the best experience at the lowest price and then he'll go ahead and deliver that experience."

Had also gone through the great reviews people had for him mentioned on this travel portal. And yes all were right about him. He had arranged the trip for us wonderfully with arrangements (as discussed earlier) well taken care of. He has options for ppl of either staying in a guest house or hotels or Camps(for nubra and Pangong). For travelling we were provided with Qualis Innova which made our journey real easy and comfortable.I would definitely recommend people who want to go to ladakh to get in touch with Phunchok. And yes he also provides Bikes and can help you with your travel itinerary.So just like the wonderful people of Ladakh(sweet, genuine & honest) Phunchok will not disappoint you and doesn't charge a bomb.Juley Ladakhis !"

But even the people out there are so warm and loving towards everyone.We stayed mainly in Lahari guest house which is a very sweet house and we enjoyed our stay there. Also the guest house is situated such that restaurants and shops are easily accessible. The cars that were provided for travel were also very comfortable. Camps chosen for us in Nubra and Pangong were also great.This also turned to be a economical trip for us since we were charged reasonably.. The itinerary was also perfect. To sum up this was a great trip and would happily recommend Mr. Phunchok to anyone who wants to spend some time amidst the beautiful nature of Ladakh.Jullay Ladakh!!

Punchok was really helpful and answered all my queries patiently. He also suggested to travel directly from Nubra to Pangong via Shyok river and getting 3 days in Leh for acclimatization. I'm glad that I went ahead and booked the tour.Punchok arranged permits on time despite it being public holiday before leaving for Nubra and was in no hurry to take the complete payment. Driver for our trip was an experienced one with good knowledge of all the routes. Special mention for hotel at Leh - Hotel Oriental. Lovely small property with clean rooms, nice food and helpful owner. Overall had an awesome trip and I would highly recommend Greater Ladakh to anyone planning a trip there."

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Manon belgium,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,AMAZING,"I want to say a big THANK YOU to Ladakh Bike Rental. Thanks to them, and especially to Gurmat and Kel, we have had the BEST TRIP EVER.With a good mix between good roads and off-road, our itinerary took us to lost places far from mass tourism: all what we wanted.  The landscapes are spectacular and the locals are super friendly.  Homestays, small hotels, campsites, beautiful hotels, it was very varied. We asked them to bring us to “lost” places without mass tourism, which makes that we had some nights without shower/internet/confort but those nights were in the most beautiful places I have never seen in my life so it was really worth it. (They can adapt the trip and bring you to more confort places and/or more touristy). As we were only two riders (women), we decided to take a guid during our bike trip. We were so lucky to have this guid, Kel. Friendly, funny, cultured, strong, always there to help us and flexible.  It was a real pleasure to share this trip with him. I hope we will see you soon for another trip in India The bikes were very nice and quite easy to ride. Nevertheless, if you do the same trip as us, it’s better to have a bit of experience in off roads. To summarise, I really recommend Ladakh Bike Rentals!! I also recommend the hostel, @the Courtyard 🤩🤩"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,SacreTeam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,Exceptionnel ! Organisation sur mesure parfaite !,"Exceptional from start to finish! Ladakh bike rental, represented by Gurmat immediately responded to our request and did everything possible to first prepare our trip and to make it extraordinary on site.My daughter (25) and I (61) rented two Himalyan Royal Enfield motorbikes for a wonderful tour in Ladakh to remote places, off the beaten track from June 10 to 24, 2022. Gurmat found us an exceptional guide to complete this adventure. Indeed, two women needed a guide and mechanic for this trip....When we arrived in Leh, the welcome was great. Gurmat and his team first made us stay 2 days in this friendly hotel The Courtyard in order to get used to the altitude and to shine the first 2 days around Leh to familiarize ourselves with motorcycles. The bikes were in excellent condition and only had 6000km on the clock.Then we left with this great and friendly guide, Kel Sherpa, 12 days to discover this beautiful region, our luggage on our motorcycles.Fantastic! Breathtaking landscapes, sometimes difficult but manageable roads. We passed passes over 5000m, sometimes a little snow and only 1 day of rain.We had various accommodations, often very comfortable, sometimes less given the very remote places.We lived intense moments, made wonderful encounters, learned a lot about the country, the culture, visited monasteries.The reception of the inhabitants of Ladakh was very friendly and often impressed to see two women discovering their country by motorbike!We enjoyed every moment, enjoyed the Indian food, never got sick or had any altitude related issues.The program was just perfect!We 100% recommend Ladakh Bike Rental for its efficiency, its kindness and for having organized a tailor-made trip for us to know authentic Ladakh.Thanks again to Ladakh Bike Rental and Kel Sherpa for making us live this unique adventure."

Gurmat has planned our short visit to Leh ladakh is a proper way that we got to see the adventurous side and the mesmerizing beauty of ladakh. The stay provided by him in Chospa Hotel was amazing and luxurious  which had built in a luxurious ladakhi architecture. Tashi's has been so humble with us and took care of us like a family member. He was always ready for every challenge just to ensure we dont miss anything in our trip (Just for the view which I can enjoy sitting in the front seat, he stopped the vehicle on the way to khardungla for which he had to struggle for 20mins to keep the vehicle moving again as it was stuck in snow), he ensured that we stay warm all the time by making a hot coffee when ever required and was always available with us for clicking some amazing pictures of us. Not to the surprise picture which he clicked and sent to me after me reaching home to surprise me again.Will definitely prefer only Ladakh Bike Rental for any trips and tours to all my colleagues and family.Hoping to travel with you guys again soon...!!!Lots of love from Hyderabad ❤️"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Puneet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Family,Literally best experience of my life.,"A wise advice for all of you if you are going to travel in North just go for LBR. They will get it all covered for you. No matter how bad the weather is, No matter if thing go sideways, they have preparation for everything. I just loved their network. All the hotels I stayed in, every single one of them gave the best hospitality possible. I booked a bolero with an himalyan. The driver named tsetan doorjay was very very very helpful. Whenever bike riding was not possible because of excessive snow we just put the bike onto back side of bolero and just sit in the car. They had snow chains, oxygen cylinder every necessary thing with them. I travelled for 8 days and every day it was snowing and because of their proper arrangements we crossed every pass easily. Gurmat bhai and tsewang bhai both of them are very humble. We decided to spend a day with them and change our last day plan and they didn't hesitated to change the plan at the last moment. Last day they showed us leh Market and helped us in shopping. The trip was so amazing that I am planning the same trip again this year and half of my excitement is to meet the LBR crew again. They stayed in touch whole year as we are friends now. Prices are also very reasonable. Can't wait to meet them... 💯 Thanks for such a great experience gurmat bhaiya."

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Ragul Ravichandran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Friends,"Leh,  Ladakh - 2021","The favourite part was to experience ladakh during winter and to learn about the people's culture during this season. First day Mr Gurmet picked us from airport and dropped in a very nice stay ( deja vu). That day was just to take rest and adapt to the altitude and temperature. Next day we started driving to lamayuru which is 120 km away from leh. The bikes ( Himalayan)  provided from the Ladakh bike rental was in very good condition and it was properly maintained.  We had a great experience on the way to lamayuru and mr Gurmet arranged a very nice comfortable stay in lamayuru. After 2 days of experiencing lamayuru we headed to the adventurous ride on kardhungla, nubra valley and panong lake. Mr Gurmet arranged us a local guy ( Mr Dorjey ) for the local guidence and support. He was excellent hardworking guy we ever met. He made our trip very comfortable even in the most uncomfortable places like panong frozen lake  with the temperature of minus 21 degree Celsius.  Because of the proper planning and management from Mr Gurmet ( Ladakh bike rental) we had a very great time experiencing the place and explore the culture.  Charges are very reasonable and very effective. He won't charge you any extra money. Very genuine and very trustworthy guy to plan your trip.  And thanks to Mr Gurmet and Ladakh bike rental team  for making our trip as a memorable and as a life changing experience. Even we had a lot of conversation about the place and culture with Mr Gurmet which gave a lot of information about the place and context. Once again thanks a lot for all the efforts you have put for our trip. We felt very happy and satisfied with your Service.  I strongly recommend him. 😁"

Gurmat, the owner, answered all our questions, and his team ensured everything worked out for us.

Gurmat (CEO of LBR) is super friendly and professional bike rental operator.. In Early March i contacted him to ask about single solo trip 11 days to ladakh, and he replied my email in no time.. Month later, i emailed him back, to ask about private tour for 4 riders (11 Days , Into Thin Air Tour - Itinerary like in LBR website), and then he replied me in no time with good explanation about The Tour itself and ask what do we want for motorcycle... So, i asked him that we were 4 riders, want to ride 3 Himalayan and 1 Classic RE, with lite modified itinerary and ask a mechanic to accompany us within the tour.. Then he replied me again about T&C and Quotation with very very very very good price.When we arrived at Srinagar, we were welcomed by Stanzin using toyota Innova taxi and take us to departure point.The bikes is very well maintained (LBR always sell their bike after 3 years operating)..From previous email, Gurmat told me that he will provide a backup vehicle for just 4 days (2 days in the early tour and 2 days before the tour ends), but in fact he gave us BONUS a back up vehicle within the tour so we dont have to attached our luggage on the bike woohooo... (Thanks Gurmat)The tour it self was very very awesome and memorable journey, thanks to LBR crew, Stanzin (our guide with back up vehicle) and Sandeep (our mechanic), they gave us the warm of ladakhi people.. They explained everythings within the tour.. and also they have good skill to take a picture..The route we took are from Srinagar - Kargil - Leh - Pangong Lake - Nubra Valley - Leh - Tso Moriri - Tso Kar - and finish at Leh, along the route we were amazed with the beauty of Himalayan, Korzok Lake, Pangong Lake, and Tso Moriri Lake and always stunned with the view. The Road we took was 30% offroad, but we like it very very much..Accomodation also very nice, Gurmat always considered with hotel and Deluxe tent, he always gave us best accomodations within the budget, and make sure that we always have a good rest. Another bonus from Gurmat are, when The last day he gave as a memorable overnight at Shakti Village Resort, a cozy resort with beautiful view (Thanks Again Gurmat)And also Gurmat invited us to farewell Dinner (beer included) (Thanks againn Gurmat)..Overall, Gurmat (Ladakh Bike Rental) and his crew has make our dream trip became an epic journey and memorable..

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,dead_monkee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Adventure of a lifetime with Ladakh Bike Rental,"Ladakh is a hidden gem in India and thanks to Gurmat and his crew we had a wonderful experience conquering the wild terrain in Ladakh on two wheels in April 2017.We got in touch with Gurmat in early March, and despite the short notice he offered us a well planned itinerary. The trip consisted of visiting Leh and its surrounding remote villages on a Royal Enfield Bullet 500. Tour guide, mechanic, supporting vehicle and accommodation for all days in Ladakh are included. On the day of arrival we were greeted by Gurmat and checked our vehicles. The machines were well maintained, and any adjustment request to the bike was taken care of by the team mechanic immediately.The roads of Ladakh are mainly sandy gravel and rocky hillside roads. If one decided to go higher up the mountains, the rider encounters wet mud and even snow in early April. Despite the harsh terrain, our tour guide and mechanic led the trip with a passion and helped us avoid the many dangers of the road. With that being said, adventure riding in Ladakh is a big challenge to the skill and responsiveness of a rider. Winter motorcycle protection is strongly recommended. Ladakh Bike Rental is well prepared in that aspect - the company has plenty of gear to borrow from waterproof off-road boots to full face helmets.Again we thank the people in LBR team - Gurmat and Tsewang Namgail, Stanzin Khakyab and others for providing an excellent Ladakh experience. Hope we will return some day for the Zanskar..."

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Badr,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Solo bike trip to Ladakh,"I've had a great human experience while choosing Ladakh bike Rental as an organizer of my solo bike trip in Ladakh. Gurmat the manager handled all my requests pretty fast and easily by changing my routes as I wanted and tried to offer a good price/quality package for almost 9 days. My guide/mechanic Norbu was helpful and a good companion. He managed to invite me for almost 3 nights and 4 days at his family home as I requested to LBR (live with local people) and he helped me discover some great hidden place around Kargil and Wakha (trekking/biking gems). Also Gurmat and his team helped me find a cheap flight ticket from Leh to Delhi 2 days before my departure as no seat was left online. As a solo traveler, i enjoyed the package and i truly recommend LBR as a tour booking manager for the Ladakh region."

Bikes were well maintained, no problems with getting up and over the passes and roads. Gurmat and gang were very helpful and knowledgeable, answering any queries online and offline quickly, and they took very good care of us on and off the bike. They treated us as family and even helped take pictures of us while all of us were riding en route. 10/10 will recommend to anyone who is going to ladakh to experience the best ride of their life"

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Dino246,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Himalayan Highlights on a Royal Enfield,"It's a risky business booking a motor-cycle holiday in a relatively remote part of the planet, with somebody you don't know, & hoping that it will turn out OK! I took the risk with Gurmat (of Ladakh Bike Rental) and the experience was excellent & painless!!! Gurmat was so casual during our telephone arrangements that I wondered could he be as efficient as he seemed. The planned trip (for my son & I) was 14 days touring the Ladakh region of Kaskmir.We had zero problems and everything worked perfectly, from being met at the airport, to the bike tour with Phuntsok, our excellent mechanic & guide. We had a fantastic experience, crossing the three highest navigable passes on the planet (& other lower passes), visiting some of the remotest areas I have ever encountered and all of the time the scenery was breath-taking and the people we encountered were splendid, colourful & friendly. Every minute my helmet camera was off, I felt I was missing both scenery & local culture. I took the 'Deluxe' package, but I would recommend (for the small extra charge) that people considering this trip should opt for 'Luxury' in Leh, and take whatever is available when touring in the remote areas.I had a Royal Enfield 500cc Classic and this is the best of the available bikes for the terrain. The 'Himalayas' looks better, but the Classic is the bike for the job!Five star plus to Gurmat, Phuntsok & the rest of the team!!! I have no hesitation recommending them for such a trip, which should definitely be on one's 'Bucket List'!"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,lokiez,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Had a Nice trip,"I opted for ""Camps & Rides"" tour and i had a good experience. Whole trip was well organised and despite it being an eight day tour which requires good planning, Gurmat was flexible to accommodate our requests for route change just a day before!! A friend of ours was having trouble riding bike, so Gurmat provided us an extra person who drove his bike at no extra cost!! Absolutely amazing.You can trust ""Ladakh Bike rental"" for their word, atleast i had good experience.There was one small issue during the trip. I have not driven bike on mountain ever so i was slow with my ride and support vehicle driver kept on pushing to drive fast which was little annoying and can be risky as well. But still it was all manageable and i would definitely recommend them for Bike rental and tours."

From start to finish, Gurmat and his crew ensured (1) safety - extremely important for these roads. Every morning, our guide Angry, mechanic Sandeep and support driver Justin would ensure all bikes were in good condition. Angdu matched his pace/speed to our skills and road conditions(2) mesmerizing destinations and sites - which is the draw of ladakh. our tour brought us through the best of Ladakh with all 3bhighest passes and overnight stays at 3 Highest lakes. with stops at some of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen in my life. Pardon the pics, all shot with my mobile and I am a lousy photographer(3) great customer service - accommodating every request we had for them including ensuring members of our groups got their best photos, setting up a camp fire, buying water for us. Even his own lodging house staff Pradeep, Shankar and Reedam saw to our every need and cooked meals to our preference!If you are doing a Ladakh bike trip, LBR is the company to go for!Lastly, I have read negative reviews about communications - having been starved of connectivity (there is zero roaming and wifi, when available in Leh only is at best patchy), it is understandable if they are slow in response."

Apart from this we even got accessories like knee pads, Go-pro, Boots, Helmets which were in decent condition before we could hire.In the end there are many vendors in ladakh for bike rental, but the best quality that we got is from Gurmat and i would strongly recommend to avail service through him when you are planning for a trip to Ladakh.I would appreciate Gurmat for his efforts and humble responses to accommodate customers requests.

,,,,,"I have taken avenger 220 for 7 days and paid all the money in advance thinking he has alloted me a good bike but once we started riding to different places, the bike gave problems such as auto shut etc ND the bike condition Is really bad. I went to change the bike but owner said this is only option even it's in bad condition. also the accessories that he gave me with bike didn't work ND a case happened that the air in back Tyre was too low, we started using the accessory to blow air but it was defective. The worst part is the last 2 days were pangong lake ND when we started the journey, the bike couldn't start In morning so we took a cab. When we asked the owner to refund 1 day money as the bike didn't worked, he refused even after his mechanic came ND saw that the bike is really in bad condition ND didn't started even after they tried. I really request the people not to take the bike from this source as they cheat the innocent travellers even after promising a good service. I am genuine rider ND came to leh on September 2017."

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,David C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Solo,Enchanting ladakh,"Recently I had the time to visit Leh Ladakh, and I had rented an amazing Enfield Himalayan from Ladakh bike rental co. I must say my experience with them was simply awesome and they have the best bikes in whole Ladakh.Guys trust me from my own experience Himalayan is the bike to go for to tame the rugged terrain of the Himalayan valley. I want to dedicate my Ladakh trip to gurmat namgail( founder of Ladakh bike rental co.), Thank you sir for providing me an amazing bike and your guidance were certainly helpful in my trip.The most remarkable thing about Ladakh bike rental is that they are available round the clock and incase if you need any help they are just a phone call away. Also gurmat sir turned out to be my good Samaritan in my hour of need when I had carelessly lost my bike keys on my return journey, when I was stranded in the pangong valley. Sure enough I got help from the locals and other bikers on the way, but Ladakh bike rental were the first ones in my hour of need.My Ladakh trip has certainly been engraved in my memory and the beauty and splendour of Ladakh that I witnessed is worth remembering."

They arranged required bikes in very good condition within 3 hours.All the people were very friendly.. each time we visit they offered snacks, told us about precautions etc., they arranged for our permit and also drove us to our hotel.Best  part is LBR doesn't loot there customers like the rental services at manali does. We took 2 extra bikes for half of day to visit khardung la and at the end we return bikes with some minor damage like mirror etc.They didn't charge a penny for extra bike or damage.We didn't face a single problem in bikes during our 7 day tour.

Me and my bro were on our dream ride to Khardung la, nubra, manali and rented bike from them. They gave us the proper tips for acclimatization and arranged our accommodations. The first bike (2017 std 500) that we took gave us little trouble on first day itself with the disc brake, was getting jammed always. I called his guys and they came with another bike immediately. That one bike didn't give us any problem for the next 6 days and ya that also was a new std 500. His accountant Stanzin (Panang) was my point of contact during my entire trip and should say a dedicated man. Proper guidance and hospitality."

And I should say we never regretted choosing them as our tour planner. They knew the terrains well. And they were very resourceful about the locations and everything. Although we had issues with our Ride on the very first day up at khardungla, they made alternative arrangements to our favour not compromising safety and the fun of the tour. They have very friendly and resourceful staffs who understands and knew what they are doing. Admin matters were well taken care of once we reached there from getting the permits to enter different places to the orientation briefing done on the very first day we were there. Gurmat and Pranav made sure we had a smooth orientation and acclimatize well before we start our ride the next day. The captain nubu who were there for our trip throughout was always ready to help us during ride. The backup vehicle guys, our mechanic and rim Chen were very helpful and they are well versed with what routes will bring us to our destination faster and with the best experience. As for the food, the cook Marco has done an awesome job in making for us the best and the most delicious dishes. He even accommodated to our request on tuna on the 4th day. Overall the 10 days we had in Ladakh was nothing but awesome. And it was totally worth the money we paid. "

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,akshay_harish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Great service,"We were a group of 3 and we wanted to rent 3 bikes for a total of 8 days. Since we were aware that there is very poor phone and internet connectivity in the Ladakh region, we dropped a mail; but Mr. Gurumat, the owner was quick to respond. We gave our requirements and he acknowledged. He requested us to make an advance payment and was very courteous throughout. We were constantly in touch with him and upon our arrival in Leh, we informed him. He made arrangements to escort us to his garage.Mr. Namgyal, who heads the service section, who also happens to be the chief of staff, showed us the vehicles that were to rent and his staff was working on giving final touches to it. He requested us to make full payment for the same and we also had submit a caution deposit of Rs. 5,000 per bike that would be returned to us when we hand over the bikes back to them. After the financial part was settled, he also asked if we wanted an Inner Line Permit (ILP). Since we had not applied for an ILP, we decided to get it done from him for a very nominal fee. He informed that the ILP would arrive after a day or two and that we had to collect it then. As per our plan, we acclimatized ourselves over these two days and got used to the bikes by riding for short distances. On the third day, we visited their garage and collected the ILP and also, got the carriers fixed on our bikes. We were provided with new helmets and other riding gear such as, knee guards, elbow guards, riding jackets, gum boots etc. All of this was included in the rental fee and we did not pay anything extra to avail these. Mr. Namgyal also provided essential spare parts such as clutch wires, brake shoes, tubes, handpump etc.We set off on our journey and after a couple of days, we found a fault in one of the bikes and Mr. Namgyal was happy to assist us over the phone and the problem was solved. We rerouted our journey to pass through Leh again so that we can visit their garage and get our bikes serviced before continuing. They took a test ride and serviced the bikes accordingly. We continued our journey after this and did not encounter any problems thereafter.We returned our bikes in good condition after the rental period and through this course, we had fostered a very good relationship with everyone working there. What I loved about LBR is that they are very warm and courteous to their customers and make them feel very comfortable. Each time we visited their site, we were offered beverages/snacks and we were treated very well. Mr. Gurumat has very good working relationships with both his staff and his customers and it was an absolute delight to be associated with LBR. We would highly recommend LBR for anyone looking to rent bikes in Leh."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Ongo B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Couples,Not honest,"We communicated through emails earlier and then when it came to paying the 40% deposit, the fees went up. I asked for explanation but there was no answer...Luckily we didn't pay the fee!"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Ladakh Bike Rental,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Fantastic,"Dear Ongo,

At the outset, I believe you have to experience the service of a provider before you rate them. 
Secondly, the rise in price was an honest mistake by one of the 5 employees of LBR who reply to 100s of mails every day. He didn't refer to the earlier mails while sending the invoice and hence failed to see that we had offered you a discount earlier (about a month and around 10 conversation threads ago). You hadn't even paid the advance amount. 
It is saddening to know you took the matter to the net before resolving it with us.

,,,,,"I was in Leh in July 2017 with two buddies. We rented 3 Royal Enfield 350 Classics from Ladakh Bike Rentals for 8 days. Gurmat, the owner, was incredibly helpful in organizing the reservation and answering all of the questions that we had. Once on the ground, he picked us up from our guesthouse and brought us to his impressive rental shop where we went over the trip plan and revised it based on road and weather conditions. The bikes were nearly brand new (< 3000km) and worked flawlessly. In addition to the bikes, we also hired a support vehicle and guide. Our guide (Mili) was fantastic and helped us navigate the multiple military checkpoints and ensured that we reached our desired destinations! It was certainly the trip of a lifetime and having Ladakh Bike Rentals as our outfitter was a pivotal decision in making the trip such an absolute success."

Eight of us went and all had a great time the tour was great the roads and scenery were fantastic some of it was on dirt roads and some tarmac. If your after 5* and silk pyjamas I'd go else. If your after an experience of remoteness stunning scenery and nice people this will tick your boxes the camping and food was very good great guide, can't fault it really i would have preferred to do it on my ktm but the enfields added to the experience.

Communicating with him prior to arrival is a headache because of poor internet and network downtimes, which actually got us a little worried. But from the point we landed in Leh, GurmatAnd his boys were extremely responsive and cooperative. Bikes are all almost new. We were a group of 5 riders and we got bikes that had run 340kms, 890kms, 2800kms, 6200kms and 19200kms. Except for one, all were practically brand new and in excellent condition. We had also taken on rent a mechanic, Dalix because we were worried if we would have issues on the way, but had almost none. Dalix was extremely helpful. A quiet chap but that was to our advantage too 😜. On the whole, brilliant experience. Most other rentals we saw had pathetic looking bikes compared to the almost brand new stuff Gurmat gives us. Wouldnt hesitate to recommend him. And if theres another ladakh bike trip, it is only with Gurmat. All the best guys and keep giving customers such good service. God bless"

Can't praise them highly enough, the tour guide and backup crew were exceptional in every respect, the bikes were almost faultless and any problems soon sorted without drama.  We covered 1300Ks over some of the most dramatic and challenging roads but couldn't smile any wider.   Thank you everyone and keep up the good work."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,GKrish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Enroute Khardangla vehicle Breakdown,"Visited Leh in 17th May for 8 days, the main purpose was to ride to Khardungla along with my wife. All started well until we reached 15kms from Leh. We stopped for picking up a stuff from our bagpack, switched off the ignition andit did not come back. It was Bullet 500 206model 18k ridden. The vehicle was good 2 days before the this ride. But our bad luck, battery failed and fails to start.However we managed to call the Tsewang with great difficulty, by borrowing the phone from a passer. We had to be in that cold weather for 2hrs+ and managed to return the vehicle and take a taxi to Khradangla. It was indeed a great ride of 15kms. We did enjoy spending time of 2 hrs doing nothing in the isolated area. Since it was 1st week of May just then the season started we did not have many tourists passing."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,GVK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,No better team than Ladakh Bike rentals to have on this epic journey,"We went with Gurmat's team on the Manali-Leh trip last year mid July. As most people who plan this once in a lifetime undertaking, we tried to do an exhaustive amount of planning and preparation. Put aside the bikes (great condition), the accommodation (sufficient) and the services (sincere), what really made this trip special for us in ways we did not expect is the personal touch from Gurmat's team.In our pre-travel communications, connectivity was a problem and that created doubts in my mind as to their reliability, but I was completely wrong. This was just because of the nature and location of their jobs. In due time, we got all our questions patiently answered, were able to discuss different routes and plan custom itineraries to our hearts content and all this at a very reliable and transparent cost.The day we set out from Manali, all the preparations were in place and all of us even got new helmets when we complained about our old ones being in bad shape. We has asked for a mechanic to ride with us (an absolute must, or you can opt for a backup vehicle with a mechanic). What we were expecting is an experienced professional who would guide us and keep us out of harms way. What we got was Tani. At first glance, he seemed like a quiet kid and we were openly questioning whether he had the experience to help and guide us along the trip. Turns out he is an awesome biker, has the mountains in his heart and biking in his veins, knows all the routes in and out and is a boss when it comes to fixing bikes in absolutely dreadful conditions. He must have fixed different problems with our bikes ranging from small to big about half a dozen times apart from graciously helping out the numerous tense, stranded travelers we kept encountering enroute. Apart from all this, he single handedly made this a special trip with his infectious enthusiasm and colorful personality. Some of the accommodation enroute can be charitably called basic, but that's part of the experience (the toilets everywhere were absolutely clean). We also stayed in Gurmat's own hotel in Leh. The place was like heaven after our spartan nomadic lifestyle of the previous week, but the service cannot be compared to a professional hotel. The trip was also not one that went close to military precision. This went both ways as in all our interactions, they never came across as ""business minded"". All of their suggestions were with our benefit in mind and the pricing was reasonable and transparent. When we kicked things off in Manali, there was some confusion because of which they actually sent down a backup vehicle from Leh to Manali which had to turn around halfway and they didn't charge us for it. Ditto when returning the bikes -they were obviously the worse for wear and were sporting some new scuffs and dents. But Gurmat's team really didn't have the mindset of wringing money from customers. It took us a little while to grasp that Gurmat and his team (I unfortunately cannot recollect the names of the others) are in this coz they love what they do. More than anything else, it was the personal touch and warmth of each of them that elevated what ought to be a legendary trip into the realms of magical."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Gourav99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Simply the best possible service you can get,"I was in Leh for 5 days with my partner . After reaching the hotel I called them up with no prior arrangement and enquired abt a bullet . Asked them to get it to the hotel next morning around 10 am. The owner was very polite n courteous I think his name was Gurmat . Took the delivery next day checked the bike and took a test ride before accepting it for 1000 Indian Rupees a day and pledged my Voter ID card. I got an Electra that had 10000 kms on it , considering Leh standards it was new. After riding it for a day I felt that the Brakes got very loose so called them up and they showed up in the morning on time and fixed the brakes and we rode around for a couple more days. After 3 days I felt like extending the possession for 2 more days so I called up the owner he agreed no confusion . U need to fill fuel at your own expense and the mileage was around 30-40 kms / liter. At the end of my stay the night before I had to leave they came and took the bike , paid them the cash as agreed earlier and took my ID proof back frm them. The whole experience was just great thanks to Ladakh Bike Rental and their team.

This was my first trip on a RE 350, I was a bit nervous at first but the guys put all my fears to rest and off we went.

The bikes were perfect with no cause for concern. We were given brand news spares for both vehicles. As also the stay at his hotel was a delight as all the helpers were literally very helpful at any given time of the day or night.

The bikes were rusted through and Gurmat the owner confirmed 'we don't have enough time between tours to fix properly' Another day the whole back fender of my bike fell off so no lights or indicators for the rest of the tour.Another day we ran out of fuel, they forgot to fill up the spare cans, whilst they were off looking for fuel 2 of the mechanics were racing around sand hills on the bikes, wasting fuel and crashed twice, these were the bikes paying customers then rode...Another morning we were to have an early start but the camp boys wouldn't get up so we wasted the early start 'I cant make them get up' was the tour organisers response...No first aid kit with the group, one guy (when his foot peg came off and he had to ride the bike without a peg; no spares) burnt his leg on the exhaust, not even a bandage on the support vehicle.The support vehicle got stuck in a water crossing, they had no rope, no chain, strap or anything to recover the vehicle, tour group wasted hours trying to push the vehicle out of the water.No communication, no clear route, no professional approach that I've experienced in other India tour organisers. Bikes are absolutely not maintained to the point they are falling apart through rust.....Ladakh is beautiful but spoiled by this amateur, unprofessional and very dangerous organisation."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Gaspard G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Memorable trip and great service,"We went for 11 days motorbike trip in Zanskar valley. Gurmat has been super helpful and reliable prior to the trip, welcomed us upon arrival in Leh, and gave us a tailor made, 100% flexible trip.We were 5 friends and had a back up team of 4, with a great guide/photographer, a talented cook, a strong mecanician and a good driver. The bikes were perfect (royal enfield bullet and classic 500cc), the camping gear new (north face tents, matresses, etc...), and the itinerary simply amazing.I recommend the Zanskar tour if you are an experienced biker and have a good physical condition (some days are 10 hours on dirt tracks), but it is definitely worth it.Food, landscapes, rides, back up team, gear: everything was fantastic!"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Johnson R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Awesome experience with Gurmat,"It was a nice visit to Ladakh with my office colleagues. We thought of biking in Leh and after some research we narrowed down our option to LBR. We required 5 bikes for four days. We got the bikes on time and also they offered the spares, repair and puncture kits. Gurmat provided enough information about the routes and some useful things. There was a landslide enroute to pangong but he offered some advice which lead us to visit the pangong lake with ease. Also he offered a cab to reach Manali which was a good ride till Manali and also he offered a good price for us. Overall it was a good experience for us with Ladakh bike rental. Thanks to Gurmat and team for his support given to us."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Darin A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,"Good price, but their poor communications in their team tainted the trip","There are some pros of this company that I will list later, but I want to describe the situation that drives this rating first.On the section going to Pangong Lake we stopped shortly after Chang La Pass to huddle up for lunch. At this point both of our mechanics were sent back over the pass to pick up needed motorcycle parts given the number of breakdowns (this plays in later). When we continued we got about 7 miles from Pangong and were stopped dead by a massive landslide covering the road (with our tent / kitchen truck already on the other side). We were forced to return to the nearest city prior to overnight, which was complicated by a local festival taking up many of the available rooms. After some time we were finally able to secure lodging but with most of us (including couples) now sharing rooms with multiple people. It was an uncontrollable event, we were told that we would be reimbursed for the rooms that we then had to pay for, and we accepted that.The next morning we were all disappointed to not be able to see one of the key attractions, but were then frustrated further that we could not move out because there had been no way to reach the mechanics or the kitchen truck - and our guide was unwilling to allow us to proceed without the mechanics to back us up. So we ended up having to do the maintenance on the bikes ourselves and ended up sitting around the guest house until noon before we finally got some communications with the mechanics so they could meet up with us. So at this point we had missed a key attraction, had paid for a set of shared / crowded rooms ourselves, and lost 4 hours the next morning doing our own maintenance and  waiting for the mechanics.Ultimately when the trip was over we talked to the owner expecting him to honor the reimbursement we were promised. We were floored when he adamantly rejected the reimbursement to us coming up with a number of non-relevant reasons (for example, that he had upgraded some folks to 500cc bikes - even though I had already paid for a 500cc bike). He would not be persuaded, even when we suggested he cover half the cost given the 'act of God' nature of the event. Even then he would not reimburse us. It was unfortunate as it tainted what otherwise was a good trip.The pros:- Price (but you get what you pay for in customer service. Also, be sure to ask what a 'luxury tent"" looks like - its a basic 2 person pup tent)- The mechanics and kitchen staff are tremendously hard workers, always up before everyone else and awake after everyone has gone to bed prepping for the next day to keep everything running- The actual trip leader was very accommodating and worked very hard to try to make everyone happy.- The views and challenge of the ride were excellentAgain it's unfortunate that given the issues with the owner I could not give a fully excellent review, otherwise it was a fun trip."

We had taken 2 bikes on rent from them for 5 days for Umling La. Besides the bikes being in good condition the team helped us with additional items like jerry cans, bungee cords and even a local SIM card and without even asking twice.In material value terms these may not seem big, but it was the helping nature and attitude of LBR team that impressed me a lot.I would highly recommend LBR for taking bikes on rent when in Ladakh.Thanks Tsewang and team for your amazing service."

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Manon belgium,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,AMAZING,"I want to say a big THANK YOU to Ladakh Bike Rental. Thanks to them, and especially to Gurmat and Kel, we have had the BEST TRIP EVER.With a good mix between good roads and off-road, our itinerary took us to lost places far from mass tourism: all what we wanted.  The landscapes are spectacular and the locals are super friendly.  Homestays, small hotels, campsites, beautiful hotels, it was very varied. We asked them to bring us to “lost” places without mass tourism, which makes that we had some nights without shower/internet/confort but those nights were in the most beautiful places I have never seen in my life so it was really worth it. (They can adapt the trip and bring you to more confort places and/or more touristy). As we were only two riders (women), we decided to take a guid during our bike trip. We were so lucky to have this guid, Kel. Friendly, funny, cultured, strong, always there to help us and flexible.  It was a real pleasure to share this trip with him. I hope we will see you soon for another trip in India The bikes were very nice and quite easy to ride. Nevertheless, if you do the same trip as us, it’s better to have a bit of experience in off roads. To summarise, I really recommend Ladakh Bike Rentals!! I also recommend the hostel, @the Courtyard 🤩🤩"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,SacreTeam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,Exceptionnel ! Organisation sur mesure parfaite !,"Exceptional from start to finish! Ladakh bike rental, represented by Gurmat immediately responded to our request and did everything possible to first prepare our trip and to make it extraordinary on site.My daughter (25) and I (61) rented two Himalyan Royal Enfield motorbikes for a wonderful tour in Ladakh to remote places, off the beaten track from June 10 to 24, 2022. Gurmat found us an exceptional guide to complete this adventure. Indeed, two women needed a guide and mechanic for this trip....When we arrived in Leh, the welcome was great. Gurmat and his team first made us stay 2 days in this friendly hotel The Courtyard in order to get used to the altitude and to shine the first 2 days around Leh to familiarize ourselves with motorcycles. The bikes were in excellent condition and only had 6000km on the clock.Then we left with this great and friendly guide, Kel Sherpa, 12 days to discover this beautiful region, our luggage on our motorcycles.Fantastic! Breathtaking landscapes, sometimes difficult but manageable roads. We passed passes over 5000m, sometimes a little snow and only 1 day of rain.We had various accommodations, often very comfortable, sometimes less given the very remote places.We lived intense moments, made wonderful encounters, learned a lot about the country, the culture, visited monasteries.The reception of the inhabitants of Ladakh was very friendly and often impressed to see two women discovering their country by motorbike!We enjoyed every moment, enjoyed the Indian food, never got sick or had any altitude related issues.The program was just perfect!We 100% recommend Ladakh Bike Rental for its efficiency, its kindness and for having organized a tailor-made trip for us to know authentic Ladakh.Thanks again to Ladakh Bike Rental and Kel Sherpa for making us live this unique adventure."

Even before booking, Gurmat was extremely helpful with tips to help me plan my trip. When I landed I had a brand new Himalayan and all the gear I required. The bike was flawless and the equipment in good condition. I also stayed in the Courtyard above the bike shop. The room was comfortable and the open area in the middle was great for socialising and planning the trip and potential detours with Gurmat. The food was perfect for the climate - tasty, filling and warm. If you’re looking for a bike or bike tour in Ladakh and/or need a place to stay, this is highly recommended."

Gurmat has planned our short visit to Leh ladakh is a proper way that we got to see the adventurous side and the mesmerizing beauty of ladakh. The stay provided by him in Chospa Hotel was amazing and luxurious  which had built in a luxurious ladakhi architecture. Tashi's has been so humble with us and took care of us like a family member. He was always ready for every challenge just to ensure we dont miss anything in our trip (Just for the view which I can enjoy sitting in the front seat, he stopped the vehicle on the way to khardungla for which he had to struggle for 20mins to keep the vehicle moving again as it was stuck in snow), he ensured that we stay warm all the time by making a hot coffee when ever required and was always available with us for clicking some amazing pictures of us. Not to the surprise picture which he clicked and sent to me after me reaching home to surprise me again.Will definitely prefer only Ladakh Bike Rental for any trips and tours to all my colleagues and family.Hoping to travel with you guys again soon...!!!Lots of love from Hyderabad ❤️"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Puneet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Family,Literally best experience of my life.,"A wise advice for all of you if you are going to travel in North just go for LBR. They will get it all covered for you. No matter how bad the weather is, No matter if thing go sideways, they have preparation for everything. I just loved their network. All the hotels I stayed in, every single one of them gave the best hospitality possible. I booked a bolero with an himalyan. The driver named tsetan doorjay was very very very helpful. Whenever bike riding was not possible because of excessive snow we just put the bike onto back side of bolero and just sit in the car. They had snow chains, oxygen cylinder every necessary thing with them. I travelled for 8 days and every day it was snowing and because of their proper arrangements we crossed every pass easily. Gurmat bhai and tsewang bhai both of them are very humble. We decided to spend a day with them and change our last day plan and they didn't hesitated to change the plan at the last moment. Last day they showed us leh Market and helped us in shopping. The trip was so amazing that I am planning the same trip again this year and half of my excitement is to meet the LBR crew again. They stayed in touch whole year as we are friends now. Prices are also very reasonable. Can't wait to meet them... 💯 Thanks for such a great experience gurmat bhaiya."

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Ragul Ravichandran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Friends,"Leh,  Ladakh - 2021","The favourite part was to experience ladakh during winter and to learn about the people's culture during this season. First day Mr Gurmet picked us from airport and dropped in a very nice stay ( deja vu). That day was just to take rest and adapt to the altitude and temperature. Next day we started driving to lamayuru which is 120 km away from leh. The bikes ( Himalayan)  provided from the Ladakh bike rental was in very good condition and it was properly maintained.  We had a great experience on the way to lamayuru and mr Gurmet arranged a very nice comfortable stay in lamayuru. After 2 days of experiencing lamayuru we headed to the adventurous ride on kardhungla, nubra valley and panong lake. Mr Gurmet arranged us a local guy ( Mr Dorjey ) for the local guidence and support. He was excellent hardworking guy we ever met. He made our trip very comfortable even in the most uncomfortable places like panong frozen lake  with the temperature of minus 21 degree Celsius.  Because of the proper planning and management from Mr Gurmet ( Ladakh bike rental) we had a very great time experiencing the place and explore the culture.  Charges are very reasonable and very effective. He won't charge you any extra money. Very genuine and very trustworthy guy to plan your trip.  And thanks to Mr Gurmet and Ladakh bike rental team  for making our trip as a memorable and as a life changing experience. Even we had a lot of conversation about the place and culture with Mr Gurmet which gave a lot of information about the place and context. Once again thanks a lot for all the efforts you have put for our trip. We felt very happy and satisfied with your Service.  I strongly recommend him. 😁"

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,rama adinugraha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,SUPERB LADAKH BIKE OPERATOR,"Thanks God, i found Ladakh Bike Rental in website.. Gurmat (CEO of LBR) is super friendly and professional bike rental operator.. In Early March i contacted him to ask about single solo trip 11 days to ladakh, and he replied my email in no time.. Month later, i emailed him back, to ask about private tour for 4 riders (11 Days , Into Thin Air Tour - Itinerary like in LBR website), and then he replied me in no time with good explanation about The Tour itself and ask what do we want for motorcycle... So, i asked him that we were 4 riders, want to ride 3 Himalayan and 1 Classic RE, with lite modified itinerary and ask a mechanic to accompany us within the tour.. Then he replied me again about T&C and Quotation with very very very very good price.When we arrived at Srinagar, we were welcomed by Stanzin using toyota Innova taxi and take us to departure point.The bikes is very well maintained (LBR always sell their bike after 3 years operating)..From previous email, Gurmat told me that he will provide a backup vehicle for just 4 days (2 days in the early tour and 2 days before the tour ends), but in fact he gave us BONUS a back up vehicle within the tour so we dont have to attached our luggage on the bike woohooo... (Thanks Gurmat)The tour it self was very very awesome and memorable journey, thanks to LBR crew, Stanzin (our guide with back up vehicle) and Sandeep (our mechanic), they gave us the warm of ladakhi people.. They explained everythings within the tour.. and also they have good skill to take a picture..The route we took are from Srinagar - Kargil - Leh - Pangong Lake - Nubra Valley - Leh - Tso Moriri - Tso Kar - and finish at Leh, along the route we were amazed with the beauty of Himalayan, Korzok Lake, Pangong Lake, and Tso Moriri Lake and always stunned with the view. The Road we took was 30% offroad, but we like it very very much..Accomodation also very nice, Gurmat always considered with hotel and Deluxe tent, he always gave us best accomodations within the budget, and make sure that we always have a good rest. Another bonus from Gurmat are, when The last day he gave as a memorable overnight at Shakti Village Resort, a cozy resort with beautiful view (Thanks Again Gurmat)And also Gurmat invited us to farewell Dinner (beer included) (Thanks againn Gurmat)..Overall, Gurmat (Ladakh Bike Rental) and his crew has make our dream trip became an epic journey and memorable..

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,dead_monkee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Adventure of a lifetime with Ladakh Bike Rental,"Ladakh is a hidden gem in India and thanks to Gurmat and his crew we had a wonderful experience conquering the wild terrain in Ladakh on two wheels in April 2017.We got in touch with Gurmat in early March, and despite the short notice he offered us a well planned itinerary. The trip consisted of visiting Leh and its surrounding remote villages on a Royal Enfield Bullet 500. Tour guide, mechanic, supporting vehicle and accommodation for all days in Ladakh are included. On the day of arrival we were greeted by Gurmat and checked our vehicles. The machines were well maintained, and any adjustment request to the bike was taken care of by the team mechanic immediately.The roads of Ladakh are mainly sandy gravel and rocky hillside roads. If one decided to go higher up the mountains, the rider encounters wet mud and even snow in early April. Despite the harsh terrain, our tour guide and mechanic led the trip with a passion and helped us avoid the many dangers of the road. With that being said, adventure riding in Ladakh is a big challenge to the skill and responsiveness of a rider. Winter motorcycle protection is strongly recommended. Ladakh Bike Rental is well prepared in that aspect - the company has plenty of gear to borrow from waterproof off-road boots to full face helmets.Again we thank the people in LBR team - Gurmat and Tsewang Namgail, Stanzin Khakyab and others for providing an excellent Ladakh experience. Hope we will return some day for the Zanskar..."

Gurmat the manager handled all my requests pretty fast and easily by changing my routes as I wanted and tried to offer a good price/quality package for almost 9 days. My guide/mechanic Norbu was helpful and a good companion. He managed to invite me for almost 3 nights and 4 days at his family home as I requested to LBR (live with local people) and he helped me discover some great hidden place around Kargil and Wakha (trekking/biking gems). Also Gurmat and his team helped me find a cheap flight ticket from Leh to Delhi 2 days before my departure as no seat was left online. As a solo traveler, i enjoyed the package and i truly recommend LBR as a tour booking manager for the Ladakh region."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Haziq B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Highlight of himalayan trip!,"Gurmat was very friendly and accomodating! We were a group of 5 guys and rented 5 bikes, 2 himalayans and 3 bullets. We went to ladakh with no plan whatsoever and Grumat helped us with all rounded logistics, tailored to our budget. Bikes were well maintained, no problems with getting up and over the passes and roads. Gurmat and gang were very helpful and knowledgeable, answering any queries online and offline quickly, and they took very good care of us on and off the bike. They treated us as family and even helped take pictures of us while all of us were riding en route. 10/10 will recommend to anyone who is going to ladakh to experience the best ride of their life"

It was literally freezing cold reaching -12 degrees Celsius and we were not acclimatized to the cold and altitude. But with Ladakh bike rental crew around they provide safety and assurance the tools we need for this trip. To be honest we would have a hard time to make it through without them. Bike was okay, didnt break down whatsoever, was able to start freezing cold. so do have a talk with them, they know what they are doing. ladakh bike rental thank you"

We took the package consisting of 4 RE Himalayan, Accommodation, Breakfast, Dinner & Guide (Tsewang) . There is not a single thing that went wrong. LBR treats its customers as a part of the family. I can safely say that we have added friends from Leh in our life. Leh is a place wherein you  would need expert hands and look no further than Ladakh Bike Rental. These guys also arrange winter trek, winter bike expedition. If you would like to go to Ladakh, LBR is the professionals that you take service from...The ex-factor: LBR owns a hotel at Leh. You can literally pluck apple and eat it after Breakfast :) With Love, Vijay & Group from Pune :)"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Dino246,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Himalayan Highlights on a Royal Enfield,"It's a risky business booking a motor-cycle holiday in a relatively remote part of the planet, with somebody you don't know, & hoping that it will turn out OK! I took the risk with Gurmat (of Ladakh Bike Rental) and the experience was excellent & painless!!! Gurmat was so casual during our telephone arrangements that I wondered could he be as efficient as he seemed. The planned trip (for my son & I) was 14 days touring the Ladakh region of Kaskmir.We had zero problems and everything worked perfectly, from being met at the airport, to the bike tour with Phuntsok, our excellent mechanic & guide. We had a fantastic experience, crossing the three highest navigable passes on the planet (& other lower passes), visiting some of the remotest areas I have ever encountered and all of the time the scenery was breath-taking and the people we encountered were splendid, colourful & friendly. Every minute my helmet camera was off, I felt I was missing both scenery & local culture. I took the 'Deluxe' package, but I would recommend (for the small extra charge) that people considering this trip should opt for 'Luxury' in Leh, and take whatever is available when touring in the remote areas.I had a Royal Enfield 500cc Classic and this is the best of the available bikes for the terrain. The 'Himalayas' looks better, but the Classic is the bike for the job!Five star plus to Gurmat, Phuntsok & the rest of the team!!! I have no hesitation recommending them for such a trip, which should definitely be on one's 'Bucket List'!"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,lokiez,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Had a Nice trip,"I opted for ""Camps & Rides"" tour and i had a good experience. Whole trip was well organised and despite it being an eight day tour which requires good planning, Gurmat was flexible to accommodate our requests for route change just a day before!! A friend of ours was having trouble riding bike, so Gurmat provided us an extra person who drove his bike at no extra cost!! Absolutely amazing.You can trust ""Ladakh Bike rental"" for their word, atleast i had good experience.There was one small issue during the trip. I have not driven bike on mountain ever so i was slow with my ride and support vehicle driver kept on pushing to drive fast which was little annoying and can be risky as well. But still it was all manageable and i would definitely recommend them for Bike rental and tours."

From start to finish, Gurmat and his crew ensured (1) safety - extremely important for these roads. Every morning, our guide Angry, mechanic Sandeep and support driver Justin would ensure all bikes were in good condition. Angdu matched his pace/speed to our skills and road conditions(2) mesmerizing destinations and sites - which is the draw of ladakh. our tour brought us through the best of Ladakh with all 3bhighest passes and overnight stays at 3 Highest lakes. with stops at some of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen in my life. Pardon the pics, all shot with my mobile and I am a lousy photographer(3) great customer service - accommodating every request we had for them including ensuring members of our groups got their best photos, setting up a camp fire, buying water for us. Even his own lodging house staff Pradeep, Shankar and Reedam saw to our every need and cooked meals to our preference!If you are doing a Ladakh bike trip, LBR is the company to go for!Lastly, I have read negative reviews about communications - having been starved of connectivity (there is zero roaming and wifi, when available in Leh only is at best patchy), it is understandable if they are slow in response."

I tried contacting them thru email / whats app and SMS, 3 weeks in advance after reading the overrated reviews on TripAdvisor. There was absolutely no response. Finally then Tsewang called up and assured me a bike for my trip.Reached Leh and was on my way to their place , couldn't locate them so called their office to check the location. Response i got ""Bikes are not available"". The response was full of arrogance because they were overbooked with large groups'.Suggestion for group of 2-3 rider's , go to Fort road and pick the bikes instantly than wasting your time with LBR."

The vehicles were washed and polished well to suit for our group trip fitted with carriers and saddle bags for our requirement. LBR was able to upgrade our bikes in last moment to Himalyans for couple of days and provided us even accommodation for stay at different places in Leh, lamayuru, pangong, hunder etc. He has a very good contacts for Stay, permits and provides best bikes and even suggests best itinerary for your group to see places around.LBR provided best quality bikes and tool kit and also taught us how to change or use the tools during any breakdown in our trip. We drive close to 900 kms in our entire trip of 6 days where we did not face any break-down of our even once. Apart from this we even got accessories like knee pads, Go-pro, Boots, Helmets which were in decent condition before we could hire.In the end there are many vendors in ladakh for bike rental, but the best quality that we got is from Gurmat and i would strongly recommend to avail service through him when you are planning for a trip to Ladakh.I would appreciate Gurmat for his efforts and humble responses to accommodate customers requests.

,,,,,"I have taken avenger 220 for 7 days and paid all the money in advance thinking he has alloted me a good bike but once we started riding to different places, the bike gave problems such as auto shut etc ND the bike condition Is really bad. I went to change the bike but owner said this is only option even it's in bad condition. also the accessories that he gave me with bike didn't work ND a case happened that the air in back Tyre was too low, we started using the accessory to blow air but it was defective. The worst part is the last 2 days were pangong lake ND when we started the journey, the bike couldn't start In morning so we took a cab. When we asked the owner to refund 1 day money as the bike didn't worked, he refused even after his mechanic came ND saw that the bike is really in bad condition ND didn't started even after they tried. I really request the people not to take the bike from this source as they cheat the innocent travellers even after promising a good service. I am genuine rider ND came to leh on September 2017."

I want to dedicate my Ladakh trip to gurmat namgail( founder of Ladakh bike rental co.), Thank you sir for providing me an amazing bike and your guidance were certainly helpful in my trip.The most remarkable thing about Ladakh bike rental is that they are available round the clock and incase if you need any help they are just a phone call away. Also gurmat sir turned out to be my good Samaritan in my hour of need when I had carelessly lost my bike keys on my return journey, when I was stranded in the pangong valley. Sure enough I got help from the locals and other bikers on the way, but Ladakh bike rental were the first ones in my hour of need.My Ladakh trip has certainly been engraved in my memory and the beauty and splendour of Ladakh that I witnessed is worth remembering."

Since we were aware that there is very poor phone and internet connectivity in the Ladakh region, we dropped a mail; but Mr. Gurumat, the owner was quick to respond. We gave our requirements and he acknowledged. He requested us to make an advance payment and was very courteous throughout. We were constantly in touch with him and upon our arrival in Leh, we informed him. He made arrangements to escort us to his garage.Mr. Namgyal, who heads the service section, who also happens to be the chief of staff, showed us the vehicles that were to rent and his staff was working on giving final touches to it. He requested us to make full payment for the same and we also had submit a caution deposit of Rs. 5,000 per bike that would be returned to us when we hand over the bikes back to them. After the financial part was settled, he also asked if we wanted an Inner Line Permit (ILP). Since we had not applied for an ILP, we decided to get it done from him for a very nominal fee. He informed that the ILP would arrive after a day or two and that we had to collect it then. As per our plan, we acclimatized ourselves over these two days and got used to the bikes by riding for short distances. On the third day, we visited their garage and collected the ILP and also, got the carriers fixed on our bikes. We were provided with new helmets and other riding gear such as, knee guards, elbow guards, riding jackets, gum boots etc. All of this was included in the rental fee and we did not pay anything extra to avail these. Mr. Namgyal also provided essential spare parts such as clutch wires, brake shoes, tubes, handpump etc.We set off on our journey and after a couple of days, we found a fault in one of the bikes and Mr. Namgyal was happy to assist us over the phone and the problem was solved. We rerouted our journey to pass through Leh again so that we can visit their garage and get our bikes serviced before continuing. They took a test ride and serviced the bikes accordingly. We continued our journey after this and did not encounter any problems thereafter.We returned our bikes in good condition after the rental period and through this course, we had fostered a very good relationship with everyone working there. What I loved about LBR is that they are very warm and courteous to their customers and make them feel very comfortable. Each time we visited their site, we were offered beverages/snacks and we were treated very well. Mr. Gurumat has very good working relationships with both his staff and his customers and it was an absolute delight to be associated with LBR. We would highly recommend LBR for anyone looking to rent bikes in Leh."

At the outset, I believe you have to experience the service of a provider before you rate them. 
Secondly, the rise in price was an honest mistake by one of the 5 employees of LBR who reply to 100s of mails every day. He didn't refer to the earlier mails while sending the invoice and hence failed to see that we had offered you a discount earlier (about a month and around 10 conversation threads ago). You hadn't even paid the advance amount. 
It is saddening to know you took the matter to the net before resolving it with us.

,,,,,"I was in Leh in July 2017 with two buddies. We rented 3 Royal Enfield 350 Classics from Ladakh Bike Rentals for 8 days. Gurmat, the owner, was incredibly helpful in organizing the reservation and answering all of the questions that we had. Once on the ground, he picked us up from our guesthouse and brought us to his impressive rental shop where we went over the trip plan and revised it based on road and weather conditions. The bikes were nearly brand new (< 3000km) and worked flawlessly. In addition to the bikes, we also hired a support vehicle and guide. Our guide (Mili) was fantastic and helped us navigate the multiple military checkpoints and ensured that we reached our desired destinations! It was certainly the trip of a lifetime and having Ladakh Bike Rentals as our outfitter was a pivotal decision in making the trip such an absolute success."

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,vivek s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Awesome people and service; recommended,I rented a classic 350 for 10 days and I had asked for a new bike. They gave me a brand new one with just 1200 on odometer. Very kind people. Gurmat let me stay at his place for 2 nights. Didn't have a single problem with the bike in whole trip. They will help you with the itinerary and you will find their staff and bikes at all the places that you visit. Best service in Leh. 
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Freddy V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,superb service in a place like Leh where everything is a little more difficult,"This place has one of the best selection of motorcycles and are mostly new bikes, with their expertise, you can rely on the bike throughout the trip, the price are reasonable and I really think it is the best place in Leh for bike rental and services during the rent (ps they are very honest and dont aim to rip you off!)"

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,jason s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Himalaya trip ,"First guided tour we have done we normally plan our own and use our own bikes but for the money this trip cost in total it was a no brainer. Eight of us went and all had a great time the tour was great the roads and scenery were fantastic some of it was on dirt roads and some tarmac. If your after 5* and silk pyjamas I'd go else. If your after an experience of remoteness stunning scenery and nice people this will tick your boxes the camping and food was very good great guide, can't fault it really i would have preferred to do it on my ktm but the enfields added to the experience. Glad I did it if your reading this debating wether to do it or not GO FOR IT.. 👍"

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,raxas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Excellent Service! Thumbs up to these guys!,"Had an excellent experience with Gurmat and his teams. Communicating with him prior to arrival is a headache because of poor internet and network downtimes, which actually got us a little worried. But from the point we landed in Leh, GurmatAnd his boys were extremely responsive and cooperative. Bikes are all almost new. We were a group of 5 riders and we got bikes that had run 340kms, 890kms, 2800kms, 6200kms and 19200kms. Except for one, all were practically brand new and in excellent condition. We had also taken on rent a mechanic, Dalix because we were worried if we would have issues on the way, but had almost none. Dalix was extremely helpful. A quiet chap but that was to our advantage too 😜. On the whole, brilliant experience. Most other rentals we saw had pathetic looking bikes compared to the almost brand new stuff Gurmat gives us. Wouldnt hesitate to recommend him. And if theres another ladakh bike trip, it is only with Gurmat. All the best guys and keep giving customers such good service. God bless"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Chris S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Exceptional all round !!,"Myself and seven other guys from the UK just enjoyed a nine day tour with Ladakh Bike Rentals.  Can't praise them highly enough, the tour guide and backup crew were exceptional in every respect, the bikes were almost faultless and any problems soon sorted without drama.  We covered 1300Ks over some of the most dramatic and challenging roads but couldn't smile any wider.   Thank you everyone and keep up the good work."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,GKrish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Enroute Khardangla vehicle Breakdown,"Visited Leh in 17th May for 8 days, the main purpose was to ride to Khardungla along with my wife. All started well until we reached 15kms from Leh. We stopped for picking up a stuff from our bagpack, switched off the ignition andit did not come back. It was Bullet 500 206model 18k ridden. The vehicle was good 2 days before the this ride. But our bad luck, battery failed and fails to start.However we managed to call the Tsewang with great difficulty, by borrowing the phone from a passer. We had to be in that cold weather for 2hrs+ and managed to return the vehicle and take a taxi to Khradangla. It was indeed a great ride of 15kms. We did enjoy spending time of 2 hrs doing nothing in the isolated area. Since it was 1st week of May just then the season started we did not have many tourists passing."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,GVK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,No better team than Ladakh Bike rentals to have on this epic journey,"We went with Gurmat's team on the Manali-Leh trip last year mid July. As most people who plan this once in a lifetime undertaking, we tried to do an exhaustive amount of planning and preparation. Put aside the bikes (great condition), the accommodation (sufficient) and the services (sincere), what really made this trip special for us in ways we did not expect is the personal touch from Gurmat's team.In our pre-travel communications, connectivity was a problem and that created doubts in my mind as to their reliability, but I was completely wrong. This was just because of the nature and location of their jobs. In due time, we got all our questions patiently answered, were able to discuss different routes and plan custom itineraries to our hearts content and all this at a very reliable and transparent cost.The day we set out from Manali, all the preparations were in place and all of us even got new helmets when we complained about our old ones being in bad shape. We has asked for a mechanic to ride with us (an absolute must, or you can opt for a backup vehicle with a mechanic). What we were expecting is an experienced professional who would guide us and keep us out of harms way. What we got was Tani. At first glance, he seemed like a quiet kid and we were openly questioning whether he had the experience to help and guide us along the trip. Turns out he is an awesome biker, has the mountains in his heart and biking in his veins, knows all the routes in and out and is a boss when it comes to fixing bikes in absolutely dreadful conditions. He must have fixed different problems with our bikes ranging from small to big about half a dozen times apart from graciously helping out the numerous tense, stranded travelers we kept encountering enroute. Apart from all this, he single handedly made this a special trip with his infectious enthusiasm and colorful personality. Some of the accommodation enroute can be charitably called basic, but that's part of the experience (the toilets everywhere were absolutely clean). We also stayed in Gurmat's own hotel in Leh. The place was like heaven after our spartan nomadic lifestyle of the previous week, but the service cannot be compared to a professional hotel. The trip was also not one that went close to military precision. This went both ways as in all our interactions, they never came across as ""business minded"". All of their suggestions were with our benefit in mind and the pricing was reasonable and transparent. When we kicked things off in Manali, there was some confusion because of which they actually sent down a backup vehicle from Leh to Manali which had to turn around halfway and they didn't charge us for it. Ditto when returning the bikes -they were obviously the worse for wear and were sporting some new scuffs and dents. But Gurmat's team really didn't have the mindset of wringing money from customers. It took us a little while to grasp that Gurmat and his team (I unfortunately cannot recollect the names of the others) are in this coz they love what they do. More than anything else, it was the personal touch and warmth of each of them that elevated what ought to be a legendary trip into the realms of magical."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Gourav99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Simply the best possible service you can get,"I was in Leh for 5 days with my partner . After reaching the hotel I called them up with no prior arrangement and enquired abt a bullet . Asked them to get it to the hotel next morning around 10 am. The owner was very polite n courteous I think his name was Gurmat . Took the delivery next day checked the bike and took a test ride before accepting it for 1000 Indian Rupees a day and pledged my Voter ID card. I got an Electra that had 10000 kms on it , considering Leh standards it was new. After riding it for a day I felt that the Brakes got very loose so called them up and they showed up in the morning on time and fixed the brakes and we rode around for a couple more days. After 3 days I felt like extending the possession for 2 more days so I called up the owner he agreed no confusion . U need to fill fuel at your own expense and the mileage was around 30-40 kms / liter. At the end of my stay the night before I had to leave they came and took the bike , paid them the cash as agreed earlier and took my ID proof back frm them. The whole experience was just great thanks to Ladakh Bike Rental and their team. KUDOS to these guys for doing a great job and offering gud service overall.IF U LIKED MY REVIEW OR THINK ITS HELPFUL PLZ CLICK THE ""THANK"" BUTTON BELOW AND LETS KEEP SHARING OUR STORIES :)"

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Andrea M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Amazing ride on Royal Enfield Bullet,"We booked our two bikes with Ladakh Bike Rental as we were advised it could get very busy during July. From the initial email to returning the bikes we only experienced helpful staff and super friendly service. This was my first trip on a RE 350, I was a bit nervous at first but the guys put all my fears to rest and off we went. Across Changla to Pangong Lake, into the Zanskar valley and to basically all the monasteries in and around Leh. What a wonderful experience it was. Ladakh Bike Rental - Thank you for an amazing time!"

I have just got back to Bombay after spending 13 days in leh and I must say that Mr. Gurmat took great care of me and my mate right from picking us up to dropping us back to the airport at 5am,and e evrything else in between. The bikes were perfect with no cause for concern. We were given brand news spares for both vehicles. As also the stay at his hotel was a delight as all the helpers were literally very helpful at any given time of the day or night. Especially Raju with his smile and my friend Sangam who was always singing at any time of the day. Thank you LADAKH BIKE RENTAL-11500FEET &  THANK YOU GURMAT."

Ladakh_Bike_Rental,John B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,"Dangerous organisation, do not book with them.","The Ladakh region is beautiful and I have made three motorbike trips in India and many throughout the world but this organisation is the worst I have ever been with, where do I start...Second day, one bike had the foot peg snap off, third day another. The bikes were rusted through and Gurmat the owner confirmed 'we don't have enough time between tours to fix properly' Another day the whole back fender of my bike fell off so no lights or indicators for the rest of the tour.Another day we ran out of fuel, they forgot to fill up the spare cans, whilst they were off looking for fuel 2 of the mechanics were racing around sand hills on the bikes, wasting fuel and crashed twice, these were the bikes paying customers then rode...Another morning we were to have an early start but the camp boys wouldn't get up so we wasted the early start 'I cant make them get up' was the tour organisers response...No first aid kit with the group, one guy (when his foot peg came off and he had to ride the bike without a peg; no spares) burnt his leg on the exhaust, not even a bandage on the support vehicle.The support vehicle got stuck in a water crossing, they had no rope, no chain, strap or anything to recover the vehicle, tour group wasted hours trying to push the vehicle out of the water.No communication, no clear route, no professional approach that I've experienced in other India tour organisers. Bikes are absolutely not maintained to the point they are falling apart through rust.....Ladakh is beautiful but spoiled by this amateur, unprofessional and very dangerous organisation."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Gaspard G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Memorable trip and great service,"We went for 11 days motorbike trip in Zanskar valley. Gurmat has been super helpful and reliable prior to the trip, welcomed us upon arrival in Leh, and gave us a tailor made, 100% flexible trip.We were 5 friends and had a back up team of 4, with a great guide/photographer, a talented cook, a strong mecanician and a good driver. The bikes were perfect (royal enfield bullet and classic 500cc), the camping gear new (north face tents, matresses, etc...), and the itinerary simply amazing.I recommend the Zanskar tour if you are an experienced biker and have a good physical condition (some days are 10 hours on dirt tracks), but it is definitely worth it.Food, landscapes, rides, back up team, gear: everything was fantastic!"
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Johnson R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Awesome experience with Gurmat,"It was a nice visit to Ladakh with my office colleagues. We thought of biking in Leh and after some research we narrowed down our option to LBR. We required 5 bikes for four days. We got the bikes on time and also they offered the spares, repair and puncture kits. Gurmat provided enough information about the routes and some useful things. There was a landslide enroute to pangong but he offered some advice which lead us to visit the pangong lake with ease. Also he offered a cab to reach Manali which was a good ride till Manali and also he offered a good price for us. Overall it was a good experience for us with Ladakh bike rental. Thanks to Gurmat and team for his support given to us."
Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Darin A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,"Good price, but their poor communications in their team tainted the trip","There are some pros of this company that I will list later, but I want to describe the situation that drives this rating first.On the section going to Pangong Lake we stopped shortly after Chang La Pass to huddle up for lunch. At this point both of our mechanics were sent back over the pass to pick up needed motorcycle parts given the number of breakdowns (this plays in later). When we continued we got about 7 miles from Pangong and were stopped dead by a massive landslide covering the road (with our tent / kitchen truck already on the other side). We were forced to return to the nearest city prior to overnight, which was complicated by a local festival taking up many of the available rooms. After some time we were finally able to secure lodging but with most of us (including couples) now sharing rooms with multiple people. It was an uncontrollable event, we were told that we would be reimbursed for the rooms that we then had to pay for, and we accepted that.The next morning we were all disappointed to not be able to see one of the key attractions, but were then frustrated further that we could not move out because there had been no way to reach the mechanics or the kitchen truck - and our guide was unwilling to allow us to proceed without the mechanics to back us up. So we ended up having to do the maintenance on the bikes ourselves and ended up sitting around the guest house until noon before we finally got some communications with the mechanics so they could meet up with us. So at this point we had missed a key attraction, had paid for a set of shared / crowded rooms ourselves, and lost 4 hours the next morning doing our own maintenance and  waiting for the mechanics.Ultimately when the trip was over we talked to the owner expecting him to honor the reimbursement we were promised. We were floored when he adamantly rejected the reimbursement to us coming up with a number of non-relevant reasons (for example, that he had upgraded some folks to 500cc bikes - even though I had already paid for a 500cc bike). He would not be persuaded, even when we suggested he cover half the cost given the 'act of God' nature of the event. Even then he would not reimburse us. It was unfortunate as it tainted what otherwise was a good trip.The pros:- Price (but you get what you pay for in customer service. Also, be sure to ask what a 'luxury tent"" looks like - its a basic 2 person pup tent)- The mechanics and kitchen staff are tremendously hard workers, always up before everyone else and awake after everyone has gone to bed prepping for the next day to keep everything running- The actual trip leader was very accommodating and worked very hard to try to make everyone happy.- The views and challenge of the ride were excellentAgain it's unfortunate that given the issues with the owner I could not give a fully excellent review, otherwise it was a fun trip."

He is a very gentle person who listens to you and gives the best guidance possible. Being a local of Zanskar region, Lobzang knows the entire area very well. He provided us with a comfortable Innova which was driven by the most saintly person we have met, Tenzing. He is a very skilled driver, who always keeps his calm, helps people on road, and also helped us going out of the way beyond his duty. He is very knowledgeable of Zanskar and Ladakh as a whole, and he is a local of Zanskar region as well. Lobzang even helped us make changes on the run, when we were stuck with a taxi union strike at Kargil, and made the necessary changes.I would strongly recommend ""Zanskar Kanishka Expedition"" anyone who is planning to hire the service of a tour operator for their Zanskar trip.

We changed our itenerary many times to suite our need, Lobzang was always gracious to redo the itenerary and the pricing. Because we are photographers, Lobzang ensured we trecked through routes with best scenic views for photography. He was kind enough to get us homestays in villages like Purne where we experienced the life of the locals.

I can only express the very best praise to my companions, 1 guide, 2 helpers and 1 cook, friendly, nice and accommodating.price-performance ratio I highly recommend the agency ... thanks to everyone...we will See us again"
,,,,,"It is always be someone's concerns when trek into mountains with altitude. However, Zanskar Kanishkar provides us the confidence with their well planning and caring.During our Markha valley trek, Lobzang's experienced team showed us their professionalism. They prepared very good camping gears. The thick form mattresses, army double zip sleep bags, and even hot water bags make us sleep in peace. The kitchen is even more fantastic. Every night, we have a 7 courses meal not even repeatingly for the 5 camping nights. Besides, our experienced guides always give stories about Ladakh, tips on how to take care of us with altitude, enjoy the journey the same as us etc..Talking about the safety, we always carry bottles of oxygen throughout the journey for any unexpected circumstances. We have extra horses during trekking for any emergency evacuation. All of those made a wonderful Ladakh experience for our tourmate. Do not hesitate to contact them for your next dreaming trip. Thanks Zanskar Kanishkar! Thanks Lobzang! See you again."
,,,,,"We booked the trip for 6 days. Lobzang had done the great job in helping us with the itenerary. The driver; who I forgot the name, had provided us with such an excellent service. He gave us good advices the whole trip and drove very professionally. Such a good team!!!"

We walked over 400 km, and it was the trek of a lifetime! Our highly experienced guide, Angla was amazing- so kind, considerate and professional, as well as being extremely knowledgable on all aspects of the local area and culture. He was also terrific with our 14 year old son, and made an extra effort to cheer him up at the end of a couple of the more strenuous days, which we really appreciated. Gompo our cook was lovely and cooked us the most delicious high altitude meals you could ever ask for- we were amazed by the number and variety of dishes he was able to make on his tiny kerosene stove with what seemed like very limited ingredients! We especially loved his 'bed tea' every morning! I can't recommend this company highly enough- they were well organised, efficient and thoughtful, and we felt that we were safe and in good hands at all times, which is extremely important in such remote areas at very high altitude."

If you have not made the advance payment how can we send a Innova car from Leh to Srinagar which is 230 Kms away from Leh ???

and you have never clearly mention that you want to confirm the trip you have just made the enquiry and fro the enquiry we do not entertain until or unless you pay advance amount.

He was very knowledgeable about monastery and Ladalk culture, also very funny and very helpful. Noang the driver was very skillful on the high passes and helpful. We made a lot of stops for photos and drone video. Angla and Noang were very accomodative to our requests.It is recommended to go to Ladakh from May to October. But ladakh in March is beautiful in its own way as the mountains was covered in snow. If you go in winter, make sure to wear enough layers and have a good pair of shoes ( we had to change our socks every hour when we were on Khadungla pass). Going in cold season also beats the crowd. We even had Pangong lake by ourself."

From the moment we arrived in Leh we felt extremely well looked after and got the sense that Lobzang, our guides Angla and Gawa as well as the extended proter team were all working very hard to make sure that our group had a great experience and a genuine look at Zanskar region and the wider culture. The equipment we were given to use was clean and in good condition. The homestays were ideal, the food was a minor miracle and when we needed help with a potentially serious medical situation, the team proved to be very efficient and professional.

Travelling through Ladakh without knowing the roads and the conditions can cause lost of many hours/days.We had the pleasure of the personal care of Lobzang, every wish or problem immediately handled.I had a problem with my laptop, he took it tried to solve it, just amazing.The Ladakh area is one of the most amazing in India. Due to altitude and very short period that the weather allow enjoying this wonderful area, you need to plan it carefully.

Everything was perfectly organised and went smoothly except for the weather as we experienced unexpected snow storms while camping in Reru Valley; nevertheless, the team of support people Lobzang had assembled for us did wonders to keep our spirits up and enable us to carry out or work in spite of the challenging conditions. However, in the end, we decided to leave Zanskar a day early due to the adverse weather conditions and once we were back in Leh, Lobzang helped us to fill our time by arranging a rafting trip along the Zanskar river and a visit to the beautiful Thiksay Monastery.I would recommend the Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions company 100% for a visit to explore Ladakh. Lobzang is highly professional, responsive to queries and challenges, and was able to accommodate the demands of our expedition perfectly."

I can only say great things about Lobzang, very responsive, flexible to any requests we had before and during our trip, highly professional knows very well the area, what is possible and what not and what can be achieved in one day or requires multiple days. We were able to see so many things during this relative short trip that for others it can take a month. Just as an example most agencies will suggest to go to Nubra Valley and return to Leh and then go to Pangong lake (this requires to traverse 4 times a couple of high passes), Lobzang was the only one who told me about the direct road from Nubra to Pangong, not only making the trip more efficient but also taking us thru one of the beautiful roads in Ladakh. If an issue came up during the trip he immediately took responsibility and found us an alternative solution in no time. In short I highly recommend his company."

He came to meet me prior to that at the guest house i stayed, and provided some very useful tips to deal with high altitude. I cant thank him enough for that : it made the whole trek absolutely enjoyable.He arranged everything to perfection : the guide, the porter, even the medicines in case needed (which I didnt). The guides were fantastic, and i thoroughly enjoyed the trek. After the trek was done, he also arranged a taxi to drop me at the airport, and it was complimentary. Now that was a pleasant surprise !!I left Leh with memories that will stay for me ever, all thanks to Mr lobzang. In fact i whenever i have to go to Ladakh, i will simply get in touch with him and be carefree !I would recommend Zanskar Kanishka expeditions without hesitation to anybody who wants to explore Ladakh.

They could not do enough for us and always made sure we were as comfortable as possible.A wake up coffee in the morning before breakfast (in a proper kitchen tent) tea and snacks after the days treking and really fantastic meals prepared by our cook meant that we looked forward to each meal, rather than dread it as has happened on other treks we've done. We were even given a basin of hot water every morning for washing.I celebrated my 50th birthday during the trek, and the cook managed to surprise me with a birthday cake, and the guide presented us with a bottle of wine, compliments of the company. Touches like this really make a difference to the whole experience. This is a professional company that knows what it's doing, and knows how to prepare for and run a trek. We had great service from start to finish, and we both whole heartedly recommend using them.George and Sonia ( Scotland)"

Thanks to Lobzang and Angchuk this was fulfilled in the month of August 2018. Lobzang organized an 8 day trip covering Leh , Nubra Valley , Pangong Tso and Tso Moriri. All the places chosen for accommodation were good. The pricing was economical and most importantly Lobzang took great care while we were in Leh. He even oversaw / took care of a few others from different other groups who were slightly affected due to altitude sickness. Lobzang would personally come and meet us and enquire about the trip etc. Our driver , Angchuk was a super friendly person who has a great knack and control in driving around the region. There were a couple of stream crossings where Angchuk showed his skill by leading the way and clearing the small rocks on the way , paving for a smoother journey for others along the route. We had a great 8 days in Leh and look forward to being there once again to experience the rich diversity , culture and natural heritage of the region. I would wholeheartedly recommend ""Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions"" for any of your trips in the Ladakh and Zanskar region. They are the best out there for both Indians and non-Indians.

We face some damage path of ice which was not solid to go for, the guides team always help us to analyze the situation and lead us through using the safest way.We running out of stamina and feel fatique easily due to high altitude which we are not familiar of, the guides team helping us with our day pack, even at certain point they have to carry 2-3 bags at once and still doing the guiding job perfectly.Porters team always moving direct to either lunch point or camping point first as guides will always take care of us. But when they discover certain location that need more man power to ensure our safety, they stay back at the area waiting for us, and work along with guides to help us pass through one and one obstacles.Although having lesser interaction with porters team compare to guides, but from day to day and night to night, I do see and appreciate their effort not just carrying our stuff, but also building camp, cooking, boil water, serving and cleaning to ensure we have the best experience throughout the journey. Without these professional, I know we will not able to complete our itinerary and plan for sure. I am glad that our bonding in the end is not just business relationship, but had build up into close friendship!

Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,Ping,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Solo,"Prompt Response, Customised Itinerary & Excellent Guide","I travelled to Ladakh (Zanskar Valley & Tsomoriri Lake) on a 14 days trip in August 2017. I contacted a few travel agencies and ended up selecting Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions as Lobzang was very prompt in responding and allowed for various customisation (changes in itinerary and my own hotel choice in Padum, Zanskar Valley). He gave a reasonable quote and most importantly was able to provide a female guide as I was travelling alone. The guide, Ms. Sonam Angmo was excellent and one of the best I ever came across! She speaks fluent English and could really preempt all the guest's needs. As we were travelling long distances on some days (6-13 hours car ride), she would prepare fruits and snacks to make sure I am not hungry. She knows that I like Thukpa (Tibetan Noodles Soup) so she got the Hotel to prepare Thukpa specially for me in addition to the standard buffet dinner. It was a joy to chat with her as she is really knowledgeable about the region and have so many interesting life experiences & stories to share. Angmo is also very resourceful. My original plan was to visit Zanskar Valley and the Aryan Villages Dha Hanu but due to landslides and roadblocks on the road towards Dha Hanu, we head towards Tsomoriri Lake instead. As the permit took some time to settle in Leh, on the first night at Tsomoriri Lake we arrived late in the evening with not much options and stayed in a rather shabby hut. Angmo could tell that I was not satisfied with the accommodation. The next morning, she immediately brought me to look for another place after breakfast. She used her extensive connections, pulled some strings and managed to get me a comfortable room with hot shower. It was peak tourist season and around India's Independence Day so I was very impressed.   Angmo is also really kind and helpful. At the guesthouse in Lamayuru, we met an Israeli couple and she helped to arrange transportation & negotiated a discounted price as the guest house owner could not speak English and the Israeli couple had 3 young children, alot of luggage and rather specific requests for the type of vehicle.Angmo have many friends & relatives in Ladakh and it is amazing as she got me access to many places that are not on a usual tourist route. An example was an invite into the teacher's quarter for tea at Puga Nomad Residential School as her relative is teaching there. Overall, I enjoyed the trip very much and a huge thanks to Angmo for making it so fantastic with her exceptional service & friendship!"

He helped me a lots and answer very clearly eg. plan the trip, book the hotels (some places such as Pangong lake and Tso moriri are vey hard to book the hotel because you have to transfer the money across the country for booking). I also have to transfer the deposit money to him to confirm my tour booking. Over 9 days and 8 nights at Leh, my driver (Nima and Tenzin) drove us to many beautiful places. They are very good in driving and very nice in term of service. If you plan to visit Leh, I recommend to book the tour with Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions and Lobzang will help you everything that you need."

Lobzang kept in constant email contact and given Ladakh's unreliable internet that was no easy task. His staff is experienced, friendly, professional and safe. From our guide Angla, fluent in English, we learned about Ladakh's history, culture and religion. Our cook, Gonbo, did a super job of preparing gluten free meals. Cholden proved to be a skillful driver on Ladakh's roads and found the 4X4 in good shape and comfortable. Our horseman was friendly and knew how to care and handle his ponies.For the first half of the trek we met up with the jeep at the end of the day at campsites and relied on ponies to porter gear and luggage on the second half. The different modes of transportation and pick up times were well-organized, punctual and dependable. The exceptional service to clients provided by Lobzang and his staff is why I highly recommend them to those travelling in Ladakh."

Not only the itinerary was stunning and varied, but the organization was perfect and the team kind and professional. First of all, I had an excellent contact by email with Lobzang to prepare and plan the trip.When you know how unreliable the internet connection is in Leh, it is quite a performance. Lobzang was very quick to reply, preparing detailed, well presented itineraries.During the trek, my guide had to go back to Leh for personal reasons, and a new guide arrived quickly to replace him without wait time or disrupting the trek program. Second, the 2 teams were simply excellent : our guides could speak very good English, they knew the best places to camp, were open to day to day slight program adaptations; the cook (the CHEF !) was 5 stars ; helper and horsemen very friendly and helpful. It is important to understand how important a good horseman is … if you do not want horses and your packs to be lost in the mountain.The 2 private transports by minibus and taxi, arranged to get to Kanji and come back from Korzok, were both comfortable and flexible. Overall, that was a memorable trip with outstanding service and supportI highly recommend Zanskar Kanishka Exp agency. Lobzang, many thanks again from the 3 of us. Take care. Kind RegardsRemi"

Lobzang was able to set up most of the items requested, from Royal Enfield riding day, to attending annual Masked Dance Festival, to Zanskar class 3+ rafting. There was a lot of driving, 7-9 hrs a day. Our assigned driver Sonam, while still young, was polite and knew the routes well, even on roads that didn't appear to have any track. We will consider Zanskar Kanishka again for future trekking trip. One notable and positive experience was that Lobzang often promptly replied to our group's questions and concerns, prior to and during the trip."

While in Leh he also showed great level of dedication with his punctuality and skill in handle unexpected situation. During the trip, due to altitude sickness, we have difficulty with the trip, and Lobzang's flexibily has helped us to have a pleasant trip. The choice for his guides is also excellent, we highly recommend Stanzin, chubby guy (driver), Gyatzel (Guide), Tenzin (helper) and Thiring (Chef) if they are available. His choice for the homestay in Leh is excellent, we stayed in a Ladakhi homestay (Dream Ladakh) and received really warm hospitality. It's a homestay which lie quietly near Leh with beautiful view and Shanti Stupa and the mountain from the balcony."

They're very friendly and service-minded and experts in the area. The supporting staff, like guides, cooks, porters or horse men are really friendly and helpful and fun too, but also very experienced and come from the region! So that means that during trekking you often pass by family members and also have a tea in a local house which is great for the local experience.I did already 2 times the Chadar trek with them and got always great help from Lobzang Sherap during the tours and with the staff, I had the best tours. Lobbying Sherap always tries to help you with good advice and try to reply the emails in time but the problem with Ladakh is that the emails not always working so even if you don't get reply sometimes it's because of the internet system. If that's the case, then in the worse case, he can help you later when you've arrived in Leh and you go and see him in the office (in Summer Time).  He always can help you with designing your tour or excursions, trekkings and he and his staff member are the most friendly & experienced group as you can imagine!So get the best out of your Ladakh & Zanskar & Spiti experience and get your stay organised by Zanskar Kanishka Expeditations and contact Lobzang Sherap!"

Contacting Lobzang 5 months ahead of time from Thailand; he has helped managed it through, by responding in timely manner via email, which I found out later that Internet was hardly available in Leh.  Once we arrived Leh, 4 out of 5 luggages did not show up!! Lobzang helped coordinate and drove us to pick them up the next morning to ensure we would start our Leh experience at the very best and we really appreciated that. Since we focused on culture, Shozang was our tour guide. He was well-rounded in history and religions, especially Buddhism, dynamic with advanced trekking skills. Our driver, Nima, a young energetic driver worked well with Shozang to get us through traffics up on mountains and ensured we had a good time traveling on super winding mountainous roads on high altitudes.  Driving through villages and monasteries, we learned new things everyday. Thanks to Shozang and Nima. All and all, we finished the cultural tour with big smiles, though the weather was unexpectedly colder than we thought. Wish to have more time to learn more about Ladakh 😄😃I would recommend anyone interested in traveling to Ladakh to contact Lobzang. He definitely gives you good advices on how to make the best Ladakh experience. "

Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Naval,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,A self-supported Kayak expedition on Zanskar,"This review is about my Zanskar self-supported Kayak expedition with Chotak and Kunga. Me and Ankush went on a Kayak trip from Padum, to Phisu, to Sacred Waterfalls and finally reaching Nimmo on the fifth day. I did multiple grade 3 and some grade 4 rapids in the Zanskar valley and am now a better paddler. Besides the tough rapids, there were amazing experiences over the camping too. The drive to Padum was beautiful, through across two high passes and through a narrow valley. At our second camp in Phisu, we drank chang (local alcohol) at a local wedding and roamed the untouched village. Chotak is a wonderful river chef and I think I could have learn how he makes Alloo Phing. Sleeping under the sacred waterfall in the Zanskar valley, under the full moon was again a super memorable experience. I am not the best paddler and was rescued safely by Kunga at the Gate rapid and Surprise 1 rapid. He also make a great friend during the trip. I have to plan doing Zanskar again very soon with Chotak.The only improvement I can think of adding to WetAndWild company is adding longer kayak paddles to the inventory. Rest we also stayed at camp site many days. On some days, we did two runs down Chilling and Scopoche rapids. The tent gets hot for few hours during the day, but everything else is great. The cook makes good stuff, we had BYOB parties and celebrated on multiple occasions."
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,sandesh gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,A Lifetime Trip to White Leh !!,"Based on their very positive TripAdvisor reviews, we booked our 8 days Leh trip with Wet N Wild Explorations. Our trip includes local sightseeing, Khardungla-pass, Nubra valley, and 3-day Chadar trek. Our hotel stay was cozy and comfortable. Chotak took care of all the permits and paperwork required for the trek. The best part of the trip was the experience of walking on Frozen river (Chadar Trek). On the trek, we were accompanied by porters, guide, and Chotak himself. He took care of us really well during the whole trek. We were treated with scrumptious meals throughout the trek. The guide (Abdul) was quite informative and enthusiastically engaged us in activities at night in camp.  We were extremely happy with Chotak's planning, tips, local driver and level of personal attention. Highly recommend!!   Thank you Wet n wild exploration and especially Chotak for providing a lifetime memorable experience."

And it trun out amazing trip with the great safety standard and service. So I planned to book my entire trip with them only. Can't explain it well in writing but it was the best choice ever I had in my life. And I would like to recommend this company whoever's travels to ladakh. Thank you team of the company. With Love Agam.

What he promised through our bookings and he went beyond to make our trip comfortable and memorable. i highly recommend Wet n wild for tose who are keen in real Adventure trip to ladakh."
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Martin B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,A world class adventure in Ladakh,"Nine of us have just returned to Australia and Canada after an amazing three-week Ladakh adventure with Chotak and his extremely fine-tuned Wet-n-Wild team.  With local sightseeing, home-stay lunches, mountain biking down some of the highest motorable roads in the world, plus the main focus of our adventure, kayaking on the Indus, Shyok, Hundar, and our finale, the world classic Zanskar gorge – it was an exceptional, and memorable adventure!  My best-ever adventure trip, and possibly the best organized in over 20 years of kayaking across the Himalayas. The camping was almost ‘glamping’, with hot towels before snacks, and the best range of camp food, including birthday cakes, fresh bread and pizza etc I’ve ever experienced on a river trip.  Well done Ramish.  All gear, equipment and kayak hire were first class.  Safety and rescues on the water was swift and professional.   Chotak’s communications throughout the whole organization of the trip were first class, and his commitment to detail and genuine customer care made for a relaxed stress-free adventure, and that was despite having to cancel our Srinagar acclimatization intro only 10 days before we were due to fly.  A highly recommended 5 star outfit.  Thank you Chotak and the boys."
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Julian R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,Greedy company and irresposible crew,"It seems this company has a lot of good reviews but my experience differs the mainstream opinion. I booked the Scorpochey - Nimo Stretch for two persons per suggestion of the company because we are newbies and just want some thrill and lots of splash of water. My partner has to return to Spain and I notify the company this fact. Without my knowledge the company changed the White Water Rafting to a Ducky raft and the Scorpoche to Nimmoo strech to the Chilling to Nimmoo stretch. As the company said in their website they upgraded me without inform me from one stretch ""especially good for the beginners"" to a stretch for ""hardcore adventure seekers"", everything because they wanted to avoid to refund the money of my partner.Naively I trust the company competence even when I saw that the inflatable raft changed to a ducky raft, maybe it is more suitable for beginners I thought.Far from what I thought the trip was a nightmare. I was falling constantly on the cold waters of the Zanskar. After falling 3 times the suit was filled with water and dropping quickly body temperature. My muscles were numb and asked to get out of the river but they keep me pushing to continue, everybody was having fun but me. Here I blame the company raft team for a lack of assessment to stop me from continue the trip because I was in a bad condition and I was not enjoying the activity.Despite my request to finish my trip I would fall again in the river, terrified, gasping for air and unable to hang on to the boat because my muscles were numb. At the end of the trip I was with symptoms of hypothermia, shaking body and cold sweat because of a terrifying experience.I was blaming myself after failing so miserably in this trip but after going to the office to collect the money from my friend who didn't come; they told me that I was not entitled to the money because I was upgraded to a more expensive (and more challenging) stretch of the river. Soon I realize why I fail so badly: they put a newbie in a strech for experienced rafters. I write my experience to offer some info to all newbies looking for a raft discovery experience because they may be subjected to the same experience I lived. Maybe the lack of tourists force the companies to this kind of practices, so please check the following:- Check the stretch of the river difficulty- Check the kind of boat they offer you.- Be clear about what kind of experience you want; for me a lot of splash of water is fun but falling into the water is not fun.- Ask about the possibility of falling in the water, keep in mind that after falling 3 times the wet suit fails to keep you warm and the trip becomes really unpleasant.- Demand that as soon as you ask to get out of the river, to comply with your wishes.Maybe this is a company for experienced rafters but for newbies I can not recommend this company."

We were so glad that we went ahead with their suggestion. It was an exhilarating experience! We had two 2 people assist us both through out the process (Shivam and Hari). They made the experience even better for us. Definitely recommend them to everyone! Good equipment, Great staff!"
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Bernard M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,Spectacular 28 km duckey trip on Zanskar river,"Excellent, super spectacular 28 km rafting trip on Zanskar river. Wet N Wild Explorations delivered on their offer for a great rafting on a super charged river (with ice cold water).  Excellent organisation, clear focus on safety with a very professional and competent team of 4 safety kayaks along the rafts. Necessary that day, because most of us flipped over in the major rapid.  There is no comparison between the 28 km rafting and the shorter versions : we did both, and the 28 km really qualifies as spectacular white water river rafting.  I wish this competent & sympathetic team best of luck for further developing their incredible rafting offer in Ladakh. Bernard, Luca and Samuel"
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Max Emil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Whitewater expertise,"I came to Leh as a solo kayaker and met Chotak in the Wet N Wild camp. He and all his staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful, and I was able to come along on several commercial trips which were all efficiently and professionally run - a really clean and personal experience on some amazing sections of whitewater. Staying in camp is great, with clean and comfortable accommodation and delicious food cooked for every meal."

Everything happened on time, our guides were very professional,they took good care of our safety and encouraged us to have fun. They offer you all the gear, information and assistance you need. Also, a very yummy lunch after the trip is available. Everybody in the camp is very sweet and helpful.Because of such a good experience,I decided to start a kayaking course with them and it's going very well so far. They also organise all other kind of adventure expeditions (trekking, cycling, biking). I honestly highly recommend Wet n Wild."
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Ashrut,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Personalised hospitality,"I got their reference from a senior colleague of mine. However, when I had my visit to Leh and surroundings, from day one I felt their personalised attending. I and my daughter faced Acute Mountain Sickness. Their followup, standing in queue at Hospital and not accepting money for my daughter's medicine touched my heart. Trip started from Khardung-la, Nubra, Pangyong, Changla, Stok, Hemis, Rafting at Sangam of and Heritage tour and other places. Driver at stay arrangements, as per my package were good ones. Tour designing also was apt. Camps at Pangyong, though were very shaky throughout night because it being very windy there. But nearly all camps at that place were like that only. At Sangam, their camp is really at a nice place, where they arranged our lunch after rafting. In hilly areas, getting a simple, freash n hot food was a taste to stay. Also, in between I wanted to purchase something for my office and their person case to assist me in local market. In between, my daughter had her birthday also, for which Mr. Chotak arranged gift and a dinner, which was tip of the iceberg. Thanks team Wet n Wild, it was really an experience that one usually cherishes long. Would give them 7 stars out of five, if it permits 😊😊😊All the best."

At the very first moment they made me so comfortable and started with funny conversations . Reaching at riverside camp made me feel like that I am in the lap of nature, cold winds, clear sky , thundering sound of INDUS,boulders and the most beautiful creature i.e cyrus (dog) welcomed me there with a cute gesture. All the crew members are so  humble , cool and fun loving that you will be like a group of friends of same interest. Chotak Bhai ( owner) is the coolest person I have ever met .

All other members are also amazing with their own skills . Food quality will  make you to full your belly more than your capacity . its so delicious that make you to lick your fingers twice .

Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,boomtangboy,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,"Absolutely amazing people, but.....","If you in Leh and in for some adventure, you definitely must contact Chotak and his team. While in Leh these guys helped me out right from tours to getting the necessary permits. I also was completely floored with their hospitality. So then why the poor rating? Well I coordinated and booked my rafting trip in June with Chotak in March and confirmed the same with him in May. There were some external factors that affected the price of the trip but I was assured there would be some work around / mid way. A day before the trip I went to the store and confirmed the same but on the day of the trip well the shutters were closed and when they finally opened shop they told me the price would be almost double of what was agreed. It was a real let down and also caused me to cancel an overnight trip."
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,binalembo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Exceptional 1 week fully organized tour in Ladakh (and 28 KM rafting trip),"We are a couple and chose Wet N Wild for the full organization of our 1 week tour in Ladakh last august, it has been the best choice, they even gave us oxygen supply throughout our trip and we always had refreshments. everything was perfect from the choice of sleeping arrangments to the help on deciding the itinerary (we did Leh, lamayuru, nubra valley and pangong lake). Our DRIVER RIGZEN was amazing, extremely professional and we always felt so safe even on the cliff drives. we also did the 28Km rafting trip and it was fun and we had all the necessary equipment."
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Andreacolorado,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Priceless day in paradise -already dreaming of next (longer trip),"I wish I could give more stars. Our day on the Zanskar was our stand out day of amazing trip to India. My advise - plan for more - my only regret is that I didn’t realize just how special this would be, and now have to go back to India for more (my dream is the 6 day expedition!) Just for perspective on this review - I have rafted a lot - my brother in law owns a rafting company in Colorado and myself and my 16 and 21 yr old daughters have spent dozens of days (and nights) on spectacular rivers. I knew that a day on the river was one of the best ways to really experience the spectacular natural beauty in Ladakh. I also was concerned about safety and equipment and training of guides and communication with the guides in a foreign land.  I chose Wet and Wild due to reviews that addressed these concerns and I can more than confirm that the professionalism of this company is way beyond the expectation at the highest standard. Additionally, my girls were super nervous because though we had been passengers in rafts so often, since we were just three customers, we could not afford to rent the whole raft. Chotak encouraged us to go for the Ducky’s (inflatable kayaks that require the paddler to paddle - you don’t just depend on your guide for the paddling - you depend on yourself) The timing was great for this as the rapids were still class three, still safe for adventurous beginners with the exceptional support of the guides in kayaks who taught us how to paddle through the rapids and never left our side. They carefully explained what to do if we did swim and assured us that if we did swim, they would be right there and that we could count on them. Sure enough I swam through a rapid and thanks to excellent gear was not even cold in the glacier run off and felt completely safe through the rescue. The Zanskar River is beyond spectacular and we were the only people on the river for 28 km stretch from Chillig to Nimmu. The three guides two on the river (and the driver who was not only an essential part of the safety team spotting through each rapid but also a professional photographer and guide himself) were all fun, helpful, teaching us and encouraging us, all with great personal stories and their love of the river was absolutely infectious - such cool people to spend the day with! These guys are top quality guides -dedicated to the safety and comfort and all around enjoyment of their spectacular home, again this is not just by India standards, I mean international standards of service! My daughters were beyond thrilled with the day -favorite day of the whole trip- and one of them is now determined to learn to kayak, she loved it so much. I just can’t thank Chotak enough for making that priceless memory possible for us!I would advise anyone to go on the longer day trip rafting or ducky trip (even beginners )the shorter trip will leave you wishing you had done the 28km (more rapids and more spectacular beauty to enjoy!) If you experienced or a kayaker, this is the company that can provide the support and comrades to share a mind blowing amazing trip. Anyone heading Rishikesh (year round rafting) -these guys can take care of you there. If you have more time- seriously consider the multi day options. Your only regret will be that you will wish you had time for more!"
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Adam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Wet N Wild gets 5 stars from a whitewater kayaker,"I traveled to Leh in August 2018 and only by happenstance ran into Chotak and his team at Wet N Wild. We were a group of traveling kayakers (not rafters) on a private trip. One day we walked into Wet N Wild HQ and met Chotak and his team. They really came through for us. I would go so far as to say they made our trip. Chotak let us tag along on one of their commercial raft trips. Then, in the following days, we paddled the Lower Indus with Chotak himself. After that, we were on the Wet N Wild program for the next three weeks. Punsok was our driver and friend and masterfully navigated our group through any obstacle presented (even when we were grumpy!). I was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of this organization. Skills, safety, and communication--the complete package. You really cannot go wrong in choosing Wet N Wild for whatever your next adventure may be."

,,,,,We went to Wet n Wild Explorations for our first rafting experience in the first week of September.  It was a nice scenic ride.  We opted for the one hour trip which did not have any rapids.  The rafts were good and we were given a short safety briefing.  Their staff are experienced and make sure you enjoy your rafting experience. It was quite a fun laid back slow ride during which we enjoyed the incredible views it offers of the mountains on both sides.  Next time we will surely take a more challenging trip with rapids.  I would surely recommend Wet n Wild in Leh for rafting.
,,,,,"Recently I returned from Leh after completing Ladakh marathon! Just before returning, I wanted to do rafting in Zanskar. I registered my slot through 'Great Ladakh Tours and Travels'. Their overall organisation of the event was quite good including transport, lunch and the main event 'rafting'. I had opted for 28 km rafting from Chilling to Nimmu. One of the highlights of rafting was their attention to safety. Participants were instructed in detail about the technique and safety measures. It was a thrilling experience to do rafting with Wet N Wild Explorations. Would love to join next time on a different rafting route!"
,,,,,"I made a one day trip of rafting in the river and had the best time! The staff is super friendly and funny, and in the same time is really careful about safety, they pick and drop you up in Leh, and give you a really good meal after the rafting session. You can book with them eyes closed it's all good!"
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,kumar Anshuman,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Awesome experience,"We visited Leh in the month of May-June18. In the run up to our trip we searched and enquired with many operators including Yatra and SOTC but we finally decided to go with 'Wet n wild'. At that point it was important for us that we were in touch with the tour operator Mr. Chotak(+91 94198 19721) directly, he is the owner and I always got responses from him unlike the other tour operator where u talk to the marketing guy and not the real people who are going to arrange and going be with you on the trip (I had very bitter experience of going with famed operators on one of my past tours).  I would have contacted him several times over a period of 3 weeks and he would patiently answer questions and when his phone was un reachable, I could get in touch with his team members.  And what a good decision it turned out to be. Mr Chotak is a gem of a person and all his team members are just so caring. This was the best guided tour of my life . He advised me to balance the tour with site seeing and adventure activity. No doubt that the Wet and wild company has the mastery on adventure activity. We loved the white water surfing so did my daughter who is just 8. He was a perfect host for us from the time we landed to the time we left Leh. As days passed, I realised that these people will advice you and will go extra mile to ensure your safety and comfort. You don't need to get worried at all, just leave everything to him. He hosted a additional parting dinner and a sumptuous lunch for us which was never in our package. I could not believe the full course lunch we enjoyed in the middle of desert, at a camp side.  I can't think anyone else for Leh. He told he is planning to organise tours in NE and I have already decided on my next tour, it has to be NE. "

,,,,,"I had the pleasure of working for Me Chotak in Ladakh for a couple of months this season. So because of that this review will come from a slightly different angle. I first met Chotak at Ganga kayak festival and after he managed the logistics for my friends 7 day kayak trip around Uttarakhand. His knowledge and experience on and off the water where invaluable, from arranging transport to cooking incredible food on an open fire.In Ladakh chotak has a range of guides from India, Nepal and a couple of western guides too. All his guides are well trained and very experienced. They are also qualified in first aid. Wet N wild is not just a rafting company. They will happily assist with any aspect of expedition planning and preparation. The company offers an invaluable resource for western kayakers. "
,,,,,"One of the best experiences in my life!Base camo is situated on a perfect locatin near the river and Nimmu rapids.It is a basic campsite, with all of the comodites. Food is literaly perfect, never in my life tasted so good food!It is mostly vegan and vegetarian meals, and it was soooo tasty.Specail thanks to cook Dave :)This guys are the most proffesinoal company for rafting in Leh, they have security at the top level, al experienced guides and safety kayakers.Specail thanks to Stansin who made every trip and staying overthere special. Also thanks to Warun, Neeraj, Shivam, Daman and the rest of the boys, and ofcourse Dave :)Tsangpo from the office was really heplpfull and make Leh experience really comfortable.If you want to have a perfect rafting trip on Zanskar and Indus, this is place for that."
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Digantjhala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,The best for adventure activities in Ladakh,"I was super happy with the work of this company. I came upon their details while surfing thru a book on Ladakh as well on Google. As this was our first experience at river rafting, we were a bit apprehensive, however we are so glad we chose ""Wet N Wild.""Both Zyangpo as well the owner Tsering Chotak were lovely people. They explained to us each minute detail and solved all the doubts and fears we had regarding river rafting. On the day of rafting, their bus picked us up from our hotel and then took the entire group to Nimoo, where they have a campsite. We were given wetsuits and the instructors gave us loads of helpful advice.We had chosen the route from Skorpoche to Nimoo, which was of 18kms and approx 2 hours. At the starting point, there was this lovely instructor called Marc who took almost half an hour and explained to us each and every little detail about rafting. He demonstrated to us what to do if one of us fell down, if the raft overturned. He gave us an important lesson - To always smile, irrespective of whatever happened.On the raft, we had a guide named ""Daman"" who was a fabulous guy. the seven of us and Daman had loads of fun throughout the entire 2 hours. We sang songs, braved rapids together, got down in the chilling water, and what not. Daman was a brilliant guide well versed with his job. I will never forget his style of saying, ""Okay team, paddle forwards.""\By the time we reached the end point, it was almost as if a family had been formed among the 8 of us.There was lunch at the camp after the rafting, and by the time we left, we had bonded with everyone.This was one of the most exhilerating experiences of my life, and I cannot thank ""Wet N Wild"" enough.Special mention to the owner Mr Tsering Chotak who was a gem of a person, ever polite and courteous whenever I called him. I would recommend everyone to engage with this company for any kind of adventure activities in Ladakh. When the owner himself drives your bus to the rafting point, you know he is really taking good care of you.Special mention to Laxman, the kayak guy who was an extra protector but enjoyed more than any of us."

Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,ashwinmurali1988,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,"If it's river rafting, it's got to be Wet n'Wild","It is by sheer luck that we walked into to the office of Wet n'Wild when we thought about rafting. The rest, as they say, is history. Had one of the most unforgettable experiences rafting in the Indus river, courtesy Wet n'Wild. Their team is so experienced that they made the whole experience so comfortable and enjoyable for us. They ensured our safety while also making sure we experienced the joys and thrills of rafting. Due to rough weather on 14th July, 2017, we could not go for rafting in Zanskar river, but the 2 and a half hour rafting in the Indus more than satisfied the adventure seeker in us. There again, I'd like to commend the team for taking us to Indus keeping in mind our safety as the utmost priority. The facilities they had at the finishing point were top notch and the sumptuous lunch was a bonus. Totally enjoyed our experience with Wet n'Wild."

Staff all very professional and highly trained and most of all friendly. I had a fantastic time being alongside them all for duration of my stay with them at the lovely river camp outside nimmo. Great price considering the 3 great meals a day. If you are going rafting in Ladakh (or Rishikesh) these are the people to go with for the best, most enjoyable and safest day out!"

Also they will take care on each and every detail, make sure you are having a good time ! Let me tell you one secret - they have a rule that if the boat flips completely, the main guy on the boat has to give party to everybody on the camp. We tried but not so successful. They have kayakers who are amongst the top 5 of India. Amazing experience !!! Thumbs up !! Keep up the good work !!!"
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,hareetds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Leave it to the professionals!,"Came across them on Trip Advisor and trusted their rating here. I am glad to say that they went way beyond our expectations. Very professionally run organisation which took care of everything (pickup, rafting, lunch, drop) at an excellent price. They took us to their camp (very well maintained) in nemo for a quick briefing given by Dave the camp manager and then they sent us on our way to the starting point.We did the Chilling to Nemo stretch which is around 28 km long, takes around 3 hours and has some excellent rapids. It takes around 1 to 1.5 hrs to get to the starting point in their van. The instructor we had (Manish) was really enthusiastic and explained everything to us properly. He would also brief us about the rapids that were coming up (fell in at one of the rapids and lost my specs too :O which was a rather fun experience). We thoroughly enjoyed his company on the raft (Wishing him luck for his Kayaking competition in Iceland). Also his favourite quote is,""What to do, Kathmandu"".Thanks for the awesome experience! Would highly recommend them if you are planning to raft in Leh.Also would recommend the Chilling to Nemo stretch, it is epic!"

Their knowledge of the local rivers is exceptional and they helped us organise a week long expedition to the Ganga, Bangarati, Alaknanda and Pindar rivers.  Wet N Wild have great local contacts and were able to organise cheap and reliable transport for us during our stay and for our return to Delhi airport.I was very impressed with the way they treated their clients, the quality of their rental equipment and the emphasis they place on safety.  They also have an office and trips run from Leh (Ladakh).  My experience in Rishikesh was so good that I'm already trying to fit in a trip to Ladakh within the next two years."

After that I also went to these guys to learn kayaking in the Ganga and it was really a great experience, they have really experienced instructor. Cheers Guys!!"
Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Rohit Varma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,An exceptional holiday to rermember!!!,"We had a week of river rafting and camping along the Alakhnanda/ Ganga river. That one week was just magical! The organisers were so meticulous that even the minutest of detail was precisely planned to ensure our comfort. At the outset, we were picked up from the airport and transported to the main camp site where well laid out, clean tents, sleeping bags and sumptuous food awaited us. After the safety briefing, we started off on our adventure the next day. The day time used to be in the rumbling waters, enjoying the roller coaster ride of our lives. By the time we finished, piping hot delicacies and camp fires awaited us. Overall, this is one experience that everyone must strive to have at least once in their life time. Kudos to the organising team for making this adventure what it is!!"

I work within the Rafting industry training & Assessing river guides.Wet N Wild are one of the only companies in Leh that strive to provide internationally recognized training & certification for there guides. In terms of safety this puts the team ahead of its competitors. The guide team at Wet N Wild all work 12 months of the year as river guides so they are true river professionals.The operating equipment at Wet N Wild is on par with any other operator in the western world. One of my favorite aspects of Wet N Wild is the beautiful basecamp and the amazing food that they provide. If I did  not work in the industry and I was going to choose a company to raft with in India it would be Wet N Wild.

I requested to witness rafting and kayaking in the Zanskar river near village Nimmu. They agreed on lunch & transportation cost, Saw the whole event & it was very adventurous &  nicely managed by expert team. To me me this was a nice chance to witness barren beauty of Ladakh, river Zanskar & a very adventurous event, Driving along river Indus & mainly along river Zanskar from their camp near Nimmu up to Chilling passing confluence of Indus  Zanskar was a amazing experience.At the age of 69 I could not show the courage to participate but whole trip was worth.This adventure sport is very popular among youths ."

Its awesome experience and you will not regret. I think there are two operators  and both are equally qualified and good. You may arrange prior booking with your tour operator or hotel to avoid rush. The guides were qualified and from Rishikesh and all safety gears are available. There are 2 stages to opt. One with multiple rapids whereas the other one includes calmer waters. The water was freezingly chill but we got used to after a while.  Remember to take an extra set of underwears :-)"

A real adventure..!!,"I have done rafting a few times before at different places, but the experience is so different. The team is very helpful & enthusiastic. Just before i entered the raft i was very exited n told a friend that my raft has never capsized so far n things like this are very rare. And finally in this trip i experienced that too in a long grade 3+ rapid. The best thing was the speedy rescue by the safety kayakers. All the 9 members on board were rescued n put back in the raft within minutes. Special thanks to Dinesh the safety kayaker who rescued two of us together. It was commendable. They have a very good safety setup thats essential for adventure activities."

I feel LE is very safest to female travellers/Solo travellers."
Landscape_Explorer,Somdeb BD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2020 • Friends,Excellent,We booked our Leh-Ladakh itinerary for July 2020 and paid our advance very early. During the booking process Sonam ji tried to adjust to all our requests without increasing total price. But unfortunately when we were to travel pandemic along with tensions with China started and we had to cancel our trip. Sonam ji instead of all his losses that he suffered understood the situation and refunded our entire advance amount. He is a true gentleman and we hope to meet him soon when we again book our ladakh trip through him.

I was travelling alone and sometimes, when one travels alone, excursions can be very expensive, but Sonam managed to organise a car with other fellow travellers to Pangong Lake and I had a great time! Landscape Explorer's assistance continued then in Leh and, thanks to Sonam and his team's kind help, Ladakh is one of the best memories I have of India!"

Landscape_Explorer,Istanbulkay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,TRIP OF A LIFETIME,I contacted many tour operators and settled with using Sonam at Landscape Explorer because I felt he listened to exactly what I wanted and not what suited the standard tour routes. I loved working out the design of our tour with him and the journey did not disappoint. The only sadness was missing Pangong lake because of an avalanche on our way there. Sonam immediately organized a raft experience which we totally loved. Zanskar was amazing and Sonam has his family there so knows the area well. I had spent years dreaming of being in this place in the mountains and he helped make that a reality. I would highly recommend using his company. And if you find the blue poppy in the mountains on the Penzila pass post a picture of them here to remind me of their exquisite wild beauty.

Jigi is a great guide with extensive knowledge of the terrain and a budding Budhist philosopher who always grounded me when I would be flagging after the long hikes.Namgial who runs this establishment is soft spoken yet organised and made our whole experience seamless by accommodating certain last minute changes which happened due to changed personal circumstances.

Whether booking excursions to monasteries or planning lengthy treks, details are handled flawlessly and always with politeness. Things change quickly in Ladakh--perhaps His Holiness the Dalai Lama is in town, or maybe there has been a landslide across the middle of your trekking route. Namgial and his team make sure that you can change your plans as needed. The trekking guides are very knowledgable and if you trek your every need will be taken care of.

Yama_Adventures,santi w,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Yama adventure is the best way to travel around…!!,"Three years ago I’ve been to Ladakh. This trip was my second time travelling to Ladakh with friends. We choose Yama Adventure again as our organizer since we were happy with their arrangement and services.Namgial, the owner of Yama Adventure, is a professional and very well organised. He looks after his clients very well. During our stay in Leh, He visited to our hotel every morning just to say hi or discussed about the tour and the trekking needs. He would accommodate our concern for the trekking, discuss it with us and make alteration for the itinerary if it’s necessaryOn my first trip to Ladakh I have done overland trip from Srinagar to Leh and I really enjoy it. So in this trip I want to try Markha Valley trek. It will take 6 days and 5 nights. I am so excited!! Before we start our trekking, it is necessary for me to get use to with the altitude so I did sightseeing around Leh and visited to some places like Lamayuru, Nubra Valley and Pangong Tso.Jigmet, our guide, on this trip is a very friendly guide. We had him as our guide from our previous trip. His abilities as a guide have met our expectation. So we’re happy that we were able to meet again in this trip. When we were in Lamayuru, we had the opportunity to meet Jigmet’s family. He introduce us his famiy who are very welcome. We’re so lucky be able to meet his family and taste their local drinks. It’s nice that we’re able to meet his family and see how they live. It’s warm our heart. Jigmet knowledge of the local attraction is excellent. He is also very patient with us during our trekking. As a group leader he is able to read the situation very well. He would discuss any problems that arise during our trekking. We also blessed that we got a very good crew member. During our trekking we had 3 cooks and 2 horsemen who took care of 12 horses. Those horses are the one that carry all our food and equipment. Ram, Rafi and Laksamana are amazing cook. They always surprise us with the food they gave us. Sometimes I feel guilty to eat what they had prepared for us because the food presentation was very pretty. Not just pretty but they are also very tasty. What surprise us the most was on the last day of our trip they can provide us a CAKE!! I don’t know how they made it with their limited cooking facilities at the camp site. Every day during our trekking trip, Laksamana would wait for us at certain point patiently.One of the memorable moments for me is on the 4th day when we were so late to get to our camp site. We’re already so tired from the walking and we just wanted to stop and tried to catch our breath. From where we stood we could see our camp for the night. It might be only about 10 or 15 min walk to the camp. Unexpectedly, I could see someone running towards us with the smile in his face. Apparently It was Ram. He brought us pineapple juice. I was so happy to see him and I think that the best pineapple juice that I’ve ever had. I could not say thank you enough to Ram! Whenever we reached our camp site, there always plenty of snacks and warm drink were ready to welcome us. The crew member always tried to give us what we need and make us comfortable during the trip. When we were in Nimaling, the place was windy and cold. So we were worried that we might not be able to sleep because it was too cold for us. However, they made something to warm our sleeping bag. They made a hot water then put the hot water in the rubber hot water bag. That rubber hot water beg helped us through the night. We could sleep comfortably. I love all the small things that they have gave us. I would say thank you to Yamatreks, Jigmet, Ram, Rafi and Laksamana. You are very helpful during our trip to Markha Valley. Again, you have made our trip one of the most memorable. "

It’s was the best ‘stumble’!  We (6 of us) arrived on May 21st from Kuala Lumpur and enjoyed a 3day acclimatisation which is crucial as you fly in at 3500m. Every care was taken by YA from the word GO! Trekking started on the 4th day after hotel breakfast and therein our adventure truly began. Together with our entourage of ponies, donkeys and crew, we embarked for 7 days on the most scenic, breathtaking and unforgettable trek any of us had ever seen.The Markha Valley is by no means an easy trek, but the dedication, friendliness, patience and smiles of the crew and our beloved guide Jigmat, helped ease our journey. Not to mention an array of food served piping hot at every mealtime become a routine of some sorts, with us looking forward to after a hard long day of trekking.

RInchen Namgial, the Owner, (namgial@gmail.com  Cell: 00919419178763) is spectacular, reliable and a very nice man. One of the main ways I decide on a tour or guide is whether they get back to me with my questions via email. I am a solo (woman) traveler so honesty and reliability are my top priority!Namgial has a great reputation and he has definitely earned it. He is honest and was “on the minute” on time at every turn. He was waiting for me with one of his drivers at the airport when I arrived, so I felt immediately comfortable.I had the same driver and guide for the entire 6 days. The driver was very experienced and I felt safe.   The tour guide was packed with local information and really loves Leh, where he lives. There was nothing I asked that he couldn’t answer! I highly recommend Yama Adventures without a doubt. I had a wonderful time. You will not regret traveling with this company.I would like to add that the internet is only “so-so” reliable in Leh and surroundings, especially in the mountains so it can take a few days to get through and for them to get back. They are working on a better server system in Leh."

I contacted any months before with Namgial from Yama Adventure. Every time I had correct answer and he organised a perfect trekking tour with our local guide Naounang. The homestay in Rumbak was very nic, a new one at a family with 2 kids. We had good diner, home made vegetarian momos, and breakfest. The second night we sleeped in a basiccamp. The guide was also for us our sherpa."
Yama_Adventures,travellust13,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Business,Excellent Operator,"I worked with Yama Adventure years ago when arranging a trek, homestays, and other activities in Ladakh for a gap-year semester program in India. Namgial is kind, attentive, extremely knowledgable, and safety conscious. He was able to arrange a trek that suited the needs of the group and had a manageable amount of challenge that everyone could take on. He has decades of experience and knowledge of the area and I would highly recommend trekking with his company!"

It was quite daunting choosing a tour agent amongst the many on offer in Ladakh but I would highly recommend Yama to anyone. To begin with, Namgial, the owner, was wonderful. He has so much experience with a range of Westerners -from the beginning trekker like myself to the more experienced one like my friend. We enjoyed our trek with him so much, we also booked two day trips to monasteries. Everything went perfectly-he listened carefully to what we were looking for and provided three magical and unforgettable events with us. Thank you, Namgial and Yama Adventures. I will certainly choose you again on my next visit to Ladakh."

Not only that, they really focus on safety and making sure that treks are well planned and that the guests are comfortable at all times.  The region is spectacular and rich with culture and I don't know why more people don't visit the Indian side of the Himalayas more.  Miss you guys!"

Yama_Adventures,Jesbir h,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,What a trip!!!,"I found these people to be very professional even before we arrived in India. Whatever questions our group had, the answers came back swiftly and always positively. We certainly had high hopes for our trip. We were not disappointed!!From the start the professionalism shone through. All our needs were taken care of, even the special requirements of some of our group.The guides and porters were friendly, happy and always smiling. The food prepared daily was a feast despite the limited cooking amenities.The tour guides helped everyone and daily consultations prepared us for each day's travel. Unfortunately some of our group suffered from AMS so we couldn't reach our final goal but the guide gave us another option and that was good too.I can't say enough regarding the overall enjoyment that we had on the trip and largely due to the great and friendly people who looked after us superbly well. Thank you. I would recommend Yama Adventures to everyone!"
Yama_Adventures,Yeniwati T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Adventure of a lifetime,"This is my second time with Yama Adventures, first time was on 2015. This time we spent 13 days exploring Ladhak ( 5 days sightseeing, 6 days trekking to Markha Valley and 2 day of resting). All the trips was very well organized, great service and full of warmth. Starting from preparation about 8 months ago, Namgial (the owner) always very responsive and will explained all of our question, He was always accommodating what our group requested. Specially during our 6 days trekking to Markha Valley, we (6 person) felt very comfortable and happy. The service (equipment, crew, guide, foods) was very satisfying. The Crew was taking good care of us. As most of us is quite new on trekking, the guide is patiently lead us to complete the trek and continuously encouraged us with his motivational words. The foods provided during trekking was SUPER GOOD, it's beyond our expectation. They made pizza, beautiful salad, tasty soup, momo, fried chicken, and delicious cake, etc. In between there was cookies or fruit with our favorite Ginder+Lemon+Honey tea. We are also surprised on the last night, they provided a bag of hot water that we can hug so we will felt warmth during the night as it was very cold, even though we already have sleeping bag and fleece. The scenery was amazingly beautiful. We enjoyed every single moment and it was a truly memorable journey to us. Our guide (Jigmet) was very experienced and good, he is the best. So if you want to experience the best of Ladhak, make sure you contact Yama Adventures."
Yama_Adventures,Asha T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,A very memorable trip!,"We made a trip to Leh in May 2018, planned with Yama adventures. Right from the beginning, they were very responsive to our questions and queries.  Our itinerary was planned based on our interests and we had a very enjoyable time at Leh, Nubra valley and a day at the breathtaking Pangong Tso. Mr. Namgial's (Yama Adventures' owner) personal attention and congeniality was outstanding.  All their arrangements were excellent - our accommodation and drivers. Angmo, our young guide at Leh was very knowledgable and friendly that it was a pleasure spending the day with her.Not only were they checking on us each day, Namgial was very open and flexible to changing our prefixed itinerary due to  health issues and suggested enjoyable alternatives. This heartwarming sincerity from Yama travels is what takes the cake and we highly recommend them!"

He is a a great manager of the Team, he knows the route very well, and is an open & honest person, whom we fully trusted.We trekked through small villages, saw beautiful landscapes of varying colors and formations. The food was tasty and plentiful, and we were impressed with the variety despite the basic cooking facilities at the camp sites. We highly recommend Yama Adventures, and the Markha Valley Trek!!Namgial also made arrangements for us to visit Agra & the Taj Mahal after the trek.Please know that internet service in Leh is limited, and at times not working.

Yama_Adventures,HuongNguyen233,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Our great Ladakh trip,"Yama Adventures helped to bring us an amazing trip in Ladakh with their dedication and thoughtful service. Namgial (the owner) has made us feel comfortable with his calmness, warmth and good solution (as he found out our next trip to Spiti Valley has a bit of unreasonable travel time) while Jigmet (the tour guide) is really dedicated and took care us well, especially when some of us got AMS. The driver is also really cute and kind, even though he doesn't speak much English but he also made us feel comfortable with his smiles and kind gestures. overall, I would recommend Yama Adventures if you want to have a trip in Ladakh. their service mind will add a big plus to your trip and make it as much pleasant as possible."
Yama_Adventures,Valerie G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Unforgettable Kala Patthar/Everest Base Camp trek,"I trekked as part of a small group on the Everest Base Camp route some years ago with Yama Adventures. Yama Adventures made this truly a once in a lifetime experience. From start to end the arrangements were handled smoothly, professionally, and with great consideration to the individual traveler’s needs. I was the lone female in this group, but always felt safe and included. The entire staff did an amazing job. The food was excellent and varied. Camping spots were well positioned and the equipment and porters were very good. The Buddhist monasteries and cultural features in the area are fascinating. A main highlight of the trip was hiking to the summit of Kala Patthar (18, 514 feet). The climb was well planned. We began hiking before dawn, reaching the summit in time for spectacular sunrise views of Mt. Everest and the surrounding peaks. Throughout the trek I was impressed by the attention given to each customer’s personal well-being. I would not hesitate booking future travels with Yama Adventures. The cost of the trek I took with Yama also was a very good value for the services provided compared to other companies I researched."

Previously we booked a trip to Pangong Lake with Yama Adventures with a journey that was as amazing as the colour of the lake itself and we were happy for Rinchen to organise our permits then and now.He is extremely knowledgable about the area and any trips that interest you and gives you those snippets of information about the culture that makes you want to return. And he just has that easy manner that makes you feel comfortable, especially when you're sitting in his coffee shop with him and smelling the great coffee and eating apricot cake.  We may decide on a future booking to Stok Kangri, and if we go we will go with Rinchen as we trust him completely and know we will have an enlightened and fabulous time.Ladakh is spectacular - verdant villages nestled amongst moonscape mountains. You will not regret going or using Yama Adventures."

Yama_Adventures,Pik Fong T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Enchanted Ladakh,"My friends and I (a group of 5) visited Ladakh last August for 8 days. We had an unforgettable trip in Ladakh. Ladakh is gorgeous... seduced us with its enchanting view, peaceful atmosphere, and the charm of friendly Ladakhis. We covered all the must-visit places in Ladakh, from Alchi, Likir, Thiksey Monasteries to the first, second, and third highest motor-able passes (Kardungla, Chang la, and Taglang la). From Nubra Valley, Pangong lake, and Tsomoriri lake. The views along the way to those destinations were awesome and breathtaking. We are so grateful to have Richen Namgial, the owner of Yama Adventures to have made this happen. There was an incredible amount of rigour and attention to detail in designing the itinerary. Namgial made sure that we could experience the best of Ladakh.However, the single, greatest thing about Namgial and Yama Adventures was the kindness they had. Namgial was attentive to all of our concerns, and was deeply concerned in ensuring we were happy and safe. Namgial was also sincere in trying to make us comfortable at the high altitudes. Additionally, our guide, Nigmet Jorgais Khema is nice and kind, and our chauffeur, Tsering Nurbo is a marvelous driver. In conclusion, Yama Adventures was truly committed in giving us the best possible experience during our trip. From the planning to execution, everything was perfect. I don’t think the trip could’ve been so great without the help of Yama Adventures. I strongly recommend Yama Adventures!"

Everything was really well planned and organized.  The first part of the trip to Pangong lake was the most fun, including the overnight in a luxurious tent by the lake. The guide for this part was awesome. Overall, there was a huge attention to detail by the owner Mr.Namgial and this made all the difference. Would love to go back one day and do a longer trek.

The Markha Valley was gorgeous, although I daresay a decent level of physical fitness is required for the trek, especially if not used to trekking at such high altitudes. The views of the valley and the surrounding mountain ranges were amazing, and the locals we met along the way were friendly and polite. Namigal and his crew were wonderful and took good care of us during the trek, making sure that we were safe, well rested and well fed. This comes highly recommended!"
Yama_Adventures,jennacjohnson,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Trekking and Culture Trip Perfectly Curated,"My husband and I had 9 days to spend in Ladakh and wanted to the make the most of trekking time. Namgial recommended the 6-day Markah Valley trek, which we found astoundingly beautiful with the right amount of physical challenge. Our guide, Nawang, and support folks, Bim, Stanzin, and Jigmet, were experienced and made our trip both special and totally stress-free. Namgial was responsive, despite difficulties inherent in being located in Leh (internet/phone connection). When my husband became ill (with a run-of-the-mill flu), Namgial arranged a physicians visit and worked with us to adapt our trekking schedule to make the most of our time.  I would definitely recommend Yama to anyone interested in a Himalayan getaway."

I was fianlly able to realize this dream this summer.  Rinchen Namgial and Yama Adventures helped me plan the perfect trip for myself and two friends.  We were able to find the right mix of treking, Buddhist culture, village life and norhtern India because of Rinchen Namgial breadth of knowledge and experience.  After we arrived, we needed to make adjustments in the itinerary and Namgial was fantastic about finding flexibility where we needed it and ensuring we still met our travel goals.  We were especially lucky to have jigmet as our fantastic guide to Buddhism in Ladakh as well as village life and traditional Ladakhi culture.  He was a fantastic and patient guide.  I cannot recommend Yama Adventures highly enough."

Yama_Adventures,Ravi S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Beyond Comparison,"We (group of 9 members) covered Ladakh from Srinagar on a 11 day trip.  Namgial coordinated our itinerary.  We enjoyed every interaction with Namgial.  The itinerary was extremely well designed, reasonably priced and choice of hotels suggested were awesome.  We had to change the itinerary and hotels in between as one of our member was unwell and had to be admitted in Leh hospital.  Namgial coordinated all the changes, ensured that hospitalisation is taken care of, he organised food for hospital visitors, stayed back and regularly interacted with hospital staff and did everything to make our stay memorable.  I cannot imagine a tour coordinator going over board to this extent.  He didn't charge us for any of these changes.  Gem of a man.  He would visit us everyday in Leh to enquire our plans and suggested multiple options to suit our need.His niece Anu (Mingur Angmo) guided us during our local Leh tour.  She was amazingly good.  Well educated, passionate, friendly and patient.  She assisted us in local shopping as well.I would recommend Namgial anytime, and look forward to take his services for other tours where possible."
Yama_Adventures,Bridget K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Couples,3 day trek: Spitok to Stok,"We had a very nice trek with Yama Adventures. Because we only had a few days in Leh, we needed to do a shorter trek and Yama Adventures had just the right one for us. Namgial arranged everything for us and came to our hotel the night before we left to go over everything in person. Our driver picked us up from the hotel and we hiked along the road for the first day. We started off with our guide, Nawong, kinda in the middle of nowhere, then went up into the valley toward Stok mtn. He made sure we were going at a comfortable pace and pointed out animals or interesting features of the landscape. Our first night was spent in Jing Chan at a home stay. We were informed that it was going to be basic accommodations, and that is exactly right. There were mats on the floor to sleep on and the food was very, very simple. (This is the main reason for the 4 stars. I had thought that the food would be a little more varied and might have supplemented had I really known the limits of the home stays)The second day was the shortest and we hiked 3-4 hours to Rumbak. We could have done a little extra walking to Yurutse, but decided not to since we wanted to conserve our energy for the last and most arduous day. The homestay at Rumbak was quite nice and there was more space to spread out. The food was nicer here and our room had thicker mats to sleep on. The third day was tough! We climbed up to 16,000ft and made it over the pass. It was a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains and we saw a lot of animals on this day. Nawong was so helpful and even carried my small pack for a bit since I was really tired at the end of the day. We walked a total of 10 miles and were so glad to have finished the trek. We ought to have stopped a bit sooner to have lunch, but its customary to eat the mid day meal around 2pm - which is about when we ate, but I should have asked to eat earlier since we had eaten breakfast at 7:30am. Our driver was waiting for us in Stok and took us directly back to our hotel."
Yama_Adventures,kjohn493,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Best company for travel in the Himalayas!,"Namgial runs one of the best travel companies for locations in the greater Himalayas.  He is kind, knowledgable, and able to make anything possible!  I have used Yama Adventures multiple times for trips in Ladakh and each experience has been a true pleasure.  Whether trekking, visiting villages, or seeing the sites, we were provided above and beyond with everything we needed.  We had great cultural information and felt safe, particularly with the great drivers that kept us safe on the mountain roads.  10/10 would recommend for any travel in the Himalayas!"
Yama_Adventures,claudia.winata,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Yama Adventures is the perfect reflection of Ladakhi hospitality!,"Just got back from an exciting 11 days adventure through out Kashmir and Ladakh. We (2 adults & 2 kids under 12) made the right decision by choosing Yama Adventures to handle this trip. Namgial, the owner, has shown us sincerity and kindness as true as Ladakhi hospitality. He took care of everything from our houseboat in Srinagar, transportation, accommodation, meals, helped us in changing our itinerary in the last minutes (since we were too tired to go to Tso Moriri as planned, we cancelled it and go for Leh city tour instead), changing our flight (we decided not to go back to Srinagar to fly to Delhi but took new flight from Leh to Delhi) and even visited us almost every night just to make sure that we are as comfort as can be.And all of that without charging us any extra fee! He treat us like a family and prepare everything to ensure we could experienced the best Ladakh trip ever. You'll be in the right hand with their experiences and expertise in arranging any trip in Kashmir and Ladakh. Thanks again Namgial, keep up the good work!Tips : if you are foreigner that doesn't really fancy Indian food, please be prepare and bring your own instant food, since you will be exploring villages and isolated places where there are not any international food available but simple Indian vegetarian dishes. And also bring enough jacket. Even in the heat of the summer, some places in Ladakh are as cold as winter with snow & rain."
Yama_Adventures,E-Hern,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,You must choose this tour company if you're in Ladakh!!,"Right from the onset, Yama Adventures more than exceeded my expectations. While I was planning our trip from home, the owner, Namgial, was very helpful and responsive via email and helped me to plan all aspects of my trip. He even helped to book out air tickets from Delhi. We had time only for a short trip to Ladakh and due to permit issues, we could not visit Nubra or Panggong. However, Namgial and guide Jigmet offered many alternatives which still made our trip very memorable. We were taken river rafting and also to various off-the-beaten path areas. Jigmet and driver  Stanzin were both very professional, knowledgeable and caring about our safety and health. The accommodation which were recommended were also great. What I really liked was that our itinerary was super flexible - we could decide what we wanted to do on the very day itself, which is a perfect fit for my travelling style. Highly recommended!!"
Yama_Adventures,pacharapun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,Beyond expectation.,"Namgial, the owner, was great and went beyond our expectations by flying to Delhi to respond to queries as Leh's internet connection problem persisted throughout winter. He modified the itinerary until it all fits our requirements and we had so much fun and great experiences from what he offered. All the accommodations that he contacted for us are really good especially Mahabhodi Choglamsar. Our tour guide, Jigmet, was also exceptional. He got all our requests during the journey fulfilled. He cared so much about how we felt and what we wanted to do in each place we went, the surroundings, the accommodation and the food. His knowledge on landscape, cultures and religions were eye-opening. He cooperated well with our driver, Mayo, who's so great with directions and super careful about our safety. ps Yama Cafe serves the best coffee in Ladakh!!! Please go try."

Namgial designed a tour based on our needs. Everything went very smoothly from the minute we landed in Leh. The sights and experience was magnificent. Our guide's Jigmet knowledge on the culture and Buddhism enhanced our overall experience. Namgial also helped to arrange for our tour to Agra. The company is very dedicated in ensuring we were always well taken care of. The price was reasonable and we'd highly recommend Yama Adventures!

Yama_Adventures,vagabonding_on_holid,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,A Truly Wonderful Experience - Markha Trek,"I signed up for a solo trek with Yama after reading their great reviews on here. Ladakh was magnificent, and Yama's staff are quintessentially Ladakhi. In other words, incredibly kind, and generous. The option I chose was the 10 day trek in the Markha Valley, and Yama delivered everything they promised at a great price. My guide, Georgi also imparted his significant knowledgeable on Buddhism which added to the experience. As I expected, the facilities were basic. There is no plumbing or cell service and very limited electricity in the Markha Valley. This trek is best for those with high-altitude trekking experience, are in decent shape, and want to experience peaceful, grounding bliss. Lastly, Yama also owns a cafe, Yama Cafe? that was one of my favorite casual hangouts in Leh."

And his prices are very reasonable.  Yama is clearly the leader in travel in Ladakh.We highly recommend Yama Adventures to everybody."
Yama_Adventures,Mahesh M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-16,we visited Leh Ladakh at the pick season But it is very Dry and Sunny weather there during entire my 12 days ...,"We were at Leh Ladakh in July-August 2016 via Manali, it takes 24 or more hours to reach Leh from Manali by RoadThere is no any proper Road way to Leh is broken on every 25 kms. This may be due to Land Slidings in Winter and during Raining. There are Two major passes are on the way Rohtang and Thanglangla Pass 13,000 and 16000 ft. Hard to stand there / on this height more than 20-30 minutes is injurious to health who are exploring the height first time.Reaching Leh not so exciting as we used to feel when reach to other hill station. It is almost dry there. very low rain in the area and unpredictable weather there, It is 14000ft Height. Nubra Valley, Monestories, Pangong Lake are main attractions and far from Leh. Pongong Lake is descent place to visit."

Mr Namgial is very polite, accommodating and thoughtful person himself. and so was the guide he provided. It was first india visit for both of my friends and he made the journey extremely comfortable and as luxurious and budget conscious as possible. every hotel we stayed in every sight seeing places were a pleasant stay. The guide Tashi and driver Sonam Dorje were absolutely fun to be with as well. Guide helped us understand and appreciate the cultural orientation of the land in a much more lucid and thorough manner while the driver handled the breathtaking mountain road curves very skillfully while being absolutely cautious and making long drives comfortable . we became really good friend through the trip.I would highly recommend YAMA Adventures to anyone taking the  trip to Ladakh.

Food was excellent (thanks for a Nepalese cook always cheerful and his assistant also from Nepal). The boss of Yama Advetures, Namgyal is a kind and highly collaborative fellow. Our guide, Jigmet, was very knowledgeable of the area, very helpful,  and provided lots of interesting remarks on Buddhism and the like.We highly recommend Yama Adventures to everybody!

We felt so cared for the whole trip (and before). Namgial was wonderful to work with and helped us out in many ways. Jigmet was an exceptional guide and helped us meet the local people and understand the culture. He had so much knowledge of Buddhist religion and culture and shared his understanding. The rest of our staff was excellent and well organized. We had delicious meals which included many fresh fruits and vegetables. We are very glad we chose to work with this company.
Yama_Adventures,Oycejay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Trekking with great aloo!,"My sister and I went on an 11 day a camping trek through the Markha Valley and above with Yama Adventures.  What a great group to go with! Rinchen Namgial (the owner) was amazing--he took care of every detail and he even had fresh vegetables delivered to us in Chilling (about 4 days into the trip)!  Our guide Jignet was incredible and very knowledgable about Buddhism.  He made it possible for us to connect with the people living nearby, including showing us how to make yak/goat butter in the Nimling Valley.  If you want to go for a shorter trek, you could do homestays, but I would still advise going with Yama and a guide so that you could communicate with the people you are staying with.  Because we were going in areas where there were no homestays available, we traveled with a guide, great cooks, a pony man and his horses.  While it seemed a bit much for just the two of us, it wasn't too expensive and we had a great time, with all of us playing cards in the evenings.  We saw great monasteries before and during the trek.  The food was amazing--with incredible curries--how the cooks managed to make piazza and bake a cook on a propane burner is beyond me!  You couldn't go with a better, friendlier group than Yama Adventures!"
Yama_Adventures,John F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Solo,Yama offers excellent package flexibility,"It was a pleasure negotiating two packages with Namgial of Yama to suit my stay period  in the Ladakh region, an enchanting part of the Indian Himalaya. His team on the trail Lobsang and Ram are excellent, every detail is covered including the early morning pick up for my last morning in Leh. If you're looking at this beautiful region for short trek or long trek, it's great to deal with a local company to put your mind at ease among the myriad of tour operators."
Yama_Adventures,zanyzoie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Solo,A remarkable experience!,"I have chosen Yama Adventures based on reviews here. I couldn't agree more to all the positive things about Rinchen and his service. My Markha Valley trek was organized by Yama and I didn't expect to enjoy every single moment of it. I wanted to do camping and Richen made that possible without having to use horses or donkeys. Instead, I had 2 local guides with me: Rigzen and Tundup. Both were incredibly kind, supportive, informational and hilarious. As a solo traveler, Rinchen suggested few options of how I can see and enjoy the best of Ladakh. I trusted him and didn't have any doubt that he'll provide me with an exceptional service. I also did a 6 day sightseeing tour with Yama covering the famous lakes, Nubra Valley and a little detour to see and experi ence another small but thriving village. Oh, it was as if I was dreaming. There's no words to describe how magical Ladakh is. Look no more. You'll be guaranteed an exceptional and honest service from a true born Ladakhi. Best regards!"
Yama_Adventures,Travelling_Louise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Don't trek with anyone else,"We had an excellent  trekking experience with Yama Adventures who were super organized and professional. They took care of every detail. One of our party changed his mind and decided to do the Markha valley trek after all after Rinchen organized a riding horse and equipment that he needed such as a sleeping bag. Our cook, Ram, was excellent and served an entirely different and delicious meal every night. The staff on the trek could not have been more accommodating, making sure that we were always comfortable.  Extra sleeping bags were provided in case we were cold. Our guide, Lobsang, even loaned us money on the trek when we ran out.  We also enjoyed our discussions with Lakhbar, a shirpa,  who spoke remarkably good English and who had met Sir Edmund Hillary. The trek itself was tough but we always felt safe and in good hands. Highly recommend this company."

Yama_Adventures,Stewart J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,Simply The Best,"You are in very good hands when you travel with Yama Adventures. The owner Namgial is a lovely, honest intelligent man who runs a very professional outfit. He clearly attracts good people. That means everyone including his staff, local horsemen, drivers, guesthouse operators et cetera are all really nice people. In November 2015, five of us from Australia did a Yama tour in the Darjeeling area of India and in Bhutan.  A great holiday. Over the years, my partner and I have travelled with other operators as well as by ourselves in South Asia.  We have now done four trips with Yama Adventures and have no doubt that it is by far the best.  Every component of their tour is excellent - the staff are professional, knowledgeable and helpful ,lots of delicious food including on trek; good equipment; comfortable vehicles; delightful guesthouses providing clean and comfortable lodgings; and prompt and reliable transfers to and from airports and train stations. Namgial often looks at ways of making improvements to your itinerary as you go along. If a problem arises such as bad weather or sickness that may interrupt your program, he or his staff will calmly find a solution or a good alternative.  Namgial is not at all pushy and is happy to give you ideas on how you can visit other parts of India by yourself. However, it is well worth asking him if he can arrange it for you.  He knows things like how long you’ll need to see the point of interest, the best modes of transport and the connections needed.  He takes away the worry of booking the right domestic flights or express trains, and vehicle hire.  And his prices are very reasonable.  Whether you are brand-new or an old hand in India, give Yama Adventures a go.  You won’t be sorry.A tip - Namgial is based in Leh the capital of Ladakh, a high altitude area in the far north of India. If you haven’t been there, it’s a fantastic area for sightseeing, trekking and experiencing a remote Himalayan Buddhist culture and an extraordinary landscape."

Yama_Adventures,Michael M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,"Excellent organization, guide and team of our mountain trekking trip","We arranged for a Markhan valley trekking trip of 6 days/nights with Yama and set off after acclimatizing for 2 days in Leh. Our team was lead by guide Lobzang and further consisted of cook Bim, helpers Nubu and Jiggy and the horseman. This clearly was a great team.When it became clear during the first day that Markhan valley was not possible (people returning reported the river was impassable because flooded) our capable and experienced guide Lobzang offered a good alternative parallel route.When one of our team got altitude sickness during the trip and required a descent in the night, our guide Lobzang and one of the helpers helped her and husband down the mountain and to safety.Overall the trip was organized perfectly and challenges found on the way were met with creativity towards good alternative solutions. The crew and team were great people to be around, capable and very professional.Even in the middle of nowhere in the mountains the food provided and prepared for breakfast, lunch and dinner was of excellent quality and taste. We were surprised every day with great and creative food. Wonderful and almost surreal.The horses that carried the tents and most of the luggage were in good health and clearly taken good care off. The horseman set the horses free each night and has the incredible task of collecting them again from the mountain meadows each very early morning. But this guy was a professional that clearly loved his job and the horses he worked with. All in all the trip and team exceeded expectations by far. It's the best organized event that I have witnessed so far in India."

Yama_Adventures,jody-ji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Business,3 years happily using Leh's premier guiding service,"After three summers working with Namgial and the Yama team, I give them my highest recommendation—six stars out of five! I bring small groups of Americans to Ladakh each summer to tour Gompas, trek, and enjoy the beauties and wonders of this very special land. Namgial has found beautiful and comfortable guesthouses for us to stay. His staff, from guides to cooks to drivers, is professional, courteous, and knowledgable. In three years, I have not had a single complaint. The food is delicious, the accommodations comfortable, and the trekking perfectly designed for the groups. This year we needed to change our itinerary repeatedly due to weather related circumstances, and Namgial was swift and responsive in helping me to design and redesign our itinerary. He has also helped friends and students I know to design personalized trips for solo travelers. Yama is clearly the leader in travel in Ladakh, and you will not be disappointed."
Yama_Adventures,Matthias_Silke,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Couples,"Reliable, friendly and competent - Yama Adventures is a great tour organizer","We organized our combined two-week tailor-made sightseeing (Indus Valley Monasteries with stays in Alchi and Temisgam) and trekking tour (Markha Valley from Zingchen to Chang Sumdo) with Yama Adventures from back-home in Europe. Namgial, the competent and helpful owner of Yama gave us with his emails a good feeling that all would be ready once we reached Leh - and it was indeed so. Some changes had to be made to the schedule due to our health (adapting to altitude) and the weather, but that was no problem at all. On the tour, our guide Stanzin was an extremely warm, friendly  and resourceful company, both when organizing homestays, introducing local customs, visiting monasteries and on the trek. Our whole group (the excellent Nepali cook Bim, who surprised us with his dishes out of his tent kitchen and his son plus the Tibetean horseman) were fun to travel with.We would surely chose again Yama when travelling in Ladakh."

Yama_Adventures,RonnWen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Couples,Fantastic Trip with Yama Adventures,"We visited beautiful, breathtaking Ladakh for 10 days in June 2015 with Yama Adventures…….from our home town, Melbourne,  Australia at sea level. As retirees we were concerned about the altitude but had a sense of anticipation and adventure. Yama organised a road trip itinerary covering most of Ladakh, totally organised with great care for our welfare at altitude. Ladakh is one of the most beautiful places we have seen. Our driver Naawang  and Guide  Jigmet were so friendly, knowledgable and helpful and we found there was flexibility in our itinerary each day, they even took us to 6am prayers at a monastery.  Namgial kept making sure all was well. Don't go to Ladakh expecting the Taj and 5 star. Part of the beauty is it is unspoilt. Our hotels, food and all Namgial organised were excellent. We will travel with him again. And don't forget the Yama Coffee Shop. Our home town is the coffee capital of the world, Yama's coffee rates among the best we have had, and the cake is a perfect way to end every day."
Yama_Adventures,sublimetime,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Extensive trekking expertise,"Completed two separate treks with Yama Adventures and both were seamlessly organized and perfectly executed. In an area of India where road closures, landslides, bad weather, and trail closures are common having the Yama Adventures staff coordinate and suggest alternatives was a godsend. On the trail the guides were knowledgeable and thoughtful. They looked after everyone in the group. The cooks were amazing and spoiled us with endless dishes and hot Chai at every turn. Yama Adventures is an excellent guide company. Without hesitation we would use them again. "
Yama_Adventures,Dina S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Nice experience.,"I contacted Mr Namgial about a 3-day tour in ladakh. Once we arrived, he checked on us, wether we need anything to adjust for the altitude, which was nice of him to do, the guesthouse he booked us in was beautiful, I only have a negative comment about the prepared plan. For the first day we had to stay at the guesthouse to adjust to the altitude, which was okay for us, the next day we went to Thiksey, Hemis and shey monastries, they were beautiful, however the guide didn't know much about the practice, she just knew some facts and a general idea about buddhism, which left us a little confused. For the third day, pangong lake was planned we spent 6 hours going to the lake only to sit there for an hour and a half and head back to Leh for another 6 hours! So we spent 12 hours on the road, wasting half of the day when we could have been doing something useful! If it was planned on the second day, maybe stay there for a night then head to the monasteries for the third day, that would have been much better! But all in all, Mr Namgial is a good man, when we talked to him about this plan, he listened. So yeah."
Yama_Adventures,LondonTimetraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Friends,Excellent Service,"I travelled extensively with Yama Adventures in Ladakh, India (Sikkim, Darjeeling, Dharamsala, etc) and Nepal and always had a fabulous time. Trips and treks were well-planned, costs were very reasonable and the company was always convival, helpful and friendly. We saw some amazing sights and I learnt so much about local people. I would highly recommend them, especially Namgial who is an excellent tour guide, extremely reliable and honest, personable and knowledgeable."
Yama_Adventures,Kate-Adie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Relaxed and flexible people to travel with,"One thing I learned on this trip is that I am not a trekker. But I think Yama's boss Namgial sensed this way before my own revelation! It's not easy doing business in Leh. The internet goes down all the time. Roads close, flights are cancelled, clients get altitude sickness. All this happened to us and through it all, Namgial remained calm, patient and helpful. He sent my friend to the hospital for oxygen when we were being terribly British about making a thing about the altitude sickness. Our trek was pushed back without complaint because we were feeling ropey (definitely worth leaving a buffer around your trek in case it happens to you). Every driver spoke English and I was impressed when one pulled over during fog on the notorious Zojila Pass to let it clear (nice one, Prem). Our trekking guide Jigmet was fun, smart and as patient as his boss. He invited us for lunch at his family house and having butter tea churned by his mum was a highlight of the trip.We were on the Sham trek, a more easy route a couple of hours to the east of Leh that takes you through barren, hot mountains into cool, green oasis of villages. You reach passes marked by prayer flags before walking down into barley fields and apricot groves marked out by poplars.We stayed in homestays, but if you don't fancy carrying your gear, another option is to base yourself at Namra Hotel in Temisgam and do day walks. When you get to Leh, you're faced with row after row of tour operators. My tip? It's much more relaxing to let Namigal sort it all out for you before you arrive."

Despite of these challenges, we are grateful that this trip becomes our lifetime adventures that we will remember always and glad that we have chosen the right travel agent.  Overall the whole science is very beautiful and the peoples we meet all is very kind and warmth. Another compliment is for Yama Cofffee Shop owned Yamatrek serve the best coffee in town and for delicious food they have. Our group felt very happy when we able to eat these delicious food like tom youm, pad thai, pizza, pasta, thai green curry and their fresh mango juice. For sure I recommended Yamatrek for arranging your amazing trip to explore Ladakh. And don't forget to visit Yama Coffee Shop if you are in Leh."
Voygr_Expeditions,Ian Cartwright,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec-22,"Snow leopards, Hemis National Park, Ladakh. Simply thunderstruck!","My trip with Voygr was outstanding and enlightening in so many ways; spiritually, physically, and emotionally. I remarked to Rigzin, a truly remarkable guide who quickly became a real friend, that I felt overwhelmed (in a most enlightened way) by the various aspects of Ladakhi life, including attending payer ceremonies at Buddhist monasteries, to which I was introduced. Being among centuries of tradition, customs, and history will induce you to contemplate those deep, soul-searching questions about your role in the universe.I should note here that whereas Ladakh is part of India geopolitically, it is wholly unlike how we typically know India, and I love India having travelled to many parts in search of wildlife. Ladakh is quintessentially Himalayan (it was once its own autonomous kingdom) with cultures and traditions closer to Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan.While the opportunity to witness snow leopards was the “hook” for me, and I was rewarded with some incredible sightings, this was only part of the “big picture” of experiencing the physical beauty, remoteness, and spiritual significance of Ladakh and Hemis National Park. Indeed, I suggest you cannot appreciate the snow leopard without experiencing and understanding the environment they share with us. With the uncertainty of sightings, having this wider understanding reinforces just how truly special sightings are. To this end, the leopard spotters are truly world class: I thoroughly enjoyed and felt privileged to be in their company.None of these would have been possible without the outstanding and world class organization and hospitality of Bezhad, Rashid, and the amazing Voygr “family”. I emphasize family because that was how Voygr made me feel. Voygr welcomed me into their “family” and went out of their way to ensure my visit was exceptional. Lungmar Remote Camp in the breathtaking Hemis Nation Park is very comfortable, full-service accommodation. I am a budget conscious traveler and while my trip was not inexpensive, the quality and value greatly exceeded my expectations. The camp staff were great hosts and excellent cooks!Flexibility was built in and we consulted every day on opportunities for upcoming day(s). Flexibility meant I was able to visit Rigzin’s village and experience the Losar (Ladahki New Year) festivities which was a unique once in a lifetime experience. Indeed, Voygr gave me the opportunity to meet and share time with several local families and these people touched my soul. These are truly amazing people.I originally booked a snow leopard tour with Natural Habitat Adventures (NatHab) having participated in a successful polar bear tour last year. But after discovering and researching Voygr I switched because I believed Voygr could provide a more personal experience. It was somewhat a leap of faith but one which for which my instinct was acutely accurate. Voygr provided a personal and flexible program of impeccable quality.  Everything from original inquiry, custom itinerary planning and booking, through many ad-hoc communications to the in-territory logistics was super organized. I cannot emphasize enough how highly I recommend Voygr. Voygr simply must be the gold standard in this area."

I was not sure what to expect but what I experienced far exceeded it.  We were able to see 7 snow leopard sightings.  On top of  the beautiful scenery was the wonderful staff Voygr they tended to all of our needs.  I highly recommend going on a trip with Voygr Behzad and team understand service
Voygr_Expeditions,P M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Family,Expedition Exceeded expectations,"We visited Ladakh to see snow leopards with Behzad Larry and Voygr expeditions in March 2022. We saw 7 snow leopards, including a mating pair that we were able to observe for several hours. Behzad and his entire team are very passionate about their work. From exceptional (and warm) accommodations in below freezing temperatures to a wide variety of delicious food, we were very well taken care of. When we were watching snow leopards in the wild, meals would be brought to us, so that we would not lose any opportunity to see these magnificent animals. Behzad is also dedicated to conservation of rare wildlife. I hope there are more people like him, it would increase the chances that our children and grandchildren will get to experience the same magic that we did."

The team of spotters would leave at the crack of dawn to begin the work of spotting leopards. Sonam always had plan B if leopards decided to take a day off and did not want to be seen. Rashid worked behind the scenes to took care of every detail. I will plan future trips without hesitation."
Voygr_Expeditions,sjs248,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-22,Warm experience in Cold country,"We started out on this journey a little apprehensive,  as the optimal time to see the snow leopard is the COLD winter.  The type of COLD experienced in that part of the world is something that we had never sensed living in a tent.  But we were eager to get a glimpse of the illusive snow leopard in its habitat.  We spent a total of 13 days in Leh and Hemis.  The first two days were spent acclimatizing to the altitude after which we were transported to our ""luxury tents"" in the middle of the most beautiful setting amongst the mountains.  The outside temperature was as cold as expected.  But inside the tent it was warm and cozy.  The hot water showers, the beautiful carpets and the comfortable beds was something that we had not expected in a tented facility.  The food was another surprise, as they catered to all our dietary needs and more.  The food was plentiful, delicious and prepared with a lot of care.  We had three course meals even when we were away from camp waiting to spot a snow leopard.  They sent out beds for us to sit on or lie down on while we waited.   We were successful in sighting the snow leopard 6 times.  Our first sighting was a mating.  It was an absolute thrill and one that we will never forget.  The second was a kill.  We did not witness the kill but saw the leopard by the kill.  The next few were of the snow leopard stocking blue sheep.  The team that Behzad has put together is world class.  We went to see the snow leopard apprehensive of the COLD.  We returned, WARM from the experience not only because we saw the snow leopard but because of the kindest, friendliest and whole-hearted hospitality that we have ever experienced in all our travels.  It was better than a 5 star experience and one that we would like to experience again !!!."
Voygr_Expeditions,Nisha Mehta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar-22,Roughing it... with 5- course meals and incredibly hot showers ;),"We spent 10 days in Behzad's camp in Shang in a totally immersive Snow Leopard experience.From the day we arrived in Leh, Behzad and Sonam made us feel so cared for as we acclimatized to the altitude in Ladakh. After 3 days we arrived at the ""camp"" (if you can call it that - more like a 5-star property in the middle of the mountains). There are two phenomal suite-style ""tents"" (again, a loose definition) that we stayed in that each have their own bathrooms inside; this was so nice given the temperatures outside.From morning to evening, Rigzin (camp manager), and crew were SO attentive to all of our requests. We had 4 different types of egg orders each morning, 6 different tea and coffee orders, and each ask was met with so much kindness and care. We felt at home on this trip, which made leaving even more difficult. As far as Snow Leopards, we had 8 sightings. The first was a mating pair and for days afterwards we saw a single leopard in the mountains. As we sat out for days, Behzad's team brought us hot chai, biscuits, breakfast, lunch, and so much more to make us feel so comfortable. We even had beds to sleep on!Needless to say we cannot wait for our next trip with Voygr!"

Employing the best trackers in the field, alongside incredible Ladakhi hospitality, each days trekking for the Snow Leopard was an absolute thrill. Accommodations are without a doubt the best in the area for an expedition such as this - no comparison. Tents were incredibly warm and cozy, hot water for showers and food was delicious. Somehow in an extreme weather environment, Behzad has created an oasis of comfort. Staff is beyond helpful and everyone is completely dedicated to the experience of glimpsing the Snow Leopard. In the end, Voygr has the best spotters so they are best chance you have at spotting the Snow Leopard. Highly recommended!"
Voygr_Expeditions,jacobsg88,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 • Couples,Dream trip to see snow leopards!,"My wife and I had a dream trip up to Leh/Hemis National Park with Voyagr Expeditions and Behzad and were lucky enough to see several snow leopards! We even saw a mum and 2 cubs playing around in snow from a few hundred meters!Behzad and his team are renowned for being the world’s best snow leopard trackers. When you combine this with the best spotting scopes in the industry (Swarovski BTX scopes with 50x magnification and 1.7x extender to 85x), you get (basically) guaranteed snow leopard sightings!The camp provides by far the best accomodation possible for snow leopard tracking anywhere on earth. My wife and I stayed in the Shan dome suite. It was beautifully appointed with wooden floorboards, stone bathroom and a high pressure hot shower! The bed was huge and very comfortable. The rooms were very well heated - my wife and I live on a tropical island hate the cold yet were happy walking around the room in underwear.We extended our snow leopard trip with side trips to Ranthambore (tigers), Jawai (leopards) and Rajasthan. Voyagr and Behzad were amazing and put together a perfect trip! The drivers and guides Behzad chose were fantastic as were the hotel recommendations!All in all there is a reason Voyagr has a perfect 5* rating on TripAdvisor… We certainly plan to book all future remote holidays with Behzad!"
Voygr_Expeditions,123,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,Amazing,"This adventure absolutely exceeded my expectations.  It was a unique combination of being totally in nature with many upscale comforts. The staff was exceptional, they anticipated your every need and were especially accommodating. I have such respect for everyone who made this a trip to remember. I really never thought about conservation before but this was a introduction to a group of individuals who are completely committed. It was inspirational."
Voygr_Expeditions,Nevena Boteva,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,Such an amazing adventure - loved the snow leopards!,"I did this adventure in february 2020  together with my father, who is a passionate wild life photographer.We liked Leh and I really loved visiting a monestery for the morning prayers. It deeply toched me and it was very intersting. I am so thankful to Behzad, Brad, Kenrab, Dzordje, Rashid,.... the whole staff, who was taking such a great care of us and made all of this possible for us. It was all very well organised. And I managed to learn so much from you. About snow leopards, about Hemis, about conservetion, enviroment. Of course VOYGR wants to offer you a nice holiday and some nice seeings of snow leopards.  But what I truelly loved is that these people are dedicated to what they do. You can see and feel its not just a job - its a passion, its an ispiration and vocation to make life better for the animals, for the village people, for nature.  We really enjoyed some nice seeing of a snow leopard. Once we spent a whole afternoon watching a mum and her two cubes. It was so amazing! The spotters did a great job too so we could also see blue sheeps, golden eagles, wolves, lammergeyersVOYGR always had an open ear for our individual needs and personal interests. And I was so happy being able to go for hiking with a guide anything I wanted.The camp in Hamis national park is really nice and comfortable as possible for the conditions there. I didnt miss anything at all in our sleeping tent, toilet or wash room. Our ""social tent"" where we could sit together, chat, have meels was cozy. Food was always great. I loved the apple cider ritual every late afternoon for warming up after going to the field trying to spot some interesting animals.For anyone who is  interested in snow leopards, who is looking for a adventure I would highly recommend VOYGR."
Voygr_Expeditions,Brent G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,My week with Snow Leopards in the Himalayas,"I had the great good fortune to hear about Voygr Expeditions from Brad Josephs, who was our head guide on the trip I took in February.  We camped for eight nights at an altitude of just below 4,000 meters in Hemis National Park in Ladakh.  Nights were a bit frosty, but Voygr's campsite was superbly equipped and our stay was very comfortable with a few unexpected luxuries!  Along with Brad our group was led by Behzad Larry, the CEO of Voygr, and a large group of local support staff including the best snow leopard spotters in India.  We were privilged to spot many leopards along with a number of other species of mammals and birds.  I learned so much from Behzad and all of the guides, and left with a deep and lasting impression of the warmth and kindness of the people of Ladakh and of their passion for snow leopards and the mountain ecosystem that is their only home.  For anyone interested in snow leopards or seeking an exceptional adventure, I would highly recommend that you contact Voygr."
Voygr_Expeditions,Carrie W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,Truly exceptional,"I was lucky enough to book a snow leopard expedition with Behzad and simply can't say enough good things. Behzad's passion for snow leopards, his true love of Hemis National Park, his desire to improve and expand the experiences he has for his guests, and the team that surrounds you on his expeditions is truly extraordinary. The joy, excitement, passion and caring that every member of the team displayed was above any expectation I could have set going in to this trip. If you're considering a snow leopard expedition look no further than Behzad and Voygr!"
Voygr_Expeditions,JoJM49,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-19,Beyond all expectations Voygr. Simply amazing!,"What a wonderful place is Ladakh. And thanks to Behzad Larry, Rashid, and Australian cultural photographer, Robert van Koesveld, we have seen the very best of it. Voygr – you are unique. You offer it all. So knowledgeable: history, geography, religion, culture, wild life, conservation, photography.  And, most special, the personal engagement with the beautiful Ladakhi people in villages, monasteries and nomad camps, and the flexibility to stop wherever, whenever, to chat to interesting locals and take photographs. Every day was jam packed with photographic opportunity, serendipitous encounters and magic moments, but we never felt rushed. We have never encountered a company with leaders, guides and interpreters so committed and so caring, and such delightful company. Easygoing and fun. But behind the scenes, every detail is covered - our trust in you complete. We felt safe. Great drivers, and the fabulous homecooked, food was plentiful and ‘clean’. ‘Off the beaten track’, driving across the Tibetan Plateau, following the tracks of the nomads and camping alongside their yaks and gorgeous pashmina goats was a highlight. As were prayers with Buddhist monks in 10th century monasteries perched high up in the oh-so-scenic mountains, joining in song at wheat harvest and dining in the ancient caravanserai. Brilliant.So Voygr, thank you for such a joyful trip, and for opening our eyes to a part of the world about which we knew so little. Only 5 stars? You deserve 100! Sensational! "
Voygr_Expeditions,GAM47,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct-19,An outstanding photography tour in every respect.,"My wife and I were privileged join Voygr Expeditions' 14-day Ladakh Photography Tour Sept 29-Oct 12, 2019 very ably lead by Behzad, Rashid and travel photographer Robert Van Koesveld. Behzad and Rashid's warm, friendly approach, impressive regional knowledge and genuine concern for guest comfort along with Robert’s excellent photography guidance meant that this photo/travel experience has exceeded all of our expectations.The ~ 1000km road trip itinerary in individual vehicles covered all of the most significant Ladakhi highlights including Thiksey, Lamayuro, Alchi, Hemis and Diskit monasteries, the Nubra Valley, Tangyar village and Tso Moriri lake, with stays in a 4 star hotel back in Leh between each segment. We were also privileged to shoot portraits and have an evening meal under stars in Voygr's refurbished Caravanserai, last used by Silk Road traders over 70 years ago. With its considerable exposure to Ladakhi culture generally; its nomad pashmina goat, sheep and yak herders in particular, and; its stark, colourful and high-impact terrain, this trip stands out as one of our best ever travel experiences."
Voygr_Expeditions,ajsdelhi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,"A wonderful Ladakh experience, courtesy Voygr....","My son and I spent 12 days with Behzad and team in Ladakh in June-July 2019.  I am an experienced hiker and climber, but this was my first trip with a top-class tour company - and the experience was simply, absolutely outstanding!  We were keen to do some hikes and also learn photography.  Behzad created a customized itinerary for us to do multiple treks; observe and learn about snow leopard tracking and conservation from the folks who are world-leaders in this field; see the impact of efforts to encourage eco-tourism and preserve the traditional way of village life; and explore varied terrain ranging from Leh to Hemis National Park to the Nubra Valley, ending up with a wonderful trek/jeep safari from Tso Kar to Tso Moriri.  Along the way, Behzad taught us the ins and outs of landscape and portrait photography, and got us to the most wonderful situations (outdoors and indoors) and people to photograph.  The type of access Voygr has to experts, geographies, people - I cannot conceive of anyone else being able to offer anything that comes close.Logistics and equipment were top-notch.  I felt a bit guilty about the wonderful style in which we stayed, but hey, you only live once.  The camping facilities (complete with a loo--with-a-view tent), the outstanding food that was drummed up seemingly out of nowhere, and the terrific service by the camp staff - all of it made for a memorable experience.  I want to single out Sharif for exemplary dedication and service - I don't have the right words to praise him, he is such an outstanding human being and guide.We engaged Behzad to be with for all the 12 days, and it was the best decision we made!  He is absolutely delightful company - knowledgeable, engaging, with a terrific sense of humor.  Rashid joined us for the last 4 days, and we got to know another terrific professional - I am coming back to Ladakh next summer to go climbing with Rashid.So, all in all, easily one of the best travel experiences I have ever had.  We will be back, repeatedly."
Voygr_Expeditions,ltsuit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,A True Adventure,"This is the second time I've traveled with Voygr Expeditions, and I'm sure to come back for more. What makes Voygr so special is that they have created adventures that are deeply aligned with and respectful of the land, the people, and the wildlife who live where we travel. The Snow Leopard tour is a true adventure. You're a few hours hike in the Himalayas, and you camp surrounded by nothing but ridges and peaks for miles and miles. You have all of the freedom you would want to explore, but they also provide the comforts you would expect from a high end luxury tour. Compared to other companies in the area, we no doubt had the best set up - the best guides, meals, tent (more like giant yurts) set ups (we had in tent heaters turned on at sunrise, and about an hour before we went to bed), and Expert trackers. Behzad and his team were great with the communications and planning ahead of time, pick up was a breeze, and everything was taken care of from beginning to end. All I had to worry about was being present and enjoying every moment of the trip. The service was unlike anything I've seen. No matter where you were, tea and cookies would find you. Each meal was multi coursed and delicious. It was a great mix of local style food, Indian food, and good old comfort food (pancakes were a treat). I went into this trip with zero expectations around seeing a snow leopard or any other wildlife. I was excited to just be in the mountains, and meet great people, but I ended up seeing so much more than I could have imagined - tibetan wolves, eurasian lynx, beautiful golden eagles, lammergeiers, and of course the snow leopard. Viewing the snow leopard for hours was truly special, and Behzad's team and the others on the trip were the perfect people to enjoy it with. Lastly, the thing I appreciated most about this trip was how much of a positive impact this expedition has on the local community, the national park, and wildlife conservation in general. The entire crew is local, the trackers are local, and so much money is flowing back into the communities and directly towards leopard and wildlife conservation. Behzad and his team care so much about this, and do whatever they can to add value to the communities and lands where they travel.Thanks Behzad, Rashid, Caitlin and team. See you sometime soon. :)"
Voygr_Expeditions,bradjosephs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,One of greatest wildlife trips in my life,"I have been focused on wildlife my entire life, and seeing a snow leopard was at the top of my list since I can remember.  I have tried several times in other regions of Himalayas and Tibetan plateau with no success, but this time it happened with Voygr!  The thrill of seeing a snow leopard in the wild is a wildlife experience in a class by itself. The scenery in Hemis National Park is as stunning as any I have ever seen.  We saw lots of other wildlife including many up close blue sheep, 7 Tibetan wolves, Eurasian lynx, fox, Tibetan Partridge, chukar, griffon, lammergeier, golden eagles, and snowcock.  The system of snow leopard expeditions in Hemis is the best anywhere in terms of being the perfect model of conservation, as the park fees are pooled to fund projects for villagers that help live sustainably in snow leopard habitat.  The region is not overgrazed with livestock, as it is outside the park, so there are no conflicts between herders and snow leopards, so leopards do not fear people.  There is excellent food resources and habitat for blue sheep which are abundant which sustains high density of snow leopards.   The crew for the camps are all locals, so they all have an equal, vested interest in healthy snow leopard populations.    When you visit Hemis in the winter for snow leopards, you are directly supporting snow leopard conservation.  We stayed in luxury tents, with cots, heaters, and super warm sleeping bags.  The food was amazing, and we had a huge heated tent to hang out and eat in.  We hired the top snow leopard experts from the wildlife department, which guided BBC planet earth 2 team, to find us wildlife ( this is the main reason they have had 100 percent success of snow leopard sightings in the last 4 years! This is the best operation to run snow leopard expeditions, in the best location, which is why I have picked them to run my snow leopard tours that we are organizing for 2020 as I am a career wildlife expedition leader.  It is solid, professional team in the best place to see and photograph these amazing big cats.  Everyone I spoke to in Ladakh had nothing but top respect for this operation, and they treated all support staff and locals with the same respect,  which is my style.  Hats off to owners Rashed and Behzad! These guys have set the bar high.  "
Voygr_Expeditions,Shravan R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Fantastic team that made a dream come true,"The recent expedition for snow leopards with Behzad, Rashid, Khenrab, Dorje, Sajan and team was outstanding. The communication from the first e-mail enquiring about the trip to the time we got back, was very good.•The expedition was very well organized. Behzad ensured each of us acclimatized to the high altitude in the first two days. None of us felt altitude sickness. Behzad and the team also kept a close watch on our physical ability and mental awareness throughout the trip. Their attention was key in a very enjoyable experience.•The camp site was perfect. Behzad had pitched the tents well in advance of our arrival, to take the best position. The tents themselves were luxurious, with a bed ensuring we were not sore or cold by sleeping on the ground. The food was delicious, with pizzas, pastas, noodles, dumplings and Indian food for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was elaborate, with porridge, eggs, bread and cereal. Many varieties of tea and coffee were always available through the day.•The sightings were exceptional. Khenrab Phuntsog, the renowned tracker from BBC Planet Earth 2, is not only a great tracker, but also one of the lead conservationists in Hemis National Park. He gave many, many insights into the ecology, animal behaviour, culture and conservation aspects of what we experienced. He delivered in spades each day: we had 7 snow leopard sightings including one from a few hundred feet and two from the camp (a first, I am told), 5 tibetan wolf sightings, including one from the camp (a first again). We also saw a red fox, many blue sheep and birds. The calls on four different mornings of 'snow leopard' even before the first cup of tea, and the first time I saw a snow leopard, will always remain with me. •This trip was supposed to see the snow leopard, to take it off it off my bucket list. Instead, it has turned into the first of hopefully many more trips to see the snow leopards again."
Voygr_Expeditions,Wayne and Sally,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Overwhelmingly sensational!,"We wanted to see snow leopards and we wanted an adventure. Our expectations were exceeded! This trip delivered in spades. It was a game changer for us. How we travel going forward will be forever influenced by this trip. And it wouldn't have been so incredible without Voygr. We couldn't have had the deep and broad connective experience we had without Voygr's:- close, influential network in the region, which provided amazing 'access'- the care and expertise of the individuals Rashid, Khenrab, Dorjay, Sajan and broader team supporting us (emphasis on the word 'care' - expertise was overflowing but it was the care factor that warmed up the very cold days and nights)- the effort from everyone to ensure our experiences with wildlife, with the communities, in/around camp, out hiking etc. were maximised at every opportunity- the support of the team to help us manage well in the harsh altitude and super cold winter conditions (nourishment, warmth, protection, equipment).  What did we like best? For us, the most memorable experiences traveling are those when we feel as though we are immersed in the environment and culture of a place, and when we feel as though we are learning and contributing in some small way to something important (in the context of the protection and prosperity of wildlife and the natural world). This is what we loved most on this trip. Voygr gave us access and opportunity to have this type of experience. It felt very personal and very 'big' if that makes sense. Hard to find words really, and we're still trying to process how amazing it was. We observed the incredible wildlife (including rare snow leopards), learned the challenges and opportunities of the region, met local villagers and learned their way of life, experienced the harsh environment, felt part of the beautiful mountains and valleys. Overwhelmingly sensational!What did we like least? Nothing really! But be warned if you go in January everything is going to freeze. Everything! Moisturizer, toothpaste.... haha! So be prepared for that! A few extra thoughts: We didn't have any problem with our camera equipment in the cold, we were able to charge our batteries each night (and kept spare batteries warm in our pockets). We did take our own little power pack for the iPhone which was super helpful out in the field (we took a lot of landscape shots and videos with the phone so having it outside the batteries could run out super quick!). Don't be tempted to stay in your warm sleeping bag too long in the mornings! It's prime spotting time! The team will let you know if they spot any wildlife but if you're still tucked up, by the time you get your clothes on and get up there (huffing and puffing, everything is harder at altitude!) you can miss that wolf on the ridge line or that snow leopard as it disappears over the ridge. Before leaving home for the trip and while we were in Leh acclimatising before starting the expedition we got good, detailed advice on so many things from both Behzad and Rashid, which we followed to the letter. And we're so glad we did, we're so thankful. They really know what they are doing and they cared about setting us up for success. Follow their advice.By the way, our expedition was for 8 nights in Hemis National Park. And even though we didn't see a snow leopard until the evening of the 6th day, at no time did we think that we wouldn't see one because we had full confidence in the expertise of the team. And aside from that we had such a fulfilling wildlife experience in the lead up to the 6th day observing lynx, wolves, blue sheep and other wildlife. It was truly wonderful before we even got to observe and photograph the beautiful snow leopard in the wild.Get this on your bucket list! It was the experience of a lifetime for us!!!"
Voygr_Expeditions,Julia T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Trip of a lifetime,"We wanted to visit Ladakh and Rajasthan and asked Rashid, who we met 10 years ago when he led us on a trek to the Nanda Devi East Base Camp, and who impressed us then by his attention to detail and caring attitude, to organise a trip for us. And we were not disappointed.  He and his staff took care of all arrangements regarding accomodation and travel, and in Ladakh the permits required to visit Hemis National Park and the Nubra Valley. Himself Ladakhi he shared his vast knowledge of the culture, wildlife and history of the country and we marvelled at the majestic mountains and beautiful isolation of the Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake after crossing the Khardung La mountain pass, the highest motorable road in the world!. In Hemis we stayed in a Homestay in Rumbuk, experiencing the extremely difficult life lived by these hardy mountain people. But unfortunately, we didn't spot any snow leopards!Our trip round Rajasthan was very different but equally enjoyable, thanks to Rashid's planning and organisation. We arrived in Jodhpur for the 2 day Marwar festival of Rajasthani folk music and dance, visited a Marwari horse stud farm in Narlai and the Ranthambore national park where we were fortunate to see 6 tigers.  And the splendour and magnificence of the palaces, forts and temples are just stunning.Rashid accompanied us on the whole trip and he and Jitu our driver in Rajasthan, were very amicable and fun travel companions, and knowledgeable, also very helpful and reassuring if you have a problem. We can highly recommend Voygr and Rashid for their professional approach to planning and organising your trip and the care and attention they give to make sure you have the experience you expect.  Not cheap but the attention to detail and the trouble they go to to make your trip trouble free and memorable can't be matched.Julia T"
Voygr_Expeditions,Nicole M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Voygr is the best in the business!,"If you are currently researching tour operators for your trip to Ladakh, you can stop searching now. Voygr is not only the best choice – from here on out it will be my ONLY choice, regardless of the difference in cost. Other tour companies in India sub-contract random local guides and drivers, leaving you on your own if things don’t go according to plan. Not Voygr - the people you talk to during your pre-vacation planning stages are the same ones that will be there with you during the tour. During our month-long trip to India last month, we booked 2 separate tour companies for different destinations. We had the unique opportunity to experience both types of tours and, believe me, it makes a big/huge difference in the quality of your experience. Voygr is the way to go, hands down.My fiancée and I wanted to see Leh, Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake in a very short time and, at the same time, get help with our new photography hobby. Voygr was able to handle these demands with ease. Both Behzad and Rashid taught us so much about how to use our cameras and photography concepts in general. Behzad even gave us a PowerPoint presentation on photography and let my fiancée borrow a couple of lenses during our trip.They were professional, extremely knowledgeable, and prepared for anything. During our stay at Pangong Lake, my fiancée ended up needing oxygen. The campsite was supposed to have a supply of oxygen, but didn’t. Rashid came to the rescue with a tank that Voygr brings on every trip. Beware – this trip is not for the faint of heart. The high altitude/lack of oxygen combined with the bumpiness of the roads throughout the mountains makes for quite a difficult ride; however, we felt extremely safe with Rashid driving. He definitely knows his way around the mountains!As for our accommodations, The Kesar in Nubra valley was a great stay with delicious food and a beautiful garden. The Hermitage “tent” at Pangong Lake was wonderful. It was located far enough away from all the other touristy places that you truly felt isolated.We came away with beautiful pictures, profound experiences, and a ton of knowledge – not just about photography, but about the places we visited. We can’t thank them enough - both Behzad and Rashid were amazing! They exceeded all of our expectations during the trip. We will gladly refer all of our friends and family to Voygr for tours in the Ladakh region."
Voygr_Expeditions,Bindi P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Experience of a Lifetime,"I flew to Ladakh with Voygr, through an organization called WorldTeach. I did not know what to expect, but the moment I met the staff - Behzad, Rashid and our guide Rigzin, all the puzzle pieces came together. They are an extremely caring and intelligent group. They made our experience extremely beneficial and planned everything thoroughly. Because they are locals of Ladakh and India, they knew all the best places, and where to go to find them. Seeing the grand Himalayan mountains and learning the history behind many of the glaciers was mainly possible because of Voygr staff. We were able to experience Yak irrigation, cow milking, the ladakhi culture, their food, a ladakhi wedding, and wear traditional outfits. This organization has exceeded my expectations and if I get the chance, I will definitely travel with Voygr again. Thanks to the staff for making our experience life-changing."
Voygr_Expeditions,elizabeth g,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Bucket List - Trip of a lifetime!,"My sister and I had a bucket list wish of going to Ladakh.  We started searching for travel companies that could arrange our trip. Voygr was by far the company with the most prompt and in depth information.Arriving in Leh we were warmly greeted by Bezhad and Rashid at the airport.  We immediately felt we were in the right hands.  These guys are so knowledgeable and on top of that have great senses of humour.   They advised us well on how to handle the altitude and through the whole trip kept a vigilant eye on us to ensure we were always safe and well.Bezhad and Rashid are well known and respected by many across Ladakh.  They know monks and lamas at many monasteries and also many of the nomadic communities.  We were so thrilled that while travelling to Tso Moriri we stopped at a nomad camp and were invited into their tents to say hello as Rashid was friends with them.  When in Nubra Valley we got to see The Dalai Lama up close because of the  contacts these guys have.  This trip delivered everything we could have hoped for and more.Liz and Renata, Perth Australia"
Voygr_Expeditions,Ellie M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,There is honeslty no one better,"I came to Ladakh through an organization called World Teach, with which Voygr worked as the in-country contact and host. Any and all expectations I could have possibly had were immediately surpassed. The team at Voygr is prepared for anything and can see and solve problems before you even know they’re there. They listen to and care about the client’s goals and ambitions for the expedition and are prepared and able to make each one a reality. The staff understands the importance of the overall experience of the client and will provide exactly what you hope for. Behzad and Rashid are well known by everyone in the community and are thus able to gain exclusive access to monks and nomads alike. You will be able to photograph and speak with people who wouldn’t otherwise interact so closely with tourists, providing you with a truly remarkable opportunity to be embedded in a local culture and appreciate the lifestyle and story of the subjects of your photos. Whatever you are traveling with Voygr to do, you will have special access, the staff’s extensive knowledge, and a just genuinely fun travel buddy throughout the whole journey. I wouldn’t travel in the region without them."
Voygr_Expeditions,Ryker M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,"IF YOU'RE NOT TRAVELING WITH VOYGR, YOU'RE WRONG.","I came to Ladakh through Voygr as part of the WorldTeach program.  I am currently a college student and have been in Ladakh for two months this summer, teaching in Zanskar for most of the experience.  Voygr facilitated the whole program and exceeded all my expectations doing so.Voygr is a well-oiled machine.  All staff members and guides are extremely experienced in traveling, planning, and adapting.  They have the ability to see challenges develop before they happen and quickly devise solutions before the client even knows a solution was needed.  They are keen to listen to the client's specific wants and needs, and they immediately make sure each one is fulfilled.  The staff understand the importance of making careful plans, planning for contingencies, and working hard to be flexible when it is best for the client.  Without exaggeration, the client is always treated like royalty.*Touring with Voygr will without a doubt give the client the best possible experience—better than any other tour company—for many reasons.  The staff are among the most well-respected people in all of Ladakh.  Everybody knows and loves them, and this gives the client privileged access to absolutely everything.  Whether the client is a photographer, trekker, wildlife enthusiast, or tourist just exploring the world, the astronomical number of connections Voygr has will give the client the most superior experience.  To name a few of the many examples: the staff knows the monks and lamas at many monasteries; they are familiar with many nomadic communities; the staff even includes the man who tracked the snow leopards for BBC’s Planet Earth II: Mountains, the best tracker in the entire world.  It is completely impossible to be disappointed with Voygr considering their many connections, and the client’s experience is enhanced even more by the unique and incredible staff (the three I interacted with the most were Behzad, Rashid, and Rigzin).Behzad is the best photographer I have ever met; but don’t take my word for it, just go look at his pictures on the Voygr website!  He is a wizard of an artist, and when he shoots, he makes it fun and educational for everyone.  He is extraordinary at getting along with every single type of person.  Behzad is like a walking google: you can ask him any question, and he will know the answer 99% of the time (100% if it involves photography, geography, or health).  Oh, and he speaks seven languages.Rashid is an extremely kind and outgoing man who overtly dedicates himself to making sure his client has the ultimate experience; he can make plans on the fly like no other (his IQ is probably around 180, Behzad’s too).  Rashid is an integral part of Voygr’s business, as he is hands down one of the most adored people in all of Ladakh; if you don’t know who Rashid is, then you probably aren’t Ladakhi.  He is a national champion boxer, an esteemed mountaineer, and an excellent photographer.I had the incredible opportunity to live and teach with ache (big sister) Rigzin for more than a month.  From the oldest village in all of Ladakh, she is a true Ladakhi: hard-working, helpful, and always happy.  She is extremely smart and well-educated, and it is her dream to climb all the highest mountains in the world.  She knows everything there is to know about how to be a good mountain guide, especially when it comes to her people-skills.  It is in her blood to truly be present as an exceptional support.  One example of this happened after school one day: I told her I would do laundry with her right after I took a quick bath, but when I came out, my laundry was already half-finished while hers hadn’t even been started.  This was a completely normal thing to happen, and when I expressed gratitude she would always say, “You don’t need to thank your ache!”  She is superb at her job with Voygr, but she’s an even better ache!Overall, if you’re not traveling with Voygr, you’re wrong.*Palm leaf fans not included: This is the beautiful Himalayas, not some disgusting and overpopulated beach, thank God."

This was the second tour I arranged them and I went the specific goal of capturing some great portraits of the Ladakhi people. I had high expectations and specific requirements. Rashid and Juma did not disappoint. There professional, can do attitude exceeded all my expectations. It was clear Rashid’s local knowledge and connections meant all my requests were going to be met without any problem. I really felt like I was backed up by a highly professional team. They were able to open up access to exclusive situations which gave me amazing opportunities to get some great portraits.This was the second tour I arranged with Voygr and will hopefully get the opportunity to book another customised photography tour with them in the future.

Voygr_Expeditions,behzadlarry,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Photography tour of Ladakh,"Just came back from an 8-night trekking expedition with the Voygr crew.  Wow.  Unbelievable camp experience with some nice amenities (e.g. cots/carpets/side tables in the tents), and great food prepared 3x daily (lunch was delivered to us wherever we were in the valley that day).  Voygr uses the best guides (for real, these guys are total pros with decades of experience), and will be happy to take care of any need you may have.  One example stands out to me - after leaving camp, we ask if we can trek further into the valley that day and use a local homestay for lodging that night.  Logistics would be uncertain as none of us had left camp thinking we wouldn't be back that evening.  10 minutes later, we see a guy with a horse heading back toward our camp.  Rashid arranges for him to pick up some supplies from our camp and bring them to our destination, as well as sends a message to camp to bring our lunch about 2.5 hour hike away to where we'll be.  I was so impressed with their ability to make adjustments on the fly, take care of their clients, and deliver an exceptional experience.  We also had a great snow leopard spotting one day and decided that we should visit other parts of Ladakh the following day.  No problems - Behzad and Rashid made arrangements and took us all over Nubra Valley and all the way to Pangong Lake.  These guys are totally dedicated.  They have the connections all over Ladakh to make anything happen.  I'll definitely be coming back for another tour!"

Voygr_Expeditions,expatraveller13,,,,It was wonderful having you with us Matt!
Voygr_Expeditions,daniellakb,,,,"I arranged a return tour with Voygr with high expectations from my first trip and had a really fantastic time again. This was a customised photography tour focussing on my interest in people photography, and visiting some remote areas in Nubra, Zanskar and Kashmir. From beginning to end Voygr went out of their way to make sure they delivered an exceptional experience that not only gave me unusual and interesting photographic opportunities but also a great cultural experience which was exactly what I was looking for. As a solo traveller this time I had the flexibility to keep changing the itinerary as we went along according to the opportunities that arose, which they managed seamlessly and without any objections. My every request and need was met with a 'no problem' and 'can do' attitude which was refreshing and lead to some amazing experiences off the beaten track which I just wouldn't have been able to have on my own or with a less specialised/experienced tour company. Arguably just as important as their professional expertise at delivering a top notch trip, was that Behzad, Rashid and their team of staff and local guides are fantastic people to travel with and spend time with, and as a solo traveller I was in great company and had lots of wonderful fun moments to remember. I'm sure this one won't be my last trip with these guys - don't hesitate to choose them for your next adventure and book your slot early as they're always in demand from repeat customers. I can't recommend them highly enough!"
,,,,,I contacted Bezhad to arrange a tailor-made photography tour of Ladakh. From start to finish I felt the tour organisation was very professional. The day I arrived Behzad and Sharif met me at the airport in Leh and went through the plan. After allowing sometime to get used to the altitude my adventure began. They took me to some amazing locations and through there local knowledge they were able to arrange access to do portrait sittings with some incredible local people. I could tell everywhere I went they are very well respected in the local community. Nothing was too much trouble. I will be booking another trip in the future and would highly recommend Voygr if your looking for a personalised photography trip.
,,,,,Bezhad and the Voygr team where amazing! Great organisation and recommendations on all the best activities and food around Leh. We were lucky enough to also visit the newly opened Kesar in Nubra Valley - WHAT A TREAT! The staff we're so welcoming and friendly. If going to Leh you MUST get in touch with Voygr and their team
Voygr_Expeditions,Beatrice S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,The experience of a lifetime thanks to Voygr!,"Jullay!As part of a 5 week volunteer trip to Sumur Valley, the fantastic Voygr team was coordinating and overseeing all onsite activities for us volunteers. Behzad, Rashid, and Rigzin not only prepared us well on all things involving life in a Sumur Valley village but also introduced us to Ladakhi culture and its natural beauty during an amazing 5 day camping/trekking trip to Lake Tsomoriri and Lake Tso Kar at the end of our stay.I always felt safe and well-taken care of by the entire team. Everyone made sure that we have the best possible experience and did so in the most professional way. Especially the glamorous tents and the amazing cooking by the Nepali staff made it a very special kind of camping trip, which we appropriately called ""glamping"". To everyone who is considering visiting Ladakh, I can full-heartedly recommend Voygr Expeditions. You will get so much more out of your trekking than just hundreds of fantastic pictures, you will win new friends, teachers, and an experience of a lifetime when trekking with Behzad and Rashid and their most wonderful, caring and extremely knowledgable support staff."
Voygr_Expeditions,360plus2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Business,Voygr led student trip - a wonderful experience!,"360+ Leadership Collective has partnered with Voygr to support logistics for our summer travel program for the past three years. Our students are age 16-19 and come from across the U.S. and India. This year, we opted to hold the Leadership Collective in Ladakh for thematic reasons but also so we could benefit from having the Voygr team's physically presence on our trip. What an absolutely excellent decision. I cannot say enough positive things about Behzad, Rashid, and our guides Rigzin and Sharif. Behzad was extremely responsive in the lead up to the trip ( this has been consistently true over our past three years of partnering with Voygr) responding to emails with detail and focus. There are so many details when planning a student trip for nearly 40 people and Bezhad made it seem easy. Rashid was always there to give additional information or make more contacts if needed. Both of them are funny and always keep things entertaining while managing to stay professional. When we arrived in Leh we were met at the airport by a smiling Voygr team and whisked to our guest houses. When traveling with so many students things don't always go as planned , in fact, they can sometimes seem in constant flux. Sharif and Rigzin ( who traveled with us from the moment we landed until the moment we left) handled everything beautifully. From letting us borrow phones to finding restaurants that the kids consistently loved to helping run errands they were always there and always genuinely eager to help. Rigzin and Sharif were more than just extra hands however, they were truly our guides and interpreters during our time in Ladakh adding their perspective as community members whenever an opportunity presented itself. This was truly invaluable. The students adored them and we as staff did too. We also had the chance to stay at the new Voygr guest house in the Nubra Valley ( Kesar Guest house) which was really, really lovely. Excellent chefs in the kitchen and spacious, sun filled rooms. Students are still telling me they wish they could go back! All in all, we are very proud of our partnership with Voygr and believe they offer an unparalleled level of attention to detail, clear communication, and genuine thoughtfulness about their trip planning. Highly recommend this partnership for student groups or large tour groups in general. Voygr has the capacity and people you need to run a flawless, low stress trip."
Voygr_Expeditions,4onadventure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,WOW WOW WOW,"I had the time of my life travelling in Ladakh with Behzad and Rashid!I was lucky enough to travel in April while there was plenty of snow to making crossing the passes exciting!Both of these guys are very professional, very entertaining and informative, plus the photos Ive come back with are sensational!I can't wait to travel with Voygr again and again and again."
Voygr_Expeditions,Martin W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Snow leopard expedition 2017,"This was a very successful and well led trip to Ladakh, organised by Behzad and Rashid and a splendid assembly of porters and cooks, and especially local guides Khenrab, from the Snow Leopard Conservancy in the Hemis National Park and Rigzin Wangdu in the Nubra valley. Behzad and Rashid are very interesting and personable guys and very good company and provided great insights into Ladakh, Leh and pretty much anything else! Being a winter trip at altitude it was chilly though we were well prepared and well catered for. Hot sweet tea would miraculously appear at intervals even on the top of snowy ridges! Spotting the leopards is not guaranteed but chances are maximised by the quality of the crew and there was a wealth of knowledge to draw from. We saw leopards on three of the four days in Hemis and also saw many tracks, marking rocks and leopard skat. Large raptors abound in the park as well as bharal (blue sheep) which are the snow leopards' principal prey. The itinerary on this trip was flexible. We could have stayed longer but elected to travel farther afield with reports of sightings elsewhere. We visited Ullay and crossed the spectacular Kardhung-La into the fascinating Nubra valley where we spent a few days identifying sites to put camera traps. Sadly we saw no more leopards though did see a beautiful red fox and a lot of interesting geology and topography, not to mention petroglyphs in a number of locations. This is a fairly hardy trip with the cold and altitude but if you are up for it it makes for a brilliant experience."
Voygr_Expeditions,bsw0pe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,The Best Possible Experience We Could Have Had,"The trip was absolutely amazing.  We went on a motorcycle tour / fishing trip and Rashid led our team.  The team was incredibly thorough and knowledgeable.  Ladakh is truly one of the most beautiful places I've ever been and the prep, skill, and care the team put into our safety and trip left me feeling incredibly at ease and truly able to enjoy my vacation.  The motorcycle was sick and a really great bike.  In fact, our team was so prepared that we even rescued a guy who's chain had broken.  Can't recommend enough."
Voygr_Expeditions,christinmacgillivray,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,If I Could Give Voygr Ten Stars Out of Five I Would,"Voygr created a mind blowing experience in Ladakh. As for many - traveling through the more remote areas of Ladakh was a new experience for me. Voygr ensured everything was taken care of at a top notch level every step of the way. The guides - Behzad and Rashid - provide complimentary skills from a global and local perspective. They were able to craft a unique experience off the beaten track while providing rich environmental and cultural knowledge on the way.Within our trip, we pitched tents with nomads to explore Pashmina production, visited remote monasteries and trekked across beautiful landscapes. Behzad also gave lessons on time lapse and night sky photography, which as an aspiring photographer I found tremendously helpful. It will change how I look at the night sky through my lens.In addition to this - Vogyr has ethical guide practises. Their guides are paid fairly and they have an environment-first mindset. They will not cut corners on cost at the price of ethics, which sadly we cannot say of many of the tour companies in the region.It is without a nanogram of hesitation that I recommend Voygr as your choice in Ladakh. Enjoy Ladakh !"
Voygr_Expeditions,Lukas B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Unbelievably Awesome,"I did a motorcycle camping/fishing trip with Rashid.  Ladakh is so beautiful and different and we got to see so many different things.  The temples are incredible.  The landscape and terrain is super varied and interesting.  Maybe the coolest part was meeting some of the native nomadic people.These guys are such pros, I felt a little guilty.  They cook really good food and wake you up in your tent in the morning with hot tea.  We went a little late in the season and it was pretty cold, but we had a lot of fun.Rashid is fantastic.  He's the perfect combination of hyper competent and friendly.  I can't believe he took time off from leading trekking expeditions and doing search and rescue missions to help a couple of idiots on motorcycles not kill themselves in the mountains and try to catch fish.Every step of working with Voygr was great.  They are responsive and followed through on every request."
Voygr_Expeditions,Clare R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Why this is who to choose for your trip to Ladakh,"Exceptional experience from the beginning to end. I recently did a tailor made photography trip with Behzad J. Larry and his team from Voygr in Ladakh. Communication before the trip was very responsive and professional and together we worked out an ideal trip. The combination of Behzad's expertise, personality, photographic experience and enthusiasm and historical insights combined with Rashid's local knowledge, contacts and connections, capabilities and personality give a winning combination that is unbeatable. As a travel photographer, I know how important local knowledge and connections in gaining access to privileged situations which result in great photographic opportunities and this is exactly what you get with Voygr, all delivered with the utmost professionalism and attention to detail, be people who go to great lengths to make sure they're delivering what you're looking at the same time as being great fun and entertaining travel companions. I am already planning my next trip with them and can't recommend them highly enough."
Voygr_Expeditions,Simon G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Unforgetable Ladakh - Photography Tour with Voygr,"Two of us had a tailor-made photography tour with Behzad and Rashid. We were presened with great locations and wonderful people to photograph; I doubt that anyone else could give the level of privileged access that we had. The amount of planning and groundwork done by Voygr was evident in their warm welcome from local people wherever we went, at any altitude. Great staff made the adventure as comfortable as it could be in an, at times, very harsh climate. The overal impression is that I was greatly privileged to have visited some very special people in Ladakh and I could not have done it in any better company."
Voygr_Expeditions,Anulekha G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Unbelievable experience!,"The trip customized by Voyagr for our group was fabulous. It kept in mind acclimitization and travel time. They took care of hotel, permits, transportation, the best guides and driver (Chozkin and Stanzin - you are wonderful!) and meals on the road.  When travelling to this region of India it is important to remember that it is still developing and was not open to tourists until recently. Given the incipient nature of the tourist industry in Ladakh, Voyagr left us with very little to worry about and we were happy to be in their very capable hands. Voyagr met us at the airport, and from then on it was all up to them. Our group of 6 travelled in a well kept Tempo Traveller, everyone had a window seat. There was always an oxygen tank. Our guide Chozkin was very knowledgeable about the history of Ladakh and our driver Stanzin knew all the roads. We travelled for 5 days covering Leh, Diskit, Hunder and Turtuk via KhardungLa. Voyagr is very flexible to your needs and to the environment. Our day in Leh visiting monasteries had to be replanned as all the monks had gone to see the Dalai Lama. Voyagr took us to see the Dalai Lama to speak as well! How awesome! The landscape is unbelievably beautiful and unspoilt. Voyagr took care of our homestays with wonderful people in Turtuk and the tents of Hunder were very comfortable with wifi to boot! Voyagr also arranged our camel ride in Hunder - another once in a lifetime experience in a mountain desert sand dune. We were accomodated for any requests we had like stopping at pharmacies or other places along the journey. Voyagr staff is known by everyone in Leh. I was very comfortable with them. They are used to tourists from overseas and our guide spoke English. It is the best way to travel the region. Let Voyagr handle it all and you just soak in the wonder of the mountains. Would definitely go again!"
Voygr_Expeditions,Breedfreak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,Fantastic experience with Voygr.,"I have traveled the world but this is the first time I went with a guide. Looking back it was a good move, Rashid was PHENOMENAL and almost too good. I guess that maybe it was a given that he would get me where I needed to go and basically give me an all access pass to Ladakh (including expert itinerary and all that jazz) but, in my opinion, Rashid went over and above anything that I would have expected. For example, when we were out shooting stars, I was pretty happy with where we were but Rashid was not happy at the fact there was a lightbulb 500 yards in the distance. So, at 10PM we jumped in the car and drove 10 minutes into the darkness just to get a better picture. These guys were fantastic. NOTE: it was a little confusing for me when I first found Behzad and Voygr.  This entry in Trip Advisor is listed as Behzad Larry Photography. The reason I have been talking about Rashid and Voyager is that Behzad and Rashid are the owners of Voygr.com which is an adventure tour operator based in Leh. They do much much more than what you see in this entry. Bottom line: 1000% percent happy with these guys and would recommend them to anyone and everyone."

Behzad put together the perfect itinerary for us. We stayed at guest houses and camps which were simple yet comfortable and experienced great hospitality. Chamtse guest house in Leh started to feel like home by the end of our trip. Our driver, Imran was the best guide and we couldn't have seen Ladakh with anyone better. I'm not a big fan of long drives but in Ladakh I almost never wanted it to end. Our itinerary included Leh, Khardung la, Hunder, Turtuk, Tso Kar, Tso Moriri. I would definitely want to go back someday and visit Kargil, Zanskar and would love to go back to Turtuk and probably do a bit of rafting too. I would however skip Tso Kar - too deserted, too much walking and not much to eat."

You spend a large chunk on the road covering the vast stretches of Ladakh and thanks to the enthusiasm and competence of Imran, appointed by Behzad and Rashid, we had the best time. He's a very able driver and excellent guide whose love for Ladakh is infectious.  Voygr set us up at homely guest houses and planned an itinerary that allowed us to see more than the tourist-infested spots. Will certainly return to Ladakh with Voygr.

,,,,,"Behzad, Rashid and his Voygr team provided me with one of the best adventures of my life (honestly, might be #1). In my short stay I got the opportunity to experience the following:1. I saw a baby Pashmina goat take it's first steps right out of the womb on Tso Kar lake at 15,000 ft.2. I chased Keang (wild donkey/horse) on foot, and have hilarious photos to prove it (Behzad captured)3. I camped out with the Changpa Nomads for 2 nights - eating dinner with them, herding goats, sleeping underneath the brightest stars I have ever seen.4. I took the best photos of my life - portraits of Tibetan nomads, wild animals, incredible landscapes.5. I hiked to the top of StokLa at 17,000 feet, and was just constantly blown away by all of the views around each turn, and above every crest.6. I saw a family of Blue Sheep, Black Necked Cranes, hundreds of Wild Keang, a Marmot, Yaks, thousands of Pashmina Goats, Tibetan Mastiffs.7. I met amazing people, and built lasting relationships.He and his team did everything in their power to make these experiences happen. This included flying in film from New Delhi so I could take photos with my film camera!!! Also, because I could not find the battery to the digital camera I had brought, they hunted down an extra digital camera for me so I could take photos on our two day expedition to camp out with the ChangPa Tibet Nomads. They truly went above and beyond in every way.I already miss the land and people of Ladakh, and cannot wait to come back."

,,,,,"Did a Photography expedition with Behzad and Voygr and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Ladakh is stunning and as a photographer to be along with other photographers  gave us the opportunity to work together at getting the shots we wanted at our own pace. I lost count of the number of times we stopped the car to take photos of interesting scenes and amazing landscapes! :) Behzad is a great guide and photographer, patient, enthusiastic and up for anything. He is very knowledgeable about his subject, be it photography or the history of the region and goes to pains to ensure you have a great experience. If you are a photographer and want to check out Ladakh (the lesser known places especially) i would highly recommend checking out Voygr and Behzad Larry Photography."

With Higher Himalaya our trip went absolutely amazing as both the owner and the guide cum driver gave us a splendid experience of the beautiful Ladakh.From the very beginning the experience of booking the vehicle was super smooth, the owner is so soft spoken and helps understand and carve out a tour and gives a fair and the best deal. When you have a great beginning all the luck falls in to make the trip a success, likewise in our case the guide (driver) what's super amazing and gave us the best experience of the road. We traveled via Khardungla to Nubra and stayed there for night. He took us to multiple sites, best eateries, dunes and also helped us in getting the best (value for money) accommodation. then we were off to Pangong next day and despite the delays due to various factors and the road conditions he was calm composed and drove as per our recommendation, stopped as in when required, also help us finalize the accommodation.To sum up the whole experience from booking the cab to doing the trip and payment was absolutely seamless. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family."

Chamda is a true professional; could not recommend him more!"

,,,,,"ITALIAN BELOW We have been in Ladakh for 12 days and we hadn't organized anything in advance. Once there we visited many travel agencies and finally we decided to arrange our tour with higher Himalaya. That's because of their professionalism and very open to customize the trip accordingly to our desires. We did a trekking in Marka Valley and 3 days tour in Nubra Valley. For the trekking we decided to go with a guide. It has been a good choice and we recommend it mainly for 2 reasons. First and foremost even if the trail is quite easy to follow we had some troubles due to the heavy rain and the guide has been fundamental. In addition, he allowed us to better understand the places and local culture, but above all he has been both a linguistic and cultural bridge between us and the hosts in homestay. Regarding our second experience, Nubra valley, all the accommodations were beautiful and clean. The dinners were fantastic as well. The driver was very careful and he drove very well.The whole organization has been perfect, highly recommended. siamo stati in ladakh 12 giorni e abbiamo organizzato tutti I tour direttamente sul posto. Abbiamo chiesto a diverse agenzie e alla fine abbiamo potato per Higher Himalaya perché ci sono sembrato molto seri e disponibili.Abbiamo fatto un trekking di 5 giorni in Marka Valley e abbiamo deciso di prendere una guida. Questa è stata una decisione molto saggia principalmente per due motivi: innanzitutto perché anche se il sentiero è facile da seguire abbiamo avuto un po dinproblemi a causa del maltempo e l'aiuto della guida in alcuni punti è stato funzamentale. Inoltre, avere una persona del posto ci ha permesso di scoprire.meglio la.cultura locale e di entrare maggiormente in contatto con chi ci ha ospitato nelle homestay. Il tour nella Nubra Vally è stato molto affascinante e le sistemazioni molto belle e comode. Le cene sono state deliziose. In generare l'organizzazione e stata impeccabile quindi lo consigliamo vivamente"

Chamba bhaiya even booked a tent for us at pangong lake. He only suggested it and I'm thankful for that as most of the tents were full.He introduced us to an amazing driver, Dorjee. Who was really wonderful. Very friendly and felt like a family member. Was giving good suggestions and  was driving very carefully. He wore mask at all times. I've not seen him without mask even once. Very professional!!If u want to have the best trip I'd suggest go for Higher Himalayas. They will definitely enrich ur experience of the trip."

Higher_Himalaya,Khalid Anzar,,,,"We had a fabulous time on our 16 day jeep safari with Higher Himalaya. We sent Chamba  a list of places we would like to visit in Ladakh and  he put together a great itinerary making best use of our time .We had a comfortable and reliable jeep with a excellent driver who was helpful, friendly and always  ready to stop for photos and breaks and alter plans as we went along. The scenery was breathtaking and the local people incredibly friendly and welcoming.Late September was a really good time to visit Ladakh as tourist numbers are much lower and the weather clear and bright although getting a bit cold by the lakes. The journey from Pangong Lake to Tso Moriri Lake and on to Tso Kar was absolutely stunning and was the highlight of the trip.We found Higher Himalaya to be a well organised, reliable and competitively priced  tour agency. It has an office right in the centre of Leh and Chamba was always available for advice and information. He even helped us plan the jeep for the rest of our trip in the Spiti Valley  ( Himachal Pradesh ). You certainly don't need to have any concerns about transferring money for the deposit if you are organising a a trip from your home country. In our experience , Chamba is honest and trustworthy and keen for visitors from abroad to experience his country and it's culture.We would highly recommend Higher Himalaya to anyone and would certainly use the company again should we have the pleasure of returning to Ladakh.Thank you Chamba for your services and all the wonderful memories!"

Chamba (Higher Himalaya) took his time to understand the requirement, fixed up two more people to bring down the cost for individuals and organised the expedition in such a way that we get to visit maximum places in timely manner. Though he charged a little premium, the services offered were exemplary. Special thanks to Mr Karma, our car driver, who made the journey easy and fun.I'd recommend this place to people visiting Leh-Ladakh and need a friendly local trip adviser to fix up their itinerary."

,,,,,We had an amazing time with Higher Himalaya on both our trips: hiking in the Markha Valley and a jeep safari to Nubra Valley and Pangong Tso. We loved Leh as well and the whole area felt completely safe to travel in despite ongoing political drama!The guides on both trips were great and really looked after our interests. The hike (4n/5d) was less strenuous than expected although the altitude brought on a slight headache for the final night camp. Food and accommodation were great along the way.Jeep safari was beautiful. Lots of time in the car but plenty of opportunities to stop and best way to see the amazing sights.Would definitely recommend!

,,,,,"We had the best 6 days trekking with Higher Himalaya. The whole service was excellent, from being picked up from the airport to the complete care of our guide. The accommodation through the trek was great, but we would definitely recommend sleeping bag liners and a towel. The loos take a bit of getting used to for our western dispositions! Don't underestimate the effect that altitude will have on your fitness. We found parts of this very challenging, despite both being active people. Our guide was very considerate and got us through these times though. I was a little concerned before heading to Leh as I had read of some political trouble in the surrounding area, but we saw absolutely no sign of this and Leh was the least intimidating city we visited in India. The people are very respectful and there is never and pressure in shops or staring from local people."

Higher_Himalaya,Higher Himalaya,,,,"This agency organised a two day road trip to Khardung La, Pangong Lake and Chang La for us. They found another couple of travellers to share with us at short notice and organised all transport and accommodation. It was a superb trip although a little fraught on Chang La which was still snow-covered and icy in places. It was still very cold in April and  warm clothes were definitely needed. The tent camp we stayed in overnight was excellent, despite the cold. The young driver drove carefully and did a great job of getting us through Chang La under difficult driving conditions. I would highly recomend this agency for their professinalism and honesty. The trip was a great adventure for a couple of over 60s."

Higher_Himalaya,McSav,,,,"We arrive in Leh with no hotels or trips booked, just with the idea of what we wanna do in 5 days around Indus Valley and Nubra Valley. Half an hour after landed we arrive at the agency and we spoke with a kind man (I’m sorry but I don’t remember his name, however all people there were kind with us) and we explain which was our plans. He in few minutes organized us an incredible trip with hotel, private driver, meals that allowed us to see in few days all that we wanna see. All inclusive. The price was very good for all the things we done! Talking about the experience was the best experience we done in our lives, we slept in the thiksey gompa we done a trekking in the awesome markha valley with a very professional guide, always with professional drivers or guides. We were going to go to Nubra Valley through the Khardgung La Pass (5600 mt), unfortunately when we arrived there with our driver the road was closed for the snow, so we call back the agency (that was helpful and patience for all our trip), and they organize us an alternative trip to other beautiful areas WITHOUT EXTRA CHARGE! In conclusion I definitively suggest this incredible and professional agency for a great adventure in the magic Ladakh.P.s. They also organize trip to see the legendary snow leopard during the winter. "

,,,,,"We visited ladakh in June 2018, and we booked a private tour with Higher Himalayas. We had already booked our own accommodation, and we're looking for someone to help us with the transportation, and other local requirements. We found them through Google maps, and lonely planet recommendations. They booked our transportation for us, as well as our rafting trip. They also took care of our permits required for the trip, and acquired a Sim for us, since only local BSNL Sims, and some Airtel and BSNL postpaid Sims work there. The transportation provided was excellent! The car was in perfect shape, and our driver cum guide Urgyen was very knowledgeable and tactful even with the roads where roads did not exist. They helped us with all sorts of recommendations on the trip.The best part about them was their excellent communication. Even despite the terrible network conditions in ladakh, they were always just one WhatsApp message away. I had tried to work out my trip with a few other travel agents as well, but gave up due to communication issues. Higher Himalayas never had that problem. It was a real pleasure working with them. "

,,,,,"We did three trips with HIgher Himalaya. We were travelling with two children (age 10 and 12) and wanted to make sure they would also enjoy the sightseeing and avoid too much driving. All the trips were well organised, good facilities, great drivers, and really took account of what we were looking to do and our constraints. First was a one day trip to three or four local Buddhist monasteries. We set off early and arrived at the first monastery before anyone else, which made for a relaxing time. The driver was flexible and kind. Second trip was an overnight stay in the Nubra Valley. We stayed in tents, which were basic but comfortable. Unfortunately it rained - but the place we stayed was good and had very good food. The sand dunes were beautiful, though we didn't spend much time looking at them, though our son had a wonderful time playing in the mud. Again, the driver was helpful and flexible and we ended up leaving early because of the rain. Third trip was white water rafting. The rafting was amazing. HH was clear that our son probably wouldn't be able to do the full length of the rafting as he was too young, which turned out to be the case, and it was good to be clear about this from the beginning. He did join us half-way through and was looked after very happily in between. Our raft flipped and we ended up in the white water - we'd had good instructions on what to do, the equipment was really good, there were extra people to help us, so we were all fine and in fact thoroughly enjoyed it. It was also reassuring that after each trip HH asked us for detailed feedback on our experience. They were kind, hugely knowledgeable, and delivered three great trips for us."

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Helen Menhinick,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Couples,Markha Valley,"My husband and I trekked the Markha Valley route over 8 days.From arriving in Leh, at the Dreamland office, to departure our experience was without complaint or hitch. We were given the trip of a lifetime with every detail so calmly organised. Our guide Idga was excellent- so good at planning, very knowledgeable and reliably looking after us. The cook was a genius and a true character and the pony man kept happy healthy ponies and the little donkey.The scenery was breathtaking and every corner turned, a different vista. My favourite bits were the high passes, what a wonderful feeling.  Javeed made sure we had the best experience and organised at trip to Pangong Lake and Nubra Valley after our trek where we had a ride on two hump camels. Can’t fault anything- Can’t wait to go back. Thank you Javeed, Idga, Beem, our pony man and our driver Ali."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Alexander G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul-22,Great company for the individual travel experience!,"The cultural tour was very well organized and everything worked out perfectly. From a logistical side, we could not have asked for a better experience. The company owner, Javeed, speaks English very well, he was very responsive to our email queries, and it was pleasant to discuss the possible tour options with him. Also, he was very flexible to accommodate all our boundary conditions for the tour. I have rarely seen this with a travel agency in the past.Our driver on the tour, Ali, was a similarly honest and trustworthy person who did an excellent job. The only downside was that unfortunately, the driver spoke only very little English, so we received almost no information about the things we saw on the tour. I picked some info from our travel guide book, which was OK, but I am sure we missed a few interesting infos. If you would like to get some additional information while on the road, we recommend to discuss this with Javeed beforehand (booking an additional tour guide might be an option).The Markha Valley Trek, including the climb of Kang Yatze II, was an unforgettable adventure. The trekking guide Sonam, our ponyman, cook and assistant were all very friendly and quickly became our Ladakhi-Nepalese family. The food was great, and the trek itself was very pleasant to walk. Our recommendation is to make sure that the group brings along a dedicated toilet tent, and a comfortable chair for each person. For altitude acclimatization, we took Diamox, which worked very well. None of our group got any altitude problems. You can buy the Diamox in Leh in a pharmacy without any problem (Javeed can help to find it), but it's even better to take it before you arrive in Leh.Kang Yatze II is a serious mountain climb that requires mountaineering skills and the right equipment (crampons, gaiters, ice axe, climbing harness and rope). You can rent the gear from Dreamland Trek and Tour, but we advise to carefully check it with Javeed before you go on the hike. Some of the equipment was a little bit worn-out and needs to be renewed. The snow conditions during our hike (early July 2022) required us to cross countless small crevasses, and 2-3 larger ones (>1 metre wide, and many tens of metres deep). Two days before our summit push, two avalanches released on the glacier, cutting straight through the route. So make sure that the mountain guide has crevasse and some avalanche rescue equipment available. The high camp location doesn't exist any more (we heard it was permanently closed), so the summit push now is a 14-hour return hike from the base camp, covering 1200 vertical metres. Bring a good head lamp that lasts through the night. We left the base camp at 23:00, returning just after lunchtime the next day. Standing on top of Kang Yatze II just after sunrise is an incredible feeling that makes the pain worth it!In general, we recommend Dreamland Trek and Tour. It’s a professional company, and they really try to make your trip as enjoyable and memorable as possible."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Matt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun-22,Great experience with excellent support,"Dreamland organised a great tour for us of the Ladakh region. In particular, Javeed and his team went above and beyond by organising the delivery of my delayed luggage to a remote corner of Ladakh without extra charge, which was a huge help. And thanks to Ali, the best driver in Ladakh!"

Everything was perfect: the organitation, the food, the team and, of course, our guide Sonam.We have felt very well attended by all the people working in it. The planinification of the days for a gradually aclimatation to all we had to walk and to the altitud was perfect. The food was very good, variated and in big amount of it.We all have to say is Thanks to all the team (guides, cooker man, helper and ponymen), all of them taking care of us, and thank you very much for celebrating with us that we had reached the summit of the Kant Yatse Peak.So, everything was really excelent . I would recomended to everyone who loves mountains,  who likes knowing people and who wants to feel secure being led by a good guide."

The food was 5 star Passang is the best chef he made pizzas and cakes at 4000mters. Gyalson and Lobzang both are so professional I am talking about our guides and the pony man Ishey in one sentence I want to say they are a perfect team very caring. We highly recommend dreamland trek & tour. 
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Ratul_Neogi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021 • Family,Mesmerizing Ladakh with Dreamland,"Very well organised with attention to detail and positive response to any request. We planned to cover multiple locations in Ladakh over a week. All stay arrangements, travel, passes etc. were organised seamlessly. Dreamland is passionate about Ladakh tourism and it shows in the service provided. We would definitely like to do our next visit to Ladakh with Dreamland and recommend them to friends and family."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Annie P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-20,Excellent Company - Best Snow Leopard Treking Experience,"I recently completed a 12 day trip with Dreamland - 3 days of touring around Leh and surrounding areas and 9 days Snow Leopard trekking.Leh and the monastery tours were amazing, prefect time to visit the area as there are nearly no tourists, of 10 sites visited I only encountered 2 other foreign tourist and 1 Indian tourist.As a single female and wildlife enthusiast, I had booked a 9 day private Snow Leopard trek to Hemis National Park, I was of course a little nervous traveling alone to a remote location. I felt 150% safe and looked after the entire time. The 4 camp staff and my 2 wildlife guides (Gyalson and Stanzin), went out of there way to make this a trip of a life time, they were kind, gentle, knowledgeable and fun people. We saw 4 leopards - a lone female twice, then a mother and 2 juveniles for 7hours!!! We also saw 2 Lynx once and 2 Wolf on at least 3 occasions including a successful hunt of a woolly hare and a very near miss hunting a Blue Sheep. We also also many birds and Pika. The sightings and the stunning scenery was well above my expectations.The trip was very well organised from start to finish, camping equipment was in excellent condition and the food provided was delicious and plentiful. Javeed was incredibly patient answering all my pre trip questions, and I asked a lot!I could not recommend this company and its trekking / wildlife staff highly enough. Do not waste money booking with an international operator, book direct with Dreamland, it is cheaper and the money goes direct to the people of Ladakh and the experience is amazing."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,John M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Winter 2020 Snow Leopard Tour-Hemis National Park,"This is probably the most affordable snow leopard tour you will find in Ladakh, but don’t think you will compromise on other aspects of the experience. I camped out for 5 nights/6 days and it was an unimaginable, unforgettable time. We were given heavy, down sleeping bags that will keep you warm during the -20C nights and a tent that had plenty of room for me. You also have an option for home stay which I didn’t do. There was a heated dining tent that had a wonderful staff of cooks who gave us such a diverse meal plan for three meals a day. I don’t think I had one meal that was the exactly the same. Everything tasted great and they provided plenty of hot beverages and water. Your day typically involves a 0700-0900 morning lookout for snow leopards (of course other animals, too) and then breakfast after. Then you have a choice of going on a couple hikes around the valley, depending on your activity level and interests. You either eat lunch back at the camp or during your hike, if it’s a lengthy one. You will have a porter to take your lunch to wherever you are. There is also a 1330-1800 spotting session at the lookout, or other spots if you want to hike farther and for better views. The guides are so keen on finding the snow leopards that if there is one in range of a spotting scope, they will most likely find it. During my stay, I saw not one, but FOUR snow leopards. One adult female spotted twice the same day and a mother and her two cubs another day. I was allowed to watch the trio for 6 hours, resting in the afternoon sun and then the cubs chasing each other on the mountain. The guides had excellent scopes for you to use and will gladly take pictures and videos through the scope for you (digiscoping). We also found 2 Eurasian lynx, 2 Tibetan wolves, tons of blue sheep, pika, lammergeiers or bearded vultures, golden eagles, Himalayan griffon vultures, woolly hares, etc. You cannot find a better company with the price and experience  than Dreamland Trek and Tour.

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,FedeIke,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,Excellent! Highly Recommended!,"We did the 6 day Markha Valley trek with tents. It was fantastic and the organisation was perfect. Our guide, cook and pony man were excellent. All of them were very friendly and funny and at the same time very professional.Sonam, our guide, always found the best solution to guide us safely during the trek even when we had a challenging day due to the river level which was higher than normal. He always paid attention to our health and he was always available to help his team and other trekkers. Every day Stanzin, our cook, prepared different meals, very tasty and hearty. Always smiling. During the last dinner he left us speechless with his surprise.In addition, we had to change the starting date a couple of times (due to a flu) and Javeed and his team were very understanding and helpful. We highly recommend organising a trek with Dreamland Trek and Tour!"

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,dreamweaverA,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Amazing Experience,We booked dreamland through internet and the communication with Javeed was very swift and to the point. On arrival they picked us up from airport and later we did Rumtse Tsomoriri trek 8 days. It was incredible experience with dreamladakh team. Guide Sonam is so up to date in every sense very knowledgable reagrding budhism and wild life.  Cook lakpa is unbelievable on height of 4500 m he made tuna Pizzas and baked delicious cakes. Over all the food was so good we gained weights.  Whatever I am so happy to recommend dreamland. They are really awesome .
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Tini D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-19,Trekking in Ladakh,"We had a tremendous experience in Ladakh with Dreamland trek and tour. Good communication with manager Javeed. They picked us up from the AirPort in Leh. Arranged transportation to the Phyang-festival. Had a Wonderful 4-day trekking from Spituk to Nehmo. Our guide Rigen could tell a lot about the Himalaya’s and helped us perfectly over Stok-lo pass en Nehmo-lo pass. Our cook Beam made delicious meals in the small tent on the campsites. Equipments for the trekking were well organised. In twee campsites there was a toilet. Be Sire you ask if they can bring a toilettent in case there isn’t one availeble, for on our trekking we were lucky anonther group had one we could use. The day after the trekking they arranged a Wonderful rafting trip on the Zanskar river. When ever you plan to go to Ladakh and want to do activities we surely recommandeer Dreamland trek and tour."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Atzll1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,9 day Snow Leopard trek,"We booked the 8 day Snow Leopard trek and extended it by one day in February 2019. This meant trekking for about 5 days and acclimatizing/transfers for about 4 days.  During the acclimatization period you visit the area and some monasteries which is a nice add-on to the trip. Organization of all activities is spot on and you feel well looked after. However, the absolute highlight was of course the trekking itself in the Rumbakh Valley, which is a beautiful area. We saw two Snow Leopards, a Wolf, four Lynx, a Fox, Lammergeier, Golden Eagle and many other animals/birds. This was all thanks to the very experienced and knowledgeable team of guides who were able to spot the animals under the most challenging conditions. Apart from that they were also very friendly and fun. The rest of the team at the camp also looks after your every need by supplying hot tea and snacks during the treks and during times when we were based at a certain spot for an extended period of time. At the camp cooking was amazing and very  tasty, especially considering the conditions in which the cooks had to prepare the food. Only downside is the cold (in February sometimes at -25c), but that is part of the deal and they do provide warm sleeping bags and warm water bottles. All in all this was a once in a lifetime trip which we will never forget. We wholeheartedly recommend Dreamland to guide on such trip as they looked after our every need and, last but not least, were able to show us the Snow Leopards. "
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Austin B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,"Encouraging, Kind and Safe Guides","I hiked with 2 other friends to the Stok La (Stok Pass) on a 4-day trek. This trek is in Hemis National Park. We camped on our trek but stopped at a few home stays for tea. The entire hike was beautiful. The small villages we passed were pristine Ladakhi settlements. Locals at these villages were extremely kind. Our guides were very affable with locals and helped answer questions we asked of the local people regarding their homes and families.Our guide, Sonam, was extraordinarily kind and helpful. He had a great deal of knowledge to share and explained when and where we could see certain wildlife. The most helpful thing Sonam did for us was to help us descend rapidly on the 2nd night of our trip. We were not acclimatized enough and had severe altitude sickness. Sonam got us down the mountain and into a home stay immediately. He was great to us. Sonam also suggested how we could avoid altitude sickness in the future by completing “baby treks” that would have acclimatized us properly.We had the opportunity to visit some nearby monasteries and have a small bonfire at our home stay in place of the final day of trekking and camping. The trek was incredible and I’m glad we did it even though we had to cut it short. "

I went on the chat room here and found so many good reviews (backed up on other websites) that I decided to book my Snow Leopard Trek with DreamLadakh. communication  from day 1 and on arrival we were met and taken to the offices where we met the team to chat through the plans. From the moment the trek started until we were dropped off at Leh airport afterwards we were looked after so well.It happened to be an uforgettable experience, wow amazing we ended up with sighting snow Leopard two times once with cub, and blue sheeps, wolf, Golden eagel, eagle owl and ofcourse a lynx.   We had a team of 3 - a lovely guide Gyalson, talented cook Stanzin  and jolly horseman Eshey. They were so respectful (we were 2 girls travelling on our own), informative, smiley and hard-working during the 11 day trip we did not want to leave. Nothing was too much trouble. Always greeted with tea & Soups after the treks or at wake up......3 course meals cooked on fire - even cakes were baked! Cannot recommend DreamLadakh enough!!!!!!"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Jared1987,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Incredible time tracking snow leopards in Ladakh,"This was one of the greatest trips I have ever done. Gyalson, Stanzin, and Dhanjus (sorry guys if I butchered the spelling of your names!!) were all amazing guides and made the two of us on the tour feel very comfortable. They always did their best to try and find and point out the different animals for us. We were lucky and ended up seeing four different leopards on our trip - nothing is guaranteed of course, and even if we saw nothing at all, it would've been fantastic. I couldn't be more positive about these three guys - super nice, very patient, and provided any information you needed.      The camp food itself was surprisingly good. I was expecting six or seven days of just chapatis, dal, and potatoes, but it ended up being much more diverse than I expected. And always more than enough to fill you up.      The camp was also very comfortable. I was given a nice pillow, soft padding to sleep on the ground, and really warm sleeping bags. You'll need those sleeping bags, it gets so cold at night.      I really couldn't recommend Dreamland more!"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,menm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Hiking and mountainbiking in Ladakh,We recommend Dreamland for their perfect organisation. We made our own raw plan and Javeed made it better. We walked from Lamayuru to Marka and after that we mountainbiked near the Chines and Pakistan borders. We had an excellent cook Lakpa who came from Nepal and had climbed the Mount Everest for several times. We are a little bit late with filling this in because in fact we visited Ladakh in 2016 but that we could fill in the formular.
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Werner,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Amazing tour through Ladakh (28.07.-14.08.2017),"From the very beginning the trip was perfectly planned and organized. Furthermore, Javeed kept our deposit more than one year because we had problems with our flight-> Many thanks for this Javeed (This is not naturally in these times)!! There was always a very fast response on our questions from dreamladakh.com office. We booked a tour “Extreme Adventure Lamayuru (Trekking-Rafting-Biking 14 Days)”-it was much better than expected. Very various landscapes and activities. We had a perfect guide, cook and horseman. They did everything for us what we never expect to make us a great holiday. At the end of our roundtrip, Javeed booked us a different hotel in Leh as mentioned. The hotel was around 25 minutes one-way walking distance from Leh center away. So Javeed offered a taxi service free of charge from the hotel to Leh center and back. Additionally, Javeed organized a motorcycle for us on the last day. to have an amazing tour to the highest motorable pass of the world 😊. If we come back to Ladakh (and we will someday 😊), we will book our next trip only with Dreamland Trek & Tour! Many thanks and greetings to Javeed and his team."

We experienced a day rafting on the Zanskar river, we did an unforgettable 6-day trekking along the Markha Valley, and finally we visited the Nubra Valley. Overall it was an amazing vacation and Mr. Javeed proved to be extremely professional, reliable, and kind. I remember drinking several lovely honey/lemon/ginger teas at his office while planning for the next trip! I especially recommend the trekking experience to fully immerse yourself in nature and discover breathtaking landscapes (otherwise unreachable). We were just two girls travelling alone in Ladakah, but we felt safe and well taken care of by DreamLadakh super-experienced guides. We walked for days from one monastery to another, crossing freezing rivers, and sleeping in a tent. Walking at high altitude can be extremely tiring sometimes, but I will never forget those Himalayan skies... so blue and incredibly full of stars at night!"

Dreamland Trek & Tour stands head and shoulders above its competitors, so I have used their services repeatedly, both for work and when travelling in Ladakh with family and friends. Javeed and his team are exceptionally professional, not to mention friendly, and their success rate at sporting snow leopards in the winter is unmatched. If you are planning a trip to Ladakh and Zanzibar, book with Dreamland Trek & Tour."

Everything promised was professionally provided. Dreamland's equipment was good, the guides were excellent and the food was of a very high standard. Javeed was easy to communicate with. The expedition was well priced. The transport was prompt and efficient. We found the whole expedition well paced, interesting and challenging. I can easily recommend Javeed and Dreamland Trek and Tour to anyone who is looking for adventure in Ladakh."

After a couple of days acclimatizing in Leh, we started our 6 days trekking from Lamayuru to Chilling with Dreamladakh. Indeed, it has been a dream. Javeed and the rest of Dreamladakh team took care of everything. They have perfectly organized every small detail of the trip, from food to the place to sleep (camping tent in spots with amazing views), from digging the canals aroung the tent when raining to describing us the beauty and customs of their land. The guide, the cook and the horse-man that accompanied us along the way made a very good team with good knowledge of English. We have no doubt in reccomending Dreamladakh (Dreamland Trek and Tour) as organizer of your trek."

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,lizdiscovers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Great trek to Markha Valley; well organised!,"After some online research and talking to friends; we choose for Dreamland for our 8 day trek through the Markha Valley. As a family with 2 children (13 and 16) we were a little nervous about the altitude and the walking distance for our children so we opted to have two extra riding horses for our children, this would give them an option if not well or not wanting to walk anymore. Javeed was very easy to communicate with and we appreciated the rendez vous the day before our trek at the office and to meet our guide, Rik, as well. He joined us to buy a few last minute supplied in Leh, which was very helpful. Rik, with his calm and very patient demeanour, was a great guide. He explained lots about and during the track and ensured we were all drinking lots of water. He also reached a helping hand to other guides and travellers when they needed it; some of the river crossings were more challenging due to the high water levels. Stanzin was a great cook and prepared the most amazing meals for us. The kids loved the pancakes, eggs and the surprises at the end of the track! Our helper brought us wonderful tea to our tent in the morning. The quality of the sleeping tents was very good (the “social/dining” tent could do with a refresh). The only thing we missed was little chairs; other tents seemed to have little chair and tables, we sat on mattresses on the floor for our meals. Which is ok, but got a bit cold at the higher altitudes and problematic when we had rain during one evening.After our trek Rik took us to enjoy the monasteries and Shey Palace before dropping us of at our hotel; a nice way to end our truly amazing experience.I can very happily recommend Dreamland for a trek in the Markha Valley.

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Nadège R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Pass your way there are better options,"We booked a 5-day trekking tour for the Markha valley and were quite disappointed of the services provided. The guide only took us from point A to B every day but did not explain much about the valley despite our many questions. He didn't even know the names of aninals or plants in English despite his 25-year of guiding service! Also he unnecessarily pressed us on the last day repeating we had 5 hours of walk, while we walked a 2 and a half finally. For sure we came back early! Also the lunch provided was merely a snack and I was hungry on Day 3, 4 & 5. The Markha valley can certainly be done on your own for much cheaper!"

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,extremeyus,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Ladhak with Dreamland Trek and Tour,"We did an 8-day Markha valley trek in August 2017 with Dream Ladakh. It was an absolutely fantastic experience. We would normally trek on our own but it was our first trip at high altitude and were not sure about its effects, so wanted to book a guided tour to ensure safety, access to satellite phone, to have horses carry the bags, etc. We booked Dream Ladakh's guided tour in advance and it was a fantastic decision.The Markha valley trek is stunning – an incredible diversity of colours, mountains and rock formations in these desert mountains, but with the rivers in the valleys lined with stunningly bright green fields and tiny villages. While there were other trekkers at the campsites and we occasionally encountered local residents and trekkers on the paths, mostly it was just our group with the mountains and the trail.Gurmet, our guide, was incredibly professional and organized, very friendly and knowledgeable about the mountains, the wildlife, and was very open to ensure the schedule fit our preferences. I cannot imagine a better guide. Stanzin, the cook, made delicious and sumptuous food for every meal. Hearty cooked breakfast, big lunches with freshly baked cakes, and 3-course dinners meant that even after long high-altitude days we kept energy and spirits high. Lopsang and Tashi were extremely friendly and helpful. We were so happy to be with this team not just for their professionalism, but also because of so many great conversations, with Gurmet and Stanzin sharing thoughts on Ladakhi and Indian history, culture and politics, stories and experiences about the mountains, and life in general.  The trip was very well prepared and well equipped, with everything we needed re tents, comfortable sleeping mats, food, etc, as well as safety equipment. Indeed, after spending a night at high altitude, one of the trekkers in another group got quite serious altitude sickness and it was Gurmet (our guide) who went to check on him, provide medicine and ensure he got help. Each day was very well planned and we camped in beautiful locations, usually beside mountain streams which were refreshing to paddle and wash in after a day of hiking.We were so pleased with our trek that on returning to Leh, we also booked a day of white water rafting and a 2-day trip to Turtuk with Dream Ladakh. Everyone in their office is extremely helpful and friendly. For example they helped us out with access to internet when there was a Leh-wide outage and we needed to contact someone back home. Javeed, the owner, was extremely helpful as we were planning and booking the trip."

Wowwww the landscapes  the lakes and the nomadic  settlements  breath taking I can't express in words  that  how complete was this trek. I will highly recommend dreamladakh.

Unimaginable landscapes, impossible to describe, a journey full of emotions! Special thanks to the best driver of all the Ladakh, our great Norboo.

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Javeed I,,,,"Management initially over charged us by £40. They then insisted on cash payment and were aggressive and abusive when we explained we didn't carry £200 cash so could we pay by card. Our guide was friendly and had good English, but lacked knowledge of the sights and failed to provide what we had requested, showing us monasteries rather than taking us on half day hikes."
,,,,,"The main issue was that they didnt wanted to pay the waiting charge for the taxi, since we booked the taxi for them they will always bill us for waiting in any case. As per Taxi Union Guide lines when the came to know about waiting charge they were very reluctant, on the otherhand we cannot do any trip in minus.

,,,,,"The main issue was that they didnt wanted to pay the waiting charge for the taxi, since we booked the taxi for them they will always bill us for waiting in any case. As per Taxi Union Guide lines when the came to know about waiting charge they were very reluctant, on the otherhand we cannot do any trip in minus.

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Jim T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Travelling to Ladakh!,"Thank you for organizing such a wonderful trip for us to beautiful Ladakh. We were so impressed with how smooth everything was run throughout our trip. Ladakh is a wonderful place and using a local company with such good local knowledge was definitely the correct choice. Gurmeet was an excellent guide throughout, he was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The camp was brilliant and the food fantastic. All credit to the cooks for creating such amazing food in those trying conditions. We enjoyed the wildlife viewing and the trekking but we both felt that more days exploring the various valleys in the area would have made it even better. I understand that the emphasis was to spot a snow leopard but it felt sometimes like this was too the detriment of the other possible species. Stanzin was very knowledgeable and could spot all types of wildlife but for 2 days we were essentially exploring the valleys alone while he concentrated solely on the snow leopard.  It is a minor thing in a great experience so thanks again to you and your team"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Icedancer83,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Awsome Trek to Nubra valley,"An amazing unique experience enhanced by a friendly, caring and multi-talented staff. Our wonderful guide, Pema made the trek to our needs and desires. Perfect organization all the way through, even in the smallest, kindest details (Hot lunch after a hard day!). We only had to walk, all the rest was taken care of! Exceptional sites, landscapes and views. Great memories for the year to come! A first, unique trekking experience, 1st time in the Himalayas, We loved it! Hard enough to fully appreciate it, but smooth enough to only remember. Great times! Thank you for everything."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Niels Peter A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb-18,Trekking in Hemis National Park,"This trekking in Rumbak Valley arranged by Javeed Iqbal and his excellent guides was breathtaking. Several Snow Leopards were spotted, Wolf and Lynx. Good equipment, sleeping bags, tents, and very tasty food. Our group of 7 can give our best recommendations to Dreamland Trek and Tour"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Leif S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,A professional and serious company,Wow! We saw six Snow Leopards and a lot of other nature goodies! Our 11-day Snow Leopard tour was a great succes thanks to our guides and Dreamland's organisation of the tour. Making such a tour under difficult conditions demands experience and thinking - this is what Dreamland can offer you. As a former tour guide I can say that Dreamland has a high quality service. You will not find it better if you want to go for the ultimate nature experience in Ladakh.
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,keepmoving48,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug-17,Fantastic trek from Lamayuru to Stok Kangri August 2017,"Dreamland Trek and Tour arranged our wonderful 12 day trek from Lamayuru to Stok Kangri this past August. We were a group of 8 and I was in charge of finding a local company to guide us. I was a bit nervous about making arrangements for such a trip for so many people and from so far away. Javeed’s prompt and thorough responses to my emails throughout the preceding months helped put my mind at ease. From our first meeting in Leh, I knew I had made a good decision to go with Dreamland Trek and Tour. After a few days of acclimatizing in Leh we were ready to begin our trek. Rigzen (our lead guide) and the team were so kind, hard working, helpful and always smiling. Everything went smoothly, lots of food at mealtime, flawless resupplies and transportation from starting and ending points. There were long days of hiking and numerous swollen rivers to cross but our guides were never without a smile and humble graciousness. Rigzen taught us so much about Ladakhi culture, Indian history and the surrounding mountains. I have nothing but fond memories of this trip to Ladakh and can’t thank Javeed and his group enough."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,yipsh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Chader Ice trek - January 2018,"Spent almost two weeks doing Chader Ice Trek organised by Dreamland Trek and Tour on my own recently in January. Dreamland provided me with a guide, cook and 3 porters to take care of me on this trek. Logistics was well organised. The guide was very experienced and professional and ensure that i was safe throughout the trip. The cook provided simple but very tasty hot meals. The porters worked hard to ferry all the gear during the trek and helped to ensure that I was safe when we had to rock climb a short section of the route on the return journey.I would highly recommend Dreamland to others who are thinking of doing this wonderful trek through a dramatic part of India. The winter scenery is indeed very beautiful. The hike up to the settlement of Lingshed was especially beautiful amidst steep canyons and majestic winter mountain scenery. A good down jacket, winter pants, gloves and a 4-season sleeping bag are needed to keep warm but I had excellent winter weather throughout the trip and took many photos. The chader ice trek is indeed a very unique trek and you need to do it to fully appreciate the wonderful creation of nature"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,J0annaWarszawa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,10 days in Ladakh - Zanskar trekking + sights of Leh - 2009,"I spent around 10 days with Dream Ladakh, some 8 years ago. I was there with 2 friends in April, just before the tourist season actually started. It was one of the best trips I ever had. Our plan was a week-long trekking tour in the Zanskar valley, but Javeed and his colleagues made sure that we planned enough time beforehand to acclimatise and that we are prepared for the adventure - equipment, health and all. Dream Ladakh took care of us right from the moment we signed up for the trip, starting from sending us a list of items and clothes we were supposed to take from home. They organised us a tour of the monasteries in the area of Leh and gave us tips about other things we could see and do. In Leh we stayed at a family-run inn also booked for us by Javeed. The family was very nice and helpful in our first days there. During the trek we had 2 companions - a guide and a cook cum quartermaster, both excellent professionals, very friendly and fun to talk and be with. They took care to adapt the day route to our physical condition, made sure we got enough rest and ate properly along the way. The area and the views left us speechless at times, I did not know such places even existed. I hope to get back there one day and if I do, I will surely join our Dream Ladakh friends again."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Rowan S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Superb Trip!!,"I spent 12 days with Dreamland Trek and Tour with my 3 teenage children. During that time we did a package of trekking, cycling and white water-rafting. The owners of the business Javeed and Parviz were very professional and honest.All aspects of the bookings were exactly as described and huge fun.  It was a big fear that making a booking from Australia and travelling with teenagers that the holiday may have complications but everything ran smoothly.We plan to go back!"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Mar G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Wonderful experience with Dreamladack,"Dear Javed and team from Dreamladakh, our 3 weeks in India passed very rapidly and now we are back in Spain and Germany, but we still have very good memories of our journey. We want to thank you for the good organization and planning of our trip: The days in Delhi and Agra,the excursions in Ladakh-- the monastries, Nubra valley, Pangong lake-- and especially our trekking tour in the Markha valley were amazing. We want to mention your very helpful and friendly office team which could solve all problems from internet, equipment and  not working pant zippers. During our trekking tour our guide Padma showed us the the beauty of the landscape perfectly and the cook prepared amazing meals--we did not know that vegetarian meals could be so delicious!!! The tea in the morning and the warm water in the washing bowls activated our spirits at once, even in 4700m hight. Moreover the Hotel Ladakh Retreat in Leh, the Ashok Resort Hotel in Delhi and the the Mansingh Palace Hotel in Agra were a good choice and the stuff very nice and helpful."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,jonhubb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Amazing Snow Leopard tour in Rumbak Valley,"I would highly recommend Javeed and his team for tours in Ladakh.  They were well organised, provided great meals and tried to make us as comfortable as possible in some tough conditions.  Javeed's communication before the tour was excellent and I would definitely use again. Also we were lucky enough to see a snow leopard (aswell as loads of other wildlife), which was amazing.  The tour was as described with no unexpected unpleasant surprises.We did the snow leopard tour with camping.  Being from the UK if possible we prefer to book directly with the country that we travel to so we know that the money is going to a local company rather than a UK company. However , it can nerve racking paying large amounts to a unknown company.  We found Dreamland trek and tour through internet searches and comparing reviews and contacting Javeed.  As mentioned his communication prior to the trip was excellent even considering time differences.  The tour itself was in the Rumbak valley and surrounds where we camped for 7 nights near the Rumbak village.  We went beginning of January so the conditions were very cold and the altitude was tough.  However, Javeed's team tried to make you comfortable as possible.  We had a tent for two and a mess tent (with gas heater, lighting and plugs to charge things) for dinners.  We were provided with sleeping bags (which were actually very cosy at -15C), sleeping mats and pillows. We were in the middle of the Himalayas in a remote area so I think they did just great.  The food they provide is varied, big quantities and wholesome.  It always amazed me how you can be up a mountain and they still proved such such great food.  On the days we went hiking down different valleys the porters brought the lunch along.  The trek itself was great.  there was loads of exciting wildlife to see and the landscapes are breathtaking. Our head guide Gyalson had a huge amount of knowledge and it was him who saw the snow leopard on our 3rd days.  We only saw one snow leopard and it was quite far away but it was amazing to see.  We also saw wolves and much more.  Things I learnt from this tour were: I need better thermal gloves and walking boots (it gets very cold) and I need better binoculars and camera (the valleys are vast, up to 1-2km across and the mountains go on and on and snow leopards are like needles in haystacks)"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Stinkyrules,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,They took amazing care of us...!,"My wife and I took a wonderful trek with Dreamland a few years ago and were truly impressed with the level of service and care they provided us.  At times during the hike my wife or I would experience some challenges related to the altitude but our guide and porters were always their to support us and assist us in completing our trek.  I've trekked in a number of parts of the world and I can honestly state that Dreamland were exceptional in guiding us to a successful completion.  Also note that the food they provided us was awesome.  When you're in the mountains and low on energy, eating and drinking is critical to having a successful trek.  I strongly recommend Dreamland for your next trek in Ladakh!"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Jaap d,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Trekking again with Dreamland,"In 2009 I did the Markha Valley Tour with 8 people (4 adults and 4 children) and we had a wonderful experience. Excellent information from the owner, very helpful guides, good materials, fine cooks and strong horses. This summer (2018) I am going back and will do the Lamayuru-Hemis trek with 7 friends. Yaveed, the owner is helping us greatfully with all the organisation of getting there and being there. I strongly recommend Dreamland Trek & Tour"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,EricSwiz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,An Unforgettable experience with Dreamladakh ,"It was an amazing winter in Ladakh, amazing in the sense that my dream of seeing a Snow Leopard came true. In Feb 2016 we hired dreamladakh for this trip including me we were five. From day one we felt that we are in safe hand and the trek was amazing Gyalson the lead guide was experienced, from his every day briefing I could imagine that he has vast knowledge about wildlife in Ladakh, beside that the cook was awsome, I can’t imagine that he can cook so many varieties in that climate, more importantly whole crew was supportive and friendly.For the first 4 days of the trek we just saw older and fresh foot prints of the Leopard, and with each passing movement my wish to the Snow Leopard was slowly dying, though with his best efforts Gyalson was also looking grim. Suddenly around 11:00 am we had an unbelievable news, Stanzin was running towards us he was sent by Dreamladakh owner Mr Javeed. Stanzin told us that there is a Kill at Matho Vaillge, that means the Leopard won’t be moving away from the kill atleast for a couple of days. Matho Village approximately 50 kms from Rumbak. Gyalson said, “look guys we have to move as soon as possible , and we won’t have to waste any time in packing our team will pack everything and will bring to Matho, so without waiting for our equipment we just took our cameras and spotting scopes and rushed to Matho Village along with Gyalson the driver and 5 of us.After the motorable road we walk for half an hour than suddenly my life time dream came true, Yes it was truly a Snow Leopard with a long tail feeding on a Blue sheep. Could you believe we kept on seeing this single leopard for complete two and half days, eating, sleeping and threatening the birds coming near his kill. I will highly recommend dreamladakh & Gyalson, WE MADE IT just because of their  efforts."

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Haley89,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Unforgettable Ladakh trip !!!!!!!,"We had the opportunity to use Dreamland Trek & Tour during a month in Ladakh. Javeed and his staff were most helpful. We organized our tour over the internet due to recommendations from friends. Javeed met us at the airport and ensured we were well looked after throughout our trip including accommodation, guides, tour drivers, pony boys - in fact the lot! We did change our trekking schedule and Javeed met the challenge, was flexible, and as a result we also squeezed in a trip across Khardung La into the Nubra Valley after our trip up the Markha and into Rupshu. We enjoyed Leh, our trek and sightseeing journeys to a very interesting land with many excellent gompa's combined with a rich cultural heritage. Dreamland kept us well physically as we went to altitude and we were pleased with their approach to the environment in Ladahk. We found Javeed and his staff to be friendly and helpful throughout. There are many tour operators in Leh, but Dreamland stands out as a professional, honest, competent and well run company."

They had all the facilities to make my travel comfortable, fun and economical. Their staff is super nice and helpful. They were prompt to arrange and plan the 5 day- long trek I did to Markha Valley along with great guides and back-up. Their hospitality was overwhelming. I want to be back in Ladakh soon and will definitely choose them as my tour planners again."

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Sujoy D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Efficient and Professional Tour and Trek Outfit in Ladakh,If you go to Leh you will be inundated by the large number of trekking and tour outfits in the city. Amongst this mileu stands out Dreamland Trek and Tour. Manned by a team of efficient professionals and equally competent guides they provide a one stop service for all your Ladakh activities. Whether it is trekking or day tours or monastery visits or peak climbing Dreamland can cater to all your needs and more. I have been associated with them for many years now and have the highest regard for their capabiity and honesty. Highly recommended.

Dreamland_Trek_Tour,gibbsrs2003,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Outstanding trek through this beautiful and fascinating region of the world!,"We had no prior experience in this part of the world, but wanted to explore and learn about it firsthand after visiting other regions of the Himalayas. We conducted a lot of research on good companies to hire as trekking guides, and finally decided on Dreamland. We weren't disappointed. We let them our primary interest areas, and they designed the trek that best fit our goals. The communication prior to us leaving for India was excellent and prompt, and once in Ladakh the staff was very helpful. Once on the trek, the guide was extremely knowledgeable, patient, made sure that we were able to see everything that the our trek offered. All around, excellent trip and adventure. We highly recommend Dreamland for both first time visitors as well as return trekkers."
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Birgit B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Markha-Valley-Trek with Stok Kangri 2017,"I found Dreamland Trek and Tour via Internet. It was the most professionel site. To organize the trek with Javeed was very nice and uncomplicated. Everything was perfect. They picked us up on the airport, drived with us to the office of Dreamland and later to the hotel. Our team on the trek was the best!!! Gyalson is the best guide ever! He told us a lot about Ladakh, the nature, the people and he showed us many animals... Lobsang spoiled us with very good food. Mingma, our climbing sherpa, worked very hard to bring us to the summit. There was a lot of soft snow. It was not important for us to reach Stok Kangri, but we did it. And also the ponyman was very kind. We had a lot of fun on the trek. I really recommend this trekking agency!!! And many, many thanks for an unforgettable trip!!"
Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Ang T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Couples,Stok Kangri June 2017,"Contacted Dreamland Trek and Tour through email and they were very helpful and prompt in their responses. Decided to do the Stok Kangri trek and was provided with all the necessary arrangements weeks before we arrived in Leh.Met Javeed in Leh and was briefed on the trek. Cut a long story short, company is professionally run and all pre-trip preparations were taken care of. During the trek, guides went all out to make sure we meet the objective of the trek without compromising on the safety of ALL. Even to the extent of re-routing our initial trekking route and spending an additional night in HIS home.Submitted Stok Kangri and decided to do rafting with Dreamland at Zanskar river. Javeed is generous with his advice without being pushy and  certainly no hard-selling here. If you are going to Leh for some outdoor activities, give them a call."
