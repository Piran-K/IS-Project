3,Basgo_Monastry,Prasanna N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Serene historical monument,"The Basgo monastry is located at Nimu village about 32 KMs from Leh City towards Kargil. The place is situated on a hillock 2 Kms off the National Highway 1. Though a plethora of monastries exist in Leh the crowd which swarms them during peak tourist seasons kills the charm that exists in these historical sites. The Basgo monastry is an exception to the class commercialisation of Buddhist workshop places. The monastry encompasses Three Temple's one each for Lord Maitreya, Serzang and Cham Chung. They are believed to be various incarnations of Lord Buddha. The ruins of Cham Chung Temple and the serenity and cleanliness of the Basgo temple premises portrays the necessary evil that Tourism and publicity is for these ancient monuments. The temple is a must see for the shutter bugs as it presents a panoramic view of Nimu village. The NH 1 winding up the road is another image which can be clicked a million times.This temple is not on the popular tourist routes. To locate it one needs to start moving towards the road leading to Kargil.  An enquiry with any localite of Village Nimu is the right way to locate it. The route to the temple is narrow and winding up a hillock. So the driver needs to be extremely cautious. "

It lies at a distance of 42 km west of Leh and is on the way towards Sham valley and Lamayuru on the Leh-Srinagar National Highway.

It is a Buddhist monastery located in Basgo or Bazgo in Leh District,Ladakh approximately 40 km from Leh.Although the monastery was built for the Namgyal rulers in 1680, Bazgo itself was embedded in the early days of Ladakh and is frequently mentioned in the Ladakhi Chronicles when it was a political and cultural center.In the 15th century, a palace was built in Basgo.The monastery is situated on top of the hill towering over the ruins of the ancient town and is noted for its Buddha statue and murals.

4,Basgo_Monastry,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Ancient monastery on a hillock,"During our trip to Leh, we had visited this ancient monastery located on a hillock near the Leh Srinagar highway. There were only few more tourists other than us. From the parking lot, we first walked on a hilly road and then climbed a flight of steep steps to reach the top. Entrance tickets were priced at 30 rupees per person. We saw a beautiful giant idol of Maitreya Buddha and found that devotees had offered biscuits, juices, Coca-Cola to the Lord. The paintings on the inner walls were still clearly visible and beautiful. Also the view from this place of the surrounding mountain landscape was just mesmerizing."

Just looking down the surrounding, one can wonder the age of the monuments, some natural others carved out. The monastery is standing precariously on cliffs some 300 meters above the ground. When I reached there, no other tourist or believer was there. I and my driver, only two persons were there to admire the delicate ancient monument. Even for reaching there the driver of my taxi had to ask some villagers about the way leading to the monastery. "

Luckely , the three temples were opened for us by the guard, and we had a wide angle multi-led power torch to see and appreciate the many wall paintings. Interesting was that they had not tried to repair the paintings when damaged, but left them blank, instead of making a poor quality as seen in other temples.The old castle is in ruins, but as such the buildings are still very impressive, especially with the very large Bouddha inside."

Quite different from the others and much older. The logic of monasteries being on hilltops comes from the fact that the rising sun hit them first!!"

7,Basgo_Monastry,lotusdiamond,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Skippable-not worth visit.,On the way to Alchi monastery from Leh just after crossing confluence/sangam of Indus-Zanskar river. Very small village full of greenery. In case you are in hurry you may just skipped this place. Else you may like to take quick stop and can take a break.

9,Basgo_Monastry,Kaneth25341,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Friends,Beautiful to stop by and take photos,"Basgo Monastery is located on the route towards Alchi monastery from Leh just after you pass the confluence of Indus and Zanskar river. The town is rather a small piece of land surrounded by mountains. You can take nice photos from the road going up the hill. This would be a nice place for a quick stop but otherwise skippable. The is a small fee (maybe 15rupees each) to enter the inner area, the praying/buddha rooms are small and dark then I don't even want to take photos."

Also, enjoy the view, and the peaceful atmosphere."

And try to visit his movie locations. Basgo was spectacular for photography. It was deserted when we visited and my friend and me spent almost 3 hours exploring every nook and corner. It has texts written in gold to a 500 year old temple which had very powerful energy and wall paintings. For the traveler who likes a road less traveled, this is a must see destination"

6,Basgo_Monastry,minre,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,"Not to be missed attraction, which it seems most people just pass by.","Not just a monastery, but it was a former palace too. Its hard to judge what kind a of place it is from the main road. Its only when you cross the last curve just before the parking lot that the true extent of the whole campus on the hill top becomes apparent. Built on top of a mud hill, the mostly ruins are a breathtaking site."

The structure looks just on ""Top of the World"" from a distance as it is located on top of  the mountain. Basgo Gompa is smaller than Lamayuru Gompa in its grandeur and popularity. This is primarily maintained by the local inhabitants. We could not go to the top of the monastery as it is too high and we did not want to exert too much on our day 2 in Ladakh!!!"

1,Basgo_Monastry,Elvor,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,15th century monastary with frescos,"Basgo Monastary is a 15th century monastery in the midst of the rugged Himalayas. It is not for the faint of heart. We had to take several breaks all the way up to the monastery (and we are 40 years young!). At times we thought we can't go one step further without our heart popping out. But we made it and I am so glad that we did. The views all the way up are awesome. The huge Budhha statue is one of its kind. There is a sense of serenity and spiritualism in the monastery. The frescos inside the monastery tell a story. Be sure to ask the monk about it. There is a fee per person that you have to pay for your visit which shouldn't be a big deal. After all, seasonal tourists are the only livelihood of the monks.    "
2,Basgo_Monastry,MakCha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Solo,Eerie,"Basgo monastery was chosen as one of the 100 most endangered sites by UNESCO in 2001 and its not a wonder why. The monastery is sited on crumbly mud mountains ravaged by rain; am sure much of the monastery has been washed down the Indus. Be that as it may, whatever remains is worth a visit. The couple of temples one can visit house Maitreya Buddhas (also known as Chamba in Ladakh). I remember two exquisite thankas in the temple with the massive Maitreya; sadly there wasn't enough light in the temple for photographs. The whole setting was pretty eerie in the fading evening light amidst a whistling dust storm."
3,Basgo_Monastry,vinodkhedkar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Solo,Beautiful View,This is monastery located in Basgo village. Endangered heritage site declared by UNESCO is maintained by archaeological society of India and local villagers. Serene place located on the hills offers scenic view of a surrounding area.

4,Basgo_Monastry,SomnathSarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,A Fragile History Capsule,"The monastery (once part of a fort complex), built of clay and stone, is 40 kms from Leh. Enlisted among World's 100 most endangered heritage sites by the US World Monument Fund, this is a must see. The complex was once part of the famous castle of Basgo Rabrtans Lharise Khar, but all that now remain are three diff Maitreya Buddha temples. The first temple on the right is the Chamba Maitreya temple (1450-90), housing a large Buddha idol of clay reinforced with discarded cotton shreds and paper. and of course delicate fresco paintings. This temple is maintained by the Hemis monastery. The 2nd temple in the middle is the Serzang temple (1600-22), consisting a copper-gold large Maitreya Buddha idol. This temple is owned by the Basgo village, its conservation being undertaken by the Basgo Welfare Committee, which was awarded the UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Award of Excellence in 2007. The 3rd temple to the right is the Cham Chum temple (1600-15), built by a Muslim Balti princess to offer her namaz, but later converted into a Buddhist temple when she converted to Buddhism. This small shrine is in a state of decay, with the inner walls containing wonderful frescoes showing cracks. Local volunteers are trying to preserve this structure under the aegis of the Tibetan Classics Translator Guild, New York, USA.The 1st and the 3rd temples offer beautiful views of the fort complex and the surrounding mountain and village. The temple complex is a bit of a maze, and one can lose his way and descend to the nearby village, if not mindful. Entry fees are charged at the 1st and the 2nd temple.Vehicles reach the gate of the complex, and it is not much of a climb around. Will take around an hour to visit. There is a basic waterless toilet arrangement for both the sexes at the parking lot."

6,Basgo_Monastry,ptrav9,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Friends,Surreal,"About an hour from Leh and 40 minutes from Alchi, Basgo is a couple of clicks from the Srinagar Leh highway. Basgo used to be the capital of Ladakh afew centuries back. There are three temples bunched together close to the castle/palace ruins. There was some work happening on the topmost temple and entry could be limited. It should not deter you from a visit. Basgo makes for a quick detour from the highway and can be done in less than an hours time. The highlight of the visit to little Basgo is the surreal castle ruins strategically perched on a steep hill. The temples do require some steep climbing and is not wheel chair friendly."
7,Basgo_Monastry,KaiT1972,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015,great view,the beautiful trip uphill starts with the climbing- every few steps you'll enjoy a new view. the old ruin and the monastery aren't that impressive but more than adequate to watch. We were here short before sunset and the light was amazing. A young monk invited us for a tea and showed us the huge statue of maitreya buddha inside the temple. We were the only tourists at this time and the surruondings were full of atmosphere

9,Basgo_Monastry,karthik_akrishnan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,An Average Monastery,This was the first monastery visited by me in my visit to Leh.

3,Basgo_Monastry,Indie-Brindie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Couples,Unique clay-built ruined monastery.,"Looking like something from a film set, this place is well worth the £15 taxi ride out here. (Combine it with the confluence of the Zanskar / Indus rivers & the ridiculous 'magnetic hill' and it's cheap at half the price. ) it's extremely photogenic perched atop a rocky atoll overlooking the valley below. The ruins are not unlike those West African mud brick buildings in Timbuctou. It's very different to the other gompas out here in Ladakh. Don't miss it!"
4,Basgo_Monastry,smurg,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Couples,Unusual ruined monastery,"Looking like something out od a film set, this is worth visiting if you are keen on monasteries that are not tin the usual whitewashed mould. Although Basgo is mainly in ruins it is striking ,made of  mud and looks like giant anthills rising from the ground . If visiting in summer, make sure you apply plenty of sunscream-it is extremely hot and exposed."

1,Basgo_Monastry,rexie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2013 • Couples,See this while you can,"The Basgo mud-brick structures are in a terrible state.  They stand imposingly on a hill above the Indus and contain some exquisite statues and paintings.

3,Basgo_Monastry,jenabaintheworld,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 • Solo,try to see this monastery,Really enjoyed Basgo--- and fairly close to  Leh with a group of other Gompas.    Worth the trip!   Each monastery offers different views/focus/art.

5,Basgo_Monastry,Angshu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2012 • Couples,Beautiful in late evening light,"The Fort is in ruins, but from the main road below the ruined fort presents great photo opportunity. The road up towards the fort rises quite steeply & crosses a stream as well. It is a good idea to go to Basgo in the evening. Walk up the last stretch as the sun paints the fort in golden colours & you will be rewarded with an amazing spectacle as the low light of the sun falls on the mud-brick fortress ruins. Once again a steep walk up the stairs to the ruined monastery Chamba Lhakhan. You would be lucky to get the monk to open the door of the temples for you. In the walls & ceiling of the monastery are magnificent original wall paintings, similar to those in Alchi. Light is very low, but the details can be seen.Climb down to the second temple called Serzing Lhakhang which is slightly older and smaller than the Chamba Lahakhang. It is very dark inside. This temple has a huge statue of Buddha which is so big, the head is hidden by the upper story of the temple. Unfortunately one cannot climb to the topOne of the best places to visit in Ladakh for the culturally & photographically oriented. Virtually no tourists and so you can soak in the beauty all by yourselves. Strongly Recommended."
