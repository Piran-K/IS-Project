2,Central_Asian_Museum,royjay2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,A Look-Back At History,"This tapered four-storey stone tower is a modern construction in the centre of the Leh Main Market and is based on a historic Lhasa mansion.  The museum hides in a courtyard that also contains Leh's oldest mosque and a traditionally styled Ladakhi show-kitchen where you can order lunch. The museum looks at Leh's role in Silk Road trade, with rooms focused on Ladakh, Chinese Turkestan and Tibet."

6,Central_Asian_Museum,nikhanjs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Our link with Central Asia,"Sometimes we proud of our Central Asian ancestry but know little about. This a place at the heart of Leh town and easy to visit if you are at Leh. You can learn how hard at past to travel from central and how we are drifting apart by modern border of India, China and Pakistan. One can learn about life of these areas and get inspiration how to build an Institution by a retired Ancestry searcher, NGO worker like Din Khan. "
