0,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,claire c,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Museum and Gompa,Excellent unexpectedly so was the visit here. We savoured a  cup of tea and looked at kitchen artifacts well preserved and displayed. the view was amazing.It was special to see photos and information about the missing Panchen Lama on display. It has been restored by many dedicated people volunteering here in the past. So all this makes it quite special amongst the gompas and monasteries of Ladakh. The very friendly atmosphere and kindness of monk attending to us also made it worth the trip

1,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,infoaddict,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,May be Worth A Visit,"Only got to see this stunning monastery complex from the road on the way to Pangong Tso. But it looked interesting.If you have your own transport then may be worth looking at it, as it's definitely one of the less visited places."

4,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,huys25,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,"Also called Chemday Gompa. Beautiful construction, great museum in the top floor","We had an overnight stop coming back from Pangong Tso and Nubra valley. Already from a distance this monastery complex can compete with the most famous monasteries in Leh valley. We were allowed to make pictures here.After exploring the many corridors, stairs, patio's and three temples, one of the monk asked us if we had seen the museum.The museum is on the top floor, and one of the best and complete in Ladakh region. The entry fee was Rs 50/ per person, but no photo's were allowed here."
5,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,Clayhaus,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,"Saw only from afar, but still 4 stars","Upon our return from the Nubra Valley region I would have loved to stop and visit this scenic-looking monastery (well, OK: almost all of the Ladakhi monasteries are scenic-looking!), but we didn't have the time. Nonetheless, we did halt for a couple of photographs and that in and of itself is worth 4 stars. Try to catch it in the afternoon when the light is upon it."

7,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,lotusdiamond,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Chemre Gompa,Located at isolated place of Leh. Monastery is nothing different from other monasteries. Under renovation/construction till June 2016. Can be avoided if you are short of time and visited most of other monasteries of Leh. Located on the hilltop as other monasteries.
8,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,itinerarirasta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Friends,Most mysterious,"Chemrey or Chemdey as it is called locally, seems uninhabited; or rather its not active like Hemis. But it is really beautiful and I liked it best. Very scenic views, and isolated feel that the monasteries of bygone days must have had. "

Unfortunately it was not hat restaurated and many parts were under construction. But really worth to see.

3,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,AkashRoonwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Monastery! Peace!,The gompa is located at 40 kms from Leh. Estd in 1664. Very peaceful & calm.Provides an insight of the rich culture!
4,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,PROF.HARAGOPAL MATHSYARAJA,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Solo,MUST VISIT,"This beautiful and scenic monastery on the top of a hillock, just away from the main Leh - Pangong lake road at Sakti village must be seen for its architecture."
5,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,SomnathSarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,Honest Monks,"The gompa is 40 kms from Leh. Estd in 1664, the gompa is run by the Nyingma pa. Situated on a hillock, it has a honey comb appearance from a distance. Inside, there are several floors, so one should be prepared for climbing some steps and carry a bottle of water. Inside there is a 300 yr old statue of Vajraguru Padmasambhav, some exquisite frescoes, strange potted plants, a small but very rich Tantric museum. The museum's  chief draws are ancient parchments in both Sanskrit and Tibetan, damru made of human cranial bones and yak skin, ancient weapons and cooking utensils. There was a huge skeletal head of an ibex, the biggest I saw in Ladakh. But the jewels were the young monks on the top floor. One young monk was experienced in Tantric practices. I exchanged some experiences in meditation with him, to my full satisfaction. We had dropped a bag containing INR 40k, realised our error after 2 hours, and barely had our vehicle been parked, when a monk called us out from the top floor. He said he had opened the bag in search of some mobile phone or phone number, but finding none, he had kept the bag in his safe custody. We plain land dwellers cannot easily imagine such honesty. A truly humbling experience in front of such true hermits."
6,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,Yat123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Couples,Simple and Pure,The museum over here is real good. But it is bit interior and placed in a village side and you will get a wonderful view to see lush green village from top of the  monastry.
7,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,DipakJivnani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Solo,Beautiful village & mountains view,"While our return from Pangong lake, we visited this monastery on the way.

3,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,Indie-Brindie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Couples,Stunning location atop a rocky outcrop,We took this in on our return by taxi from the Markha valley trek. It was wonderfully picturesque. The approach road winds round and round until you finally arrive at the top. Once there the monastery is interesting to explore with stunning roof-top views of the surrounding valley and the mountains that we had recently trekked through. There is also an interesting museum with an impressive haul of artifacts. This is arguably the best monastery around Leh so well worth a visit.
4,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,smurg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Family,Scenic and worth taking in on your way back to Leh after the Markha Valley Trek,"This is a stunning monastery, set high on a hill, with an interesting museum full of Buddhist treasures.You alo get views over to the mountains from the roof tops. My only suggestion is that  the monks might wish to consider offering a short tour /talk about the artefacts in the museum. Everything looked interesting and was labelled in English but it would have been more informative to have had things explained to us."
5,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,Vikas Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 • Solo,Chemrey Monastery,"Chemrey Monastery is a  Buddhist monastery, of the Drugpa monastic order and was founded by the Lama Tagsang Raschen and dedicated to King Sengge Namgyal in 1664, It is located around 40 kms from Leh.

9,Chemre_Gompa_Monastery,SandeepSaxena-IIP,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,beautiful,"he famous Monastero Chemre Gompa can be seen from the intersection of Chang La and “Pangong Tso”. The barley fields along its way are breathtaking beauties, surely not to be missed. Photography enthusiasts and nature lovers throng this place throughout the year. The foreground of the monastery has rapeseed fields, which give it a pristine yellow hue against the white stupas. The slopes to the monastery are steep, perfect for those who would like to go mountaineering or trekking. It is said that the Monastero Chemre Gompa was built around the 17th century by the “Red Hats” who took inspiration from Hemis. Hemis till date considers the Monastero Chemre Gompa as its branch.If you have the energy to climb the steps to this Gompa, then you must. It is a fascinating place to visit and the views from up there are amazing. Bring lot's of water as you will need it."
