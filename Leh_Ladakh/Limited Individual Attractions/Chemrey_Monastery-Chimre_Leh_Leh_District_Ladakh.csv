0,Chemrey_Monastery-Chimre,claire c,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,"Chemre, Chemrey or Chemday Monastery and Museum","This Gompa, monastery and small museum has different names so may also be under other listings. This was quite  a surprise to find this small museum showing ancient kitchen utensils. Teapots etc. We sat on beautiful Tibetan rugs and had a cup of tea whilst admiring these treasures.The monk was very friendly and helpful.It was also good to see information about the Panchen Lama on display, acknowledging his disappearance. There was also information about the restoration of the monastery on display.It was the usual climb up steps and through doors to view and pay homage to the founders of this monastery.The views are, as always brilliant.The artwork in the Thangka paintings in the gompa and the frescoes are  as always in Ladakh, stunning."
