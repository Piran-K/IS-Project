4,Chokhang_Vihara_Temple,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 â€¢ Couples,Peaceful ambience amidst noisy market,This Buddhist temple is located in the main market area in Leh. We had visited this temple during our trip to Leh. We liked the traditional Tibetan architecture of the temple and inside the ambience was very peaceful - we sat on the carpet and meditated in peace for sometime. We liked the beautifully decorated big idol of Lord Buddha and the thanga paintings hanging from the walls showcasing events from the Lord's life and his teachings. This can be visited for a quick stopover to escape from the hustle of Leh market.
5,Chokhang_Vihara_Temple,Gavin R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 â€¢ Family,A  little gem in the market,This will not be on most people itineraries and I found this by accident while looking at for a loo in the local market. Chokhang Vihara Temple is located bang in the middle of the market opposite the SBI branch and I was pleasantly happy to have stumbled upon it. I think all travellers should visit it as it is so central and easy to include in ones itinerary.

9,Chokhang_Vihara_Temple,Nick B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 â€¢ Solo,Peaceful,A really peaceful place to visit whilst you are in Leh - either to take in Buddhist culture or to pray yourself. If you are lucky your visit may coincide with a monk reciting a prayer in the main prayer room.There are numerous prayer wheels and a large courtyard too.Located close to the centre of Leh this temple is relatively easy to find.

2,Chokhang_Vihara_Temple,Pathik_2404,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 â€¢ Friends,Beautiful Buddhist Temple in the heart of Leh,"Most people visit the monasteries around Leh which are generally some distance away from the main town. However, if you find yourself short of time or are just plain lazy to travel the distance but still want to see a glimpse of Buddhist culture, the Chokhang Vihara temple becomes a must visit.Located centrally in the main market of Leh, the temple offers all the solace and quiet of the monasteries and quite makes you forget that you are still in town. The temple itself has a large courtyard and makes a great place for meditation with Buddhist chants and drums transporting you to another world. The walls of the temple are decorated with paintings on scrolls depicting the life of Buddha and the art on the exterior is one of pleasing simplicity and aesthetics.You can also talk to the monks who patiently explain to you the significance of the prayer wheels surrounding the temple and any other questions you might have.Must visit place on account of its accessibility, tranquility and beauty."
