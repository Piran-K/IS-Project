0,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Apolonia70,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Best views and landscape,Driving in towards Sangam Point was epic - scenery was sublime. The spot above where everyone stops to take photos is exactly why this place is special - it is a superb view. While we were there a Bollywood crew was filming the sequel to Gagar.  Colours and views are worth stopping for.

3,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Anubhav,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,One of the most places to visit especially for river rafting enthusiasts,"I would recommend this is a must go place on your day two of the trip. You can see the conference of the two rivers. There's a small cafe and you can enjoy tea and Maggie. For those who are river rafting enthusiast they can book their river rafting then and there itself. If not river rafting then I would recommend go further from here to chilling, it's an amazing bike ride till there. You'll also come across the points where they start river rafting.For Bungie jumping enthusiast couple of kilometres from the point you'll find your spot."
4,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Ruchirz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Very good place of visit,"One can clearly see the two colors of water coming from Zanskar and Indus rivers.

7,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Ravsh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Ok Ok.,"Also called Sangam. Given the limited choice of places to visit in Leh, it a good place to spend some time. One can do rafting, boating or canoying, otherwise just sit there and enjoy the view. Given the footfall, facilities need to be improved. Just one average place to eat, dirty toilets, etc., put you off.  Take a cap and use sunscreen to avoid tanning."

2,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Tannu D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,awesome,"With lofty snow-capped mountains, rugged terrains and deep valleys, this union territory in the Trans-Himalayan region of India is one of the highest and most picturesque destinations in the country. While there are so many fascinating spots in this region that can catch the eye of the wanderlust, the river confluence of Zanskar and Indus is nothing short of a glimpse of heaven.The green-tinged Indus river originates in the Tibetan Plateau near the Manasarovar range, whereas the shiny blue Zanskar has its source in the Zanskar valley. Both the rivers kiss each other near the scenic Nimmu valley, that falls between Leh and Kargil.  The rivers are clearly distinguished by their colours and the confluence can be best viewed during the spring-summer months, from March to May."
3,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Adarsh Venkatesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,Absolutely brilliant...,"This place is about an hour's drive away from Leh on the Leh-Srinagar highway - NH1. The fast flowing Zanskar meets the slow, meandering Sindhu at what is locally know as the ""Sangam Point"". Rafting options are available from here, which is the world's highest rafting point. Cannot get into the water, too dangerous. There is a small restaurant at this point - only Maggi was available when we visited.There are many attractions on the way to this place - The Hall of Fame museum, The Magnetic Hill, and a couple of other view points. Worth spending a couple of hours."

7,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Abhimanyu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,OK Place to Visit !!,"Place is on Leh-Kargil highway about 40kms from Leh. Afternoons can be very hot, get touristy with lots of cars and people at same time, eating options are not that good, avoid using washrooms to save your life. If weather is soothing, you can spent some time there sitting by the river. Rafting is a major attraction here, sometimes the queue is long and you might need to wait 1 hour as well."

3,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Shyam Prasad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Friends,Surreal and peaceful,"This is a must visit spot on your Ladakh sojourn - but only if it’s not buzzing with tourists. We were thankful to be by the river banks when it was near empty. If you wish to get the view you see in images, make sure to stop on your way down to the point. The view from the top is better, and feels more surreal. But being at the confluence point has a magic associated with getting to dip toes in the waters. The pictures do not lie about the striking contrast in colours between the two rivers - they really look magnificent together. "
4,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Benjamin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021 • Solo,Personal trip,"This is just an amazing place, excellent spot for photograph. Less crowded during the winter.Specially during the sunset just amazing !"
5,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Breathtaking!,"I had always heard about the different colors of rivers, & how, at the confluence, one can notice the distinction. But it came alive for me only at the confluence of the Indus & Zanskar rivers. The Indus is of a muddy brown color while Zanskar is a slaty grey.The confluence is calm, despite the fact that Zanskar is a river that has rapids. You can try river-rafting too. In winter, it is known for its Chadar trek, i.e., trek on the frozen river. The view on the way to the confluence is impressive too. Must must see!"
6,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Shivi G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,One of the best bike trips of my life,"The Confluence – Indus & Zanskar - At times, at the Sangam, the Indus River can be seen as shiny blue while the Zanskar river is dirty green. In the summer season, Zanskar is swollen and rapid, while Indus is comparatively calmer. In the winters, it is quite the opposite. Zanskar slows down, its flow is light and is completely frozen at a lot of places, enabling the legendary Chadar Trek. While Indus flows fast, with ice floating on it. Be it the summer or the winter season, the confluence of these two magnificent rivers is not a sight to be missed when you are in Ladakh. It is a remarkable depiction of nature’s subtle magical nuances. ⠀"

0,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Manasa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Mesmerizing and beautiful ,"One of nature’s finest creation to be looked at and be amazed. Nestled between gigantic barren mountains, the two rivers, Indus and Zanskar find themselves to be united at this point. The shadow of the mountains and the colours of sky paint a confluence of pictures on the water surface. The water body is simply mesmerizing. It is a great spot to do river rafting as the current seems to be very tame. There is a river rafting company near the confluence and a small cafe to eat something. "

6,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,rajkumar.r,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Magnificent Merger Of The Rivers,It is the place where the two rivers of Indus and Zanskar merge. It is approximately around 35 kms from Leh in the Srinagar Highway. If you are travelling from Srinagar means you can visit it before reaching Leh. Both the rivers are in different colours. So the merger looks beautiful. You can view it from the highway itself or a road goes down upto the merger point from the highway. There is a Cafeteria at the point and also they conduct river rafting . They charged us around Rs.1900/- for 16 kms rafting. A must visit place while you are in Leh.
7,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,jdgupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,sangam valley- the confluence of Indus and Zanskar rivers,One can go to the confluence point of the Indus and Zanskar rivers on a day trip visiting all the sightseeing points in and around Leh. The most amazing pat of this confluence is the two distinctive shades of blue converging together.The views are best seen as you travel to this point from Leh on the NH1. This is suppose to be one of the highest altitude river rafting points. So if you are visiting during the month of june july you can give it a shot. There is also a small canteen near the entrance. One can enjoy the marvelous views sitting near the stairs that lead down to the sangam point while sipping your hot coffee. 
8,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Savvy Fernweh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Very popular and very interesting,"This place is also calld Sangam point which is in Shyam valley where the Indus River meets the Zanskar river. In fact, the bluish green color of Indus river and muddy water of Zanskar river are distinctly visible most of the time.  One can get the best view while driving through NH1 overlooking the Sangam point. This is a popular tourist place in Leh and mostly quite crowded also.The interesting part being that, in the Zanskar river you can do rafting during summer time and the same river freezes into a thick ice sheet named as Chadar in winter. So, the famous Chadar trek is done on Zanskar river only. Well, we didn’t do rafting here as we have done rafting multiple times in Hrishikesh. But we will come back for the Chadar trek in winter.

Eagerly waiting to see the deep aqua green india river waters mixing with the white waters of zanskar river, both desperately trying to maintain their identity yet happy to mingle and becomes mighty river before  flowing to Pakistan.The scene is so beautiful, both rivers flowing within deep steep valleys, meeting at almost right angles and giving us a breathtaking view.Nature is at it's best here and later during the day, the river allows it to be navigated, enthusiastic rafters quickly changing into rafting gear, drive up to the river rafting start point and getting the experience of rapids in the drivers flowing within deep steep valley, dark and mighty mountain cliffs on either side. A dip in the icy cold waters, which is an exhilarating experience, done in shallow water is something to watch out for. My son and daughter both teenagers were thrilled to bits and do was their dad, who was also having a blast.Must visit!!"

It is on the Leh -Kargil road close to Nimu. It can be great place to take pictures from the road above. But take selfies close to the edge. If you reach in season it is a place where you also do white river rafting.

0,Confluence_of_the_Indus_and_Zanskar_Rivers,Prasanna N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Sangam: ,"The terrain of Ladakh is  characterised by the Rivers and mountains ranges adorning the region. The Indus River takes the pride of being the longest river in the region. It originates within Tibet and flows through the entire Ladakh and further into a good part of our Western neighbour's territory before merging into Arabian Sea. Though we get to see the river's splendid beauty at various places in Ladakh , it is at Sangam that we get to flavour it in all its grandeur.The place is about 20 kms from the Leh airport on the road leading to Kargil. It is the point where the Zanskar River which flows from the Southern parts of Leh meets the Indus. A bird's eye view of the confluence can be seen from the NH 1. It is a sight to relish with two Rivers embracing  each other to form a giant Y shape. The ideal time to watch this scenic spectacle is in March -April bracket when the snow has just started melting. The Zanskar attains an emerald hue and the point of confluence looks like a giant canvas in the hands of a Divine artist. We can also get to the banks of the Indus River from where white water rafting is conducted on the Zanskar River. The best package would be a 28 kms rafting which costs about 2000 INR. Every bit of the rafting route drenches us in adventure and adrenaline rush. There are about 7 rapids. The  rafting commences from Chilling and the drive along the Zanskar River to Chilling is  an added bonus.  We can relish the beauty of Zanskar as we progress along this road. A change of clothes and Towel needs to be carried along for the rafting trip. "

This is the time when the miracle of nature happens when the water from Indus river flows beneath a frozen Zanskar. Unfortunately, we visited this place in July.The confluence of Indus and Zanskar river is a spot where you can go to just sit and relax. Amidst the smooth flow and mixing of the water from the two rivers, you can also do some river rafting or kayaking. Do not expect an adventure like Rishikesh, the flow of the rivers is smooth and you can experience the flow of the river amidst the beautiful surroundings"

We visited the meeting point of Indus and Zanskar river on our 2. day. This was amasingly beautiful. All the other programs booked and suggested by the touragent were not really interesting (war museum, a small sikh temple) so we were back in town 2 hours later. We asked the guide to take us to Hemis monastery (40 km to other direction -60-70 min drive) wich was very interesting.  For that day I would have suggested to go further the road after Zanskar-Indus meeting point to Lanayuru monastery (till the monastery it is3 hours drive)."

The beauty and the landscape views are just can't be explained. Both the rivers have their own and unique color. This place also provides you the rafting experience and which is the one of the world's highest rafting point. However, the prices are high for rafting and there is no option to bargain as only one contractor operates this. However, a must visit and stop by place during your Leh Ladakh trip. The cold water and heavy Breezer will make you relaxed instantly. "
