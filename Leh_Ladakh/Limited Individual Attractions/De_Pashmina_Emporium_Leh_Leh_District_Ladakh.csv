I think that perhaps he is a master salesmen - so good that you don't even realise you are under his influence! Anyway that is fine because the reason you stepped into the shop is because you're interested in Rugs and Pashminas and if you walk out of there with a purchase it will be a quality item that you can admire for a lifetime.

0,De_Pashmina_Emporium,Selina L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Excellent shop,"Had a great experience at De Pashmina Emporium. I walked in, planning to settle for a cushion cover since I was sure that I wouldn't like the shawls, and the carpets would be too expensive and too much of an hassle to ship abroad... But ended up buying a carpet for my new home and 2 shawls in the end. Not sure if it is the best price you can get in town, since I wasn't in the mood to check any other shops where the people try to push you to buy something, but definitely a must visit for the wonderful service by Omar and the beautifull items. He listens well to your preferences, is honest about the products and willing to accomodate to your wishes."

Truth be told, I only wanted to compare the prices I had seen in another shop, but I ended up staying in bus shop for more than an hour. Omar took the time to explain to me the different types of shawls that were sold, and I felt that physically differentiating between the softness of the shawls and textures helped me appreciate why prices were so different! I ended up buying 3 shawls at a reasonable (I hope!) price and enjoyed my cup of Kahwa tea he offered me. No pressure felt at all, no hard sells. "

5,De_Pashmina_Emporium,Vivien C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Wonderful place to buy a carpet or pashmina in Leh,"When you go into this shop to look at carpets or shawls, you will get so much more than just buying something from Ladakh. Omar is such a gentleman and in tune with his customers' needs, so he quickly understands your preferences and selects certain items which he knows you would like. This helps one choose from an overwhelming array of neatly folded items on shelves upon colourful shelves of stacked carpets and shawls. Omar would never badger you in order to make a sale. This doesn't mean though that you won't receive the most professional, informed and generous attention when you are looking at the exquisite items in his shop. He has a very good eye and collects, amongst hundreds of different shawls and carpets, some of the most unique once-off carpets.  If you are like me, you will go into this shop quite a few times before you actually buy something. Looking for that special carpet that just ""speaks"" to you is a pleasure and takes time - and Omar and his team know this. You will be treated to cups of Kashmiri tea in the process. I was really lucky when I was invited to share a delicious Kashmiri feast, seated on the floor, surrounded by all those beautiful carpets with his team one evening.  I give you, your shop(s) and your team 100% Omar."

He will tell you all he knows but he will also tell you what he might not know i.e. he might not know exactly the age or origin of a carpet and he will say so as opposed to saying what on might want to hear.  He has a fantastic, trusting work ethic and deserves to be noted as having one of the finest shops in Leh. Going there is pleasant, reassuring buying experience - even the tea served is excellent!

Omar has a passion for the many carpets and pashminas you can find in his shop, an unhurried manner and a way of drawing you in. He is very knowledgable. I was the only person in the shop and there was no pressure to buy - but I did take home a beautiful pashmina at a fair price. When travelling, it's the stories we remember, and going to De Pashimina Emporium is a great way to add a fresh page to your travel diary. Recommended."

0,De_Pashmina_Emporium,Sid B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Excellent, informative experience","We ended up spending the entire morning and afternoon at one shop, the De Pashmina Emporium, run by a Mr. Omar Yaseen. We were just observing the enticing display of vibrant colors and textures of shawls displayed in his shop window as we were strolling around Changspa Road, and he saw us looking, so with an irresistible salesman‚Äôs charm and his soft blue eyes and quiet melodic voice, he slowly drew us in, like a fisherman reeling in a reluctant fish! He made the sale perfectly ‚Äì he sat us down and explained the different qualities, what an actual pashmina is (from the wool of a pashmina goat, which can only be bred at high altitudes) and how to tell the authenticity, as well as explaining the other qualities which were blends with other materials like other goat wool and silk, and then how the cheaper ones were rougher as they contained ‚Äòviscous‚Äô which are impurities. He also offered us ‚Äòkahwa‚Äô tea, the famous Kashmiri tea with cinnamon and cardamom and other aromatic spices which gave it a distinct taste. We liked his stuff so much we got shawls for everyone, and he was so good that he even got us to buy a huge carpet for our new house! And then another! The shawls we got were warm and comfortable and a big hit with our family. I recommend this as an essential shopping stop for all who visit Leh. Thanks Omar!"

The items are all very unique and I doubt there are many places in India where such incredible pieces are so readily available. The Kashmiri weave-work is exquisite and authentic, and the owner Omar is an interesting and exceptionally helpful individual. It shines through that his highest priority is customer satisfaction and he has a very good sense for what your taste is after speaking to you for just a brief time. Wonderful shop."

11,De_Pashmina_Emporium,saidja,,,,"When my friends and I just arrived in Leh, our hotel was very close to Omar's shop. He greeted us and invited us for coffee. We stayed a couple of day in Leh and even thouhg I personnaly did not buy anything in De Pashmina Emporium, Omar explained us all the different shawls and pashmina types. To whomever is going to Leh and looking for a nice Pashmina, do not hesitate to go there, Omar will find you what suits you the best. I am glad I met you in Leh and wish you all the best."
12,De_Pashmina_Emporium,DPEOmar,,,,"If you are in Leh and you are looking for Pashmina and Carpets, you must go to De Pashmina Emporium! You will find amazing pashminas! The shop is so different to the other shops you can find in Leh. Omar Khar, the owner, is really friendly and patient. His service, assistance and professionalism were excellent and precious. I was very undecided about what to buy because I wanted to buy everything what I saw! Great service and great products."
13,,,,,,"An oasis of peace in a very busy shopping street!I have seen a lot of carpet shops and met lots of carpet sales people over the years. We met Omar several times and bought several carpets the past couple of years.We feel he is a true gentleman. His service is excellent. We were looking for a certain carpet size and he kept searching and followed up 6 months later to share some options. I feel that his kindness and patience are a real pleasure, as most shops don't have such attitude or service. His selection is also very diverse and extensive. Yet, if he can't help you, he even directs you to another shop.We are happy customers!"

0,De_Pashmina_Emporium,Eliza S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Design Lovers - Exceptional Quality & Service a store in Ladakh to not miss,"Omar keeps a gorgeous collection of high quality authentic shawls and rugs. I absolutely fell in love with his unique collection and the essence behind the craftsmanship and the rawness of the trade that the area is so famous for. Every rug has a story and for me it was with great pleasure to hear these stories and support local craftsmanship and the artisans. I first visited Omar's emporium in 2012 as a young traveler with a fine eye for design. I work in the design industry and to this day I can still not count the amount of compliments I receive every time I wear one of the shawls I purchased from the store. They truly are pieces of fine art work. Omar the owner is a wonderful person. His charisma and passion for his business, family, friends and customers is outstanding.I was in Ladakh for over 3 weeks trekking and on every return to Leh it was with great delight to visit Omar and his store. Every time I visited he always had a new design on display and there was always plenty of stories to share.I highly recommend a visit to this authentic store and the opportunity to meet Omar."

I went in expecting the typical hard sell of most other shops I td gone into. instead I was offered a cup of tea. one cup of tea turned into 3 and 2 hrs later I left having purchased nothing but having made a fast friend. after that I introduced friends to Omar and his beautifully sourced wares. many have purchased said wares including me. I returned to Leh in 2012 and when I came into the shop it was like seeing family after far too long. I was immediately invited to Omar's birthday party and returned to the shop a number of times in the week I was there. I had my eye on a particular carpet in the shop that was beyond my budget at the time. Omar insisted I take it with me and send the payment when I could afford it. He is a good and honest business man but best of all, a friend"

There are lots of places the get shawls and rugs but Omars store and service was by far the best. He is so hospitable with tea and even lunch cooked by his private cook one day.

On entering, he greeted us with Tea and showed us in a very relaxed manner, his produce. I highly recommend dropping in to have a look, even with no intention of buying because the carpets and pashminas are truly beautiful- we bought 3!! He kindly shipped them to us, as planned and within a couple of weeks of purchase. Unlike many other shops in this area, Omar does not hassle you, just allows you to look at what he has to offer at your own pace! I highly highly recommend it!"

23,,,,,,"De Pashmina Emporium was located near our accommodation in Leh so we spent a few days walking by the shop, and finally went in to join the owner, Omar, for some tea. Not only did we have a great conversation about culture and life in India, we found Omar to be quite honest about his products and was willing to negotiate on the prices. I chose one of the cheaper Pashmina's but the quality has held up and I am still using it almost a year later. Highly recommended. Thank you Omar!"
