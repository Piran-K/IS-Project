I entered to buy few postcards but I exit with the best rings in town (I know it sounds strange but in India it is very normal!). My wife bought some pashmina stuff of which I am not very expert.

Very nice experience."

3,Din_Brothers_Jewellers,Din Brothers J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,Must visit if in ladakh,"I have had dealings each year with Din since 2013, during my visits to his shop in Cavallosum, Goa. He has always been extremely friendly and had gone out of his way to meet my requests. At one time I had a jade pendant that needed a repair. Jewellers in S.Wales, UK, had refused to consider a repair as it might have fractured. I entrusted it to Din with excellent results. Over the years I have unreservedly recommended him to others, who have been pleased his work. He has always been extremely honest and fair, and I have no doubt that his service in his new shop will continue to please. I would highly recommend him."
