1,Donkey_Sanctuary,Umang A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 â€¢ Friends,Donkies...,"There is actually a sanctuary for donkies in Leh. Small set up for street donkies, run on donations."
2,Donkey_Sanctuary,royjay2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 â€¢ Couples,Great Effort For A Noble Cause,"Opened to the public in July 2008, the Donkey's Sanctuary in Leh is primarily funded by a South African photo-journalist Joanne Lefson while the local affairs are looked after by Stany Wangchuk. The animals here are primarily those who are not capable of any work, due to old age or disabilities, and have been abandoned by their owners. Not only do they get medical care and food here, but are also kept safe from street dogs. There are some baby donkeys here too mostly born here only and some pregnant ones as well. The male species are distinguished with red ribbons, while the female ones with yellow. The Sanctuary is located just off the road leading to Khardungla Pass, the highest motorable road in the world."
3,Donkey_Sanctuary,Lovers_paradise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 â€¢ Couples,Home For The Homeless Donkeys,The Donkey's Sanctuary is located around 3 km from Leh. This sanctuary was opened in July 2008 to accommodate the neglected donkeys in Leh. Around 30 donkeys can be taken in at a time. Preference is given to injured and pregnant donkeys. But once they are healed and have given birth they are released back to the open to look after themselves once again. The sanctuary is run on donations and favours shelled out by concerned travellers and animal lovers.
4,Donkey_Sanctuary,TheBeckhams421,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 â€¢ Couples,Well worth a visit if you love animals,"Not the easiest to find, especially with the road dug up around it. Best to approach from the outskirts and cross the bridge. There were about 20/25 being cared for on our visit. All looked in good shape. Best NOT to arrive with 2 kilos of carrots in a bag if you don't want a donkey mugging - they can bite. Would be better to give food to the staff so it can be given out in a more orderly fashion. They are sweet little creatures and most like to be petted. We left RS500. Im sure they're grateful for all the help they can get. All they need in Leh now is someone to take care of the dogs .... ðŸ˜• "
5,Donkey_Sanctuary,dzejar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 â€¢ Friends,A garden with a lot of old or ill donkeys,"We came to see and feed some donkeys during our stay in Leh, but the place was closed and only way to reach someone was to call some number, what is not easy for tourists without local phone plan. International roaming doesn't work in the area at all. So we tried to give some vegetables to donkeys over the fence and went away as there was no way to get inside. It would be nice to have some better option to contact staff. If you're planning to visit, you might want to contact owner in advance from a place with internet or a telephone."
6,Donkey_Sanctuary,Stanzin Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 â€¢ Friends,Angel's from Heaven... ,"It is very painful to see those beautiful creatures struggling to Live their life without any shelter, food and even water....though Ladakhis are doing prosperous in every field but the humanistic side is diminishing very fast... Agriculture land and turning into big concrete structures leaving the animals to eat plastics and sleeping in the busy streets... Where is Ladakh going?But there are still some angels looking after those poor creatures..The story begin.......Two days back i saw two donkeys trying to   reach  tree leaves at old road but the donkeys were to small to eat those leaves so i went to help them but when i reach them the smaller fellow was trying to scratch her forelegs repeatedly when i checked it there was a medium wound from bog bite... First i felt helpless for not have anything to calm him down but after some time i google donkey sentury leh and i found one contact no and dialed without wasting any time.... Luckily it got connected on the first dial and a very soft spoken gentleman answered and sent his volunteer within short time...I really appreciate your spirit of work...... "
7,Donkey_Sanctuary,Katrin R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 â€¢ Friends,Heartwarming donkey sanctuary,We went on a mountain bike tour around Leh and stopped at the donkey sanctuary. Worthwhile quick stop; good to see they have a lovely shelter. Not over-done but honest and needed. Thanks!
8,Donkey_Sanctuary,julia p,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 â€¢ Solo,Love of animals, If you get a moment in beautiful Leh glance past the sanctuary and leave a few rupees. You see the lovely donkeys abandoned in the streets I can't imagine what happens to them in the winter. There is alot of love in the sanctuary it's really superb how someone has sacrificed their time and money to do it. 
9,Donkey_Sanctuary,Mohit M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 â€¢ Family,A fun visit if you have extra time in Leh,"The sanctuary is about 10-15 min drive from Leh market. Totally worth a visit if you're relaxing in Leh and waiting to acclimatize. There's about 15 donkeys that were stranded, hurt, etc. that are now being cared for. You can bring or buy food and feed the donkeys. They're super cute!"

4,Donkey_Sanctuary,NGN42,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Solo,"Colourful, Interesting Sanctuary for Donkeys","The donkey sanctuary turned out to be one of my favorite things to do in Leh. The colourful signs make it a fun place to be, and petting and feeding the donkeys is fun too. They do good work here.The visit is free, but you'll want to donate something towards helping keep the donkeys fed."

6,Donkey_Sanctuary,tanwanisunil,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 â€¢ Couples,Colours on walls,Donkey images and the certain pictures of donkeys are maintained here. paintings of donkey and crayons used to make pictures. Good place
7,Donkey_Sanctuary,Kennith R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 â€¢ Family,Your Leh trip shall be incomplete without this,"It began with us spotting a rusty boarding, dangling by a nail, which read, 'Donkey Sanctuary' and an arrow under it. After much asking around and lots of walking from that rather misleading sign, we reached the Donkey Sanctuary. And it was worth all the effort. The place is much different from what rest of Leh offers you. The people of Ladakh are kind and friendly, and so are its donkeys. We spent a long time just feeding these abandoned animals and spending time away from all the 'tourist-y' things Leh has to offer."
8,Donkey_Sanctuary,Arshdeep S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 â€¢ Friends,Wonderful,"This sanctuary is the home for many donkeys that were saved from mistreatments and near abandonment. They are preserved and treated with respect here as manâ€™s best friend and are fed carrots and sugar. These creatures wander about freely in the less visited Leh. Moreover, the scenic view from atop the sanctuary is mesmerizing."
9,Donkey_Sanctuary,merzbach2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014,Wonderful place,A wonderful place you must visit when you are in Leh. And dont forget to donate for this great sanctuary for rescued lovely donkeys. A peaceful and colorful place with plenty of thankful animals....
0,Donkey_Sanctuary,Alby69,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2014 â€¢ Friends,Nice experience! ,It is worth a visit to this sanctuary while you are in Leh. There are many donkeys around that are happy to eat a carrot from your hands.. so sweet... a must a visit! 
1,Donkey_Sanctuary,Anuragme,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Wonderful mission,Establishing a sanctuary like this for aged donkeys is a wonderful mission takenWe suggest every body should visit the place and help poor donkeys. 
2,Donkey_Sanctuary,Bhutantraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,"Great initiative, a home for retired and injured donkeys","Many donkeys are usued for carrying loads of everything in daily life, and during treks. When they are old and/or injured they cannot do their job and are mostly abandoned. This is a place were donkeys can get good care, food and love, to spend the rest of their working life in peace, and the injured are treated to go back to earning life. The area is in the higher part of Leh, with views of the mountains and the Shanti Stupa. The donkeys welcome visitors in a friendly way. We took carrots for them which were eaten quickly. We  walked around, could touch and stroke every animal and interact closely. Of course donations were accepted with many thanks, but we didn't feel pressed to give. I'd advise to take children here, they'll love to be close to animals, In  Leh,there aren't  so many possibilities to see and touch those. A lovely spot for good views as well."
