0,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Philip B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Friends,Brilliant Trek,"We had a great time, super helpful and informative team on the Markah Valley trek. Great food and good communication with Javeed at the office leading up to the trip. Thanks!"
1,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Helen Menhinick,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Couples,Markha Valley,"My husband and I trekked the Markha Valley route over 8 days.From arriving in Leh, at the Dreamland office, to departure our experience was without complaint or hitch. We were given the trip of a lifetime with every detail so calmly organised. Our guide Idga was excellent- so good at planning, very knowledgeable and reliably looking after us. The cook was a genius and a true character and the pony man kept happy healthy ponies and the little donkey.The scenery was breathtaking and every corner turned, a different vista. My favourite bits were the high passes, what a wonderful feeling.  Javeed made sure we had the best experience and organised at trip to Pangong Lake and Nubra Valley after our trek where we had a ride on two hump camels. Can’t fault anything- Can’t wait to go back. Thank you Javeed, Idga, Beem, our pony man and our driver Ali."
2,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Alexander G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Great company for the individual travel experience!,"The cultural tour was very well organized and everything worked out perfectly. From a logistical side, we could not have asked for a better experience. The company owner, Javeed, speaks English very well, he was very responsive to our email queries, and it was pleasant to discuss the possible tour options with him. Also, he was very flexible to accommodate all our boundary conditions for the tour. I have rarely seen this with a travel agency in the past.Our driver on the tour, Ali, was a similarly honest and trustworthy person who did an excellent job. The only downside was that unfortunately, the driver spoke only very little English, so we received almost no information about the things we saw on the tour. I picked some info from our travel guide book, which was OK, but I am sure we missed a few interesting infos. If you would like to get some additional information while on the road, we recommend to discuss this with Javeed beforehand (booking an additional tour guide might be an option).The Markha Valley Trek, including the climb of Kang Yatze II, was an unforgettable adventure. The trekking guide Sonam, our ponyman, cook and assistant were all very friendly and quickly became our Ladakhi-Nepalese family. The food was great, and the trek itself was very pleasant to walk. Our recommendation is to make sure that the group brings along a dedicated toilet tent, and a comfortable chair for each person. For altitude acclimatization, we took Diamox, which worked very well. None of our group got any altitude problems. You can buy the Diamox in Leh in a pharmacy without any problem (Javeed can help to find it), but it's even better to take it before you arrive in Leh.Kang Yatze II is a serious mountain climb that requires mountaineering skills and the right equipment (crampons, gaiters, ice axe, climbing harness and rope). You can rent the gear from Dreamland Trek and Tour, but we advise to carefully check it with Javeed before you go on the hike. Some of the equipment was a little bit worn-out and needs to be renewed. The snow conditions during our hike (early July 2022) required us to cross countless small crevasses, and 2-3 larger ones (>1 metre wide, and many tens of metres deep). Two days before our summit push, two avalanches released on the glacier, cutting straight through the route. So make sure that the mountain guide has crevasse and some avalanche rescue equipment available. The high camp location doesn't exist any more (we heard it was permanently closed), so the summit push now is a 14-hour return hike from the base camp, covering 1200 vertical metres. Bring a good head lamp that lasts through the night. We left the base camp at 23:00, returning just after lunchtime the next day. Standing on top of Kang Yatze II just after sunrise is an incredible feeling that makes the pain worth it!In general, we recommend Dreamland Trek and Tour. It’s a professional company, and they really try to make your trip as enjoyable and memorable as possible."
3,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Matt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Great experience with excellent support,"Dreamland organised a great tour for us of the Ladakh region. In particular, Javeed and his team went above and beyond by organising the delivery of my delayed luggage to a remote corner of Ladakh without extra charge, which was a huge help. And thanks to Ali, the best driver in Ladakh!"
4,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Ana I,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,Tremendo,"We have just finished a trek from Lamayuru to Kant Yatse II through the Marka Valley. It has been a great and amizing experience. Everything was perfect: the organitation, the food, the team and, of course, our guide Sonam.We have felt very well attended by all the people working in it. The planinification of the days for a gradually aclimatation to all we had to walk and to the altitud was perfect. The food was very good, variated and in big amount of it.We all have to say is Thanks to all the team (guides, cooker man, helper and ponymen), all of them taking care of us, and thank you very much for celebrating with us that we had reached the summit of the Kant Yatse Peak.So, everything was really excelent . I would recomended to everyone who loves mountains,  who likes knowing people and who wants to feel secure being led by a good guide."
5,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Julie B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Friends,Amazing!,"Our experience with Dreamland was amazing! We had such a good trip! One advice would be to meet with the guide before going. The office is good at administrating the trips, but do not have knowledge about all the equipment you need to bring."
6,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Amish S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Excellent trip with Dreamland trek and tours,Big thank you to dreamland trek and tours. We were 10 of us with 4 kids to explore Ladakh. Being a season time the rates everywhere was a rip off. Javeedji from dreamland trek and tours turned out to be a big saviour. He provided excellent service throughout our trip. Had a totally hastle free trip. Kids were happy and we all returned with smiling faces.Amish ShahPune
7,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Rukhsana P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Friends,Awsome trek Lamayuru to Hemis ,Just finished the trek with dreamladakh. It was unforgettable experience. The food was 5 star Passang is the best chef he made pizzas and cakes at 4000mters. Gyalson and Lobzang both are so professional I am talking about our guides and the pony man Ishey in one sentence I want to say they are a perfect team very caring. We highly recommend dreamland trek & tour. 
8,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Ratul_Neogi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021 • Family,Mesmerizing Ladakh with Dreamland,"Very well organised with attention to detail and positive response to any request. We planned to cover multiple locations in Ladakh over a week. All stay arrangements, travel, passes etc. were organised seamlessly. Dreamland is passionate about Ladakh tourism and it shows in the service provided. We would definitely like to do our next visit to Ladakh with Dreamland and recommend them to friends and family."
9,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Annie P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Excellent Company - Best Snow Leopard Treking Experience,"I recently completed a 12 day trip with Dreamland - 3 days of touring around Leh and surrounding areas and 9 days Snow Leopard trekking.Leh and the monastery tours were amazing, prefect time to visit the area as there are nearly no tourists, of 10 sites visited I only encountered 2 other foreign tourist and 1 Indian tourist.As a single female and wildlife enthusiast, I had booked a 9 day private Snow Leopard trek to Hemis National Park, I was of course a little nervous traveling alone to a remote location. I felt 150% safe and looked after the entire time. The 4 camp staff and my 2 wildlife guides (Gyalson and Stanzin), went out of there way to make this a trip of a life time, they were kind, gentle, knowledgeable and fun people. We saw 4 leopards - a lone female twice, then a mother and 2 juveniles for 7hours!!! We also saw 2 Lynx once and 2 Wolf on at least 3 occasions including a successful hunt of a woolly hare and a very near miss hunting a Blue Sheep. We also also many birds and Pika. The sightings and the stunning scenery was well above my expectations.The trip was very well organised from start to finish, camping equipment was in excellent condition and the food provided was delicious and plentiful. Javeed was incredibly patient answering all my pre trip questions, and I asked a lot!I could not recommend this company and its trekking / wildlife staff highly enough. Do not waste money booking with an international operator, book direct with Dreamland, it is cheaper and the money goes direct to the people of Ladakh and the experience is amazing."
0,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,John M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Winter 2020 Snow Leopard Tour-Hemis National Park,"This is probably the most affordable snow leopard tour you will find in Ladakh, but don’t think you will compromise on other aspects of the experience. I camped out for 5 nights/6 days and it was an unimaginable, unforgettable time. We were given heavy, down sleeping bags that will keep you warm during the -20C nights and a tent that had plenty of room for me. You also have an option for home stay which I didn’t do. There was a heated dining tent that had a wonderful staff of cooks who gave us such a diverse meal plan for three meals a day. I don’t think I had one meal that was the exactly the same. Everything tasted great and they provided plenty of hot beverages and water. Your day typically involves a 0700-0900 morning lookout for snow leopards (of course other animals, too) and then breakfast after. Then you have a choice of going on a couple hikes around the valley, depending on your activity level and interests. You either eat lunch back at the camp or during your hike, if it’s a lengthy one. You will have a porter to take your lunch to wherever you are. There is also a 1330-1800 spotting session at the lookout, or other spots if you want to hike farther and for better views. The guides are so keen on finding the snow leopards that if there is one in range of a spotting scope, they will most likely find it. During my stay, I saw not one, but FOUR snow leopards. One adult female spotted twice the same day and a mother and her two cubs another day. I was allowed to watch the trio for 6 hours, resting in the afternoon sun and then the cubs chasing each other on the mountain. The guides had excellent scopes for you to use and will gladly take pictures and videos through the scope for you (digiscoping). We also found 2 Eurasian lynx, 2 Tibetan wolves, tons of blue sheep, pika, lammergeiers or bearded vultures, golden eagles, Himalayan griffon vultures, woolly hares, etc. You cannot find a better company with the price and experience  than Dreamland Trek and Tour.

1,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,FedeIke,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Excellent! Highly Recommended!,"We did the 6 day Markha Valley trek with tents. It was fantastic and the organisation was perfect. Our guide, cook and pony man were excellent. All of them were very friendly and funny and at the same time very professional.Sonam, our guide, always found the best solution to guide us safely during the trek even when we had a challenging day due to the river level which was higher than normal. He always paid attention to our health and he was always available to help his team and other trekkers. Every day Stanzin, our cook, prepared different meals, very tasty and hearty. Always smiling. During the last dinner he left us speechless with his surprise.In addition, we had to change the starting date a couple of times (due to a flu) and Javeed and his team were very understanding and helpful. We highly recommend organising a trek with Dreamland Trek and Tour!"
2,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Tinu Stutz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Great Trekking Company!,"We had an awesome time in Ladakh with Dreamland! The staff was very professional and everything was well organised. We can only recommend Dreamland for your adventures in Ladakh, India."
3,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,dreamweaverA,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Amazing Experience,We booked dreamland through internet and the communication with Javeed was very swift and to the point. On arrival they picked us up from airport and later we did Rumtse Tsomoriri trek 8 days. It was incredible experience with dreamladakh team. Guide Sonam is so up to date in every sense very knowledgable reagrding budhism and wild life.  Cook lakpa is unbelievable on height of 4500 m he made tuna Pizzas and baked delicious cakes. Over all the food was so good we gained weights.  Whatever I am so happy to recommend dreamland. They are really awesome .
4,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Tini D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Trekking in Ladakh,"We had a tremendous experience in Ladakh with Dreamland trek and tour. Good communication with manager Javeed. They picked us up from the AirPort in Leh. Arranged transportation to the Phyang-festival. Had a Wonderful 4-day trekking from Spituk to Nehmo. Our guide Rigen could tell a lot about the Himalaya’s and helped us perfectly over Stok-lo pass en Nehmo-lo pass. Our cook Beam made delicious meals in the small tent on the campsites. Equipments for the trekking were well organised. In twee campsites there was a toilet. Be Sire you ask if they can bring a toilettent in case there isn’t one availeble, for on our trekking we were lucky anonther group had one we could use. The day after the trekking they arranged a Wonderful rafting trip on the Zanskar river. When ever you plan to go to Ladakh and want to do activities we surely recommandeer Dreamland trek and tour."
5,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Atzll1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,9 day Snow Leopard trek,"We booked the 8 day Snow Leopard trek and extended it by one day in February 2019. This meant trekking for about 5 days and acclimatizing/transfers for about 4 days.  During the acclimatization period you visit the area and some monasteries which is a nice add-on to the trip. Organization of all activities is spot on and you feel well looked after. However, the absolute highlight was of course the trekking itself in the Rumbakh Valley, which is a beautiful area. We saw two Snow Leopards, a Wolf, four Lynx, a Fox, Lammergeier, Golden Eagle and many other animals/birds. This was all thanks to the very experienced and knowledgeable team of guides who were able to spot the animals under the most challenging conditions. Apart from that they were also very friendly and fun. The rest of the team at the camp also looks after your every need by supplying hot tea and snacks during the treks and during times when we were based at a certain spot for an extended period of time. At the camp cooking was amazing and very  tasty, especially considering the conditions in which the cooks had to prepare the food. Only downside is the cold (in February sometimes at -25c), but that is part of the deal and they do provide warm sleeping bags and warm water bottles. All in all this was a once in a lifetime trip which we will never forget. We wholeheartedly recommend Dreamland to guide on such trip as they looked after our every need and, last but not least, were able to show us the Snow Leopards. "
6,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Austin B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,"Encouraging, Kind and Safe Guides","I hiked with 2 other friends to the Stok La (Stok Pass) on a 4-day trek. This trek is in Hemis National Park. We camped on our trek but stopped at a few home stays for tea. The entire hike was beautiful. The small villages we passed were pristine Ladakhi settlements. Locals at these villages were extremely kind. Our guides were very affable with locals and helped answer questions we asked of the local people regarding their homes and families.Our guide, Sonam, was extraordinarily kind and helpful. He had a great deal of knowledge to share and explained when and where we could see certain wildlife. The most helpful thing Sonam did for us was to help us descend rapidly on the 2nd night of our trip. We were not acclimatized enough and had severe altitude sickness. Sonam got us down the mountain and into a home stay immediately. He was great to us. Sonam also suggested how we could avoid altitude sickness in the future by completing “baby treks” that would have acclimatized us properly.We had the opportunity to visit some nearby monasteries and have a small bonfire at our home stay in place of the final day of trekking and camping. The trek was incredible and I’m glad we did it even though we had to cut it short. "
7,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Sussy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Un-Believable Snow Leopard Trek in The Hemis National Park with dreamladakh team,"Sussana & Emma  from Norway Recommends Feb 19, 2019It was my first ever visit to India and also to Ladakh and I wanted to arrange my trek in advance. I went on the chat room here and found so many good reviews (backed up on other websites) that I decided to book my Snow Leopard Trek with DreamLadakh. communication  from day 1 and on arrival we were met and taken to the offices where we met the team to chat through the plans. From the moment the trek started until we were dropped off at Leh airport afterwards we were looked after so well.It happened to be an uforgettable experience, wow amazing we ended up with sighting snow Leopard two times once with cub, and blue sheeps, wolf, Golden eagel, eagle owl and ofcourse a lynx.   We had a team of 3 - a lovely guide Gyalson, talented cook Stanzin  and jolly horseman Eshey. They were so respectful (we were 2 girls travelling on our own), informative, smiley and hard-working during the 11 day trip we did not want to leave. Nothing was too much trouble. Always greeted with tea & Soups after the treks or at wake up......3 course meals cooked on fire - even cakes were baked! Cannot recommend DreamLadakh enough!!!!!!"
8,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Jared1987,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Incredible time tracking snow leopards in Ladakh,"This was one of the greatest trips I have ever done. Gyalson, Stanzin, and Dhanjus (sorry guys if I butchered the spelling of your names!!) were all amazing guides and made the two of us on the tour feel very comfortable. They always did their best to try and find and point out the different animals for us. We were lucky and ended up seeing four different leopards on our trip - nothing is guaranteed of course, and even if we saw nothing at all, it would've been fantastic. I couldn't be more positive about these three guys - super nice, very patient, and provided any information you needed.      The camp food itself was surprisingly good. I was expecting six or seven days of just chapatis, dal, and potatoes, but it ended up being much more diverse than I expected. And always more than enough to fill you up.      The camp was also very comfortable. I was given a nice pillow, soft padding to sleep on the ground, and really warm sleeping bags. You'll need those sleeping bags, it gets so cold at night.      I really couldn't recommend Dreamland more!"
9,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,menm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Hiking and mountainbiking in Ladakh,We recommend Dreamland for their perfect organisation. We made our own raw plan and Javeed made it better. We walked from Lamayuru to Marka and after that we mountainbiked near the Chines and Pakistan borders. We had an excellent cook Lakpa who came from Nepal and had climbed the Mount Everest for several times. We are a little bit late with filling this in because in fact we visited Ladakh in 2016 but that we could fill in the formular.
0,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Werner,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Amazing tour through Ladakh (28.07.-14.08.2017),"From the very beginning the trip was perfectly planned and organized. Furthermore, Javeed kept our deposit more than one year because we had problems with our flight-> Many thanks for this Javeed (This is not naturally in these times)!! There was always a very fast response on our questions from dreamladakh.com office. We booked a tour “Extreme Adventure Lamayuru (Trekking-Rafting-Biking 14 Days)”-it was much better than expected. Very various landscapes and activities. We had a perfect guide, cook and horseman. They did everything for us what we never expect to make us a great holiday. At the end of our roundtrip, Javeed booked us a different hotel in Leh as mentioned. The hotel was around 25 minutes one-way walking distance from Leh center away. So Javeed offered a taxi service free of charge from the hotel to Leh center and back. Additionally, Javeed organized a motorcycle for us on the last day. to have an amazing tour to the highest motorable pass of the world 😊. If we come back to Ladakh (and we will someday 😊), we will book our next trip only with Dreamland Trek & Tour! Many thanks and greetings to Javeed and his team."

3,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Silvia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Wonderful Experience in Ladakh,"Last summer I visited Ladakh with a friend and relied on Mr. Javeed and DreamLadakh to help us make the most out of our stay. We experienced a day rafting on the Zanskar river, we did an unforgettable 6-day trekking along the Markha Valley, and finally we visited the Nubra Valley. Overall it was an amazing vacation and Mr. Javeed proved to be extremely professional, reliable, and kind. I remember drinking several lovely honey/lemon/ginger teas at his office while planning for the next trip! I especially recommend the trekking experience to fully immerse yourself in nature and discover breathtaking landscapes (otherwise unreachable). We were just two girls travelling alone in Ladakah, but we felt safe and well taken care of by DreamLadakh super-experienced guides. We walked for days from one monastery to another, crossing freezing rivers, and sleeping in a tent. Walking at high altitude can be extremely tiring sometimes, but I will never forget those Himalayan skies... so blue and incredibly full of stars at night!"
4,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,alessandro s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Wonderful Trek and tour!!!,"Mr.Javeed and Dreamland staff organized our tour in Ladakh to visit a lot of very nice places, monastery, Nubra valley, Pangong lake and a lot of amazing places, moreover organized Lamayuru to Chilling trek with very nice and friendly staff.Everything was perfect!!!"
5,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Sophie Ibbotson,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,By far the best tour operator in Ladakh,"As the author of Bradt Travel Guides’ guidebook to Kashmir and Ladakh, I have researched and travelled with dozens of tour operators in the region. Dreamland Trek & Tour stands head and shoulders above its competitors, so I have used their services repeatedly, both for work and when travelling in Ladakh with family and friends. Javeed and his team are exceptionally professional, not to mention friendly, and their success rate at sporting snow leopards in the winter is unmatched. If you are planning a trip to Ladakh and Zanzibar, book with Dreamland Trek & Tour."
6,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,DavidFleischman,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Excellent service from Dreamland - Stok Kangri Climb,"Javeed and his Dreamland team provided a well organised climb up Stok Kangri for friends and me. Everything promised was professionally provided. Dreamland's equipment was good, the guides were excellent and the food was of a very high standard. Javeed was easy to communicate with. The expedition was well priced. The transport was prompt and efficient. We found the whole expedition well paced, interesting and challenging. I can easily recommend Javeed and Dreamland Trek and Tour to anyone who is looking for adventure in Ladakh."
7,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,jjacktim,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Trip to Ladakh - Lamayuru to Chilling Trek,"Amazing organization. After a couple of days acclimatizing in Leh, we started our 6 days trekking from Lamayuru to Chilling with Dreamladakh. Indeed, it has been a dream. Javeed and the rest of Dreamladakh team took care of everything. They have perfectly organized every small detail of the trip, from food to the place to sleep (camping tent in spots with amazing views), from digging the canals aroung the tent when raining to describing us the beauty and customs of their land. The guide, the cook and the horse-man that accompanied us along the way made a very good team with good knowledge of English. We have no doubt in reccomending Dreamladakh (Dreamland Trek and Tour) as organizer of your trek."

The whole experience was excellent from the moment I contacted Javeed until we returned back to Leh. Organisation, information, service, quality of food and equipment and not least the team we trekked with. I can highly recommend Dreamland and would have no hesitation using this agency again."
9,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,gipsy567,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Trip to Ladakh and trekking Markha Valley,Very good organization and also flexible to change trekking date as my husband fell ill.As road to Manali was still closed due to heavy and late snowfall great organization for us to go via Srinagar back to Delhi. Can highly recommend this company and my friend used there service already twice with no complaints.
0,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,lizdiscovers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Great trek to Markha Valley; well organised!,"After some online research and talking to friends; we choose for Dreamland for our 8 day trek through the Markha Valley. As a family with 2 children (13 and 16) we were a little nervous about the altitude and the walking distance for our children so we opted to have two extra riding horses for our children, this would give them an option if not well or not wanting to walk anymore. Javeed was very easy to communicate with and we appreciated the rendez vous the day before our trek at the office and to meet our guide, Rik, as well. He joined us to buy a few last minute supplied in Leh, which was very helpful. Rik, with his calm and very patient demeanour, was a great guide. He explained lots about and during the track and ensured we were all drinking lots of water. He also reached a helping hand to other guides and travellers when they needed it; some of the river crossings were more challenging due to the high water levels. Stanzin was a great cook and prepared the most amazing meals for us. The kids loved the pancakes, eggs and the surprises at the end of the track! Our helper brought us wonderful tea to our tent in the morning. The quality of the sleeping tents was very good (the “social/dining” tent could do with a refresh). The only thing we missed was little chairs; other tents seemed to have little chair and tables, we sat on mattresses on the floor for our meals. Which is ok, but got a bit cold at the higher altitudes and problematic when we had rain during one evening.After our trek Rik took us to enjoy the monasteries and Shey Palace before dropping us of at our hotel; a nice way to end our truly amazing experience.I can very happily recommend Dreamland for a trek in the Markha Valley. "

2,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,melshoogendoorn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018,Great trip and excellent service by Dreamland Trek & Tour,"We, a family of 5, had a great holiday trip in Ladakh! First, we did a 12 day trekking, organized by Dreamland trek & tour. Our guide was very professional, had a high social intelligent and really made our trekking into a succes! Furthermore, the food was delicious and varied,  the cooking team worked great together. We finished our holiday with a jeepsafari to the remote lakes. Also, this was very well organized with a high standard jeep, an excellent driver and good places to stay. In conclusion, Dreamland Trek & Tour and especially Javeed, organized all well, was reliable and most important very flexible in adjusting travel schedule. thanks a lot for our fantastic holiday  "
3,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,MisterBart1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,2 week tour highlights of Ladakh,We did a tour of two weeks with our family of 5.  The tour with private driver in a comfortable car took us around the highlights of Ladakh.  The driver was very professional taking us over the highest road in the world!!  The accommodation was overall very good.  Excellent service and Indian food.  The price is very correct and I recommend this tour and the hospitality of Javeed!
4,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Nadège R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Pass your way there are better options,"We booked a 5-day trekking tour for the Markha valley and were quite disappointed of the services provided. The guide only took us from point A to B every day but did not explain much about the valley despite our many questions. He didn't even know the names of aninals or plants in English despite his 25-year of guiding service! Also he unnecessarily pressed us on the last day repeating we had 5 hours of walk, while we walked a 2 and a half finally. For sure we came back early! Also the lunch provided was merely a snack and I was hungry on Day 3, 4 & 5. The Markha valley can certainly be done on your own for much cheaper!"

7,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,extremeyus,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Ladhak with Dreamland Trek and Tour,"We did an 8-day Markha valley trek in August 2017 with Dream Ladakh. It was an absolutely fantastic experience. We would normally trek on our own but it was our first trip at high altitude and were not sure about its effects, so wanted to book a guided tour to ensure safety, access to satellite phone, to have horses carry the bags, etc. We booked Dream Ladakh's guided tour in advance and it was a fantastic decision.The Markha valley trek is stunning – an incredible diversity of colours, mountains and rock formations in these desert mountains, but with the rivers in the valleys lined with stunningly bright green fields and tiny villages. While there were other trekkers at the campsites and we occasionally encountered local residents and trekkers on the paths, mostly it was just our group with the mountains and the trail.Gurmet, our guide, was incredibly professional and organized, very friendly and knowledgeable about the mountains, the wildlife, and was very open to ensure the schedule fit our preferences. I cannot imagine a better guide. Stanzin, the cook, made delicious and sumptuous food for every meal. Hearty cooked breakfast, big lunches with freshly baked cakes, and 3-course dinners meant that even after long high-altitude days we kept energy and spirits high. Lopsang and Tashi were extremely friendly and helpful. We were so happy to be with this team not just for their professionalism, but also because of so many great conversations, with Gurmet and Stanzin sharing thoughts on Ladakhi and Indian history, culture and politics, stories and experiences about the mountains, and life in general.  The trip was very well prepared and well equipped, with everything we needed re tents, comfortable sleeping mats, food, etc, as well as safety equipment. Indeed, after spending a night at high altitude, one of the trekkers in another group got quite serious altitude sickness and it was Gurmet (our guide) who went to check on him, provide medicine and ensure he got help. Each day was very well planned and we camped in beautiful locations, usually beside mountain streams which were refreshing to paddle and wash in after a day of hiking.We were so pleased with our trek that on returning to Leh, we also booked a day of white water rafting and a 2-day trip to Turtuk with Dream Ladakh. Everyone in their office is extremely helpful and friendly. For example they helped us out with access to internet when there was a Leh-wide outage and we needed to contact someone back home. Javeed, the owner, was extremely helpful as we were planning and booking the trip."

It was an amazing trekGuide Gurmet is the best guide we have ever met. Food was amazing lakpa made pizza  and pancakes  at an altitude of 5000m more importantly  it was great team combination that made our trek  unforgettable. Wowwww the landscapes  the lakes and the nomadic  settlements  breath taking I can't express in words  that  how complete was this trek. I will highly recommend dreamladakh. And will definitely come back here for another adventure with Gourmet  and dreamladakh!!!!!!! 
9,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,ashleyrogerss1989,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Leh has better alternatives ,"My husband and I booked a tour in May with the DreamLadakh.Excellent organization of the tour by the owner, Mr. Javeed, who has been able to give good advice.After two days of acclimatization in Leh, where we visited the surrounding area, we started the tour visiting the Nubra Valley, the magnificent high altitude lakes, the Pangong, the Tso Moriri and the Tso Kar, passing through the Khardongla, the pass world's highest carriage, 5,600 meters. Unimaginable landscapes, impossible to describe, a journey full of emotions! Special thanks to the best driver of all the Ladakh, our great Norboo. We will return as soon as possible to do the trekking on the tracks of the snow leopard!"
10,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Liz_0102,,,,"It was my first ever visit to India and also to Ladakh and I wanted to arrange my trek in advance. I checked on internet here and found so many good reviews (backed up on other websites) that I decided to book my Markha Valley trip with DreamLadakh. It was great communication from day 1 and on arrival we were met and taken to the offices where we met the team to chat through the plans. From the moment the trek started until we were dropped off at Leh airport afterwards we were looked after so well. We had a team of 3 - a lovely guide Nurbu, talented cook Lakba and jolly horseman Angdu. They were so respectful (we were 2 girls travelling on our own), informative, smiley and hard-working during the 8 day trip we did not want to leave. Nothing was too much trouble. Always greeted with tea after the treks or at wake up......3 course meals cooked on fire - even cakes were baked! Cannot recommend DreamLadakh enough!!!!!!"
11,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Javeed I,,,,"Management initially over charged us by £40. They then insisted on cash payment and were aggressive and abusive when we explained we didn't carry £200 cash so could we pay by card. Our guide was friendly and had good English, but lacked knowledge of the sights and failed to provide what we had requested, showing us monasteries rather than taking us on half day hikes."
12,,,,,,"The main issue was that they didnt wanted to pay the waiting charge for the taxi, since we booked the taxi for them they will always bill us for waiting in any case. As per Taxi Union Guide lines when the came to know about waiting charge they were very reluctant, on the otherhand we cannot do any trip in minus.
Ofcourse I was offended but never ever abused, Since we are a highly reputed company and working in travel trade for last 23 years we will never misbehave with a client, well it depends on the behaviors of other side, if someone crosses limit that time we must say stop here. 
Being a tour operator I am very much satisfied with my job,  and have thousands of well wishers and myself and my team is quite confident to live up to their expectations. "

0,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Jim T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Travelling to Ladakh!,"Thank you for organizing such a wonderful trip for us to beautiful Ladakh. We were so impressed with how smooth everything was run throughout our trip. Ladakh is a wonderful place and using a local company with such good local knowledge was definitely the correct choice. Gurmeet was an excellent guide throughout, he was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The camp was brilliant and the food fantastic. All credit to the cooks for creating such amazing food in those trying conditions. We enjoyed the wildlife viewing and the trekking but we both felt that more days exploring the various valleys in the area would have made it even better. I understand that the emphasis was to spot a snow leopard but it felt sometimes like this was too the detriment of the other possible species. Stanzin was very knowledgeable and could spot all types of wildlife but for 2 days we were essentially exploring the valleys alone while he concentrated solely on the snow leopard.  It is a minor thing in a great experience so thanks again to you and your team"
1,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Icedancer83,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Awsome Trek to Nubra valley,"An amazing unique experience enhanced by a friendly, caring and multi-talented staff. Our wonderful guide, Pema made the trek to our needs and desires. Perfect organization all the way through, even in the smallest, kindest details (Hot lunch after a hard day!). We only had to walk, all the rest was taken care of! Exceptional sites, landscapes and views. Great memories for the year to come! A first, unique trekking experience, 1st time in the Himalayas, We loved it! Hard enough to fully appreciate it, but smooth enough to only remember. Great times! Thank you for everything."

3,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Leif S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,A professional and serious company,Wow! We saw six Snow Leopards and a lot of other nature goodies! Our 11-day Snow Leopard tour was a great succes thanks to our guides and Dreamland's organisation of the tour. Making such a tour under difficult conditions demands experience and thinking - this is what Dreamland can offer you. As a former tour guide I can say that Dreamland has a high quality service. You will not find it better if you want to go for the ultimate nature experience in Ladakh.
4,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,keepmoving48,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017,Fantastic trek from Lamayuru to Stok Kangri August 2017,"Dreamland Trek and Tour arranged our wonderful 12 day trek from Lamayuru to Stok Kangri this past August. We were a group of 8 and I was in charge of finding a local company to guide us. I was a bit nervous about making arrangements for such a trip for so many people and from so far away. Javeed’s prompt and thorough responses to my emails throughout the preceding months helped put my mind at ease. From our first meeting in Leh, I knew I had made a good decision to go with Dreamland Trek and Tour. After a few days of acclimatizing in Leh we were ready to begin our trek. Rigzen (our lead guide) and the team were so kind, hard working, helpful and always smiling. Everything went smoothly, lots of food at mealtime, flawless resupplies and transportation from starting and ending points. There were long days of hiking and numerous swollen rivers to cross but our guides were never without a smile and humble graciousness. Rigzen taught us so much about Ladakhi culture, Indian history and the surrounding mountains. I have nothing but fond memories of this trip to Ladakh and can’t thank Javeed and his group enough."
5,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,yipsh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Solo,Chader Ice trek - January 2018,"Spent almost two weeks doing Chader Ice Trek organised by Dreamland Trek and Tour on my own recently in January. Dreamland provided me with a guide, cook and 3 porters to take care of me on this trek. Logistics was well organised. The guide was very experienced and professional and ensure that i was safe throughout the trip. The cook provided simple but very tasty hot meals. The porters worked hard to ferry all the gear during the trek and helped to ensure that I was safe when we had to rock climb a short section of the route on the return journey.I would highly recommend Dreamland to others who are thinking of doing this wonderful trek through a dramatic part of India. The winter scenery is indeed very beautiful. The hike up to the settlement of Lingshed was especially beautiful amidst steep canyons and majestic winter mountain scenery. A good down jacket, winter pants, gloves and a 4-season sleeping bag are needed to keep warm but I had excellent winter weather throughout the trip and took many photos. The chader ice trek is indeed a very unique trek and you need to do it to fully appreciate the wonderful creation of nature"
6,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,J0annaWarszawa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,10 days in Ladakh - Zanskar trekking + sights of Leh - 2009,"I spent around 10 days with Dream Ladakh, some 8 years ago. I was there with 2 friends in April, just before the tourist season actually started. It was one of the best trips I ever had. Our plan was a week-long trekking tour in the Zanskar valley, but Javeed and his colleagues made sure that we planned enough time beforehand to acclimatise and that we are prepared for the adventure - equipment, health and all. Dream Ladakh took care of us right from the moment we signed up for the trip, starting from sending us a list of items and clothes we were supposed to take from home. They organised us a tour of the monasteries in the area of Leh and gave us tips about other things we could see and do. In Leh we stayed at a family-run inn also booked for us by Javeed. The family was very nice and helpful in our first days there. During the trek we had 2 companions - a guide and a cook cum quartermaster, both excellent professionals, very friendly and fun to talk and be with. They took care to adapt the day route to our physical condition, made sure we got enough rest and ate properly along the way. The area and the views left us speechless at times, I did not know such places even existed. I hope to get back there one day and if I do, I will surely join our Dream Ladakh friends again."

During that time we did a package of trekking, cycling and white water-rafting. The owners of the business Javeed and Parviz were very professional and honest.All aspects of the bookings were exactly as described and huge fun.  It was a big fear that making a booking from Australia and travelling with teenagers that the holiday may have complications but everything ran smoothly.We plan to go back!"
8,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Mar G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Wonderful experience with Dreamladack,"Dear Javed and team from Dreamladakh, our 3 weeks in India passed very rapidly and now we are back in Spain and Germany, but we still have very good memories of our journey. We want to thank you for the good organization and planning of our trip: The days in Delhi and Agra,the excursions in Ladakh-- the monastries, Nubra valley, Pangong lake-- and especially our trekking tour in the Markha valley were amazing. We want to mention your very helpful and friendly office team which could solve all problems from internet, equipment and  not working pant zippers. During our trekking tour our guide Padma showed us the the beauty of the landscape perfectly and the cook prepared amazing meals--we did not know that vegetarian meals could be so delicious!!! The tea in the morning and the warm water in the washing bowls activated our spirits at once, even in 4700m hight. Moreover the Hotel Ladakh Retreat in Leh, the Ashok Resort Hotel in Delhi and the the Mansingh Palace Hotel in Agra were a good choice and the stuff very nice and helpful."
9,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,jonhubb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Amazing Snow Leopard tour in Rumbak Valley,"I would highly recommend Javeed and his team for tours in Ladakh.  They were well organised, provided great meals and tried to make us as comfortable as possible in some tough conditions.  Javeed's communication before the tour was excellent and I would definitely use again. Also we were lucky enough to see a snow leopard (aswell as loads of other wildlife), which was amazing.  The tour was as described with no unexpected unpleasant surprises.We did the snow leopard tour with camping.  Being from the UK if possible we prefer to book directly with the country that we travel to so we know that the money is going to a local company rather than a UK company. However , it can nerve racking paying large amounts to a unknown company.  We found Dreamland trek and tour through internet searches and comparing reviews and contacting Javeed.  As mentioned his communication prior to the trip was excellent even considering time differences.  The tour itself was in the Rumbak valley and surrounds where we camped for 7 nights near the Rumbak village.  We went beginning of January so the conditions were very cold and the altitude was tough.  However, Javeed's team tried to make you comfortable as possible.  We had a tent for two and a mess tent (with gas heater, lighting and plugs to charge things) for dinners.  We were provided with sleeping bags (which were actually very cosy at -15C), sleeping mats and pillows. We were in the middle of the Himalayas in a remote area so I think they did just great.  The food they provide is varied, big quantities and wholesome.  It always amazed me how you can be up a mountain and they still proved such such great food.  On the days we went hiking down different valleys the porters brought the lunch along.  The trek itself was great.  there was loads of exciting wildlife to see and the landscapes are breathtaking. Our head guide Gyalson had a huge amount of knowledge and it was him who saw the snow leopard on our 3rd days.  We only saw one snow leopard and it was quite far away but it was amazing to see.  We also saw wolves and much more.  Things I learnt from this tour were: I need better thermal gloves and walking boots (it gets very cold) and I need better binoculars and camera (the valleys are vast, up to 1-2km across and the mountains go on and on and snow leopards are like needles in haystacks)"
0,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,Stinkyrules,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,They took amazing care of us...!,"My wife and I took a wonderful trek with Dreamland a few years ago and were truly impressed with the level of service and care they provided us.  At times during the hike my wife or I would experience some challenges related to the altitude but our guide and porters were always their to support us and assist us in completing our trek.  I've trekked in a number of parts of the world and I can honestly state that Dreamland were exceptional in guiding us to a successful completion.  Also note that the food they provided us was awesome.  When you're in the mountains and low on energy, eating and drinking is critical to having a successful trek.  I strongly recommend Dreamland for your next trek in Ladakh!"

2,Dreamland_Trek_Tour,EricSwiz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,An Unforgettable experience with Dreamladakh ,"It was an amazing winter in Ladakh, amazing in the sense that my dream of seeing a Snow Leopard came true. In Feb 2016 we hired dreamladakh for this trip including me we were five. From day one we felt that we are in safe hand and the trek was amazing Gyalson the lead guide was experienced, from his every day briefing I could imagine that he has vast knowledge about wildlife in Ladakh, beside that the cook was awsome, I can’t imagine that he can cook so many varieties in that climate, more importantly whole crew was supportive and friendly.For the first 4 days of the trek we just saw older and fresh foot prints of the Leopard, and with each passing movement my wish to the Snow Leopard was slowly dying, though with his best efforts Gyalson was also looking grim. Suddenly around 11:00 am we had an unbelievable news, Stanzin was running towards us he was sent by Dreamladakh owner Mr Javeed. Stanzin told us that there is a Kill at Matho Vaillge, that means the Leopard won’t be moving away from the kill atleast for a couple of days. Matho Village approximately 50 kms from Rumbak. Gyalson said, “look guys we have to move as soon as possible , and we won’t have to waste any time in packing our team will pack everything and will bring to Matho, so without waiting for our equipment we just took our cameras and spotting scopes and rushed to Matho Village along with Gyalson the driver and 5 of us.After the motorable road we walk for half an hour than suddenly my life time dream came true, Yes it was truly a Snow Leopard with a long tail feeding on a Blue sheep. Could you believe we kept on seeing this single leopard for complete two and half days, eating, sleeping and threatening the birds coming near his kill. I will highly recommend dreamladakh & Gyalson, WE MADE IT just because of their  efforts."

Javeed and his staff were most helpful. We organized our tour over the internet due to recommendations from friends. Javeed met us at the airport and ensured we were well looked after throughout our trip including accommodation, guides, tour drivers, pony boys - in fact the lot! We did change our trekking schedule and Javeed met the challenge, was flexible, and as a result we also squeezed in a trip across Khardung La into the Nubra Valley after our trip up the Markha and into Rupshu. We enjoyed Leh, our trek and sightseeing journeys to a very interesting land with many excellent gompa's combined with a rich cultural heritage. Dreamland kept us well physically as we went to altitude and we were pleased with their approach to the environment in Ladahk. We found Javeed and his staff to be friendly and helpful throughout. There are many tour operators in Leh, but Dreamland stands out as a professional, honest, competent and well run company."

We conducted a lot of research on good companies to hire as trekking guides, and finally decided on Dreamland. We weren't disappointed. We let them our primary interest areas, and they designed the trek that best fit our goals. The communication prior to us leaving for India was excellent and prompt, and once in Ladakh the staff was very helpful. Once on the trek, the guide was extremely knowledgeable, patient, made sure that we were able to see everything that the our trek offered. All around, excellent trip and adventure.

To organize the trek with Javeed was very nice and uncomplicated. Everything was perfect. They picked us up on the airport, drived with us to the office of Dreamland and later to the hotel. Our team on the trek was the best!!! Gyalson is the best guide ever! He told us a lot about Ladakh, the nature, the people and he showed us many animals... Lobsang spoiled us with very good food. Mingma, our climbing sherpa, worked very hard to bring us to the summit. There was a lot of soft snow. It was not important for us to reach Stok Kangri, but we did it. And also the ponyman was very kind. We had a lot of fun on the trek. I really recommend this trekking agency!!! And many, many thanks for an unforgettable trip!!"

Decided to do the Stok Kangri trek and was provided with all the necessary arrangements weeks before we arrived in Leh.Met Javeed in Leh and was briefed on the trek. Cut a long story short, company is professionally run and all pre-trip preparations were taken care of. During the trek, guides went all out to make sure we meet the objective of the trek without compromising on the safety of ALL. Even to the extent of re-routing our initial trekking route and spending an additional night in HIS home.Submitted Stok Kangri and decided to do rafting with Dreamland at Zanskar river. Javeed is generous with his advice without being pushy and  certainly no hard-selling here. If you are going to Leh for some outdoor activities, give them a call."
