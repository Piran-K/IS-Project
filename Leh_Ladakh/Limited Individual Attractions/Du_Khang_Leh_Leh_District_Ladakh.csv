0,Du_Khang,Niru64,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,The oldest monastery in Leh,"The Alchi monastery is definitely worth a visit . More than a thousand years old, it has Buddha as Avalokiteshwara, next is the   Maitri and then Manjushri. The entire wall of the sanctum is covered with beautiful small frescoes. A staircase made of a tree trunk outside the temple is a interesting conversation piece."
1,Du_Khang,SamikB2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Hidden Heritage of India,"ke you bend to get in but once you step in you will surprised to stand in front of beautiful and enormous statues of Lord Budha some of which are even about 17 feet, the murals and paintings on the mud wall of the temples still look splendid. Taking photographs inside the temples is strictly prohibited. "
2,Du_Khang,Blitzkrieg3,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Intricate Artwork,"Du-Khang is the main assembly hall that forms a part of the Alchi Monastery's sacred premises. It is the oldest structure present in the shrine and is used as the venue for religious ceremonies and rituals. The walls of Du-Khang are adorned with artistic illustrations. Intricate designs and artworks related to various Bodhisattvas and guardian deities are present on the doorway that leads to this hall. Overall, a very nice place to visit."

3,Du_Khang,BenMasai,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,Tourist invasion,"Unfortunately, this fine monastery with its exquisite ancient frescoes has become a major tourist attraction, drawing in throngs of visitors, not always well educated (""no flash please""), with the unavoidable throng of trinket sellers choking the narrow access lane. As in Egypt, the best advice is to stay overnight here or in the nearby village so you can plan an early morning and/or late visit, during proper ceremonies, before the groups and attending sellers arrive or once they have left.

6,Du_Khang,Janak V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,"Monastery's ""Mandala"" , we call "" Rangoli ""","We, witnessed four monks working on a Mandala,at one time. They were sitting on four corners, filling-in, powder colors, into the intrinsic but set pattern (representing UNIVERSE in 2 dimensions).The talk-fine, color-powder, is first,made from naturally available, colored stones,then, filled into metallic cones, with outer surface having line-grooves. One color-one cone.Monks tap the cone, gently,from outside, to drop color, at the right place and amount to fill in. There were at-least 9 different colors. They sit,for about 7 hours, every day, till completed.Theirs lips were murmuring mantra s. It takes 7 to 15 days for a group but necessarily, they complete a pattern of Mandala on the full moon day. They worship and offer Mandala to God, on that full moon day. Thereafter, they destroy this particular Mandala and start all over again."

This hall is usually the central location of a monastery and often contains the main shrine. The words Dukang, Tsogkang, Tsogchen, and Tsug Lhakang are almost identical in meaning. Most dukhangs have a small courtyard in the front in which one can see the four Lokpals and the wheel of life painted"
