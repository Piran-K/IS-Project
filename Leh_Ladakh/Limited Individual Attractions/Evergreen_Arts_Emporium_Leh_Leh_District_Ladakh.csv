0,Evergreen_Arts_Emporium,yaroslavabibabo,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Looked reputable but still cheating,"We visited this shop in mid-September with my sister. Out of all shops it stood out, looked more professional. Father and son woking there gave us very nice impression. No pushing, knowing their business. They even helped us with other shop cheating (we bought ring with faked stone and could get money back after checking stones with them). They have special tool to check real stones. So my sister found 2 similar silver rings with tiny diamonds. They were tiny and low quality but that rustic style were charming. So we bought both for less than 80€. I was concerned about stones setting but older seller told that every stone is properly set manually. They also said that if they lie then they will give 100000 Rupees back. Could be great to record his words and come back. Next day we flew to Varanasi and during one day one stone fell out. Then we discovered that they all were glued. I was so disappointed. I tried to call that shop but numbers on their card are not answering. I tried for a week. I reached manufactory frim same card, man told that he will contact them and they will call back. Never happened. In one week ring lost 2 more stones so we went to some goldsmith in Delhi, who made it worse, basically destroyed both rings. Now we decided to order new rings and use all stones from these ones. Surely we will do it at home.The moral: go to this shop only if you know your stones well or you have some pro with you, or you dont care about being cheated. Shame. I really felt those people are nice and professional. Big disappointment."

They have a decent collection of Kashmir shawls and traditional Tibetan jewellery. Different types of interesting Tibetan masks can be found here along with wall-hangings, statues etc. Good place to buy some home decor items and gifts for your friends back home."
2,Evergreen_Arts_Emporium,Peregrineri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Solo,good shop for Kashmiri shawls,"This place has quite an assortment of beautiful Kashmiri and other shawls (not so much of the local pashmina, though. This isn't the place for that.), jewelry etc. I found the quality to be good. They will be opening a much bigger place just opposite their current location within a month or two."
3,Evergreen_Arts_Emporium,gogandhi44,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 • Friends,Friendly One-Stop Shop,"The guys have Evergreen have all your bases covered: thangka tapestries; turquoise & other rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets; beautiful cashmere and wool scarves, shawls, and sweaters; singing bowls; statues & figures; masks; wall-hangings... Just about everything you might need/want to buy to bring home for yourself or as a gift. Most things are also available in a range of prices & qualities, so you can be sure to get what your budget accommodates.My friend and I first visited the shop for some scarves and found the staff very friendly, patient, and helpful. We started with a thoroughly negotiated purchase of 5 scarves on our first visit, bringing the price down to what we were quite happy to pay given the quality of the products. We returned on several later occasions to purchase more scarves, shawls, sweaters, wall-hangings and even some socks. We did our shopping around Leh and found that prices everywhere (thanks to the shop-owners' union) are relatively consistent, and so we were only too happy to remain loyal to the guys at Evergreen whose service (ample free tea to assist our decision-making) was excellent. Their patience alone, as we spent hours in the store poring over the different wares and options, was admirable enough to merit our happy patronage."
