1,Gomang_Stupa,SaddviAndalwala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 â€¢ Solo,Library was voluminous,"Rather than the Stupa, the more interesting thing was the library and museum maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India. The teachings of Lord Buddha and the sermons of King Ashoka were carved on the Stupa."
2,Gomang_Stupa,Peregrineri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 â€¢ Solo,Beautiful and peaceful,"This is one of my favorite places around Leh. I stay nearby and usually go around the stupa on my walk to town. I'm reviewing it again mainly in hopes of getting the proper photos up. The shop shown is obviously not a stupa! I tried to get them to take it down, but Tripadvisor completely ignored my request."
3,Gomang_Stupa,Peregrineri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Solo,Fascinating,"This is a beautiful stupa complex and well worth a visit. It dates back to the 9th century, though it is freshly whitewashed, giving it a more recent appearance. There are many small chortens and some carved stones. The location is peaceful and delightful, surrounded by trees."
