0,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,BfromG,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Ladakh in September,"We did a motorcycle tour through Ladakh organized by Greater Ladakh Tour.  They were excellent, friendly and took very good care of us.  The landscape was, as expected, stunning. We did the standard stuff including Nubra, Pangong Lake, Khardon-La, etc.  Punstok and Sonam were extremely helpful and took care of all our needs.  We stayed at the Chantsa in Leh.  Comfortable and centrally located with a couple of adorable Shih-tzus.  if you're picky about the accommodation, let them know and they will find more ""upscale"" - to a limit - lodging along the way.  All in all, a highly recommended trip, still off the beaten path."

Mr. Punchok was proactive and patient to answer our numerous queries.  We finally left to his best judgement to plan itinerary by keeping in mind our wish-list.Everything was good from the time we landed at Leh airport till we left Leh after 8 days with loads of memories.  Hotels selected were nice, travel itinerary was planned with clockwork precision, transportation was very comfortable.  Our drive Punchok Chuli was an excellent driver, very pleasant, always smiling and always ready to help.Barring things like hotel in Pangong and a few amenities here and there , overall our trip was just fabulous.  Thanks to Mr. Punchok."

2,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Mayank A,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Friends,Very very poor services provided by Mr Sonam and Mr phunsukh,"I booked 7N/8D package from Mr phunshuk and Mr sonam for 73000.I faced a lot of issues with these unprofessional people . 1. They took money from us for booking pangong tso hotel and when I reached there I got to know that they haven't booked hotel for us . Later I have to book my own accommodation.  When I reached to the hotel which Mr sonam has booked , hotel staff was cursing them that they Don't pay the money on time and they both are completely fraud . 2. At Nubra valley they booked magpie camp for us which lacks basic facilities like wifi , proper lighting . At the end I have to take alternative accommodation I.e hotel saser LA  which was very good and was having all the facilities. If you are going to Nubra valley avoid taking magpie camp accommodation at any cost . It will not cost more than 1500rs but these fraud travel agent will tell you that they have booked for 3500rs .3. Airport drop was included in our package but they never provided us the same . They tried to extort extra money from us for Airport drop 4 hours before our departure.  These people are highly unprofessional and avoid booking any package with them .I highly regret booking my package with these unprofessional people .The services which I have got is not at all worth the amount 73k which I have paid ."
3,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Greater Ladakh tour & travel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Couples,Highly recommended,"Unfortunately we meet this couple they booked tour package for 7N/8D. Actually this package is for 73000. Before they booked the package we gave them day by day itinerary details and accomodation details. They also checked by internet then they say ok then they paid 5000 advanced. After they arrived Leh when they checked at the hotel then we asked for rest of the money but they said they are tired and pay in the evening o tomorrow. At that we are busy and they left to Nubra. After 4 days when they came back they start complaining actually they don't want to pay the amount and they said all this places have no  internet connection
After arguing they paid only 69000 and also they didn't pay the cab driver Mr Dorjay if anyone speak to him his contact number is 9469712289 
They said Mr. Dorjay to take some more places they told they will pay extra but after they came back to hotel they didn't pay they said they will pay in the morning but unfortunately they ran from our hotel at 3:00am like a thief.
Right now I will busy as soon as possible i will send you CCTV footage 
We are not fraud actually this couple is fraud.

All our properties were great,  I would highly recommend to book your Next Leh Ladakh trip with them."
6,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,ashishvetmed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,My experience,"I travel quite widely around the world and have had all kinds of experiences with tours and tour operators, ranging from pathetic to blissful. This company managed by Panchok Tsering tops my list of most blissful experiences. My Ladakh tour and trek trip threw all kinds of challenges from the beginning to the end. My friend fell sick and we kept changing the itinerary. Finally, we had to abandon the trip half way through as I had a personal emergency. Throughout the ill-fated trip, Panchok kept his cool, answered all our questions, and even partially refunded the tour cost. Frankly, I wouldn't have been so generous if I were him. Panchok knows Ladakh in and out and personally makes sure everything is going to plan and customers are happy. In a remote place like Ladakh subjected to severe weather conditions, flexibility and empathy are key to customer service and Panchok goes beyond the call of duty and commercial considertions to make you happy. I would whole heartedly recommend his tour company and hotel."
7,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Pranali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,I will see you soon!!,"The travel agency is run single handedly by Mr. Phunchok who appears to be a sincere but busy person. Tours include a stay at hotel Greater Ladakh Residency at Leh. The hotel is newly built and has comfortable rooms. Staff is very courteous. Food was superb. However, our tour was ruined by an errant driver (Stanzin) arranged by the travel agency which was with us for Nubra valley and Pangong tour. He drove the vehicle at very high speed  on mountain roads and ignored our pleas to slow down. I strongly recommend that fellow travellers should ask for experienced and mature driver for their tour especially if you are travelling with little children."
8,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Ramit Bhattachary,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Best travel guide in Leh,It was a very comfortable trip and if you are fun loving then you will definitely enjoy it.

9,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Guddu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Friends,Superb hospitality... Home away from Home.,"I landed on Leh on 5th March and the flight attendant announced it's ""It's 2 degree Celsius outside "", and I got very excited. We went outside and it was freezing cold and waited for our guide, Mr. Phunsuk. He as usual had arrived at the airport and welcomed us with a big smile saying 'Julley'. He made sure that we enjoy to the fullest from the beginning and at every place and stay. We visited Leh during a bit off time, that is in winter and everywhere we could just see snow. The roads were slippery but they made sure that we are equipped with proper tires and maximum safety. There are many more things that I would like to write I guess, but for now I would say ""I am looking forward to see you soon Phunsuk!!"""
10,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Milan Gupta,,,,"I met Phunshuk, who arranged all the accommodations with a very cheap rates. This guy is truly amazing, his packages are worth the trip. The cab driver (Dorjay) ensured all the necessities and took care of everything that was needed. Phunshuk and Dorjay you guys are simply awesome, can’t wait for another trip. A big Thank you ❤️"

2,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Sankalp Agrawal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,AMAZING ARRANGEMENTS FOR LADAKH BIKE TRIP,"Our trip was organised by Mr.Punchonk and his colleague Sonam..Founder of Greater Ladakh Tours and Travels. I got their contact from TripAdvisor Only. After watching their reviews on TripAdvisor I decided to go with them only. We were a group of 8 People.Tour was organised in this way:Manali-Jispa-Leh-Nubrah Valley-PangongLake-Leh-Kargil-Srinagar.Manali-Jispa-Leh was done by Private Traveller arranged by them. Driver was very knowledgeable and very much friendly and traveller had ample of space as it was 12 seater and we were just 8. Stay at Jispa in a tent was awesome under the stars shining on our head in the dark night. Food provided was average.Next day we departed early from Jispa and Reached Leh in the evening by the same traveller. Hotel booked in the Leh was very good and their hospitality was incomparable. Hotel had good lawns,parks and outdoor sitting with big tables. We really enjoyed that evening in the leh.Next day Mr.Punchonk came to our hotel and provided us a local sim for few days so that we can contact pur family members because other states sim doesnt work there except postpaid connections. He came with 4 Bullets(Royal Enfield Bike commonly known as Bullets in India) and all the Riding Gears for all the riders. For him Safety and Enjoyment both is equally important. He then suggested me to visit local tourist places of Leh that day and took us to the various famous places of leh and surroundings Like Shey Palace,Rancho School,Various Monastries,War Memorials etc. That day we had so much of fun with a relaxed and cool mindset. We also rode our respective bikes for approx 50km that day and got accustomed with it. At the end of the day we came back to our hotel and had sumptuous dinner placed in buffet by the hotel.Next day Early Morning A Jeep Came for us as in Backup Vehicle whose driver was very funny and helping. We left for the Nubrah Valley with our respective bikes and partners following that Backup Vehicle. Backup Vehicle had all the major bike parts including Tyres,Rims,Clutch Plate,Breakshoe etc which can be utilised if anyone of us need that. He was carrying all our permits and helped us in many ways. He knew everything about the routes,places,temperatures,and Oxygen Availability etc. We climbed Khardung-la- Pass with all ease with our bikes and reached Nubrah Valley in the evening. That day we did some camel ride and stayed in A tent. They also organised a Bonfire for us. We enjoyed a lot but were tired too because of riding around 140km that too on rough and off roads.Next day we started our journey to pangong lake and this days was the most scary and adventurous. We had to cross several Water and River Crossings. I once fell down while crossing a river with my bike but my backup vehicle driver immediately came to rescue. In that small accident my Rim of the front tyre of the bike got damaged and he immediately changed it with a backup one which was kept in backup vehicle. As soon as we got the first Glimpse of Pangong Lake.. We were overjoyed and happy to see that All Blue Water lake.. Another 135km was accomplished by us. There also we were provided a tent stay for the night with good food..In evening We took a hell lot of pics over there and enjoyed a lot. It was the coldest place which I felt in the whole trip.Next day again we took some pics of us with that Beautiful Giant Blue Lake and then departed for Leh..It was 160km Travelling. But Riding Bike for such long hours had now become an easy task for us and we were enjoying it. Several Water Crossings we passed..Crossed Much more Passes and reached Leh again and checked into the same hotel again by 4PM.Thereafter we surrendered our bikes to Mr.Punchonk with all the riding gears.Next day He arranged a minibus for us which took us to the Kargil..and From there they took us to the Srinagar. We were tired a lot so we could not enjoy Srinagar and Kargil Much and the Bus Driver was also not supportive and friendly but since it was on our wishlist..we did it.And then after the next day of reaching Srinagar we took our flights back to Kolkata with happy memories.Suggestion: Do not include Kargil and Srinagar in your trip..it will unnecessarily prolong the duration of the trip with a tired mind and body. Its not like Srinagar or Kargil are not good, but they require atleast 4-5 days to enjoy those places. Mr.Punchonk & Mr.Sonam are the best buddies to book the trip for Ladakh. Thumbs up 👍 for them that they managed the trip in such a great manner. Thank you Greater Ladakh Tour & Travels and People of J&K for being so nice and welcoming."

6,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,YP Kishore,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Ladakh trip_Aug/Sept 2019,"We were a big group of 18, ages ranging from 11 to 64. The group consisted of 3 kids and 15 adults. Travelled with Greater Ladakh Tour & Travel. A big thank you to Mr Punchok Tsering for organising everything so wonderfully well. Requested him to arrange pick up on arrival at Delhi airport in 4 Innovas and transport us to Chandigarh . He organised everything right from pick-up at Delhi airport on 27th Aug 2019 to dropping us at Leh airport on 6th Sept. I corresponded with him on Whatsapp for nearly 6 weeks prior to the tour and not once did he pressurise us for money in any way. In fact it was the other way around. I was asking him when to transfer the money to his account and Mr Punchok was saying ""baad mein kariye sir, no hurry"". I paid him the last few thousands on the day prior to our departure. The hotels he gave us, especially the one in Leh (Hotel Chantsa was outstanding) were uniformly good. The only day which we felt was very difficult was on the 4th day when we travelled from Jispa to Tso Moriri lake and some members of our group fell sick due to AMS. All four Innovas were equipped with oxygen cylinders right from Jispa onwards and he also provided water bottles in all vehicles. All in all. I would rate Mr Punchok's services with 5 stars.I can say with conviction that I will definitely go with Mr Punchok and his team in our planned future visit to Leh when it's a bit colder (probably in April/May a cpl of years later)"

They organized a tour and a trek for us and services were very far from what we expected. The most shocking part was when we realized that they were planning to make us drive inside a national park whereas it was clearly forbidden. When we told our guide that we wanted to walk instead of driving where we were not supposed to, he almost laughed at us. Punchok should give more awareness about environment to his team, that's also what clients expect."

Mr. Phunchok Tsering, owner of Greater Ladakh Tours was a gem of a person. He had sent us detailed itinerary on whatsapp with price details much prior to our visit. We were a group of three and the prices were reasonable for a taxi (Innova) tour around Leh including major places like Khardung La, Nubra Valley and Chang La and other places in and around Leh. Namgyal (our driver) was excellent and made up on time at every place despite the road blocks and punctures. When we were stranded near Shyok Valley and couldn't return on the same day, the owner immediately arranged another homestay at Tang Se, around  some 55kms from Pangong Lake. They even provided us two motorcycles on our request at no extra cost instead of the taxi on the last day which was a really fine gesture.Overall, we were very much satisfied and would definitely recommend all to consider Greater Ladakh Tours on your visit to Leh."

It was a fantastic adventure in a most beautiful place.For the first part I needed a bike with a very comfortable pillion seat so I used a R.E. Classic 500 and for the rest I used a R.E.Himalayan. Both bikes were new and never missed a beat.I have travelled riding bikes in many other countries in Asia and I can easily say that Mr Phunchok has provided the best service I've ever had.I highly recommend his professional services: Organizing good bikes, The support car, The permits, Hotels, Taxies, Tickets and specially: a fantastic and caring guide who is also a most brilliant mountain's rider and driver.For the people reading this, Ladakh is beautiful.

2,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,ananth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Mesmerised by the myriad hues of ladakh,"When we decided to go for a trip to ladakh, i was little hesitant since i had not been to anywhere so far.when i looked for travel agents who would guide us through the trip, i chanced upon the name Greater ladakh tour in one of my late evening net surfing. Behold that moment for it turned out to be the turning point for the whole trip! These guys were having some good reviews on internet and the fact that they are from leh itself reiterated my faith in them. We were 4 in total, i.e 2 couples and planned for a 9 day/8 night trip. Mr. Phunchok tsering, the alpha of the team greater ladakh, helped us by chalking out a great itinerary for the whole trip. It included 1day at srinagar, two days enroute to leh from srinagar and rest of days in leh and surroundings. Everything was arranged and all the guys involved were so hospitable that i cant imagine how the trip would have ended without them. Kotroo palace houseboat at srinagar was the stay arranged in srinagar and it was a nice beginning for the trip to come. Stay in kargil at dzojila was another good  arrangement.Hotel sand dune at nubra was also welcoming after a tiring days journey via the Khardungla pass and all. All staff in these hotels were cordial, friendly and helpful. And what can be said about hotel oriental in leh! Oriental was a home away from home. We stayed there for 5 nights in total and each time coming back  there was like coming home. All the staff were cordial and helpful,and the owner/s was itself a gem of a peraon. We wish to be back there ma'am😊Our rider Namgyal was another revelation. We could simply close our eyes and rely on this guy for driving through the extreme terrain of ladakh for he is an expert driver. All the good things happened in our trip bcoz of the efforts put in by the ever smiling Phunchok in organising everything. The best thing was the flexibility available in the plan for we could customize it in between the trip also. The ladakh turned out to be one of the best trips we had and all credit goes to the meticulous planning done by Phunchok and team. We would recommend this guy for anyone in need of a good time in ladakh. Moreover, i heard he is exceptional in providing bike tours and treks in ladakh. So, thanks phunchok for the wonderful memories and hope to see you soon in another trip to leh. 😊"

They provided us with the best of Ladakh tour with Shanti Stupa, Lehl Palace, Stok Kangri, Pangong Tso, monasteries and many more.  Phunchok and his group were very accommodating to our needs for this trip and flexible to change anything in our itinerary without adding additional costs.  Phunchok arranged transportation for us to and from Leh airport and we were taken to our accommodation at the beautiful Hotel Oriental (see review here: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297625-d1165223-Reviews-Oriental_Guest_House-Leh_Leh_District_Ladakh_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html); he met with us later that afternoon.  After checking to see if we were interested, he arranged for a transportation to Shanti Stupa, Leh Palace, and Leh Market (note these weren’t part of the original itinerary).  We had planned a trek to Stok Kangri base camp but had to cut it short by one day (due to altitude sickness).  Our guide Gyaltsen (who had summited several mountains in the region) was extremely patient and understanding with our pace of getting up to Mankarmo base camp; he even arranged the kitchen staff at Mankarmo to make ginger soup to help with mild altitude sickness.  Having one extra day- the guides arranged additional monastery tours for us.  Then, we were off to Pangong Tso which still feels surreal. Thank you Greater Ladakh tour and travel for such a memorable trip!"

Never thought i would be citing leh as an example in such trips. Greater Laddakh tours gave us the beautiful experience which we yearn but never get. These guys (Mr punchok tesirng specially) made sure we didn't had to worry about a single thing while we were there.Given that we just had to corroborate on phone, the expertise with which he planned and executed our vacation was amazing. The hotels were simply fabulous and the car, bike/scooty were well maintained and economic.Even in a time of snag where we were stuck on khardungla because of bad weather resulting in cancellation of hotel in nubra, mr punchok made sure that we had another beautiful hotel waiting for us to rest peacefully without additional cost.The only way i can find for returning the favour to mr punchok for such a memorable and care free vacation is by writing this review.If you are visiting leh laddakh please make sure you at least call Mr punchok once.I assure you he will convince you for the best experience at the lowest price and then he'll go ahead and deliver that experience."

Had also gone through the great reviews people had for him mentioned on this travel portal. And yes all were right about him. He had arranged the trip for us wonderfully with arrangements (as discussed earlier) well taken care of.

Punchok is a warm hearted, professional and fun loving host who will take care of all your biking needs with a smile. He is more worried about the safety and security of the guests and helps you with all the tips you will need for your trip. All the bikes are in top condition and personally inspected by Punchok. He is accessible and help you with all your stupid and smart queries. Highly recommended and I am a customer for life!! Thanks @Greater Ladakh Tours & Travels to make the trip glitch free and fun! All the best!"
2,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,Tan T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Best road trip ever,"We, me and two friends from Vietnam, just completed a 14 day Ladakh bike trip in July 2018 arranged by Mr. Phunchok from Greater Ladakh Tour and Travel; and I had to admit that it was totally beyond our expectation. I've been to many road trips then this is the BEST ONE so far. We were so impressed with the hospitality of local people and extremely stunning landscapes of this land.  Mr. Phunchok and his support team always took care of every single detail (bike, lodging, paperwork, itinerary, etc.,) to secure that we could enjoy our trip without any hesitation. Special thanks to Mr. Gawa, our happy-go-lucky guide who escorted us from beginning to the end, provided us with lots of useful infor and funny stories."

Very happy with the quality of vehicles (the bikes were RF Himalayan) that Greater Ladakh provided. Their mechanics walked us through the bike essentials, allowed us to test them & tuned the bikes based on our feedback, all before starting the trip.Our route went through offbeat places like Agham-Shoyk, Chushul & Hanle and got a lot of help from Mr. Punchok in organising ILP permits as well as carrying spare fuel.All in all a very pleasant experience and will definitely default to choosing Greater Ladakh in my next trip to Leh."

7,Greater_Ladakh_Tour_Travel,RavneetBal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Great experience with Greater Ladakh,"While searching for tour operators for Leh Ladakh, I came across Greater Ladakh on TripAdvisor and thought to give it a try after reading some positive reviews. Punchok was really helpful and answered all my queries patiently. He also suggested to travel directly from Nubra to Pangong via Shyok river and getting 3 days in Leh for acclimatization. I'm glad that I went ahead and booked the tour.Punchok arranged permits on time despite it being public holiday before leaving for Nubra and was in no hurry to take the complete payment. Driver for our trip was an experienced one with good knowledge of all the routes. Special mention for hotel at Leh - Hotel Oriental. Lovely small property with clean rooms, nice food and helpful owner. Overall had an awesome trip and I would highly recommend Greater Ladakh to anyone planning a trip there."
