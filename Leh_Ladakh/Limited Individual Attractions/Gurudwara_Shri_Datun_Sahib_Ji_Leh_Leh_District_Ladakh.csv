Shri Guru Nanak Sahib Ji visited this site around 1517. The ancient 'sacred' Datun tree which many people believe is the biggest and the oldest tree alive, was actually planted by Shri Guru Nanak Sahib Ji during his missionary travels. Considered to be sacred by the city's residents,  the tree was the first tree to grow in the area. At the time of the Guru's visit the high desert had no trees as only small shrubs and bushes would grow at the high, arid altitude. There is no Gurdwara building at the site, but the remains of a large meswak tree are located. A small board relating the history of the Guru's visit and his planting of the young neem tree has been erected on a fence, which encircles the tree."

Its a Muslim dominated area and the Jama Masjid is also nearby. At the end of the street (towards the market) there is a Neem Tree and its believed that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji used the Datun (Stick used for chewing and cleaning teeth) from this tree. Gurudwara Sahib is built around this Tree. There is hardly any place around the tree because its a narrow street and therefore the Gurudwara Sahib is now built at a higher place next to the Tree.  "

A meswak tree grew from that same twig and its twigs are used to cure people's diseases, hence the name Datun Sahib. But unfortunately, not enough being done for the gurudwara and there is a limitation of land also. It is in the Leh main market. A must visit."
