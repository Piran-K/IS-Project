The light and sound show along with laser is a must visit. The entry ticket to the Hall of Fame appears to be quite high, charging 250/- IR seems steep, maybe authorities can decide on providing a memorabilia or small memento. The south Indian restaurant along the Hall of Fame is a must visit, has authentic south indian food and excellent hospitable staff."
5,Hall_of_Fame,Aimless Vagabonds,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,"Stories of Ladakh and of the Indian Army, all under one roof!","Its surprising how many themes they have been covered in a little space.

The way the soldiers tell the stories gave me goosebumps."

8,Hall_of_Fame,Hadi1004,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Informational museum. Helpful soldiers.,"For non-locals, you have to pay 500 Indian rupees for entrance fee which also includes the light show there which only starts at 8pm (if I'm not wrong as we visited the museum in the afternoon). And pay another 20 Indian rupees to bring in your mobile phones. Need to pay by card, they don't accept cash. Fortunately our local driver was agreeable to use his card to pay. There are also guides provided who are veterans but unfortunately they don't provide English-speaking tours. Good thing that the informational boards (about the culture and history of ladakh, and past wars with china and Pakistan) and artefacts (e.g. captured items like guns and diaries from the other countries) inside the museum are written in English.We went on a Saturday and there were loads of people especially in one of their main indoor area. Abit worried since none were masked except for us. There is also an outdoor area which isn't much.Also, we have to commend the efforts from the young soldiers who tried to converse and explain the info to us in English even though English is not their strength. Overall an enjoyable and educational visit. "
9,Hall_of_Fame,ROOPshila’Shaggy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,Proud patriotic well-labelled museum honouring our defence personnel.,"Gives one Goosebumps to witness the Defence gallantry! Ticket window closes for like much till 2:30PM , charges per head are 250 ₹. Earlier the same tickets could be used for Zorawar Fort within a week. Not any more . Also remember that too ekting charges are payable only by Card . Yes, an ex-service MA’M can be hired as a guide by a group of five for an extra 500. Another tip is to take the roun from the opposite direction , because every one rushes to the right side room & it becomes too congested there. For mobiles & cameras extra charge are levied. The washroom is clean in the far corner nd of the car parking . Also the Aroma Cafe is a good place to spend your waiting time ."
