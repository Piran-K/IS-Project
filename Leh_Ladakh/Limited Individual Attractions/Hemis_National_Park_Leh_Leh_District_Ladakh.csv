1,Hemis_National_Park,David G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Winter time what an experience!,I camped just short of the village of Rumbak in Hemis National Park. Camping in winter there is a great experience as long as you're ready for the cold. Overnight it got down to -25c but the Austrian Army issue down sleeping bags did the trick. We were also fortunate enough to spot 3 snow leopards while here. A mum and 2 cubs attacked a heard of blue sheep. A sight I'll never forget.
2,Hemis_National_Park,arvind1000,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Definitely Worth visiting this Monastery ,"Hemis monastery is one of the oldest monasteries in Ladakh and has existed before the 11th century. It is further down from Tiksey monastery on the Leh- Srinagar road and about 45 km from Leh. Hemis monastery also has a museum as part of its complex which is worth visiting. It has many statues of Buddha in various forms including Maitreya, Tara, etc. There are a number of temples and prayer halls as part of the monastery. The one which fascinated me most was the one dedicated to and with a statue of Lord Padmasambhava ( Guru Rinpoche), believed to be a reincarnate of Buddha. The annual Hemis festival honouring Padmasambhava is held every year. "

Landscapes are gorgeous and you feel absolutely alone and into the wild. Few possibilities for food (shang sumdo, chogdo, nimaling and then nothing!). You will find water all along the way."

It can not be seen from the main road and its now only that its accessible due to the road constructed to reach here. Its one of the richest monastery of Leh and Laddakh.
1,Hemis_National_Park,mark10r,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Trekking through nature and traditional villages,"Markha Valley trek through Hemis NP was a wonderful way to experience the dramatic landscapes, ancient chortems and mani walls, and fascinating villages of this amazing part of Ladakh. We stayed in family run home stays each night that were comfortable and food was excellent. Carry plenty of water and allow lots of time between villages. While challenging this was a very rewarding trek and the 5200m pass above Nimilang a highlight. "
2,Hemis_National_Park,Lovers_paradise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018,"Spot the wildlife at Hemis National Park, Leh","Hemis High Altitude National Park is a hilly and rough high elevation desert located in the eastern section of Ladakh. The Park is spread in the beautiful Markha Valley and Rumbak Valley of the Ladakh. The normal altitude of the Park is more than 3,000 meters. The Park is very famous for exceptional snow leopards and the ibex. One can see the snow leopards very easily in the Shang valley of Hemis National Park. Hemis National Park is a paradise for bird watchers as well."
3,Hemis_National_Park,Balisc,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,A Wildlife Enthusiast's Paradise,This is a place for the daring and adventurous. Western trekkers visit during the winters to photograph the snow leopard and other fauna. The villages in this park offer home stays. The treks can be arranged by most tourism agencies in Ladakh.
4,Hemis_National_Park,Clive T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018,Fabulous trip to see the snow leopards in Hemis National Park,Camping in the Rumbakh Valley and then trekking in the mountains to see the snow leopards was an amazing experience.  We saw three snow leopards including one female who had just made a kill and stayed with it for a few days providing ample photographic opportunities. Our local guides were amazing and our group was exceptionally well looked after.  Our snow leopard spotters worked tirelessly and were able to find two snow leopards within site of our camp.

We saw some very nice high altitude birds and animals including blue sheep, red fronted serin ,chukar and rosefinches. It it is isolated from people which makes sighting wildlife easier. You will not get the non-wildlife  lover  crowd here like in many other parks in India."

9,Hemis_National_Park,SivaramSi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Solo,Thrilling hiking experience at Hemis,"Drive to Hemis is very thrilling - winding roads, deep gorges, Indus flowing through the valley down below, cold mountain air, remoteness, dry mountains, clear sky - it was a phenomenal ride to rememberAt the time of my visit, there was less snow so the apex predator of the region - snow leopard remained elusive but we saw plenty of the prey - himalayan tahr and witnessed their agile climbing on sharp and steep rocks of Hemis"
0,Hemis_National_Park,Sathya S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Unique park,"We trekked through portions of this park. It is greener than most of Ladakh. The pretty stream with the trees and flowers on its banks soothes the senses. We were lucky to see marmots sunning themselves and blue sheep in the distance. Also a golden eagle and many other birds. This is also where the snow leopard roams in dead winter but vanishes into the heights with the onset of summer and tourists.Anyway, as is well known, he is an elusive, almost invisible beast! You can drive in up to a point to enjoy the sanctuary which is not what you normally expect a sanctuary to be considering the inhospitable nature of the region's topography. The rest of the park is for those who are physically and mentally equipped to trek through it. Except for remote villages there is absolutely no other habitation in the park, which is a good thing. "
1,Hemis_National_Park,667marians,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,"Markha Valley, independent trekking","We did this trek starting from Jingchan, thus the trek comprised passing of two high passes: Kanda La (4973 m) and Kongmaru La (5287 m). Not many trekkers do it independently, most of tourists hire at least a guide, and majority prefer “sahib” trekking, which means that all gear is carried by a caravan of donkeys and mules. Still, this trek can be done fully independently and actually you have not to be very fit to complete this amazing route. In every village there are several homestays where accommodation and meals are available. So, it is not necessary to take tents and food. The only exception is water, and it is a good idea to have sterilization drops to sterilize refilled water and not to buy new bottles, which is not good for the environment. The cost of room and meals (this includes dinner, breakfast and packed lunch) in 2016 was 1000 rupees/person. This price was the same in every village, except for tents in Nimaling, where it was 1200 rupees/pp. Here is our itinerary, with modifications to the routine schedules offered by travel agencies, and some tips and tricks. We did this trek in the beginning of September are there were only a few tourists on the entire route. In high season (July-August) there are probably more tourists and a possible shortage of homestays.Acclimatization in Leh before the trekUsually, it is recommended to stay in Leh at least 3 days before starting the trek. This is because Leh is situated at the altitude of 3,500 m, which carries a high risk of altitude mountain sickness (AMS), and this risk is even higher if you start ascending when not properly acclimatized. Thus, these 3 days of rest are recommended. Still, most travel agencies on the 1st day of the trek take tourists from Leh (3500 m) up to Yurutse (4150 m), or even to Kanda La base camp (4450 m). This seems to be too fast ascent, and indeed you can find many reports by people complaining of AMS symptoms at such an itinerary. Our plan was to shorten acclimatization in Leh to 2 days, but to add one day of trekking at a lower altitude before crossing Kanda La pass.Acclimatization Day 1If you arrive to Leh by air you will be immediately hit by thin air and low oxygen concentration. It is better to do almost nothing at this first day, as even going upstairs can be a big challenge. All planes land in Leh in the morning, so you will have full day to relax. After half day of  rest we had a short (and slow!) walk in the afternoon.Acclimatization Day 2It is a good opportunity to check your acclimatization. There are several opportunities of a short trips within Leh city. One is to visit Leh Palace and then Namgyal monastery. The monastery is about 300 m above Leh, thus it is a good acclimatization trip and because of the visiting, you will not ascend too fast. Then, in the other part of Leh, there is a picturesque Shanti Stupa, at a similar altitude as Namgyal monastery. Also, you can visit the town, do the shopping, buy or rent trekking equipment. It is a good idea to arrange transportation for the next day, it can be done by hotel staff (taxi prices are fixed, so it does not matter who arranges the car; bargaining is not an issue in this part of India).Trekking Day 1. Jingchan-Rumbak (altitude: 3850 m)You can start your trek if you are somewhat acclimatized. If you still feel weak, suffer from headache or other mild symptoms of AMS, you should stay in Leh for another day (or even descent to another location downstream the Indus valley). Jingchan-Rumbak trek is quite short, so it is not needed to take a taxi early in the morning. I would recommend taking the taxi directly to Jingchan. A cheaper option is to take a bus to Spituk and then walk to Jingchan. Still, it would be a boring walk on a tarmac through a desert in full sun. The trek to Rumbak should not be difficult. The altitude gain is about 400 m, and even if you walk very slowly it should take 3-4 hours including rests. The proper path is usually obvious, yet in some areas there is more than 1 path (in a case of doubt follow the boot tracks or the freshest donkey poos). After several kilometers there is a parachute “restaurant”, where you can have some tea or instant soup. There is a bifurcation of the treks at this parachute restaurant. The path to the right goes towards Yurutse and most of trekkers follow this trail. Instead, we went to the left towards Rumbak village, situated at a lower altitude than Yurutse. There should not be a problem with finding a homestay in Rumbak, since not many tourists come here. Trekking Day 2. Rumbak-Yurutse (altitude: 4150 m)Also a short and easy day, about 2-3 hours maximally. There is only one house in Yurutse. Since there are only a few rooms available in Yurutse, it is better to start the trek early and arrive to Yurutse before the arrival of organized tourists, who start their trek from Jingchan. It is very easy to find the route. Firstly you backtrack your yesterday trek up to the parachute restaurant at the bifurcation (again a good opportunity to have a nice cup of tea), and then you should follow the obvious path towards Yurutse. The only problem is crossing a small stream just after the restaurant. In September it was not necessary to remove shoes, yet in July and August there can be more water and fording may be inevitable. In the afternoon it is possible to have an acclimatization trip to the Kanda La base camp. There is a parachute restaurant here and it is possible to have a cup of tea before returning to Yurutse.Trekking Day 3. Yurutse - Kanda La (altitude: 4973 m) - Shingo (altitude: 4130 m)This is probably the most difficult day. Although Kanda La is lower than Kongmaru La, but altitude gain is higher. The other problem on day 3 is that you should take quite a lot of water, since it is not available above Kanda La base camp (half an hour from Yurutse) until Shingo village; 3 liters per person is a must. A heave gear and low oxygen concentration are not good combination. The trekkers from organized groups carry only a small backpack, while the remaining things are carried by mules. It is possible to hire some mules in Yurutse to carry your backpacks to Kanda La, and we met some independent tourist who did it. There is a lot of wildlife in the area of Kanda Laː marmots, blue sheep, Himalaya hares, and eagles - just look around you. Descent from Kanda La is quite easy and there should not be a problem with finding the way. There are 3 homestays in Shingo (we stayed at Khangpa-pa homestay, with hot shower possible). Some guidebooks suggest further descent up to Skyu, but it would be at least 3 hours of trekking (possibly more, taking into account that you will be tired after crossing Kanda La).Trekking Day 4. Shingo - Skyu (altitude: 3400 m)Easy day, 3-4 hours of trekking. A descent though colorful canyon to the Markha valley, with obvious path and no river fordings. In Skyu there is a nice small monastery and ruins of a royal palace.If you do not want to have a relax day, it is possible to walk towards Markha village. There is a homestay in Sara, about 10 km from Skyu. In high season it is also possible to stay in a tented homestay, which is a few km before Sara. Both options would shorten a long walk from Skyu to Markha (still, in high season there may be a shortage of beds).  Trekking Day 5. Skyu  - Markha (altitude: 3800 m)It is a long day of trekking in a nearly flat terrain, more than 20 km, and at least 8 hours (usually more) of walking. The route goes along Markha river and it crosses the river several times. In September it was not necessary to ford the river, but in the summer, when more water comes from melting glaciers, be prepared for many fordings. Usually it is not difficult to find the proper path. However, Markha valley is built of loose sedimentation rocks that are constantly and quite fast carved by the river. All trails that are situated at the slopes above Markha river are doomed to be destroyed by erosion (in a years and not centuries perspective). You should not use a path hanging above the river without fresh boot tracks on such a path, since it could be a dangerous trap. Also, many details of the trek depicted in the guidebooks are no longer valid because of changing terrain.In Markha, the biggest village in the valley, there are about 20 homestays, so there should not be a problem with accommodation. If you have enough time, it is possible to visit local monastery.Trekking Day 6. Markha - Hankar (altitude: 4000 m)This day you will continue ascent along Markha river. Unless the locals are building a bridge across Markha river, there will be at least one fording. Look where other people cross the river, and if nobody is seen – you should use the widest section of the river (not the narrowest one, since wider part of the river will be shallower, and the water will flow not so fast). Use trekking polls for security. About 5 km after Markha village there is Umlung village with several homestays and a parachute restaurant. Before Umlung village you will see a monastery unbelievable built on a high rock (worth visiting if time allows). In Hankar there are some homestays in the lower part of the village, and another homestay in the upper part of the village, with a nice view at Kang Yatze – the highest peak in this area (6400 m). Trekking Day 7. Hankar – Nimaling (altitude: 4850 m)Difficult day, about 12 km and 850 m of altitude gain, but with superb views and a lot of wildlife along the trek. First few kilometers involve navigating along Markha stream, with a possibility of some fordings (depending on water level and status of the path hanging above the stream). Some 2 km after upper Hankar the valley divides: to the left goes a proper trek to Nimaling, to the right the trek via uninhabited Langtang valley.In high season there should be a parachute restaurant ata  campsite of Thachungtse (in September it was closed). Still, it is a good idea to have a rest in Thachungtse (4250 m) before the steep climbing begins. There are a lot of picas (a smaller version of marmot) in this area, playing on the rocks.After a steep ascent you will finally arrive to small lake at the altitude of 4700 m. If you climb a few meters above this lake you would encounter other lakes, and a view towards Kang Yatze is simply breathtaking. After several more kilometers of walking among picas and marmots you will reach Nimaling. Here there is a tented restaurant and a lot of tents to stay in. Accommodation in Nimaling is slightly more expensive compared to other villages; in 2017 it was 1200 rupees per person, meals inclusive. Nimaling is perhaps the only place where having a sleeping bag is a good idea, since it can be really very cold and windy at night (the tents are provided with blankets, as other homestays are, but the place is really cold).If the weather is good and you are not in rush (and not frozen after the night) it is possible to stay in the area for one or two days. Local trips may involve a walk to Kang Yatze base camp (5100 m) or even ascending the slope above Nimaling (6000 m; no rock or ice climbing needed to get to such a high altitude).Trekking Day 8. Nimaling – Kongmaru La (altitude: 5200 m) – Chokdo (altitude: 3850m)A long day. Although Kongmaru La is the highest point of the trek, there should not be a problem with trekking to the pass, which is almost 400 m above Nimaling. You should cross the stream and the route to the pass is obvious. As you will ascent, the views toward Kang Yatze and neighbor 6000+ m peaks, and also distant Zanskar Range are fantastic. Also, there are plenty of fearless picas and marmots (except for the moments when an eagle approaches and tries to catch something for lunch). After a short break at Kongmaru La and obligatory breathtaking vistas, there will be a long descent through beautiful colorful canyons. The descent is similar to the trek from Shingo to Skyu (Day 4), still it is much longer. Finally there will be a parachute restaurant in Chuskyumo and a few kilometers further down homestays in Chokdo. If it is not late and you are not very tired, it is possible to proceed to Shang Sumdo village and return to Leh by taxi the same day (see Day 9)Trekking Day 9. Chokdo – Shang Sumdo (altitude: 3800m)An easy 2 h walk downhill. Once you approach the village you will see some taxis waiting for tourists (it the guidebooks you can find descriptions of Markha trek ending in Hemis, but currently the road begins in Shang Sumdo and probably it won’t be very interesting to walk among cars). Yet, it may be a good idea to have a break in Hemis and visit its famous monastery, just ask the taxi driver for a possibility."
2,Hemis_National_Park,Udaya Nayak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Hemis National Park- Rumbak Village,"It was only the third day during our Leh Trip, we took a trek to Hemis National park. The starting point is around 25 kms from Leh town and will take around 75 mins. The road to park is amazing views of the valley and really a very adventurous road. Hardly any traffic throughout the road journey.At the starting point of the trek , it is barricaded and chained and no vehicle can go beyond the starting point. It is around 8 kms to the Hemis National park and will take 3 hours to reach the Park and half the time to return.Initial around 2.5 kms of the trek is a decent mud road and rest all is typical trekking path .Throughout the trek, U will get wonderful views of the mountains and water streams.You are sure to meet many fellow trekkers , few of them from overseas. We met people from France, Israel and From England. Carry enough water and eatables. Only at the top , you will be getting water,refreshments and snacks.We had to terminate our trek just before the Rumbak Village as my Daughter started showing AMS symptoms and we had to return back.You require complete 8 -9 hours to complete the trek"

For a start, it was an unforgettable experience and will forever remain so !The harshest winter months begin towards the end of December and continue for over 45 days, so there we were in Mid Jan, the warmer temperatures being around (minus )- 10 deg cel and peaking to ( minus)- 25 deg cel at night ! And we were in tents camping by the side of the frozen River Indus !The terrain is mountainous. altitudes range from 11500 feet at Leh and nearly 14000 feet at Rumbak.Moderate to Good Physical fitness is needed as well as an adequate amount of preparation by reading up on AMS ( Altitude Mountain Sickness ), Sub Zero Temperature Outdoor Living, Suitable Clothing and Gear for such climate, etc. The more prepared you are, the easier it is to adjust.Diamox ( Acetalozomide ) tablets are advisable under doctor supervision, of course. makes it easier to acclimatise, we feel, although it does have its own side effects...decathlon india bangalore outlets provided us with sufficient options to shop for suitable clothing and other gear.Do not even think of trying to adjust with clothes you may already have or jackets you may already be using !! It is a completely different world out there and your clothes and gear are important enough that they may even be termed ' life saving '.So, no compromise, if it is expensive, then so be it, after all , you only live once, and surely you would want to get back in one living piece, isn't it ? ! :)Snow leopard sighting was the icing on the cake for us, but there were many other beautiful species which we enjoyed viewing in their natural habitat ! The landscapes are breathtaking ! The rivers are frozen solid, even the waterfalls are iced ! The most beautiful people of Leh-Ladakh will forever be etched in our hearts and memories !"
9,Hemis_National_Park,Tomeslice,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Friends,AMAZING(ly cold) Park and Nature Reserve,"BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO SPOT THE ENIGMATIC SNOW LEOPARD. What else needs to be said?Oh, the fact that there are numerous other observable species of mammals and birds (we saw snow leopards, stone martens, himalayan weasels, blue sheep, wolves, red foxes, two species of pikas, woolly hares, lammergeiers, golden eagles, himalayan griffons and others, for starters).Seeing the wildlife is made possible only with certified companies (we used Exotic Travel in Ladakh led by Phunchok Tsering) and local spotters. They spend HOURS UPON HOURS scanning the gargantuan mountains for wildlife, particularly for snow leopards.We were there in October, but the prime wildlife season is closer to the middle of the winter, namely February. Keep in mind that mots of the time you're CAMPING in the park, so bring HOT clothes, coats, layers of clothing, thermal underwear, thermal sleeping bags, gloves, scarves and equally importantly - binoculars and/or scopes and a GOOD camera if you want to capture anything, as most of the animals and birds are found very far from you.You will be very very cold most of the times and there are no regular bathrooms, but out houses and your cooks will sometimes give you hot water to wash your face and hair at your request. Only recommended for EXTREME ADVENTURE seekers. To maximize chances of snow leopards stay at least 7 days.TIP - Eurasian Lynx - one of the rarest cats (perhaps equally as difficult to spot as the leopard if not more) can be seen with somewhat reliable chances if you spend a few days around Kandala campsite which is around 4500m on the way towards Kandala pass. There are actually 2 campsites within a kilometer of each other - the higher one is supposedly better for the lynx. We were there for a day and a half but didn't luck out on the lynx."
0,Hemis_National_Park,damvilram,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Solo,Spot snow leopards,"Hemis reserve has the maximum concentration of snow leopards that one can see in India. Winter especially December to February is probably best for sighting this rare species as they come down from higher altitudes in search of their prey, the blue sheep. The landscape is one white sheet with frozen rivulets that one has to criss cross inside the reserve. Hemis national park is about 30 Kms from Leh and one has to get permits for entry ( which is pretty cheap at Rs. 20). I went through WWF India for the trek but there are private operators who arrange for the snow leopard trail. The camp is as basic as can be with tents. As can be expected, there is no power or telephone which is bliss! Toilets are the Ladakhi type which is dry . Bundle up with enough down jackets and protective gear to manage extremely cold and snowy conditions with temperatures touching minus 15-18 degrees Celsius. One great adventure in winter that one should not miss."
