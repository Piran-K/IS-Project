0,Higher_Himalaya,Daniel S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Solo,Highly recommended,"Chamba from Higher Himalaya was really responsive and helpful in arranging a flexible driver for my trip - within the agreed range from Leh I was able to decide each day where I wanted to visit the next so that I didn't have to decide in advance where I wanted to visit every day of the trip.The driver Dorjey was really friendly and flexible, happy to make multiple stops for photos, and woke up early every day to take me to location for sunrise.Chamba also gave me a local sim card for use during the trip which was very helpful as it is difficult for foreigners to get a sim on their own in Leh.He also arranged for me a lovely homestay in Lamayuru for one night of the trip.I emailed several tour companies in Leh about my trip and Chamba was the most responsive by far."

18,Higher_Himalaya,Martina T,,,,"A trip becomes amazing and worth remembering when things go as planned. With Higher Himalaya our trip went absolutely amazing as both the owner and the guide cum driver gave us a splendid experience of the beautiful Ladakh.From the very beginning the experience of booking the vehicle was super smooth, the owner is so soft spoken and helps understand and carve out a tour and gives a fair and the best deal. When you have a great beginning all the luck falls in to make the trip a success, likewise in our case the guide (driver) what's super amazing and gave us the best experience of the road. We traveled via Khardungla to Nubra and stayed there for night. He took us to multiple sites, best eateries, dunes and also helped us in getting the best (value for money) accommodation. then we were off to Pangong next day and despite the delays due to various factors and the road conditions he was calm composed and drove as per our recommendation, stopped as in when required, also help us finalize the accommodation.To sum up the whole experience from booking the cab to doing the trip and payment was absolutely seamless. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family."

27,,,,,,"ITALIAN BELOW We have been in Ladakh for 12 days and we hadn't organized anything in advance. Once there we visited many travel agencies and finally we decided to arrange our tour with higher Himalaya. That's because of their professionalism and very open to customize the trip accordingly to our desires. We did a trekking in Marka Valley and 3 days tour in Nubra Valley. For the trekking we decided to go with a guide. It has been a good choice and we recommend it mainly for 2 reasons. First and foremost even if the trail is quite easy to follow we had some troubles due to the heavy rain and the guide has been fundamental. In addition, he allowed us to better understand the places and local culture, but above all he has been both a linguistic and cultural bridge between us and the hosts in homestay. Regarding our second experience, Nubra valley, all the accommodations were beautiful and clean. The dinners were fantastic as well. The driver was very careful and he drove very well.The whole organization has been perfect, highly recommended. siamo stati in ladakh 12 giorni e abbiamo organizzato tutti I tour direttamente sul posto. Abbiamo chiesto a diverse agenzie e alla fine abbiamo potato per Higher Himalaya perché ci sono sembrato molto seri e disponibili.Abbiamo fatto un trekking di 5 giorni in Marka Valley e abbiamo deciso di prendere una guida. Questa è stata una decisione molto saggia principalmente per due motivi: innanzitutto perché anche se il sentiero è facile da seguire abbiamo avuto un po dinproblemi a causa del maltempo e l'aiuto della guida in alcuni punti è stato funzamentale. Inoltre, avere una persona del posto ci ha permesso di scoprire.meglio la.cultura locale e di entrare maggiormente in contatto con chi ci ha ospitato nelle homestay. Il tour nella Nubra Vally è stato molto affascinante e le sistemazioni molto belle e comode. Le cene sono state deliziose. In generare l'organizzazione e stata impeccabile quindi lo consigliamo vivamente"

Higher Himalayas will give you most genuine rates. They gave us quote for shared car as well as personal car. Both were better than others. We went for shared car. It was perfectly safe. Chamba bhaiya even booked a tent for us at pangong lake. He only suggested it and I'm thankful for that as most of the tents were full.He introduced us to an amazing driver, Dorjee. Who was really wonderful. Very friendly and felt like a family member. Was giving good suggestions and  was driving very carefully. He wore mask at all times. I've not seen him without mask even once. Very professional!!If u want to have the best trip I'd suggest go for Higher Himalayas. They will definitely enrich ur experience of the trip."

12,Higher_Himalaya,Khalid Anzar,,,,"We had a fabulous time on our 16 day jeep safari with Higher Himalaya. We sent Chamba  a list of places we would like to visit in Ladakh and  he put together a great itinerary making best use of our time .We had a comfortable and reliable jeep with a excellent driver who was helpful, friendly and always  ready to stop for photos and breaks and alter plans as we went along. The scenery was breathtaking and the local people incredibly friendly and welcoming.Late September was a really good time to visit Ladakh as tourist numbers are much lower and the weather clear and bright although getting a bit cold by the lakes. The journey from Pangong Lake to Tso Moriri Lake and on to Tso Kar was absolutely stunning and was the highlight of the trip.We found Higher Himalaya to be a well organised, reliable and competitively priced  tour agency. It has an office right in the centre of Leh and Chamba was always available for advice and information. He even helped us plan the jeep for the rest of our trip in the Spiti Valley  ( Himachal Pradesh ). You certainly don't need to have any concerns about transferring money for the deposit if you are organising a a trip from your home country. In our experience , Chamba is honest and trustworthy and keen for visitors from abroad to experience his country and it's culture.We would highly recommend Higher Himalaya to anyone and would certainly use the company again should we have the pleasure of returning to Ladakh.Thank you Chamba for your services and all the wonderful memories!"

Chamba (Higher Himalaya) took his time to understand the requirement, fixed up two more people to bring down the cost for individuals and organised the expedition in such a way that we get to visit maximum places in timely manner. Though he charged a little premium, the services offered were exemplary. Special thanks to Mr Karma, our car driver, who made the journey easy and fun.I'd recommend this place to people visiting Leh-Ladakh and need a friendly local trip adviser to fix up their itinerary."

21,,,,,,We had an amazing time with Higher Himalaya on both our trips: hiking in the Markha Valley and a jeep safari to Nubra Valley and Pangong Tso. We loved Leh as well and the whole area felt completely safe to travel in despite ongoing political drama!The guides on both trips were great and really looked after our interests. The hike (4n/5d) was less strenuous than expected although the altitude brought on a slight headache for the final night camp. Food and accommodation were great along the way.Jeep safari was beautiful. Lots of time in the car but plenty of opportunities to stop and best way to see the amazing sights.Would definitely recommend!

24,,,,,,"We had the best 6 days trekking with Higher Himalaya. The whole service was excellent, from being picked up from the airport to the complete care of our guide. The accommodation through the trek was great, but we would definitely recommend sleeping bag liners and a towel. The loos take a bit of getting used to for our western dispositions! Don't underestimate the effect that altitude will have on your fitness. We found parts of this very challenging, despite both being active people. Our guide was very considerate and got us through these times though. I was a little concerned before heading to Leh as I had read of some political trouble in the surrounding area, but we saw absolutely no sign of this and Leh was the least intimidating city we visited in India. The people are very respectful and there is never and pressure in shops or staring from local people."

They found another couple of travellers to share with us at short notice and organised all transport and accommodation. It was a superb trip although a little fraught on Chang La which was still snow-covered and icy in places. It was still very cold in April and  warm clothes were definitely needed. The tent camp we stayed in overnight was excellent, despite the cold. The young driver drove carefully and did a great job of getting us through Chang La under difficult driving conditions. I would highly recomend this agency for their professinalism and honesty. The trip was a great adventure for a couple of over 60s."

12,Higher_Himalaya,McSav,,,,"We arrive in Leh with no hotels or trips booked, just with the idea of what we wanna do in 5 days around Indus Valley and Nubra Valley. Half an hour after landed we arrive at the agency and we spoke with a kind man (I’m sorry but I don’t remember his name, however all people there were kind with us) and we explain which was our plans. He in few minutes organized us an incredible trip with hotel, private driver, meals that allowed us to see in few days all that we wanna see. All inclusive. The price was very good for all the things we done! Talking about the experience was the best experience we done in our lives, we slept in the thiksey gompa we done a trekking in the awesome markha valley with a very professional guide, always with professional drivers or guides. We were going to go to Nubra Valley through the Khardgung La Pass (5600 mt), unfortunately when we arrived there with our driver the road was closed for the snow, so we call back the agency (that was helpful and patience for all our trip), and they organize us an alternative trip to other beautiful areas WITHOUT EXTRA CHARGE! In conclusion I definitively suggest this incredible and professional agency for a great adventure in the magic Ladakh.P.s. They also organize trip to see the legendary snow leopard during the winter. "

We had already booked our own accommodation, and we're looking for someone to help us with the transportation, and other local requirements. We found them through Google maps, and lonely planet recommendations. They booked our transportation for us, as well as our rafting trip. They also took care of our permits required for the trip, and acquired a Sim for us, since only local BSNL Sims, and some Airtel and BSNL postpaid Sims work there. The transportation provided was excellent! The car was in perfect shape, and our driver cum guide Urgyen was very knowledgeable and tactful even with the roads where roads did not exist. They helped us with all sorts of recommendations on the trip.The best part about them was their excellent communication. Even despite the terrible network conditions in ladakh, they were always just one WhatsApp message away. I had tried to work out my trip with a few other travel agents as well, but gave up due to communication issues. Higher Himalayas never had that problem. It was a real pleasure working with them. "

24,,,,,,"We did three trips with HIgher Himalaya. We were travelling with two children (age 10 and 12) and wanted to make sure they would also enjoy the sightseeing and avoid too much driving. All the trips were well organised, good facilities, great drivers, and really took account of what we were looking to do and our constraints. First was a one day trip to three or four local Buddhist monasteries. We set off early and arrived at the first monastery before anyone else, which made for a relaxing time. The driver was flexible and kind. Second trip was an overnight stay in the Nubra Valley. We stayed in tents, which were basic but comfortable. Unfortunately it rained - but the place we stayed was good and had very good food. The sand dunes were beautiful, though we didn't spend much time looking at them, though our son had a wonderful time playing in the mud. Again, the driver was helpful and flexible and we ended up leaving early because of the rain. Third trip was white water rafting. The rafting was amazing. HH was clear that our son probably wouldn't be able to do the full length of the rafting as he was too young, which turned out to be the case, and it was good to be clear about this from the beginning. He did join us half-way through and was looked after very happily in between. Our raft flipped and we ended up in the white water - we'd had good instructions on what to do, the equipment was really good, there were extra people to help us, so we were all fine and in fact thoroughly enjoyed it. It was also reassuring that after each trip HH asked us for detailed feedback on our experience. They were kind, hugely knowledgeable, and delivered three great trips for us."
