And ones of my favorite are shawls from Zanskar Art. It's a good shop.The sellers were very informative, enthusiastic and charming. They didn't pushed for shopping but provided a lot of information about various kinds of pashmina and other shawls. The prices seems reasonable, they gave a discount as everywhere in Leh. The shop is popular among Indian tourists. It's a pleasurable place and their things bring joy."

However, Zanskar Arts stand completely different for their variety of collections, variety in colours, material and of course price range. They help you to make the right decision as per your requirement and budget.. They very well knew what they were selling and would offer you it at the best. Must visit this shop if you are in Leh and planing to buy Pashmina shawls to any type of one.. They have the price range and variety."

Very few shops are open in Leh during winter, Zanskar Arts is one of them. Going by the strong reputation by word of mouth, I finally dropped by this showroom in main market and was pleasantly surprised by great selection and quality of shawls & carpets. Their collection also includes artifacts, semi precious stones & jewellery.  The staff is very knowledgeable & friendly. Picked up some beautiful Pashmina shawls, silk carpets & very pretty silk scarfs for family. "

18,Zanskar_Arts,Fiona T,,,,Sorted this shop after visiting 5-6 shops in main bazaar. The voice and way of presentation of the owner of the shop convinced me to buy pashmina shawls after all. He showed us some very expensive shawls upto Rs 1 lakh also and told us some interesting stories of legendary shahtoosh shawls also. I decided to buy 3 pashmina shawls of printed design for near about Rs 6000 each after discount of 15% i remember. The kashmere carpet was also a crafted antique piece of art and were way expensive.

We were shown many shawls and had the difference between them explained well. It was interesting and we also got to see a very beautiful Kani embroided shawl much too expensive for us but beautiful. You must bargain hard to get the prices down but we were happy with our purchases and I felt i got the 'real thing'. He sells carpets, jewelry and other handicraft too but mainly shawls. They take credit cards."
