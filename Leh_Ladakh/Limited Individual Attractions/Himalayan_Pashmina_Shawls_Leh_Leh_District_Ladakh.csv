Ladakh Pashmina
The classic Ladakhi shawl is among the most exquisite textile, ever woven, the product of consummate skill and artistry applied to one of the world’s delicate fibres. It has been an object of desire for Mughal emperors and sikh maharajas, Iranian nobles, French emperors, Russian and British aristocrats and eventually for the increasingly prosperous bourgeoisie created on both sides of Atlantic by the industrial revolution. It has left a permanent imprint on the aesthetic sensibility of modern world from a motif developed in the ateliers of Ladakh shawl designers."

3,Himalayan_Pashmina_Shawls,Moulika M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Solo,Good shop for Kashmiri shawls,"First off this is not the cheapest place for pashmina but for the great customer service and their willingness to show you their products without being pushy for a sale, it's worth your while to check them out. They will show you various grades of pashmina if you are uninitiated about it ... great learning experience too. You'll get what you pay for viz fair price for fair quality ... we are talking about shawls here. Get those that are double weave ... and good luck. Credit cards accepted too."

Went across whole Leh market and came back here for a Poncho that was on display and caught my attention. Ended up buying pashmina shawls, silk stoles, ponchos and what not for my entire family. Compared prices in other recommended shops later and I was so happy to get the best deal at Himalayan Pashmina Shawls"

6,Himalayan_Pashmina_Shawls,dharun2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Family,Very expensive but worth it,"As we know it, Jammu and Kashmir is the place to be for buying pashmina shawls! The Himalayan Pashmina Shawls had a great deal of variety and some very beautiful designs. The staff were patient and friendly, they didn't coerce us into buying anything. Definitely, the prices were a bit high, but it is a given for genuine 100% pashmina shawls. We were able to strike a good deal since we bought around 8 shawls together but it might seem a bit expensive at first."
