0,Jigmat_Couture,Kabristan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Jigmat Couture an Experience to Rember,This first class establishment in the  Himalayan town of Leh  Ladakh India is an experience and completely unique. Walk through the doors and you are transported back to the days when Leh was a major trading town between Kashmir and Yarkand in China. Jigmat Couture is not just a shop but an experience. Their fashionable garments with a traditional flair are made from first class local materials in affordable prices. Each piece is unique.  Next time you are in Leh make a point of visiting the studio maybe you too will fall under the spell of its creators Jigmat and Jigmet and will fall in love with the one garment you simply must have.

Many wealthy Ladakhis get their wedding garments here, but they also have quite a few other things, including gifts. It's a high class place so prices are relatively high."
