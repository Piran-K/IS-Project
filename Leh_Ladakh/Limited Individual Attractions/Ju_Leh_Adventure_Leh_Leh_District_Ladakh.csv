0,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Patrice,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Group trek with Ju-Leh - perfect from beginning to end,"I was alone and I joined the group for the trek from Rumtse to Tso Moriri. Ju-Leh was perfect from the moment I contacted the agency by email until the end of the trek. Staff in office is very friendly and helpful, they answered all my questions and send useful documents and advice.The trek was wonderful. The guide Dorjey and staff were great and the group was composed of people of all nationality and there was a great ambiance and we had good fun all together. We went through beautiful landscapes and there was nobody else... just the beautiful mountains and us !Dorjey, the assistants and the horseman, all were wonderful people who did everything to make us comfortable. Special mention to our cook who cooked excellent and varied food everyday, really amazing.I recommend Ju-Leh to anyone who plans to go to Ladakh and especially for solo traveller who want to join a group it's a great option. Thank you to all !"
1,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Markus W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Great adventure with Ju-Leh!!!,"What a great adventure with Ju-Leh!!! We had 2 weeks in Ladakh, a mix of visits and trek in the Markha valley for 8 days. From first emails exchanged with Dawa to the end of the Ladakh trip, everything was perfect. The Ju-Leh team is very professional, great staff in office, friendly driver and amazing team during the trek with a warm thank you to Rigzin, the best guide ever! I highly recommend Ju-Leh for your next adventure in Ladakh"
2,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Deborah Y,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Rumste to Tsho Moriri,"Ju-Leh does a fairly competent job at a great price.  The office staff are very helpful.  The cook and assistants did an amazing job.  The food was outstanding as is the scenery of the hike.  The guide lacked maturity and leadership.  Campsites on night one, four and eight need immediate attention. The first night we slept on the Indian highway. I had ear plugs for the truck noise, but it was not a great way to start the trip. Campsite on night four at Tsho Kar Lake had some of the poorest water I have ever drank in my life.  I have no idea how no one got sick.  The small water creek had huge amounts of trash, and the well was so nasty that I felt sick just thinking about drinking the water.  Ju-Leh needs to take personal responsibility and clean this up or change the campsite. Campsite number eight is just ridiculous.  Everyone in our group called it the Refugee Camp.  I think refugees are given better facilities than the Tsho Moriri camp.  We easily could have camped in the upper village where other groups were camping.  It was beautiful there.  The worst part about having such a terrible last camp is that it was the last impression of our week.  The hike is challenging and stunningly beautiful."
3,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Maria R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Trekking and visit of Ladakh during 3 weeks,"We travelled during 3 weeks in Ladakh in July-August 2022. Before the trip, we had a very good communication with Dawa who helped us select the most suitable trek for our group (we selected the trek from Rumtse to Tso Moriri Lake) and also arranged various cultural tours (Indus valley, Nubra valley).As soon as we reached Ladakh, Dawa, Stanzin and the team took care of everything. During the tours, our driver Lobzang was a great companion, always smiling, sharing stories and information about Ladakh, it was a beautiful introduction to this beautiful region and its culture.Then, during the trek, our guide Padma and his team (assistant, cook, horseman…) were wonderful and did everything to make the trek very comfortable. The food prepared by the cook Rigzin was just amazing, better than in restaurants in Leh! The landscapes during the trek were amazing, overall an unforgettable experience.Ju-Leh Adventure is a very professional agency with a friendly and dedicated team. We are very happy that we travelled to Ladakh with them.Thank you all!"

Ju-Leh Adventure played a great role in organising a perfect itinerary for us. Looking back, we never thought we would be able to complete the Markha trek, especially once we reached Hangkar village. Here I would like to thank our guide Stanzin for motivating us and it is because of him that we managed to do the impossible. Markha Valley is beautiful and our jeep tours to the lake and other valleys were truly memorable. I would definitely like to go back to Leh and choose Ju-Leh Adventure and Mr Stanzin for organising our tour."

My friend recommended Ju-Leh Adventure with whom they had booked a trek and tour last year. I got in touch with Stanzin and asked him to prepare a customised itinerary keeping the age of my kids, who are 7 and 9, in mind.

Nothing was ever too much trouble and I always had my response within just an hour or so.On the ground, it was easy to find their office and to settle the final balance of payment.* Just a word of warning though , cashpoints in Leh have a habit of being out of cash!!!Our trekking crew, Sonam the guide, Pemba the cook and his 2 assistants, Nima and Rigsun were all FANTASTIC - super helpful; super smiley; nothing was ever too much trouble and they fed us like kings.We took the camping option as opposed to the teahouses and really felt like this was a great choice.  The tents were good quality and withstood some really quite heavy rain :-)Loved that Sonam entered into the spirit of all our card/dice games!!!

The food was amazing throughout - hats off to our cook Sudeep.

8,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Moog,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Final Markha Valley trek of the season FANTASTIC!,"In October 2018, a group of 7 of us completed a 5 day trek in the Markha Valley with guides Rigzin Tamchos and Dorjay. The whole experience was amazing; the scenery, the guides, food and the support from Ju Leh Adventures from the beginning to the end of our trip. On the last day before the crossing of the Kongmaru La pass, there was a snow storm, meaning that our ponies could not make the crossing over the pass with our belongings. Our guides carried the extra weight themselves at high altitude. Our heroes! Many people have outlined what to expect on this trek, so I won't go into details, however if there are any vertigo sufferers out there (I have horrible fear of high narrow paths and edges), please note that this trek is suitable, as there are no vertiginous spots. The whole thing is through a river valley. The only time I was a bit affected by vertigo was on the last day on the way down the pass on the paths towards the end of the trek. We weren't on a high ledge, it's just that the paths were narrow, and due to there having been a snow storm the day before, they were icy. Our guides and my group mates were very supportive and I really didn't have any problems at all. This was an amazing trip and I would certainly recommend it."

It was a four day trek in the Hemis National Park from Chilling to Stok with two high altitude passes. It was a very nice trip, the organization was excellent, the guides (Rigzin Tamchos, and Rigzin) were friendly, helpful and well qualified. We enjoyed the whole tour. We hope we'll participate another Juh-Leh Adventure trek :)"

With Stanzin we've been able to create a truly exciting custom mountain biking program that we've done this autumn. Despite the unexpected bad weather, the Ju-Leh adventure team showed true professionalism, honesty and versatility, and we managed to get the most out of our wheels, leaving traces on some of the most incredible singletracks in Ladakh.Here is the place to distinguish our guide - Dorjee, who showed a lot of spirit, knowledge and temperament.

He came to meet us at the airport on the first day and again at our hotel in Leh at the end of the trip.He also has a great team working with him. Our driver was named Dorjey and we spent 5 days with him exploring the most amazing places of Ladakh. We also went for trekking during 3 days with Rinchen and this was a great experience. Crossing the Ganda La pass was really challenging for some of us but we will never forget emotion when reaching the top of the pass. We would have never done that without Rinchen's support and we can't thank him enough for that.Thank you to Ju-Leh Adventure for making a dream come true!"

I contacted Ju Leh more than 6 months in advance and Stanzin was very helpful and responsive, giving good advice to plan the best circuit. He also suggested to include a small trek (which we didn't think about initially because we are not very sporty) and this was an excellent idea too.Once in Ladakh, the staff was very nice and caring. Driver Motup was friendly and always safe on the road. We also enjoyed very much Namgail's company during the trek and the visit to Lamayuru. It was clearly the best choice to book our trip with Ju Leh. Thank you all!"

Everything was very well communicated to us in advance, with a very detailed planning. Upon arrival in Leh Ju-Leh took good care of us, we could immediately tell we were in good and experienced hands. After a 2 day (much needed) acclimatization period, we went on a 5 day trek to Markha valley. Transport was well arranged with friendly drivers to drop us off and pick us back up at the beginning and the end of the trek. During the trek we were lucky enough to have Nawang as our guide, a local Ladakhi with many years of experience. He lead us through the beautiful Markha valley along the Zanskar river. He explained us a lot of about Ladakhi culture, and the region in general. In the evenings we stayed at home-stays in little villages where Nawang cooked us delicious local dinners. In the end the trip was everything we hoped it would be. The only thing we underestimated a bit was the high altitude. Good to take the time to acclimate well, and buy some medicine for the first 1-2 days."

The guide Nesang is from Zanskar and knows his region perfectly. He always chose the best way and was helpful when the path was difficult. He is also an outstanding cook and prepared better meals on a simple camping burner than other cooks in restaurants.Ju-Leh is an agency that cares for their customers and thanks to their whole team we had a wonderful time in Zanskar.

6,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Therese B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,"""Amazing experience on trek and side trips""","Even before we left Canada, the itinerary that was provided to us, with great suggestions for changes was well put together. Upon our arrival at the Leh Airport, there were 2 people to welcome us and get the trip off to a great start. During our frequent office visits, the staff were patient with all our questions and accommodated our trek changes to enable us to enjoy the Ladakhi Festival.Our drivers, Stanzin and Sangdup, were excellent, accommodating with all our photo stop requests and great at answering all the questions we had on route. The trek, our highlight, was incredible. Certainly the weather helped but we had a superb team, Rigzin(guide), Nirajan (cook), Lokender(assistant) and Rigzin with his 9 horses. We didn't speak too much with Rigzin, but his cute horses with their lovely bells were so appreciated in carrying our gear, food etc so that we could enjoy the hike with our light daypacks. We were so lucky to have such a skilled chef as Nirajan. The variety of healthy and flavorful food he produced was amazing. Producing a cake on the last evening was such a surprise! His samosas were #1. I appreciated his soup he made me on the day I wasn't feeling too good. Lokender, seemed to be able to do whatever needed to be done, always smiling, singing and playing beautiful tunes on his flute. Rigzin, our amazing guide was so knowledgeable on the flora and fauna, enhanced our understanding of Buddhism and life in the Markha valley. He ensured our safety on the trail, assisted us with river crossings, and made sure we were doing fine hiking and not having issues with the elevation. Even on the day he wasn't feeling well in Markha, he took us on a short hike and arranged a visit at the school. Visiting with the kids was a highlight for me.We have come home with such incredible memories (even though some are on my camera somewhere in the Markha valley) which we have already shared with friends, family and colleagues. Thank you for all your combined efforts to show us how beautiful the Ladakh area is. We'd be back in a heart beat!Sincerely, Therese and Pat Bryan, North Vancouver, BC, Canada"

I have requested the offer in few Leh agencies, but only Ju-Leh Adventure answered quickly and offered customized trip according to our time limits and preferences. We received the itinerary on 10 pages, with full information about places, overnight stays, altitudes, time requested, as well as recommendations what to take in the trip etc. It was very useful and got feeling that we are in right hands. When we arrived to Leh, we met our give Tashi, that was really caring, helpful, he was good guide, explaining a lot about buddhism and tibet. We even visited his family. We had 3 days trek in mountains, + 4 days trip to Nubra and Pangong Tso by car. I would like to recommend Ju-Leh Adventure, because they are really flexible. Due to snowing in mountains, we had to return to Leh one day earlier, and agency organized it quickly, with no-delay, no additional charges. They were proactive in organizing tour trough monasteries with just few hours pre-advice. Thanks to Ju-Leh Adventure and special thanks to Tashi. "

We have to confirm: their high rating is fully merited - in fact it was perfect. They are very well organized. It starts with their quick reply and detailed itineraries. During the trek they used horses and all was taken care of: things like a waterproof bag for the backpacks (a small detail but something you often miss), kitchen tent, toilet tent, thick mattresses, climbing gear, wake up tea etc. (By the way, they boil water for you on the mountain to drink, that worked fine, we didn’t get sick.)We (2) were joined by a guide, cook, horseman and a helper. Our guide Jigmet was funny, knowledgable, easily adapted to our level of fitness and made a dream come true. During the trek we were spoiled with the food of Lobzang. It felt like we were dining in a 3-star restaurant and this at 5000m. If there would be a Nobel Prize for cooking, he would deserve it.Highly recommended!!!"

We did not regret our decision to use their services. They were very patient (esp. Dawa) with our constantly changing itinerary. There were three of us initially doing the popular Markha valley trek, but in the end there was only me and my guide Tenzin after day 1. Everything was organized well. My guide made sure I stayed in well appointed homestays and I had a room all for myself. There was never a point where I felt unsafe, neglected or my concerns unheard. Nothing but praise for the company Ju-Leh and my guide Tenzin. Ladakh is a fantastic area full of grand sweeping vistas. This was all the more evident because I was well taken care of."

She helped us find the trek that most suited what we were looking for and suggested a 2 day acclimatisation trek to help us prepare for the high altitude.Unfortunately upon landing in Leh my fiancé was struck by food poisoning, but Ju-Leh provided us with options and we ended up shortening the 2 day acclimatisation trek to a single day. Our guide for the single day trek (Chospel) was warm, friendly, & knowledgable.The 7 day trek was challenging due to the high altitude but our guide (Lotus), cook (Sukhan), & assistant (Sanjay) made sure everything ran smoothly and attended to all of our needs, turning a challenging experience into an enjoyable one.Some other positives to note:- The tent they provided us was larger than the tents we saw provided by other trekking companies which added that little extra bit of comfort- Our horseman seemed to regularly arrive at camp first, which helped us secure good camping spots- The food was amazing, in particular we looked forward to the soups each day which hit the spot after a long day of hiking. Other highlights were the french fries, fried rice with stir fry veg, momos, as well as a cake (yes, a cake!) that was baked on the last night to celebrate finishing the hikeOverall I would not hesitate to recommend Ju-Leh to friends, family, & anyone else interested in trekking in Ladakh."

Everything was just perfect from beginning to end. Our driver was a very good man and always cautious on the curvy mountain roads. We visited around Ladakh for 4 days and it was very interesting. Then we did the Markha valley trek for 6 days, reaching a maximum altitude of 5200 metres. Rigzin was our guide and he is a great person. He clearly loves his region and it was great spending time with him and listening to all his stories. He is very friendly and was always taking care of all our needs. For anyone going to Ladakh, I recommend Ju-Leh Adventures and ask for Rigzin to be your guide."
2,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Johan B,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Zero Altitude sickness knowledge.,"We choose to book a trek with a guide first (only?) because we felt we needed an expert with us for our first time at high altitude.I unfortunately had an episode of vertigo and balance loss at 4100m, that could lead to cerebral endema. During that episode our guide had no opinion (for the first 10 min he stayed 50m away), and only stumbled the dangerous advice to maybe stay at the same altitude and rest for one more day.I'm happy I read online before and could talk to other hikers about altitude sickness so I was able to take the right decision to go down immediately.I believe guides should do their homework and learn the theory about altitude sickness, it is their responsibility, it could be a life or death matter.Apart from this our guide was moody, distant, introvert. He didn't give information about the trek, the culture or the nature. He also didn't hesitate to share his dislike of the Marka valley. Maps and GPS could have done the same job. Ju-Leh managers are very nice but their teams are not professional. Stanzin seems like a nice guy but he maybe should do an other job. My advice is: if you plan to trek in Ladhak take the time to read online about altitude sickness, and if you know how to read a map you may not even need to pay for a guide (paths and homestay bookings are easy in the Markha valley)."
3,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Stanzin G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,A wonderful trip,"Dear Johan,

Thank you for your review. We regret that you were not able to complete the Markha valley trek and we understand your frustration. Indeed, this trek is considered as fairly easy and it is usually suitable for anyone who is reasonably fit. However, the guide cannot be held responsible for your inability to adapt to the altitude. His priority was to ensure your safety and despite what you claim, this is what he did.

Your guide Stanzin Angbo has attended altitude safety trainings and mountaineering courses. He has been above 6000m more than 15 times. He was therefore perfectly qualified to guide you during a simple Markha valley trek.

General recommendations to prevent altitude sickness are:
1) Take 2-3 days of acclimatization in Leh (3500m) before starting the trek -> you took 4 days.
2) Avoid ascending more than 300-400m a day -> you trekked from Chilling to Hankar (4000m) in 3 days, increasing your altitude by 500m over 3 days.

On the 4th day of the trek, you started walking from Hankar and after ascending approximately 150m you felt the first symptoms of altitude sickness. In case of mild symptoms (dizziness in your case) it is recommended to stop and rest where you are. Half an hour later, your dizziness was not going away so your guide advised to go down back to Hankar and spend the night there. You had spent the previous night in Hankar without any problem so it was safe for you to spend one more night there. Your guide was only giving you the opportunity to rest and acclimatize one more day at 4000m so that you could continue the trek the next day. Unfortunately, you panicked and overreacted (maybe because of the stories you had read on the internet before) and you decided to stop the trek.

I can assure you that you were in good hands with your guide and that he had the situation under control to keep you safe. It's a pity that the guide did not give you this impression and we will make sure that he improves his communication skills in order to deal efficiently with anxious clients.

Safety is our utmost priority:
1) our guides are trained and experienced
2) our trekking and climbing itineraries are designed to allow for gradual acclimatization to altitude
3) oxygen bottles and pulse oximeter are provided (for more challenging treks)

Best regards,
Stanzin"

The trek was amazing with spectacular views and lots of variety in terrain. We lucked out with moderate weather for the most part. We had 3 nights of Homestays which were very basic but all part of the experience.The last night was in a tent in a Campground. Food was also basic but fueled us well enough for the amount of trekking we had to do each day. There was a good size lunch to take each day.Our guide was Tashi and he did an amazing job looking after our group. He was very kind and attentive to our needs. He lead the group at an appropriate pace always hanging back to support anyone who was struggling. He seemed very well liked by all our Homestay owners. I would highly recommend Tashi as a group guide and would like to take this opportunity to thank him for taking such great care of us.Ju-leh Adventures was a great company to go with. Borrowed sleeping bags were in great shape. Horse train brought our personal stuff safely every day. We had a couple of meetings before the trek where all our questions were thoroughly answered.This was a great adventure with friends and I thank Ju-leh Adventures for the part they played in making it such a success.

The guides came and met us at your guesthouse just outside of Leh the day before our trek to answer any questions we had and to meet our group. They were awesome! Experienced, confident and personable. They next morning they were right on schedule with well equipped vehicles, loaded all our gear and we were on our way! Unfortunately, I had a gastrointestinal issue that prevented me from continuing on the trek. I had to call it quits the morning of day 2:( The guides arranged transfer for me back to the guesthouse. One of the guides accompanied me all the way to Leh. I felt terrible that he had to leave the rest of the group but he was so professional and I really appreciated it. The rest of my group continued on with the other guide. They had a spectacular trip! After a couple of days of rest, I was well enough to join up with the other half of my group who were doing a 4 day trek in the Sham Valley. Juley sent a vehicle to the guesthouse, picked me up and I was able to join that group for their last day of monastery visits. I was so well taken care of by the guides, drivers, trek planners. If you are planning to visit the area, I highly recommend you contact Juley Adventures! :)"

We have been welcomed at the airport, then installed at our lovely hotel recommended by Juh-L adventures. 2 days to rest and then started an amazing trek in the Himalaya with a perfect guide and sherpa for our friendly donkeys taking care of our luggages. We did a trek just the two of us, not a group one. We slept at homestay plus an unforgettable one night tent experience by minus 10 degrees at more than 4500meters of altitude! We have never been sick with the food, which is very simple in a good way and different from what you can experience in others parts of India. We are both 45 years old and in a good shape and made it to 5300 meters! Merci Juh-Leh adventures, it has been perfect from A to Z and we miss Laddakh!"
3,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Amal M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,"6 day Markha Valley Trek, Chilling to Shang","Four of us - my son, his girlfriend, their housemate & I - planned and booked our trek in Markha Valley over the internet, 4 months in advance, with no recommendations other than Trip Advisor reviews, and we are very glad we chose Ju-Leh. Their responsiveness and professional communication from Dawa right from the start was impressive & gave us some confidence. Their planning letter and trek itinerary were quite professional and very informative, and helped us a lot in visualizing our trip and packing for it. Once we got to Leh, and met Stanzin, all was arranged quickly - our guide Padma Namgyal was very well organized, and we got off to a smooth start. Our home stays in Markha valley were chosen well, we had no hardships anywhere, and fortunately the weather cooperated. We had 4 ponies to carry our backpacks, and a local horseman, who was also very good. Our 6 day trip from Chilling, with stops in Skiu, Markha, Hankar, Nimaling & Chogdo cut out the Ganda-La climb and allowed us to alternate easy and hard days, with just one major climb on Day 5 to the top of Gongmaru La. Padma gave us a lot of tips and help on the hard days, so we managed well overall, and there were no major problems with the altitude. A few of us in our group suffered dehydration on day 4, but recovered by the day's end with oral hydration salts and glucose. Our guide had a full first aid kit, so no worries there. Since we finished early on Day 6, we had a chance to tour the Hemis monastery, and get back to Leh after lunch. Ju-Leh helped us after the trek as well to get us Protected Area Permits & arrange a car to take us the day after up to the top of Khardung-La pass. Stanzin actually came by to meet us at our home stay the day before we left Leh, to ask us for feedback, a very nice gesture on Ju-Leh's part. All in all excellent support by Ju-Leh for our first Himalyan trek."

They were great in their communications while planning our trips: They provided well written itineraries with maps and beautiful pictures that made our decision process easier.During our trip, everyone we interacted with was very knowledgeable an delightful to work with. Especially our trekking guide Tashii and our chaffeur/guide Sangdup. They both made our trip to Ladakh a very memorable one.Thank you Ju-leh for showing us the beauty of Ladakh!"
5,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Richard B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Fantastic Custom Trek and Sight-seeing tour,"My wife used Ju Leh for her Ladakh holiday and this is her review:We were two female travellers and booked our custom Ladakh holiday through Ju Leh.  Dawa answered all of our emails promptly and found us accomodation at Hotel Omasila where everyone was friendly and helpful and the view from our room was heavenly.  We had 2 days to acclimatise - (more would be better, if there's time) and then 3 days trekking which was FANTASTIC.  We had a custom trek and decided not to do the high pass but had the most wonderful detour to Rumbak village instead.  Rigzin was the best guide ever and everything was better than we could have hoped for.  Gyapo with the ponies did all the heavy carrying.  There was an unloaded pony should we have required a ride and Rigzin carried oxygen just in case.  The homestay hosts were always sweet with plenty of food and nice rooms.  Sandup drove us on our sightseeing day and was an excellent guide and safe driver.  Our change of itinerary was accomodated without a fuss and everyone at Ju Leh from start to finish was fantastic.  We didn't want to leave!We want to go back - stay longer; trek more.  We would definitely use Ju Leh again."
6,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Alan H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Markha Valley Trek - Amazing,"I joined a group of 7 to do the Markha Valley trek on a set departure date. Our guides were Rigzin and Lumdup and besides the trek being amazing itself they were fantastic. The trek itself is not easy, some tough days including the day of the pass and subsequent climb down, mainly due to the altitude, but Rigzin and co were brilliant in helping everyone in our group along every day. No task was too small and they were constantly filling us up with mint/milk tea the whole time and negotiating the best accommodation in each town for us. The Home stays are fantastic and the families so welcoming. I would not hesitate to book with ju-Leh adventure again.  "
7,Ju_Leh_Adventure,Andy_Noi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Incredible Experience!,"We have just returned from Ladakh where we did a 6D/5N jeep tour of Zanskar. The tour went way beyond our expectations thanks to the organisation of Ju-Leh, with a particular mention to our guide Nawang who was immense throughout. The trip is certainly not for the faint hearted, but one I throughly recommend. Throughout the planning process all at Ju-Leh replied promptly to our emails and gave us solid advice on all our queries. I have no hesitation in recommending the company to anyone and when we return to Ladakh I will certainly be in touch with them again."
8,Ju_Leh_Adventure,John R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Markha valley trek with extra side-trip to Stok-La,"We arranged an 8 day markha valley trek from zingchen, including an extra side trip from Rumbak up to Stok la on day 2 of the trek. Group of 2 clients with a guide and pony to carry our baggage. The whole experience with Ju-Leh was excellent - very professional and prompt reply to our initial query, wonderful local guide called Tashi. We amended the itinerary at the last minute (cutting out the final night of homestay and the final day's short trek from Chogdo to Shamsungdo, and instead arranging a monastery tour the following day from Leh) - this was organised by Ju-Leh without any fuss or extra costs. The trek itself was absolutely phenomenal - incredibly beautiful and varied scenery, and the extra trip to Stok La (a very dramatic pass at 4860metres) was well worth it.I would very strongly recommend this company."
9,Ju_Leh_Adventure,EricBrighton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Markha Valley Trek,"I recently completed the Markha Valley Trek with a group of 4 others. I organised this through Ju Leh Adventure who were great.From my initial enquiry to to arranging  a hire company for walking poles, rucksack and sleeping bag, their organisation and communication was prompt and efficient.Our guide was Sangay and the assistant guide was Lundup. Both were really knowledgeable, friendly, fun and always around to help you if you needed them.The home stays were basic but perfectly OK and the families were very friendly and the food was good and plentiful. There were blankets but I’d recommend taking your own sleeping bag.The toilets are holes the ground so bring your own paper and wipes.You are provided with a bucket of hot water for your shower on most nights which is very welcome.The night camping st Nimaling is also basic but you do get to meet other trekkers in the communal dining hut.The trek in the last 2 days is hard going and you do need to be fit. It’s also very rewarding.I’d definitely recommend the trek  and would certainly suggest you check out Ju Leh Adventure."
