0,Kalachakra_Stupa,Lovers_paradise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,"Leh --- the land of stupas, gompas and llamas",This is basically a big welcome entrance gate to Leh city. All tourists and travellers to this city gets a grand welcome. From here the Leh iMain Market is just a short walk away. The bus terminus is also nearby. You will notice this place first thing when you enter Leh city either from Manali side or from Srinagar side.
1,Kalachakra_Stupa,SaddviAndalwala,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Just an ordinary Stupa,This Buddhist stupa is just an ordinary piece of rock with some carvings of sermons on it. The number of tourists visiting this area is also very less.
2,Kalachakra_Stupa,Peregrineri,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Beautiful Stupa,This is a lovely stupa that sits right in the middle of the intersection of the two highways as you approach Leh town. Definitely worth a photo if you can approach it safely.
