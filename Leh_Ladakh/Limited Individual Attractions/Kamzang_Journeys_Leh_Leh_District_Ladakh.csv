0,Kamzang_Journeys,viralimm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Bicycle tour Ladakh 2019,"Wonderful trip. Cycle-eat-relax-repeat. I had met Kim Bannister and Lhakpa Dorji previously, but this was my first trip with them as formal leaders.  Kim and Lhakpa have all of the logistics for fun and relaxing Ladakh travel completely dialed in. The itinerary was challenging but not overly so, with the flexibility to ride in the support vehicle completely open at any time. Very importantly, our two drivers were 100% calm and safe.  Cycling ranged from 4 to 8 hours a day. The team uses cell phones and, when necessary, small radios for communications to coordinate camps and timing.  Each cyclist also has a personal radio for potential emergency use, but in reality, even though we had some tough days, there were zero emergencies. Camp is set up and struck efficiently by the crew.  Basically snacks and drinks await on arrival in the afternoon, with large, comfy personal tents set up in nice locations and your personal gear stashed inside. It has been said an army marches on its stomach, and for any trip of this sort, the food is of paramount importance. Junar and the rest of the crew never failed to impress with tasty, copious and varied food choices, including melons, momos, salads, and a birthday cake.  "
1,Kamzang_Journeys,Sally L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Sixth Time since 2009 - 2018 and STILL Fabulous,"Nomads, Lakes & High Passes of the Changtang ... three plus weeks of glorious travel and sixteen plus days of walking in the most wonderful landscapes with two 19,000 foot plus passes (and several smaller ones).  Trekking with Kim (Kamzang Journeys) is such a treat; treks are well organised, carefully planned, and the attention to comfort in camp is second to none.  An individual tent for everyone with no single supplement and it's a large tent!  Plenty of room to have your kit in your tent with you and move around with head room for getting dressed.  Duffle bag to protect your kit bag during the day (when it's on a pony/mule).  Three good - and varied - meals a day ... choice of breakfast options; lunch while walking; unlimited tea/coffee in camp in the afternoons. Dinner is lovely soup ... a varied (largely vegetarian) dinner with soup, main course and vegetables/sides, followed by fresh fruit or a pudding.  Dedicated dining tent which is also a place to sit and relax out of the sun if needed ... rugs and camp seats make life homely and biscuits are there for snacks between meals!  Kim and her crew are a constant ... we've used the same horsemen since my first trip; only one change in crew members over that time ... they are a happy and professional team and it is like trekking with a group of friends.  Safety and hygiene standards are excellent too and I've never had a 'tummy bug' on one of Kim's treks!  Ladakh is fabulous and well worth the visit ... her July/August treks are particularly nice as the long summer days mean you are getting up in daylight, and coming home into camp in sunshine in the afternoon so hair can be washed, clothes etc and all will dry before dinner! It's also a lovely temperature ... cool nights and warm sunny days.  Perfect!"

We couldn't stop ourselves from admiring the nature's beauty. A must visit trip for people who love to travel adventurously.

4,Kamzang_Journeys,Dean S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Solo,Trekking in Ladakh,"I am back from a trek in Ladakh with Kim and Lhakpa and their team from Kamzang. It was my third trek with them (2 in Nepal and this one in Ladakh). The trip was well organized with only minor glitches, the food was good, the tents comfortable (even with a lot of rain and wind only minor leaks), and adequate support staff and animals. Ladakh is austere, gorgeous in its own way, and also a lot of work with the high elevation (the entire trek is above 4000 meters) being a challenge for me. Kim and Lhakpa do a good job of taking time to get people acclimatized as much as possible and they are flexible enough to deal with both fast and less fast (I might as well say slow) trekkers such as myself. They put a lot of emphasis on safety, and give everyone personal attention as needed. I highly recommend their services, for both Ladakh and their other treks in Nepal and elsewhere.
