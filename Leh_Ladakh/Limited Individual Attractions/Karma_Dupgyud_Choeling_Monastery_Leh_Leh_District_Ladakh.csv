1,Karma_Dupgyud_Choeling_Monastery,SaddviAndalwala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Wonderful but remote location,The monastery's architecture is fascinating and the meditation halls are lavishly decorated. But the location of the monastery from the mainland of Ladakh is rather odd. It took me nearly 2 long hours to reach.

3,Karma_Dupgyud_Choeling_Monastery,lotusdiamond,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Another Monastery !!!,Located far away from the city of Leh. Very peaceful and calm place. You may like to spend some time doing meditation. Not much of lamas at this place and not a big place. Visit this place if you have free time else all monasteries look sme.
