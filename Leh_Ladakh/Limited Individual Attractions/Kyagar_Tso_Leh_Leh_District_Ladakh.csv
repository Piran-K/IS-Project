1,Kyagar_Tso,Tribhuvan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Execptional,"Had travelled to leh and nubra last month, we stayed at the kyagar, which is opened up recently, its a great property, the staff was warm and welcoming, opened just a month before, it was absolutely on spot in terms of service, food, location and the infrastructure. Would definitely recommend it and if i were to visit again i would surely stay there."
2,Kyagar_Tso,Ravikant Sabnavis,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,The mysterious Kyagar Tso,"I saw this listed amongst the ""10 things to see around Leh"". I asked our hotel about this and they told me that it was not a lake but a small pond. I decided to go anyway, since it was a short drive away from our hotel. Sadly could not find the place. Google maps told me I had arrived, but there were only buildings on either side. "
3,Kyagar_Tso,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Pulchritudinous,"Not many know about Kyagar Tso & only discover it accidentally on their way to Tso Moriri. But I'd researched about it & had told my cabbie I wanted to halt here. The best part was having the lake all to myself.The Kyagar Tso is a small brackish lake surrounded by mountains. From afar, you can spot it from its turquoise colour. As you get closer, you'll notice salt deposits on its bank. It was too pretty for words!"
4,Kyagar_Tso,sandeep k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Best way to spend time ,This is a good place where we have to spend much time near this lake . It's very cool place and attractive to people many of tourist will enjoy there picnics

6,Kyagar_Tso,shash4333,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,A tiny little lake with a magnificent view,"You probably wouldn't have Kyagar Tso in your list of lakes to visit. It will most probably be an accidental visit for you on your way towards Tsomoriri. For me though, it's one of the highlights on this particular route. I tend to spend more time here than at Tsomoriri. It's absolutely a midget when compared to its more enormous counterparts like Pangong Tso and Tsomoriri, but definitely not the least beautiful."
7,Kyagar_Tso,Lovers_paradise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Saline Lake Near Tso Moriri,"Kiagar Tso lies in the Rupshu Valley of Ladakh at the height of over 4,000 m above sea level. It lies midway between Manali in Himachal Pradesh and Leh in Jammu and Kashmir if you take the road to Tso Morori. Tso Morori is about 30 km from here. Kiagar Tso is a saline lake and is surrounded by the mountain fauna like sheep, goat and yak. However due to shrinking glaciers on the surrounding mountains the water levels in the lake are receding."
8,Kyagar_Tso,royjay2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Small Lake near Tso Moriri,"Kyagar Tso is a very small saline water lake in the Ladakh at an elevation of 4.705 m above sea level, The road to the lake includes paved sections but is mostly unpaved. Along this part, the road is very bumpy, on gravel and stone strewn sections. It is located near the famous Tso Moriri lake."

2,Kyagar_Tso,Shreyas Macwan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,A jewel hidden under the fame of Tso Moriri.,"We travelling Pangong Tso to Tso Moriri.This Lake is situated on the road from Sumdo to Korzok.I heard(read) many praises about a small lake before Tso Moriri. We were driving towards Korzok. I was waiting for Tso Kiagar. After a while, we came across the first view of Tso Kiagar. It was beautiful.We reached Tso Kiagar. We stopped on the road. I tried to get out of the XUV but there were lots of flies. I got back in the car.I got back in the car. We were about to move and I thought, we came this far, how could some flies stop us?. I turned the car towards the Lake. I got out, touched the water, clicked some photographs and rushed back to the car. Those flies were fierce.I don't understand why there were so many flies. I wanted to spend more time with this beautiful lake but those flies attacked me and I had to get back in the Car."
3,Kyagar_Tso,doomslag,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,A beautiful lake ,We came here because the tour that accompanied us make a stop. I didn’t know the name of the lake at first. Then I knew that it’s called Kyagar Tso after the driver told us. It’s a pretty lake in the upper hill. Make sure you visit this lake before going to Tso Moriri

Never had I seen such a beautiful and unspoilt lake...water was crystal clear and very cold.This lake is on the way to Tso Moriri... and for a moment, we thought this was Tso Moriri as even this lake was huge... we spent more than an hour clicking pics and strolling along the shore... not many tourists here...If you're planning for Tso Moriri... pls ensure to make an hour stop here.... its worth every bit of it... No restaurants / shacks / hotels here.... only tents..."
5,Kyagar_Tso,vinay_galactus,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Simply awesome,Kiagar Tso is an unbelievable place. We visited this place in mid september. It was chilling cold waves flowing out there. We were the only people near the lake. You can enjoy the beauty of this place with peace. Amazing lake!!!!Not everyone has Tso Moriri in their itinerary. But it is a very beautiful place and unexplored. Our itinerary for this place was: Leh to Tsomoriri via Chumatang and Kiagar Tso and back to leh via Tso kar and Tanglang la pass.  https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297624-d319681-r534230360-Tso_Moriri-Ladakh_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html#
6,Kyagar_Tso,ThePrateekSethi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Breathtaking and pristine!,This small lake enroute to Tsomoriri is fantastic! We spent a full day here because of the number of birds we saw on the lake. A great place for camping in the wild on your own with no humanity for a few kilometres!

9,Kyagar_Tso,Seshan Iyer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Nice Place to be - Must see,All lakes in Leh are a must see. Every lake is unique. This lake will be approachable on the way to Tso Moriri Lake and one cannot miss this. It would look desolated with only nomads with yak and sheeps around. But is a nice lake to halt and spend an hour or two.
0,Kyagar_Tso,Mahua S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Picture postcard view!,"While travelling from Leh, after crossing the Mahey Bridge, on the way to Tso Moriri lies this brackish lake, one of the three lakes in the Rupshu Plains. The view is breathtaking. This region is habited by Changpa tribesmen, and one can spot their camps near or around the Lake. For those too enthralled by the beauty of this little lake and wishing to stay overnight, one can ask for a tent. Frequented by many migratory birds, and kiang , marmot, geese, yak-  if one is lucky to spot these here. It is easy to be tempted to linger on here, however, since Tso Moriri is usually the destination, one must move on ! Enjoy the wide expanse of the Rupshu Plains and the clouds playing in the darkest blue skies!"
1,Kyagar_Tso,melroyd80,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,Very beautiful lake,"Beautiful lake but stay, food and rest room facilities need to be improved as there are not many options as well."
2,Kyagar_Tso,infoaddict,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Not Tso Morriri,You will pass by this small lake on the way to Tso Morriri. If the weather is good then it's worth a brief stop to take in the view.
3,Kyagar_Tso,shashindrak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,BREATHTAKING KYAGAR TSO,"While on way to Tsomriri a beautiful saline water lake situated at an elevation of 4705 meters attracts every traveler The lake lies in Rupsu valley,A very barren  breathtaking beautiful  view is around the lake.Can be stopped for a hour here."
4,Kyagar_Tso,Pratik Banerjee,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016,Serene Surprise,"Not many take the road from Manali to reach Leh and I was quite clear that the first time I will go to Leh was only via Manali. While often such decisions proved right for me, this is one occasion where I was never overwhelmed with the extent of the outcome of such a decision. Surely a Journey of many lifetimes. But even in that many go stratight to Leh after a overnight halt at Sarchu or Jispa. We decided to halt more and divert ourselves via Tso Kar and Tso Moriri. While both these places turned out to be absolute gems, but the sheer surprise on the way to Tso Moriri from Tso Kar was the gradual emergence of glistening blue waters suddenly from nowhere in the backdrop of the rugged mountains scattered with patches of snow. We indeed missed reading about this hidden gem and hence wasn't at all expecting it and its sheer beauty and that too without any expectation and the divine serenity made it a never-to-be-forgotten experience. we stepped out from the the, and apart from clicking a few snaps, just stood there in the vast expanse of Himalayan desert with this oasis in front of us and no one but we and our car."
5,Kyagar_Tso,Debasis,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Nice & calm & beautiful,"This one also near to Tso moriri Lake, but day by day loosing it charm because of brackish water. As per locals, its sacred. Me along with my friends just too few snaps & then moved ahead to Tso moriri."
