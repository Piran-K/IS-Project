There were many foreigners seen around the temple.The ticket for this temple and another monestary is sold together.The view from the temple of the Nubra valley is simply awestrucking.
1,Lachung_Temple,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Giant statue of Maitreya Buddha,We had visited this temple located at the lower level of Diskit monastery during our trip to Nubra Valley. We had to pay common entrance tickets for this temple and Diskit monastery. The temple is a small one dedicated to Sakyamuni Lord Buddha but the main attraction is the giant statue of Maitreya Buddha outside the temple. All tourists were enjoying clicking pics with this beautiful giant statue and also the view of Nubra Valley from this place was just breathtaking. We enjoyed the peaceful ambience of this place.
