1,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Rakesh G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,LBR team is very helpful and highly recommeded.,"LBR is a great team and very helpful people. We had taken 2 bikes on rent from them for 5 days for Umling La. Besides the bikes being in good condition the team helped us with additional items like jerry cans, bungee cords and even a local SIM card and without even asking twice.In material value terms these may not seem big, but it was the helping nature and attitude of LBR team that impressed me a lot.I would highly recommend LBR for taking bikes on rent when in Ladakh.Thanks Tsewang and team for your amazing service."

5,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Manon belgium,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,AMAZING,"I want to say a big THANK YOU to Ladakh Bike Rental. Thanks to them, and especially to Gurmat and Kel, we have had the BEST TRIP EVER.With a good mix between good roads and off-road, our itinerary took us to lost places far from mass tourism: all what we wanted.  The landscapes are spectacular and the locals are super friendly.  Homestays, small hotels, campsites, beautiful hotels, it was very varied. We asked them to bring us to ‚Äúlost‚Äù places without mass tourism, which makes that we had some nights without shower/internet/confort but those nights were in the most beautiful places I have never seen in my life so it was really worth it. (They can adapt the trip and bring you to more confort places and/or more touristy). As we were only two riders (women), we decided to take a guid during our bike trip. We were so lucky to have this guid, Kel. Friendly, funny, cultured, strong, always there to help us and flexible.  It was a real pleasure to share this trip with him. I hope we will see you soon for another trip in India The bikes were very nice and quite easy to ride. Nevertheless, if you do the same trip as us, it‚Äôs better to have a bit of experience in off roads. To summarise, I really recommend Ladakh Bike Rentals!! I also recommend the hostel, @the Courtyard ü§©ü§©"
6,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,SacreTeam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Exceptionnel ! Organisation sur mesure parfaite !,"Exceptional from start to finish! Ladakh bike rental, represented by Gurmat immediately responded to our request and did everything possible to first prepare our trip and to make it extraordinary on site.My daughter (25) and I (61) rented two Himalyan Royal Enfield motorbikes for a wonderful tour in Ladakh to remote places, off the beaten track from June 10 to 24, 2022. Gurmat found us an exceptional guide to complete this adventure. Indeed, two women needed a guide and mechanic for this trip....When we arrived in Leh, the welcome was great. Gurmat and his team first made us stay 2 days in this friendly hotel The Courtyard in order to get used to the altitude and to shine the first 2 days around Leh to familiarize ourselves with motorcycles. The bikes were in excellent condition and only had 6000km on the clock.Then we left with this great and friendly guide, Kel Sherpa, 12 days to discover this beautiful region, our luggage on our motorcycles.Fantastic! Breathtaking landscapes, sometimes difficult but manageable roads. We passed passes over 5000m, sometimes a little snow and only 1 day of rain.We had various accommodations, often very comfortable, sometimes less given the very remote places.We lived intense moments, made wonderful encounters, learned a lot about the country, the culture, visited monasteries.The reception of the inhabitants of Ladakh was very friendly and often impressed to see two women discovering their country by motorbike!We enjoyed every moment, enjoyed the Indian food, never got sick or had any altitude related issues.The program was just perfect!We 100% recommend Ladakh Bike Rental for its efficiency, its kindness and for having organized a tailor-made trip for us to know authentic Ladakh.Thanks again to Ladakh Bike Rental and Kel Sherpa for making us live this unique adventure."

Even before booking, Gurmat was extremely helpful with tips to help me plan my trip. When I landed I had a brand new Himalayan and all the gear I required. The bike was flawless and the equipment in good condition. I also stayed in the Courtyard above the bike shop. The room was comfortable and the open area in the middle was great for socialising and planning the trip and potential detours with Gurmat. The food was perfect for the climate - tasty, filling and warm. If you‚Äôre looking for a bike or bike tour in Ladakh and/or need a place to stay, this is highly recommended."

Gurmat has planned our short visit to Leh ladakh is a proper way that we got to see the adventurous side and the mesmerizing beauty of ladakh. The stay provided by him in Chospa Hotel was amazing and luxurious  which had built in a luxurious ladakhi architecture. Tashi's has been so humble with us and took care of us like a family member. He was always ready for every challenge just to ensure we dont miss anything in our trip (Just for the view which I can enjoy sitting in the front seat, he stopped the vehicle on the way to khardungla for which he had to struggle for 20mins to keep the vehicle moving again as it was stuck in snow), he ensured that we stay warm all the time by making a hot coffee when ever required and was always available with us for clicking some amazing pictures of us. Not to the surprise picture which he clicked and sent to me after me reaching home to surprise me again.Will definitely prefer only Ladakh Bike Rental for any trips and tours to all my colleagues and family.Hoping to travel with you guys again soon...!!!Lots of love from Hyderabad ‚ù§Ô∏è"

They will get it all covered for you. No matter how bad the weather is, No matter if thing go sideways, they have preparation for everything. I just loved their network. All the hotels I stayed in, every single one of them gave the best hospitality possible. I booked a bolero with an himalyan. The driver named tsetan doorjay was very very very helpful. Whenever bike riding was not possible because of excessive snow we just put the bike onto back side of bolero and just sit in the car. They had snow chains, oxygen cylinder every necessary thing with them. I travelled for 8 days and every day it was snowing and because of their proper arrangements we crossed every pass easily. Gurmat bhai and tsewang bhai both of them are very humble. We decided to spend a day with them and change our last day plan and they didn't hesitated to change the plan at the last moment. Last day they showed us leh Market and helped us in shopping. The trip was so amazing that I am planning the same trip again this year and half of my excitement is to meet the LBR crew again. They stayed in touch whole year as we are friends now. Prices are also very reasonable. Can't wait to meet them... üíØ Thanks for such a great experience gurmat bhaiya."

7,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Ragul Ravichandran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Leh,  Ladakh - 2021","The favourite part was to experience ladakh during winter and to learn about the people's culture during this season. First day Mr Gurmet picked us from airport and dropped in a very nice stay ( deja vu). That day was just to take rest and adapt to the altitude and temperature. Next day we started driving to lamayuru which is 120 km away from leh. The bikes ( Himalayan)  provided from the Ladakh bike rental was in very good condition and it was properly maintained.  We had a great experience on the way to lamayuru and mr Gurmet arranged a very nice comfortable stay in lamayuru. After 2 days of experiencing lamayuru we headed to the adventurous ride on kardhungla, nubra valley and panong lake. Mr Gurmet arranged us a local guy ( Mr Dorjey ) for the local guidence and support. He was excellent hardworking guy we ever met. He made our trip very comfortable even in the most uncomfortable places like panong frozen lake  with the temperature of minus 21 degree Celsius.  Because of the proper planning and management from Mr Gurmet ( Ladakh bike rental) we had a very great time experiencing the place and explore the culture.  Charges are very reasonable and very effective. He won't charge you any extra money. Very genuine and very trustworthy guy to plan your trip.  And thanks to Mr Gurmet and Ladakh bike rental team  for making our trip as a memorable and as a life changing experience. Even we had a lot of conversation about the place and culture with Mr Gurmet which gave a lot of information about the place and context. Once again thanks a lot for all the efforts you have put for our trip. We felt very happy and satisfied with your Service.  I strongly recommend him. üòÅ"

Gurmat (CEO of LBR) is super friendly and professional bike rental operator.. In Early March i contacted him to ask about single solo trip 11 days to ladakh, and he replied my email in no time.. Month later, i emailed him back, to ask about private tour for 4 riders (11 Days , Into Thin Air Tour - Itinerary like in LBR website), and then he replied me in no time with good explanation about The Tour itself and ask what do we want for motorcycle... So, i asked him that we were 4 riders, want to ride 3 Himalayan and 1 Classic RE, with lite modified itinerary and ask a mechanic to accompany us within the tour.. Then he replied me again about T&C and Quotation with very very very very good price.When we arrived at Srinagar, we were welcomed by Stanzin using toyota Innova taxi and take us to departure point.The bikes is very well maintained (LBR always sell their bike after 3 years operating)..From previous email, Gurmat told me that he will provide a backup vehicle for just 4 days (2 days in the early tour and 2 days before the tour ends), but in fact he gave us BONUS a back up vehicle within the tour so we dont have to attached our luggage on the bike woohooo...

6,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,dead_monkee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Adventure of a lifetime with Ladakh Bike Rental,"Ladakh is a hidden gem in India and thanks to Gurmat and his crew we had a wonderful experience conquering the wild terrain in Ladakh on two wheels in April 2017.We got in touch with Gurmat in early March, and despite the short notice he offered us a well planned itinerary. The trip consisted of visiting Leh and its surrounding remote villages on a Royal Enfield Bullet 500. Tour guide, mechanic, supporting vehicle and accommodation for all days in Ladakh are included. On the day of arrival we were greeted by Gurmat and checked our vehicles. The machines were well maintained, and any adjustment request to the bike was taken care of by the team mechanic immediately.The roads of Ladakh are mainly sandy gravel and rocky hillside roads. If one decided to go higher up the mountains, the rider encounters wet mud and even snow in early April. Despite the harsh terrain, our tour guide and mechanic led the trip with a passion and helped us avoid the many dangers of the road. With that being said, adventure riding in Ladakh is a big challenge to the skill and responsiveness of a rider. Winter motorcycle protection is strongly recommended. Ladakh Bike Rental is well prepared in that aspect - the company has plenty of gear to borrow from waterproof off-road boots to full face helmets.Again we thank the people in LBR team - Gurmat and Tsewang Namgail, Stanzin Khakyab and others for providing an excellent Ladakh experience. Hope we will return some day for the Zanskar..."

Gurmat the manager handled all my requests pretty fast and easily by changing my routes as I wanted and tried to offer a good price/quality package for almost 9 days. My guide/mechanic Norbu was helpful and a good companion. He managed to invite me for almost 3 nights and 4 days at his family home as I requested to LBR (live with local people) and he helped me discover some great hidden place around Kargil and Wakha (trekking/biking gems). Also Gurmat and his team helped me find a cheap flight ticket from Leh to Delhi 2 days before my departure as no seat was left online. As a solo traveler, i enjoyed the package and i truly recommend LBR as a tour booking manager for the Ladakh region."

The planned trip (for my son & I) was 14 days touring the Ladakh region of Kaskmir.We had zero problems and everything worked perfectly, from being met at the airport, to the bike tour with Phuntsok, our excellent mechanic & guide. We had a fantastic experience, crossing the three highest navigable passes on the planet (& other lower passes), visiting some of the remotest areas I have ever encountered and all of the time the scenery was breath-taking and the people we encountered were splendid, colourful & friendly. Every minute my helmet camera was off, I felt I was missing both scenery & local culture. I took the 'Deluxe' package, but I would recommend (for the small extra charge) that people considering this trip should opt for 'Luxury' in Leh, and take whatever is available when touring in the remote areas.I had a Royal Enfield 500cc Classic and this is the best of the available bikes for the terrain. The 'Himalayas' looks better, but the Classic is the bike for the job!Five star plus to Gurmat, Phuntsok & the rest of the team!!! I have no hesitation recommending them for such a trip, which should definitely be on one's 'Bucket List'!"
5,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,lokiez,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Had a Nice trip,"I opted for ""Camps & Rides"" tour and i had a good experience. Whole trip was well organised and despite it being an eight day tour which requires good planning, Gurmat was flexible to accommodate our requests for route change just a day before!! A friend of ours was having trouble riding bike, so Gurmat provided us an extra person who drove his bike at no extra cost!! Absolutely amazing.You can trust ""Ladakh Bike rental"" for their word, atleast i had good experience.There was one small issue during the trip. I have not driven bike on mountain ever so i was slow with my ride and support vehicle driver kept on pushing to drive fast which was little annoying and can be risky as well. But still it was all manageable and i would definitely recommend them for Bike rental and tours."

From start to finish, Gurmat and his crew ensured (1) safety - extremely important for these roads. Every morning, our guide Angry, mechanic Sandeep and support driver Justin would ensure all bikes were in good condition. Angdu matched his pace/speed to our skills and road conditions(2) mesmerizing destinations and sites - which is the draw of ladakh. our tour brought us through the best of Ladakh with all 3bhighest passes and overnight stays at 3 Highest lakes. with stops at some of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen in my life. Pardon the pics, all shot with my mobile and I am a lousy photographer(3) great customer service - accommodating every request we had for them including ensuring members of our groups got their best photos, setting up a camp fire, buying water for us. Even his own lodging house staff Pradeep, Shankar and Reedam saw to our every need and cooked meals to our preference!If you are doing a Ladakh bike trip, LBR is the company to go for!Lastly, I have read negative reviews about communications - having been starved of connectivity (there is zero roaming and wifi, when available in Leh only is at best patchy), it is understandable if they are slow in response."

I went to change the bike but owner said this is only option even it's in bad condition. also the accessories that he gave me with bike didn't work ND a case happened that the air in back Tyre was too low, we started using the accessory to blow air but it was defective. The worst part is the last 2 days were pangong lake ND when we started the journey, the bike couldn't start In morning so we took a cab. When we asked the owner to refund 1 day money as the bike didn't worked, he refused even after his mechanic came ND saw that the bike is really in bad condition ND didn't started even after they tried. I really request the people not to take the bike from this source as they cheat the innocent travellers even after promising a good service. I am genuine rider ND came to leh on September 2017."

I want to dedicate my Ladakh trip to gurmat namgail( founder of Ladakh bike rental co.), Thank you sir for providing me an amazing bike and your guidance were certainly helpful in my trip.The most remarkable thing about Ladakh bike rental is that they are available round the clock and incase if you need any help they are just a phone call away. Also gurmat sir turned out to be my good Samaritan in my hour of need when I had carelessly lost my bike keys on my return journey, when I was stranded in the pangong valley.

Since we were aware that there is very poor phone and internet connectivity in the Ladakh region, we dropped a mail; but Mr. Gurumat, the owner was quick to respond. We gave our requirements and he acknowledged. He requested us to make an advance payment and was very courteous throughout. We were constantly in touch with him and upon our arrival in Leh, we informed him. He made arrangements to escort us to his garage.Mr. Namgyal, who heads the service section, who also happens to be the chief of staff, showed us the vehicles that were to rent and his staff was working on giving final touches to it. He requested us to make full payment for the same and we also had submit a caution deposit of Rs. 5,000 per bike that would be returned to us when we hand over the bikes back to them. After the financial part was settled, he also asked if we wanted an Inner Line Permit (ILP). Since we had not applied for an ILP, we decided to get it done from him for a very nominal fee. He informed that the ILP would arrive after a day or two and that we had to collect it then. As per our plan, we acclimatized ourselves over these two days and got used to the bikes by riding for short distances. On the third day, we visited their garage and collected the ILP and also, got the carriers fixed on our bikes. We were provided with new helmets and other riding gear such as, knee guards, elbow guards, riding jackets, gum boots etc. All of this was included in the rental fee and we did not pay anything extra to avail these. Mr. Namgyal also provided essential spare parts such as clutch wires, brake shoes, tubes, handpump etc.We set off on our journey and after a couple of days, we found a fault in one of the bikes and Mr. Namgyal was happy to assist us over the phone and the problem was solved. We rerouted our journey to pass through Leh again so that we can visit their garage and get our bikes serviced before continuing. They took a test ride and serviced the bikes accordingly. We continued our journey after this and did not encounter any problems thereafter.We returned our bikes in good condition after the rental period and through this course, we had fostered a very good relationship with everyone working there. What I loved about LBR is that they are very warm and courteous to their customers and make them feel very comfortable. Each time we visited their site, we were offered beverages/snacks and we were treated very well. Mr. Gurumat has very good working relationships with both his staff and his customers and it was an absolute delight to be associated with LBR. We would highly recommend LBR for anyone looking to rent bikes in Leh."

At the outset, I believe you have to experience the service of a provider before you rate them. 
Secondly, the rise in price was an honest mistake by one of the 5 employees of LBR who reply to 100s of mails every day. He didn't refer to the earlier mails while sending the invoice and hence failed to see that we had offered you a discount earlier (about a month and around 10 conversation threads ago). You hadn't even paid the advance amount.

11,,,,,,"I was in Leh in July 2017 with two buddies. We rented 3 Royal Enfield 350 Classics from Ladakh Bike Rentals for 8 days. Gurmat, the owner, was incredibly helpful in organizing the reservation and answering all of the questions that we had. Once on the ground, he picked us up from our guesthouse and brought us to his impressive rental shop where we went over the trip plan and revised it based on road and weather conditions. The bikes were nearly brand new (< 3000km) and worked flawlessly. In addition to the bikes, we also hired a support vehicle and guide. Our guide (Mili) was fantastic and helped us navigate the multiple military checkpoints and ensured that we reached our desired destinations! It was certainly the trip of a lifetime and having Ladakh Bike Rentals as our outfitter was a pivotal decision in making the trip such an absolute success."

Eight of us went and all had a great time the tour was great the roads and scenery were fantastic some of it was on dirt roads and some tarmac. If your after 5* and silk pyjamas I'd go else. If your after an experience of remoteness stunning scenery and nice people this will tick your boxes the camping and food was very good great guide, can't fault it really i would have preferred to do it on my ktm but the enfields added to the experience. Glad I did it if your reading this debating wether to do it or not GO FOR IT.. üëç"

6,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,raxas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Excellent Service! Thumbs up to these guys!,"Had an excellent experience with Gurmat and his teams. Communicating with him prior to arrival is a headache because of poor internet and network downtimes, which actually got us a little worried. But from the point we landed in Leh, GurmatAnd his boys were extremely responsive and cooperative. Bikes are all almost new. We were a group of 5 riders and we got bikes that had run 340kms, 890kms, 2800kms, 6200kms and 19200kms. Except for one, all were practically brand new and in excellent condition. We had also taken on rent a mechanic, Dalix because we were worried if we would have issues on the way, but had almost none. Dalix was extremely helpful. A quiet chap but that was to our advantage too üòú. On the whole, brilliant experience. Most other rentals we saw had pathetic looking bikes compared to the almost brand new stuff Gurmat gives us. Wouldnt hesitate to recommend him. And if theres another ladakh bike trip, it is only with Gurmat. All the best guys and keep giving customers such good service. God bless"
7,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Chris S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Exceptional all round !!,"Myself and seven other guys from the UK just enjoyed a nine day tour with Ladakh Bike Rentals.  Can't praise them highly enough, the tour guide and backup crew were exceptional in every respect, the bikes were almost faultless and any problems soon sorted without drama.  We covered 1300Ks over some of the most dramatic and challenging roads but couldn't smile any wider.   Thank you everyone and keep up the good work."
8,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,GKrish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Enroute Khardangla vehicle Breakdown,"Visited Leh in 17th May for 8 days, the main purpose was to ride to Khardungla along with my wife. All started well until we reached 15kms from Leh. We stopped for picking up a stuff from our bagpack, switched off the ignition andit did not come back. It was Bullet 500 206model 18k ridden. The vehicle was good 2 days before the this ride. But our bad luck, battery failed and fails to start.However we managed to call the Tsewang with great difficulty, by borrowing the phone from a passer. We had to be in that cold weather for 2hrs+ and managed to return the vehicle and take a taxi to Khradangla. It was indeed a great ride of 15kms. We did enjoy spending time of 2 hrs doing nothing in the isolated area. Since it was 1st week of May just then the season started we did not have many tourists passing."
9,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,GVK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,No better team than Ladakh Bike rentals to have on this epic journey,"We went with Gurmat's team on the Manali-Leh trip last year mid July. As most people who plan this once in a lifetime undertaking, we tried to do an exhaustive amount of planning and preparation. Put aside the bikes (great condition), the accommodation (sufficient) and the services (sincere), what really made this trip special for us in ways we did not expect is the personal touch from Gurmat's team.In our pre-travel communications, connectivity was a problem and that created doubts in my mind as to their reliability, but I was completely wrong. This was just because of the nature and location of their jobs. In due time, we got all our questions patiently answered, were able to discuss different routes and plan custom itineraries to our hearts content and all this at a very reliable and transparent cost.The day we set out from Manali, all the preparations were in place and all of us even got new helmets when we complained about our old ones being in bad shape. We has asked for a mechanic to ride with us (an absolute must, or you can opt for a backup vehicle with a mechanic). What we were expecting is an experienced professional who would guide us and keep us out of harms way. What we got was Tani. At first glance, he seemed like a quiet kid and we were openly questioning whether he had the experience to help and guide us along the trip. Turns out he is an awesome biker, has the mountains in his heart and biking in his veins, knows all the routes in and out and is a boss when it comes to fixing bikes in absolutely dreadful conditions. He must have fixed different problems with our bikes ranging from small to big about half a dozen times apart from graciously helping out the numerous tense, stranded travelers we kept encountering enroute. Apart from all this, he single handedly made this a special trip with his infectious enthusiasm and colorful personality. Some of the accommodation enroute can be charitably called basic, but that's part of the experience (the toilets everywhere were absolutely clean). We also stayed in Gurmat's own hotel in Leh. The place was like heaven after our spartan nomadic lifestyle of the previous week, but the service cannot be compared to a professional hotel. The trip was also not one that went close to military precision. This went both ways as in all our interactions, they never came across as ""business minded"". All of their suggestions were with our benefit in mind and the pricing was reasonable and transparent. When we kicked things off in Manali, there was some confusion because of which they actually sent down a backup vehicle from Leh to Manali which had to turn around halfway and they didn't charge us for it. Ditto when returning the bikes -they were obviously the worse for wear and were sporting some new scuffs and dents. But Gurmat's team really didn't have the mindset of wringing money from customers. It took us a little while to grasp that Gurmat and his team (I unfortunately cannot recollect the names of the others) are in this coz they love what they do. More than anything else, it was the personal touch and warmth of each of them that elevated what ought to be a legendary trip into the realms of magical."
0,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Gourav99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Simply the best possible service you can get,"I was in Leh for 5 days with my partner . After reaching the hotel I called them up with no prior arrangement and enquired abt a bullet . Asked them to get it to the hotel next morning around 10 am. The owner was very polite n courteous I think his name was Gurmat . Took the delivery next day checked the bike and took a test ride before accepting it for 1000 Indian Rupees a day and pledged my Voter ID card. I got an Electra that had 10000 kms on it , considering Leh standards it was new. After riding it for a day I felt that the Brakes got very loose so called them up and they showed up in the morning on time and fixed the brakes and we rode around for a couple more days. After 3 days I felt like extending the possession for 2 more days so I called up the owner he agreed no confusion . U need to fill fuel at your own expense and the mileage was around 30-40 kms / liter. At the end of my stay the night before I had to leave they came and took the bike , paid them the cash as agreed earlier and took my ID proof back frm them. The whole experience was just great thanks to Ladakh Bike Rental and their team. KUDOS to these guys for doing a great job and offering gud service overall.IF U LIKED MY REVIEW OR THINK ITS HELPFUL PLZ CLICK THE ""THANK"" BUTTON BELOW AND LETS KEEP SHARING OUR STORIES :)"

3,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Andrea M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Amazing ride on Royal Enfield Bullet,"We booked our two bikes with Ladakh Bike Rental as we were advised it could get very busy during July. From the initial email to returning the bikes we only experienced helpful staff and super friendly service. This was my first trip on a RE 350, I was a bit nervous at first but the guys put all my fears to rest and off we went. Across Changla to Pangong Lake, into the Zanskar valley and to basically all the monasteries in and around Leh. What a wonderful experience it was. Ladakh Bike Rental - Thank you for an amazing time!"
4,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Zubin Mark Fernandes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Ladakh on 2 wheels,"I am surprised people have give bad reviews to LADAKH BIKE RENTAL. I have just got back to Bombay after spending 13 days in leh and I must say that Mr. Gurmat took great care of me and my mate right from picking us up to dropping us back to the airport at 5am,and e evrything else in between. The bikes were perfect with no cause for concern. We were given brand news spares for both vehicles. As also the stay at his hotel was a delight as all the helpers were literally very helpful at any given time of the day or night. Especially Raju with his smile and my friend Sangam who was always singing at any time of the day. Thank you LADAKH BIKE RENTAL-11500FEET &  THANK YOU GURMAT."

6,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,John B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Dangerous organisation, do not book with them.","The Ladakh region is beautiful and I have made three motorbike trips in India and many throughout the world but this organisation is the worst I have ever been with, where do I start...Second day, one bike had the foot peg snap off, third day another. The bikes were rusted through and Gurmat the owner confirmed 'we don't have enough time between tours to fix properly' Another day the whole back fender of my bike fell off so no lights or indicators for the rest of the tour.Another day we ran out of fuel, they forgot to fill up the spare cans, whilst they were off looking for fuel 2 of the mechanics were racing around sand hills on the bikes, wasting fuel and crashed twice, these were the bikes paying customers then rode...Another morning we were to have an early start but the camp boys wouldn't get up so we wasted the early start 'I cant make them get up' was the tour organisers response...No first aid kit with the group, one guy (when his foot peg came off and he had to ride the bike without a peg; no spares) burnt his leg on the exhaust, not even a bandage on the support vehicle.The support vehicle got stuck in a water crossing, they had no rope, no chain, strap or anything to recover the vehicle, tour group wasted hours trying to push the vehicle out of the water.No communication, no clear route, no professional approach that I've experienced in other India tour organisers. Bikes are absolutely not maintained to the point they are falling apart through rust.....Ladakh is beautiful but spoiled by this amateur, unprofessional and very dangerous organisation."
7,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Gaspard G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Memorable trip and great service,"We went for 11 days motorbike trip in Zanskar valley. Gurmat has been super helpful and reliable prior to the trip, welcomed us upon arrival in Leh, and gave us a tailor made, 100% flexible trip.We were 5 friends and had a back up team of 4, with a great guide/photographer, a talented cook, a strong mecanician and a good driver. The bikes were perfect (royal enfield bullet and classic 500cc), the camping gear new (north face tents, matresses, etc...), and the itinerary simply amazing.I recommend the Zanskar tour if you are an experienced biker and have a good physical condition (some days are 10 hours on dirt tracks), but it is definitely worth it.Food, landscapes, rides, back up team, gear: everything was fantastic!"
8,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Johnson R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Awesome experience with Gurmat,"It was a nice visit to Ladakh with my office colleagues. We thought of biking in Leh and after some research we narrowed down our option to LBR. We required 5 bikes for four days. We got the bikes on time and also they offered the spares, repair and puncture kits. Gurmat provided enough information about the routes and some useful things. There was a landslide enroute to pangong but he offered some advice which lead us to visit the pangong lake with ease. Also he offered a cab to reach Manali which was a good ride till Manali and also he offered a good price for us. Overall it was a good experience for us with Ladakh bike rental. Thanks to Gurmat and team for his support given to us."
9,Ladakh_Bike_Rental,Darin A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Good price, but their poor communications in their team tainted the trip","There are some pros of this company that I will list later, but I want to describe the situation that drives this rating first.On the section going to Pangong Lake we stopped shortly after Chang La Pass to huddle up for lunch. At this point both of our mechanics were sent back over the pass to pick up needed motorcycle parts given the number of breakdowns (this plays in later). When we continued we got about 7 miles from Pangong and were stopped dead by a massive landslide covering the road (with our tent / kitchen truck already on the other side). We were forced to return to the nearest city prior to overnight, which was complicated by a local festival taking up many of the available rooms. After some time we were finally able to secure lodging but with most of us (including couples) now sharing rooms with multiple people. It was an uncontrollable event, we were told that we would be reimbursed for the rooms that we then had to pay for, and we accepted that.The next morning we were all disappointed to not be able to see one of the key attractions, but were then frustrated further that we could not move out because there had been no way to reach the mechanics or the kitchen truck - and our guide was unwilling to allow us to proceed without the mechanics to back us up. So we ended up having to do the maintenance on the bikes ourselves and ended up sitting around the guest house until noon before we finally got some communications with the mechanics so they could meet up with us. So at this point we had missed a key attraction, had paid for a set of shared / crowded rooms ourselves, and lost 4 hours the next morning doing our own maintenance and  waiting for the mechanics.Ultimately when the trip was over we talked to the owner expecting him to honor the reimbursement we were promised. We were floored when he adamantly rejected the reimbursement to us coming up with a number of non-relevant reasons (for example, that he had upgraded some folks to 500cc bikes - even though I had already paid for a 500cc bike). He would not be persuaded, even when we suggested he cover half the cost given the 'act of God' nature of the event. Even then he would not reimburse us. It was unfortunate as it tainted what otherwise was a good trip.The pros:- Price (but you get what you pay for in customer service. Also, be sure to ask what a 'luxury tent"" looks like - its a basic 2 person pup tent)- The mechanics and kitchen staff are tremendously hard workers, always up before everyone else and awake after everyone has gone to bed prepping for the next day to keep everything running- The actual trip leader was very accommodating and worked very hard to try to make everyone happy.- The views and challenge of the ride were excellentAgain it's unfortunate that given the issues with the owner I could not give a fully excellent review, otherwise it was a fun trip."
