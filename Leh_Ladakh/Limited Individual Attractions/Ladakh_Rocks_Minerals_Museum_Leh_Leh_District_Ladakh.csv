It answered a lot of our questions regarding the various hues of the Ladakh Landscapes. Mr. Phunchok Angchok (  Founder and Collector) , was present at the time and he patiently ( and humbly) answered all our questions. We were amazed by his vast knowledge on the subject.His collection was so amazing, that we took more than an hour to cover.I sincerely hope the Government /officials in Ladakh assist him in properly establishing a Permanent Museum. That it can become one of the Major tourist attraction in Leh is a given with the right publicity!After all, who would'nt be interested in understanding the topography of Ladakh- one of the main reasons why tourists come to Ladakh in the first place!!!A big Thank You to Mr. Phunchok for adding more Flavour to our mesmerising Ladakh Trip."

That is nothing for such a beautiful place . A ot of information with specimens about Shilajit . Unique . Must see , strongly recommended attraction . "

And I must agree that it was worth visiting. It has a wonderful collection of stones and rocks and all done by one man, without any support from the government. He was sweet enough to explain everything in detail and left us baffled about things we didn't know. With no educational background of geology, the sheer enthusiasm and interest that has led to such a beautiful place is just awesome. A must visit."

4,Ladakh_Rocks_Minerals_Museum,Damia Benet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Amazing,"It is extremely rare to be in the middle of Ladakh and find a Rocks & Minerals Museum of such a good quality. Not only because the specimens are gorgeous but also because the owner, Punchok, who invite me to have a cup of tea and explained the project, knows about the scientific side of it. He has contrasted the speciments according to the Moh's scale and their specific weight. The minerals are identified and its task due to their scarcity is not easy at all. The description of the specimen is accompanied with a definition, what makes it very engaging for the general public but also for schools or anyone who wishes to learn a bit more about rocks and minerals.As I am an enthusiast of minerals I asked Punchok to do some mineral chasing around Ladakh, as my schedule was tight, we had only one day, but it was sufficient time as to see beautiful quartz, pirites, hematites, garnets and rock formations. Punchok knows his land milimeter to milimeter and since he has been a rock and mineral collector by nature since young, he knows the best where to find them. Another good point is that he is a local and has been working in the region as a teacher, so he is respected and is the perfect guide. My experience was just unbelievable; to meet Punchok and his glorious museum was beyond any expectation! Thanks Punchok, hope to see you again!"

7,Ladakh_Rocks_Minerals_Museum,huys25,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,Rocks and minerals museum has poor presentation,"The very old building is in state of repair, but the exhibition inside also needs a vision and some upgrading. The various minerals are packed in TL-tube illuminated showcases with descriptions in two languages.For study purpose it may be intetesting , but the whole presentation is without any inspiration.Some of the minirals shown in the town shops are more interesting.The entry price was Rs 50, although little, I found it money and time wasted."
8,Ladakh_Rocks_Minerals_Museum,MaheshThipse,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Club a visit with Shanti stupa,"It is a small museum displaying a collection of minerals, precious stones, semi-precious stones and fossils from the rocks and mountains of Ladakh.The museum is next to Sankar Goma and pretty close to Shanti stupa so you can club the visit together.The enter fee is Rs 100 per person although they didn't charge for our children."
