But unfortunately when we were to travel pandemic along with tensions with China started and we had to cancel our trip. Sonam ji instead of all his losses that he suffered understood the situation and refunded our entire advance amount. He is a true gentleman and we hope to meet him soon when we again book our ladakh trip through him.

I was travelling alone and sometimes, when one travels alone, excursions can be very expensive, but Sonam managed to organise a car with other fellow travellers to Pangong Lake and I had a great time! Landscape Explorer's assistance continued then in Leh and, thanks to Sonam and his team's kind help, Ladakh is one of the best memories I have of India!"

6,Landscape_Explorer,Istanbulkay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,TRIP OF A LIFETIME,I contacted many tour operators and settled with using Sonam at Landscape Explorer because I felt he listened to exactly what I wanted and not what suited the standard tour routes. I loved working out the design of our tour with him and the journey did not disappoint. The only sadness was missing Pangong lake because of an avalanche on our way there. Sonam immediately organized a raft experience which we totally loved. Zanskar was amazing and Sonam has his family there so knows the area well. I had spent years dreaming of being in this place in the mountains and he helped make that a reality. I would highly recommend using his company. And if you find the blue poppy in the mountains on the Penzila pass post a picture of them here to remind me of their exquisite wild beauty.
