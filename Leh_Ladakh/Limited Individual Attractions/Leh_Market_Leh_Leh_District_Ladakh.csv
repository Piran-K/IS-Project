2,Leh_Market,suresh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Friends,Peep of Leh,"It’s a complete local market gives you a feel of local Leh. Mostly non veg, very limited veg option with decent food. Need to focus on basic infrastructure and development."
3,Leh_Market,Ravsh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Very good,"A must visit place in Leh preferably in the evening when the lights are on. Its a small market with many eateries, ATMs and other shopping options that gives you a wonderful feeling. A wide pedestrian walking space and sitting space as well. Very well managed place-can easily spend 4-5  hours there."
4,Leh_Market,NayantSavani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,A small pedestrian zone,The Main bazaar road has shops lined on both sides selling varied items with few cafes also. It is walking only street.
5,Leh_Market,Redfred320,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,"Rare pedestrianised shopping street in this enjoyable mountain town, plenty of opportunity to buy souvenirs","In a two-week tour of northern India, this was the town centre wee enjoyed most. Pedestrianistion makes for a far more enjoyable shopping and cultural experience, with the added bonus of some attractive bars and restaurants, often hidden away on top floors and only spotted by keeping your eyes upwards. By aiming for the smartest looking pashmina and shawl shops we found helpful and friendly English-speaking staff who were delighted to see foreign tourists for the first time in three years, and negotiated for some beautiful and reasonably priced Indian made scarves and Tibetan handicrafts. There are also a couple of larger, smarter, glass-fronted shops on the left as you walk down nearby Fort Road.  (We avoided the lesser shops and stalls in the market, the product and service generally looked less good.)"

8,Leh_Market,V B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Friends,Filthy city,Filthy city despite the tourist boom. Stray dogs everywhere.  Virtually no place to walk. The municipality should do much more to improve the infrastructure.  Most migrant workers from Jharkhand Nepal and Kashmir are very niceAwful toilets on way to the famous sites

3,Leh_Market,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Roam around to see the colors!,"The Leh Market is pretty. I wandered here with my tour organizer as he told me tales of Tibetan settlements in India. You can find almost anything in this market. A lot of Tibetan shops exist selling woolens, junk jewelry etc. The market is a burst of color.In between, you'll find Ladakhi Muslim bakeries selling the softest of breads. Don't forget to enjoy one! The entire market is quite unlike Indian markets in the sense that it's not noisy."

6,Leh_Market,Cat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,Absolutely beautiful,"Really beautiful place. Could wonder around here for hours looking at all the jewelery, clothes, knick knacks and colours. Locals are so friendly and not pushy at all, stopped plenty of times for a chat. Really calm and relaxed vibe around the town, maybe it's the mountains maybe it's the people, but it's been a lovely first taste of India. "

9,Leh_Market,Peregrineri,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,I liked it better before they over modernized it,"I do like that it's now a walking mall, which it should have been since many years. (This happened just in the last few years.) However, to make the new mall, they tore down some beautiful old trees. And many of the buildings have been renovated in a way that destroyed the beautiful, traditional Ladakhi architecture. And it is heavily tourist oriented now, which also detracts from the charm. Still, if you go to Leh you have to go there. I do love the ladies who sit on the sidewalk selling their vegetables and apricots etc., though it makes me sad to see tourists running up and sticking their cameras in their faces without even asking if they mind."
0,Leh_Market,ranjanasharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Nice place to hang out,"There is lot of restaurants, all kind of shops pashmina, woolen, crockery, dryfruits and daily use items. It's clean and wide market and in evening there's lot of crowd so you would love it hanging out there. Please buy from Ladakhi localities as they are really based on this. Old granny's sells hand knitted woollen stuff. Don't bargain and buy. Enjoy ..."
1,Leh_Market,Anuradha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Beautiful ,"Unexpectedly it’s a big market with all the basic shops.

2,Leh_Market,mnrkrishnan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Centrally located with European apperance,"Once we reach the central location, we would definitely feel that we are somewhere in Europe.  The pathway, seating arrangement and even the street lamps are different from other Indian markets,  There are lot of Kashmiri shawl shops, Foreign exchange shops, Dry fruits shops, Restaurants and coffee shops.  Once in Leh, please don't miss to visit this Market,which is a unique in itself."
