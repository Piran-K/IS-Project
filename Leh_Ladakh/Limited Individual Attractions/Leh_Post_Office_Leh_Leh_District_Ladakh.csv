Just walking around the area connects one to the lifestyle of people inhabiting Ladakh. Itâ€™s quite cold even in June and to see people sitting on benches and the dogs all curled at their feet is mesmerising. Just a stroll in the area with shops lined up on both sides, the light poles and locals selling vegetables is refreshing."

If you have to send anything from here, make sure it is very well packed. I had stuff pilfered at one time because I didn't seal it well enough. Maybe the problem wasn't here, but it's impossible to know. If you have a parcel stitched, use sealing wax and drip glue along the seams."

One caveat: don't fully close up any packages... you'll have to show the postal employees what is inside your box before you send it. Then you'll need to go to a tailor to have a white sack sewed around the box. Then you'll be able to address it and send it off."

Entry charges are nominal for Indians and for foreign nationals it is almost 3 times what we pay. One gets a very good view of the Leh city and the surrounding Ladakh Range from the palace. Khardung La is also visible on a clear day from the palace. It would be advisable to carry a pair of binoculars or a camera with a good zoom. Photography is prohibited in some parts of the Leh Palace though.

3,Leh_Post_Office,antonymathew,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 â€¢ Solo,A place to remember,"Leh : Few places in India are at once so traveller friendly and yet so enchanting and hassle-free as mountain framed Leh. Dotted with stupas and crumbling mud-brick houses, and old town is dominated by steep rocky ridge topped by Tibetan-style palace and fort."
4,Leh_Post_Office,KGB777,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 â€¢ Solo,This is just a typical Indian post office,Not really sure why this is listed as an attraction. It's just a regular post office. And it's located in the Main Bazaar. Really nothing special at all.
5,Leh_Post_Office,Madhuvanti,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 â€¢ Family,visit for a govt experiance,"this is not the attraction first of all...people go there only if they have something to post or send out of leh.the visit can be irritating and give you a general idea of indian govt.offices...leh office is not the exception.even if you reach on time there will be only one person sitting there who will not bother to talk to you anything until you try to break the silence and speak....staff will be late and adament as ever....the items they have mentioned on their available board is for decoration and not all the items are available so u need to get out of the office for getting cello tape,marker,the wrapping cloth etc several times....this is the best place to practice how to be cool and patient all the times!!! after you gather everything by yourself you need to wait till your turn comes to get the box stitched or else you are free to do it on your own!!kind of India govt office experiance if anyone intends to take visit post office!"
6,Leh_Post_Office,ramadast,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 â€¢ Family,market area,"the place is kept so neat and clean it appeared that one can just sleep thereon without even brooming the area. the people are so proud of their area and they preserve it so well as if it was their own dwelling.  when someone dropped some wrapper on the ground (while parking at some point for passing due to snow), the other drivers who saw the scene just asked the person that he has dropped some of his belonging unknowingly and made the person pick it up and drop it in the nearest dustbins. such sweet and nice persons. we should all learn from them as to how to keep our cities clean."
7,Leh_Post_Office,JustYARandomGuy,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2012 â€¢ Friends,Just yet another govt office.,"Folks seemed distinctly unfriendly to non-locals. But then I have seen that attitude in my local post office too.  So, didn't pay attention -- except hope that the people had a better day when I visited the next time.  But then the rating makes no difference.  Wnen you need a post-office, you need one."
8,Leh_Post_Office,shiva494941,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2012 â€¢ Friends,"Pengong Tso , a lake in Ladakh","A reasonably physically fit person must take a trip to Leh Ladakh area. It is something different and worth visiting. During our visit to this area we went to Pengong Lake. What a sight!!! It is almost 140 km long lake with width ranging from 3-5kms. One third of lake is in India whereas two third is in China. One can see blue strip of water with very tall barren 'Green/Blue' mountains on the both sides. What a nature's phenomenon!!!! We were told that this lake freezes completely during winters and one can walk over it and up to some dist can drive a vehicle over it!! Wow!!! Otherwise from Leh it takes almost 5 to 6 hours on very picturesque but an adventourous route. But it is worth a visit once you reach the Lake site. However one must undergo 'acclamatisation period of minimum 2-3 days' as advised by Doctors before you venture out, even you may be fittest person."
9,Leh_Post_Office,princemalik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Friendly faces,I used their service to post plenty of postcards to make my friends jealous. The staff is unusually friendly for Indian standards. They do sell postcards and you can mail letters/postcard to any destination

3,Leh_Post_Office,Lalit B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2012 â€¢ Business,Old building,"Highly overrated.  Nothing much to talk about, except an old post office.  No need to make a special stop for this.There are many other sight-seeing options nearby.  Try the gompas, mosques, and monastries"
4,Leh_Post_Office,jenniferstevens,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2011,Not like the U.S.,"If you are expecting a U.S. esque post office you will not find it here or anywhere in India for that matter. In some aspects the country moves at a slower pace, with the post moving at a slower pace, and if you really desire to immerse yourself in India you have to understand that everything does not go at the speed of light a la the U.S. Workers may be eating right in front of you, while you sit in a chair waiting for post on one letter, but that is the custom and it is all part of the experience. I promise everything will be sent and delivered, just a bit slower :)"
