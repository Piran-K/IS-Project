0,Leh_Royal_Palace,Apolonia70,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Lots of steps but a fabulous view and ancient interiors,"Visited the palace as part of a day tour.  I managed to climb most of the area and appreciated all the drawings, history and views from this epic building. It  can be seem from almost everywhere in Leh city - one got spot for photos is where the statue of the snow leopard is. I couldnt go up all levels but what I saw was unique."
1,Leh_Royal_Palace,Be U,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Just to completed my list of Leh,This is really ancient place was built over 160 years. Nothing much in side the building. People come for the overlooking the Leh town.
2,Leh_Royal_Palace,Aimless Vagabonds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,A must visit attraction for history and culture buffs! Look out for the stairs,This was the main establishment of the Namgyal kings and is a no miss for history and culture buffs! The palace however has 7-9 floors which are connected by narrow and squeaky wooden stairs. This could be a problem for someone with breathing problem or knee problems. Also parking could be a hassle here as the narrow road leading to the Palace are lined by tourist cabs.
3,Leh_Royal_Palace,Ruchirz,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Upkeep desired,"The Palace seems dilapidated. It needs some upkeep. Though the location is excellent, there is hardly any parking place. There are multiple levels to climb, but hardly anything to see. A museum on one of the level also requires upkeep. Mainly, this place can be avoided if want of time"
4,Leh_Royal_Palace,ROOPshila’Shaggy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,View from the top is panoramic.,"A historic wood & mud nine storey building with wide front terraces, low doors, dark passages, a royal temple (were one has to doff off one’s shoes)& a washroom on the fourth floor. The stairs are steep for elderly , the parking is in a disarray , there is a small eatery on the left of the parking ."
5,Leh_Royal_Palace,Arun N,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Bad exoerience,Very bad experience.Nothing to see except empty rooms.No guide or anybody to explain anything.It was a waste of time
6,Leh_Royal_Palace,Avinash Chandra A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,"Extremely disappointing, nothing worthwhile to see except city view from the 8th floor.","Not worth visiting , poor maintenance and no old materials to see. The building itself is shabbily maintained"
7,Leh_Royal_Palace,puchka,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,Important to Tibetian culture,"The Palace perched on a ridge is unique in its architecture, built in the old Tibetan style.  There are a total of nine floors, the last floor closed to public.  Most of the artefacts are not on display, as there is construction work going on.  The roofs are low, and there are benches on every floor to take rest.  A great place to visit to feel how the royalty lived in the palace some five hundred years ago.  A must visit."
8,Leh_Royal_Palace,drkakkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Leh History,Leh palace situated near the Leh market and should be there in the itinerary. Though the palace lacks in antiques or museum but it provide a great view of the city from top floors. The information about the heritage sites in India is good for the students.
9,Leh_Royal_Palace,Debabrata G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Good place well maintained,We were at the Leh palace today for a visit. The motorable road goes all the way up to the entrance. You need a ticket to enter. There are 4 more levels once you have entered. The view from the levels is amazing. I would not say that the inside of the palace rooms was very impressive - mostly modern artefacts. But it is worth looking at the architecture of the building and understanding the logic of how this was built.
0,Leh_Royal_Palace,Redfred320,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Well worth the 20-30 minute hike uphill from the pedestrianised market area,"By starting in the corner of the L-shaped pedestrianised market area, you can follow your nose (in some ways by the smell!) through the winding alleys of an older part of town up to the palace that you can easily see above you. It takes about 20-30 minutes and assumes you are altitude acclimatised. Although none of the original interior artefacts survive, there is an interesting exhibition of the best heritage sites across  India, and the Buddhist shrine within is well worth taking off your shoes to go inside.  Best of all are the views from the top of the palace across Ladakh, and the plain and mountains beyond. There appears to be an entry fee to visit but when we went all the offices were closed so we entered for free. Worth a short hike to visit one of the main attractions of Leh."
1,Leh_Royal_Palace,karthik g,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Visit,"I had visited this place in 2013,it was in a very bad shape,I never recommended people to visit considering the way it was kept,I happened to visit the palace again during my latest visit to Leh,I must admit that the place has been neatly renovated and kept well.It exhibits the rich culture and heritage of Leh & Ladakh.It a must visit place now."
2,Leh_Royal_Palace,Deepak_01,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,A very basic & simple  palace,"Not a very promising palace architecture,but very basic structure with lots of alleys & steep climbs to different floors.It is more of a museum depicting the different heritage sites managed by ASI.If time permits,one can visit here,nothing great."
3,Leh_Royal_Palace,Yadlapati,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Glory of the Past,"Leh Palace also known as Lachen Palkar Palace is a former royal palace overlooking the city of Leh in Ladakh, India. It was constructed circa 1600 by Sengge Namgyal. The palace was abandoned when Dogra forces took control of Ladakh in the mid-19th century and forced the royal family to move to Stok Palace. Built of Wood, sand and stone is devoid of the grandeur associated with Indian Palaces.  Now in ruins and is maintained by ASI. Must visit in LEH."

5,Leh_Royal_Palace,Utpala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,"Easy to reach, awsome to explore","Above the Leh market, this 9 storey palace can be reached through alleyways and steps. It has intricate wood carving, inteesting layout with a courtyard at every storey and awesome view from the top."
6,Leh_Royal_Palace,Mon@,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Solo,Leh Palace,"Be prepared to climb a lot of stairs for a 360° view of Leh. The temple is beautiful, however the overall place has no lighting, fone torch will be handy to use. Online research indicates the Royal family lives in the same palace, however that isn't the case anymore."

9,Leh_Royal_Palace,AK007_IND,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Friends,Ladakh Palace,"Ladakh palace is a seven storied architectural place. Be ready to climb heights. Make sure you find the right path upstairs, since there are no proper sign boards. At the top floor you can have a bird's eye view of the town. There are few displays inside the palace. Only recommended if you like architecture and heights."
0,Leh_Royal_Palace,S.MATHEWS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,"HISTORICAL,RENOVATED,MAGNIFICIENT VIEW","Visited in the afternoon,long que of cars were present.Had to walk up a bit to reach the entrance.Entrance fee was RS 30/- per adult."

6,Leh_Royal_Palace,rajkumar.r,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,A Heritage site at the top of Leh,"It was 400 years old palace with 9 storeys built. Once the Royal family lived here but not now. As it is built over in a higher place , the view of the city from it is very beautiful . Once a beautiful palace and now it is not in a good condition. There is a motorable road  upto the palace and also from the market area you can go to palace by the stairs built there. But it is very difficult to climb up through the stairs.Overall a nice place to visit in Leh."
7,Leh_Royal_Palace,Michelle M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Learn the history!,"Learn the history of Leh's royal family.  It is a wonderful story.  I won't spill the beans, because this was the best surprise for me. The building was beautifully preserved. There are stairs and you are at altitude. "

The palace is a maze of rooms and terraces which look out onto Leh and the surrounding valley.Great views but you need to be mobile to get to the top ,and not subject to vertigo.I found it quite romantic andfull of history"
0,Leh_Royal_Palace,KeshavChakraborty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Most exotic place in city,"If you are in Leh, this is the first place you must visit.An archeological and historical monument with rich heritage of Buddhist culture."
1,Leh_Royal_Palace,Tannu D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,leh palace,"Leh Palace is a former royal palace overlooking the town of Leh, Ladakh, in the Indian Himalayas. The palace was constructed circa 1600 by Sengge Namgyal. It is nine storeys high; the upper floors accommodated the royal family, while the lower floors held stables and store rooms. Much of the palace is in deteriorated condition, and little survives of its interior decorations.The Palace Museum holds a rich collection of jewellery, ornaments, ceremonial dresses and crowns. Chinese thangka or paintings, which are more than 450 years old, with intricate designs still retain the bright colours derived from crushed and powdered gems and stones. Stuctures around the palace's base include the prominent Namgyal Stupa, the colourfully muralled Chandazik Gompa and the 1430 Chamba Lhakhang, with medieval mural fragments located between the inner and outer walls.The palace is being restored by the Archaeological Survey of India."
2,Leh_Royal_Palace,sandeep k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Adorable things,It's the place many things we know and very great place.this palace is very adorable and good looking there are many old things to see
3,Leh_Royal_Palace,Piainindia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Worth it for the stunning views from the open terraces,"This was our fourth visit to Leh and we finally decided to visit the Leh Palace. Well, we kind of tripped onto it ... we were trying to find our way to the Museum and somehow got onto the track leading up to the Palace. By the time we realised where we were headed, we just carried on up, higher, and higher and higher.We would stop every now and again to regain our breath and were struck by how the view changed each time. The Palace charges Rs. 25/- for Indians and Rs. 300/- for foreigners. Wish this discrimination would stop and everyone would be charged the same amount.There are 9 levels and narrow stairwells going up. The highlights of the Palace are the open terraces where, once atop the 8th level (you're not allowed up on the 9th level for some reason), you get the feeling if you reach out far enough, you might touch the sky. It could be fascinating at night!On one of the levels, there was a room with a sign saying, ""Toilet"". It's a 'den' with lots of sand covering the floor and you just 'do your job' (and probably cover it up with some sand?). Only thing is, have someone stand outside the door to keep it ajar so the sunlight can filter in.We enjoyed the walk back down the main road to the village/Leh city.Would we do it again? Nope, once was good enough for all the experiences had :-)"
4,Leh_Royal_Palace,Nitsnath123,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Very Nice View,"Very old structure, however, very unique place to visit as the architecture is very different and the view from some of the places is extraordinary. "

6,Leh_Royal_Palace,The Vagabond,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,A great place maintained extremely poorly by the ASI,"The Palace in itself is unique. A 5 storied building made from brick and mud. Decorated wooden beams and pillars. Windows adorned with intricate wood carving. One gets a birds eye view of city of Leh. So far so good. Coming to maintenance; its really shocking that one of UNESCO world heritage sites is mainained so poorly. No electricity, no guides, not much of descriptions. In absence of electricity major part of the palace is plunged in darkness. Most of the photographs cannot be seen due to darkness. Visitors coming to this marvel have to return dissapointed as they are unable to see nearly 90% of the place. "
7,Leh_Royal_Palace,viveks3,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,High experience,Unique palace at the top of Leh. From main market a path leads to it giving a tunnel like experience. Minimally accessorised with a number of stories to reach the top. Must visit when in Leh

0,Leh_Royal_Palace,Vivekhanand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Great Walking,We visited the Palace on the day of arrival in Leh. Visiting the Palace was great experience for us. It was a warm up trek for us visiting the Palace. 
1,Leh_Royal_Palace,Prasanta D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Enjoyable Royal Palace visit,Tour needs climbing through multiple steps. Entrance fee required. The Palace is closed in the evening. Photography is allowed in most areas.
2,Leh_Royal_Palace,Meera,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Solo,Adventurous Journey from market to the Palace. ,It's so hard to explain in words about the feeling a place gives you. But if you are visiting the palace I have a suggestion for you. Walk to the Palace from the market. Ask anyone and they will mostly point towards a narrow passage and ask you to keep going that way to reach. And trust me figuring out your way through that is an amazing experience by itself. 😊
3,Leh_Royal_Palace,kiransfootprints,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Could have been an interesting tourist attraction,"The concept and layout of the palace are unique. However, most of it is under repairs and they seemed to be done rather poorly. There are no information boards or guides to help understand and appreciate this historical landmark."
4,Leh_Royal_Palace,Sarthak B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Royal palace,I didnt like it much as you just need to climb for 8 floors and its like nothing much is there so not worth it
5,Leh_Royal_Palace,Shuddho G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Highlight of Leh Town,You would be able to see Leh palace from almost everywhere in town as it is perched on a hilltop.This is the highlight of Leh city.A visit will give an insight into the abode of erstwhile royalty.
6,Leh_Royal_Palace,Kat T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Cute but come prepared,"This is the main attraction in the town of Leh itself. Getting up to the palace door requires going uphill by around a long detour. A road (and taxis) lead up to it until about 50 meters outside the gate, then the road ends and you have to walk across a bridge. Tickets (about 300 rupees per foreigner) are sold at a small window on the side of the footpath. Once inside, the property itself is partially restored (mostly the front-facing side, where the windows looking out to town are) but some areas are derelict. Mind your head as you go up & down the stairs. Best view is at the 7th and 8th floor, looking back out into town from top of this palace. No toilet on (or near) premises, except for a hole in the wall (about 3rd floor) -- no running water either. Call it an authentic experience. The pillars & wall ornamentation (restored), the old photo display (about 5th floor), the view into town are all truly stunning though -- particularly if you compare with Tibet and Sikkim, etc. There is a small ""monastery"" (really, it's a temple hall) on the 4th floor with magnificent statues."

9,Leh_Royal_Palace,VenkatBoinapally,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Good restoration by ASI,ASI has done a fairly decent job of restoring Leh Palace. More exhibits related to Ladakhi history would make this trip more useful.

4,Leh_Royal_Palace,Teebaron,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Expensive view over Leh,This was the expensivest entry we paid in Leh (300 Rupies/Person). What you get is a nice view but nothing else. The palace is totally empty! We have been disappointed. 
5,Leh_Royal_Palace,shash4333,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,For a panoramic view of Leh,"Walk your way through the old town of Leh to reach this quaint but beautiful palace, from where you are ought to get a mesmerizing view of the entire Leh town. You can easily distinguish between the old and new town areas and to further enhance your experience you can see the Stok Kangri at the horizon to the south. To the north you can easily spot the road towards Khardung La, to where you might want to take a motorcycle ride the next day. The palace in itself is also worth seeing for its construction peculiar to the region."

8,Leh_Royal_Palace,István Soós,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Couples,Do not enter,"Watch it from the city, make photos about this impressive and mysterious building but DO NOT ENTER. The fact that you have to pay 10 times more than the locals is painful, but the real shock comes afterwards: THERE IS NOTHING INSIDE. A terribly weak and useless exhibition without any useful information about the history of Ladakh or the royal family. Forget your memories about Versailles or Schönbrunn, this is an empty an abandoned place."

4,Leh_Royal_Palace,knoesenm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,Royal highlight in Leh,You can see the palace already as you drive from the airport. It doesn’t look very appealing from afar as it is brown and so are the rocks it was built on. Once you approach it though it all changes. It looks like something from a Game of Thrones scene. There are 8 levels and some steps are wooden and quite challenging to get up and down with. Getting to each level is worth it for the views of Leh. There is nothing in the Palace apart for some art of this era. Nothing remains of the ancient palace.

It is not a very well maintained place as it was abandoned by the royal family a while ago. It is now a museum with artifacts, ornaments, dresses, paintings, drawings. It had a mud, wood, brick construction. You can get a view of it from Leh Market. The upper floors used to be the royal residence while lower floors were used for storage and horses. As is is at a height you can get a good view of Leh city from the top. "

2,Leh_Royal_Palace,John_Doe1011,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Best view of the city,"Leh palace located a top a hill and thus gives the best view of the Leh city. The palace itself it lying in ruins, despite conservation work is going on.There are enough info boards in the palace to lets you know the significance but all in all, the view of the city is what you come here for. There is a steady flow of tourists at the palace but its not very crowded, so any time during the day would be good. Sunset would definitely make a good backdrop."
3,Leh_Royal_Palace,Aartichand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Great Views,The Shay Palace is currently under renovation. It is a steep climb to the top. But offers excellent views of Leh. One can stop on the way to or from Thiksey.

6,Leh_Royal_Palace,nisasu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Good view of the city but under renovation,Been there in Oct’18. The place was under renovation. The galleries were empty and the photos under display are nothing great.The palace entry fees is 25 INR for adults.Overall not very impressed. May be post renovation it will become a must visit.
7,Leh_Royal_Palace,mark10r,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Good way to experience Leh history.,A walk up the hill to the well restored OLD palace via steps on the edge of old Leh is agree at way to build your readiness for trekking but take your time and visit early in the morning to avoid the heat and take water. Only a section of the palace is open but make sure you visit the temple room inside with its classic masks.  If you are feeling energetic and keep going up further the temple further up is beautiful and gives you stunning views over the Indus Valley. Again slowly slowly but the effort is worth every step.

1,Leh_Royal_Palace,Boogiet17,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Ummm,The tickets are incredibly over priced - I'm not sure what they do with the money as there was very little to see inside! The view from outside of the palace (before paying) was almost more spectacular than inside - I wouldn't recommend if you are a little unsteady on your feet as there are many doorways to duck under and uneven steps/floors.
2,Leh_Royal_Palace,ravi0291,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Nothing special ,"After getting permit we ate something and decided to do trekking to leh palace and one other gompa which is on the top of mountain(not recommended first day such activity if you feel very tired or heavy breath).The Leh Palace, also known as 'Lhachen Palkhar'was built in the 17th century by King Sengge Namgyal as a royal palace, and the King and his family were the former residents of the majestic mansion. The Leh Palace is also one of the tallest buildings of its time with nine stories in all.Leh Palace has now been turned into ruins due to the Kashmiri invasion that took place in the 19th century.The leh palace entry ticket is 25 rs per person but nothing special to see there. The tracking took around 2 hours too and fro but from the top the view was awesome and cannot be explained in words. You can see entire leh from top, also you can see shanti stupa which is far from there."

4,Leh_Royal_Palace,Dalbir_S_Virdi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Also known as Shay Palace,It was a difficult climb to the top but it was worth visiting the place. We were not allowed in the residential areas but we could visit the prayer halls. It gives a great insight into the local culture and heritage.
