2,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,sidshirur,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Couples,Do not miss this great place,"The place to visit in Leh City without fail. Do not miss it if you love good drinks, great food and music. Service is a tad slow, but then you'll get used to this once in Leh. Don't hurry, you are not in a metro city. Take it easy and chill"
3,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,ghoomakkad,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Friends,Few options in food and drinks,"We wanted to hv good food and drinks. A lot has been written abt this place so we went there. To my surprise they on serve few options in food. They serve local whiskey and beer. We ordered mutton and veg momos both were average. For a place rated so high, I was disappointed with the quality and options in food. Place has good ambience and has both outdoor and indoor seating."
4,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,Utpala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022 • Family,"Cozy place, good food, music",We enjoyed our evenings spent here. The owner is friendly and makes nice cocktails. The barbecue food was delicious and the music enjoyable. They also have fire going so that is a plus on cold evenings.

6,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,Bindlish_A,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Couples,A place that looked promising,"Being the only bar in Leh, we entered the place with many expectations.Ambience- good ( has multi seating options)Drinks- ok ( some of the std ones)Food- patheticBecause the food experience was so bad ( stale hummus, pathetic garlic bread ( the third dip was missing) and use of canned paneer ( cottage cheese)), I will not recommend this place.Having experienced lovely food across Leh, this one was a major disappointment!"
7,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,Nishita M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Go there for the terrace experience!,"My favourite part of the Lehchen experience is chilling out on the open, shaded terrace which has a very cosy setup & enjoying a glass of beer."
8,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,Mary S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,"A Gem, truly wonderful!","We visited Lehchen Bar and Restaurant many times while staying in Leh. The food is wonderful and delicious,  catering for a global clientele. The music and atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. Staff are so friendly and helpful and very willing to accommodate everyone. It is a beautiful really special place with excellent food and great value for money.  I would definitely recommend that you go there while visiting Ladakh, you will be amazed. The owner is extremely knowledgeable about the area and will help with any queries you may have or assist organising trips for you.A true Gem, with great food and lovely kind staff."

0,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,Aiyaps,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Best restobar in Lehn & don't miss the Banoffee pie,"Amazing ambience, has a great mix of Korean, European & Indian restaurants. I even found a Keralite amongst the guests. Open fairly late, so you can go there for a couple of drinks even after trying local street food. Desterts are amazing. Owner is on site but i must admit a tad bit cocky with the success of the place"
1,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,Prerona D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Fantastic place!,"Absolutely amazing ambiance, food and great service. We went there three nights in a row and throughly enjoyed it!

4,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,deepakGurgaon_India,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,"Good atmosphere, but food lacking inspiration",I went their post dinner to get a couple of drinks with friends. Cozy place. decent music. For me it was more about who I was with than the place. Nothing exceptional. Comfortable and moderately priced.
5,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,hayanhimalaya,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Pathetic Service Ever,We went for dinner at the Lehchen restaurant and bar it was a nice cosy place but had parking issues the food especially the fish was excellent in addition we had grilled chicken with vegetables which were also quite good there was recorded music which was quite good however we had a singer in our midst who sang a few songs and enlivened the evening the management was kind enough to lend him a guitar

8,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,hayanhimalaya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,Absolutely amazing,"Had a great evening here, with good company. But the food was a disappointment. In fact is was both the most expensive and the worst meal we had. They try to be an 'upmarket alternative' to the traditional restaurants but the sheek kebab and tandoori malai, come on... you cannot serve that like this in this portions and with this (lack of) entourage. The waiters are good. "
9,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,InMobi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Great place ,"I visited this place recently during first week of September with my father,wife & brothers (5ppl). Entire fort road and few other places were displaying live music night A4 sized printouts.Hardly two waiters were serving the entire lot and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to serve the starters despite of the owner/manager being informed. Here starters looks like main course and main course is just like starter. The owner comes and asks how's the food and fails to apologise on third class service and raises his own voice.With a nominal amount of 2650/- bill we walked out with a horrible experience ever on Leh ladakh Tour.If this is the only last option to eat food pls ensure you place an order with a very short height guy (waiter) north eastern may be. He seems to be little helpful only.The ratings should go in negative. It's not a restaurant but only a Bar for limited drinks."

12,Lehchen_Bar_and_Restaurant,Lokeshg87,,,,"We visited this place for the Indian Classical Music night for which they had put up posters in the market. The place was easy to find and the atmosphere was good. The interiors were well done and the terrace seating was excellent. We ordered a steak, paneer tikka and mezze platter. The former two were excellent while the latter was okay as they had slightly altered the recipe. The presentation of the food was as good as it tasted and the music just made our appetites grow. Definitely recommend this to people looking for good food that is both tasty and clean. Meal for 2: Rs 750-900 without the drinksP.S. They do serve a variety of alcoholic beverages for those who are interested."
13,,,,,,I visited teis place sometime back on my trip to leh. This place perfectly captures the serenity of leh and the scenic beauty as well.A cultural mix of simplicity and subtlety. Was extremely impressed to find something like this in place where its even difficult to find a proper trail.Amazing place :)
14,,,,,,"This small hang out place located in the inner streets of fort road in leh is just perfect to just chill out after a whole day in leh. They serve all kinds of liquor, beer and cocktails. The food is delicious and the staff is super friendly. The Lehchen is a must visit while in Leh. A perfect place to unwind. Plus you can pick up some awesome kashmiri street food kababs round the corner to The Lehchen."
15,,,,,,"Only place which comes closer to a good hangout place (with liquor) in leh.....Good music, decent service and good crowd."
