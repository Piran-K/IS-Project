0,Library_Road_Vegetable_Market,Peregrineri,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 â€¢ Solo,I keep hoping . . .,"Unfortunately, many of the merchants are not friendly to visitors or anyone who isn't a regular customer. I keep hoping they will realize that this doesn't help them. Yesterday, I went to buy mangoes from a guy I don't usually buy from. His were the best looking mangoes in the market, but he refused to sell them to me with the ridiculous excuse that they were 'hard'. In the past he has refused to sell to me on similar specious excuses. Maybe he was saving them for his regulars, but then they shouldn't have been out on public display."
1,Library_Road_Vegetable_Market,Mastco78,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 â€¢ Friends,Magical place,"I think this is probably the center of the city. I would stay close to this road as it has many options in restaurants, cafes, and some shops. Definitely very touristy but you still flavor the local culture and at nights they have some activities. While I was there they had a traditional show with music and dance, they invited attendees to join the dance show, it was pretty unique. For photographers the market is a great opportunity to capture nice shots. The streets around it also have many surprises, fresh baked bread, the tibetan market, the Sikhism temple, etc"

5,Library_Road_Vegetable_Market,SerendipityIndia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 â€¢ Couples,Quite a spectable in the Leh market,"The vegetable market is basically a lot of vendors sitting by the curbside selling fresh vegetables and produce in the Leh market. Given that the vibe of the place is already quite nice, they just add a layer of freshness and local-ness to the place.The vegetables are quite fresh, some times even surprisingly bigger than what you would find in the plains."

7,Library_Road_Vegetable_Market,Kaushik G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 â€¢ Solo,Fresh fruits and veggies,"During our vacation in Leh, we had visited the main market area many times and had also come across this vegetable market on the pavement in Library Road. One can find many local vendors mostly females sitting on a line on the footpath and selling different types of fresh vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, carrot etc along with small apples & berries which are produced locally."

9,Library_Road_Vegetable_Market,Peregrineri,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Solo,not a good experience,"Although there are a few other fruit and vegetable stand around town, this is the place where several are clustered together. Personally, I try to buy as much as possible from the ladies in the main bazaar. The guys who have these stalls on Library Road are some of the most rude and unfriendly people I've met in Ladakhâ€”probably the only rude and unfriendly ones, come to think of it. The quality of produce is, of course, variable, but that's to be expected. They want people to buy larger quantities and not try to pick out the best. It used to be in one big shed farther up the road, but they tore that down and the stalls moved down nearer to the library."

5,Library_Road_Vegetable_Market,Indrani S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 â€¢ Family,Nice walk,This is a nice walking trail but nothing exclusive. Early mornings bets views!! But you feel the lack of oxygen during walking if you travel during Oct-Feb (Winters)
6,Library_Road_Vegetable_Market,Vikas Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 â€¢ Family,Leh vegetable market,Most of the fruits and vegetables on sale in the market come from Srinagar or from Jammu. Apricots are the only local produce on sale here. If you like you can try the Ladakhi bread ( Pao) sold at these stores. As for Kashmiri vegetables you can try the haq saag and the mongol.
7,Library_Road_Vegetable_Market,Prakash_Yadav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 â€¢ Family,Good Location to Know the Ladhaki Culture,This Market is a part of Main Leh market. Here You can find a lot of Winter/Trecking/Adventures Clothes & Equipments at cheaper rates. The items are good but some shop you can negotiate. I observe that here two rates are offers One for Local Person & another for Tourist. The Local rates are much cheaper.
