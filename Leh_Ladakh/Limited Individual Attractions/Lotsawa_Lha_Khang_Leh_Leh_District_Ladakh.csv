1,Lotsawa_Lha_Khang,restlessatdawn,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Interesting monastery,"Park your vehicle at the beginning of the short road down to the Monastery.  There are several shops selling trinkets and local items. The temples are very old, with ancient paintings. Be sure to walk down to the riverside after visiting the monastery and before getting back to your vehicle.  Visit the Alchi kitchen on the first floor (just at the beginning of the road leading down to the Monastery) for authentic local cuisine. "

3,Lotsawa_Lha_Khang,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Nice temple inside Alchi complex,We had visited this temple located inside the ancient Alchi monastery complex during our vacation in Leh. The temple is very small and looks uninteresting from the outside. The entrance door to this temple is low in height and we saw many banging their heads while entering. The temple has a very small courtyard and beautiful idol of Lord Buddha with beautiful paintings on the inner walls.

3,Lotsawa_Lha_Khang,Chetan Kanakia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,Path to self realization with solitude as your soul guide.,"For the Indian tourist many of those who expect a ""tourist"" destination which brims with Shopping or money spending activities beware..This is not a place for you ! Welcome are those who seek solitude, a  method to connect with the inner self and that with the aid and tool what the great Buddha left a treasure trove of knowledge a glimpse into the 600 year old miniature paintings on the wall and the narrow lane which can have no more than 2 bicycles across is the path to oneself. A generous monk if requested would take you around and explain to his best the purpose of the Alchi temple and the very fact that little has changed here makes you wonder that this is what it could be when the advancement of generations are kept away and true civilization blooms. A short walk to the south of the temple leads to the river side faced by a steep cliff that overlooks the monastery. Not many luxury offering hotels here so make the bookings well in advance. In fact it would be more than inviting to stay here a few days and begin to realise what lies within is much more than what lies beyond."

Being said that this is why these paintings are very valuable in the history of paintings in Ladakh.
