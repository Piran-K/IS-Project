Not a major thing to experience but all part of the adventure. There is a photospot and cafe nearby. "
1,Magnetic_Hill,Sachin Mahadeshwar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Magnetic Hill,"Just a drive through area with a illusion that looks like car is auto reversed. On the way to Sangam point, can stop for photos. Should have better arrangement for public toilets, especially for ladies."
2,Magnetic_Hill,M&M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Illusion,"Magnet Hill is a gravity hill .Actually the road is a downhill road. Objects and cars on the hill road may appear to roll uphill in defiance of gravity when they are, in fact, rolling downhill. The layout of the area and surrounding slopes create the optical illusion of a hill."
3,Magnetic_Hill,Hadi1004,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,"Tried on our tour car; in the end, dressed up in ladakhi traditional wear and took photos in and outdoor.","There is an outline of a box on the road where you can try out on your own vehicle, whereby the vehicle would move on its own without even pressing on the accelerator.There is an eatery there and also a shop which sells indian snacks and tidbits and ladakhi traditional costumes for phototaking. We rented a costume for 200 Indian rupees and actually could even change some parts of it i.e. head wear, necklace etc. Without additional charge. There is an interior decoration within the shop, and we can even do phototaking outside of the shop i.e. at the sandy area. "
4,Magnetic_Hill,Ravsh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Family,Ok Ok,"Just an average place en route Sangam from Leh. Dont think there is anything magnetic. Think its the barely discernible slope.

6,Magnetic_Hill,puchka,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Couples,Defying law of gravity.,The Magnetic Hill is a must stop over to witness how vehicles kept on neutral tend to roll uphill in defiance of gravity.  A great place to take photographs of this chumbak hill as popularly known.
7,Magnetic_Hill,Amit Singh S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,This is a natural marvel,"As the name suggest this hill really has Magnetic forces which pull the speeding vehicles towards it, which causes the vehicles to slow down automatically.

8,Magnetic_Hill,vikramkanodia,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,On the way to Sangam Point,"It seems to me fake!! We do not feel any magnetic power or zero or low gravity while driving in car.

1,Magnetic_Hill,Sachet Gupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021,"Good, but very crowded.","This spot is situated on Leh - Srinagar highway and is about half-an-hour drive from Leh.

3,Magnetic_Hill,Kushal Patel,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Visit on the way to Sindhu-Zanskar confluence.,"It was a great comedy when I arrived here. As soon as I got out of car, I saw road  going downwards and so but obviously, as per Sir Isaac Newton, car would start moving down. Haha. Was beating my chest, why this is a tourist attraction at all?But views are nice. Especially mountain standing like a wall with black-greyish color looks awesome."
4,Magnetic_Hill,Achonkar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021,Not worth visiting,I assume there must have been some sort of magnetic force earlier that caused the much talked about phenomenon but currently it isnt there. The car just rolled on like it would on a regular road. 
5,Magnetic_Hill,Shyam Prasad,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Friends,"Go there for the views, not the hype ","This spot is part of a circuit tour around Ladakh, and is great photo-op!

0,Magnetic_Hill,Nisha singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Magical ,Without gear your car is moving like someone is driving. When you inside the car and gear is in neutral that's time feeling so excited. 
1,Magnetic_Hill,setty2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Mystery of Nature,"After crossing Tiger hill, our Innova Car sppeed got reduced .

2,Magnetic_Hill,viveks3,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Must visit,"It’s in the outskirts of Leh. Your driver will definitely take you there and you will be seeing a surprising phenomenon first time in your life which you will capture in still and movie. The name is self explanatory, proven when your car will move uphill with the engine switched off. This will not happen to you though!"
3,Magnetic_Hill,JJMcG,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Stop if passing else...,This is over hyped and with a similar spot near were I grew up I was underwhelmed.  If you are short of time then you don’t stop as you won’t miss much.  My expectations were clearly not managed here and I wish I had read reviews instead of listening to others.
4,Magnetic_Hill,Meena,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Family,disappointed ,"We went there with very high expectations !As the name suggests, we were thinking that there would be something to wonder!

5,Magnetic_Hill,arvind1000,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Worth stopping for shortwhile if anyway in the vicinity but not a stand-alone attraction ,"Magnetic Hill is a ""Cyclops hill"" located near Leh in Ladakh, slightly beyond Pathak Sahib Gurudwara but before Nimu. The layout of the area and surrounding slopes create the appearance of a hill. The hill road is actually a downhill road. Objects and cars on the hill road may appear to roll uphill in defiance of gravity when they are, in fact, rolling downhill."
6,Magnetic_Hill,AnujaMangle,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Couples,Optical illusion experience,"Well this is one of the unusual sight I have ever noticed. The reason behind such a name is its property to take a static car up the hill. It is also said the aircraft travelling on top also increases its altitude when passing from this point. Initially we felt it is some kind of magic, however after talking to few locals we figured that it is due to its optical illusion which makes the car looks going upwards."
7,Magnetic_Hill,jatinlodaya,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,a visit in your maiden trip only,"having been to Leh thrice now, i did not feel too excited about this place. it has become too crowded due to extreme commercialisation planned."

9,Magnetic_Hill,somam,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Over rated ,This phenomenon  of driving  uphill is a myth. Didnt happen with our vehicle.  One will pass by this place on the way to Leh from Kargil. Its dusty and crowded. 
0,Magnetic_Hill,202hitenderg,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Family,Vacation,"This place is a scam, please avoid.The so-called magnetic hill is nothing but a slope downhill.The driver is asked to set his vehicle in neutral gear and the vehicle starts moving down the hill on its own.Which the vehicle would have done in any other slope that's downhill."
1,Magnetic_Hill,Vivekhanand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Casual Visit ,We visited this place to experience the magnetic pull. The road was newly laid due to which the box which was drawn on road was not visible but our driver showed us the pull.

3,Magnetic_Hill,Sam J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Yes!! It actually is magnetic,"Although the visible effect of the hill has mallowed down due to road construction which has changed the slope of the road, you can still see the movement of your standing vehicle.

8,Magnetic_Hill,kiransfootprints,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,More hype than reality,Our driver stopped the car at a point and switched off the engine. The road seemed to be climbing but the car effortlessly rolled upward over a short distance.Not sure if this is a rare phenomenon or an illusion.
9,Magnetic_Hill,sidds16781,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,There is nothing magnetic about it.,"Our local drivers told us that this road had been widened and repaired. So the mystical magnetic hill is not magnetic anymore. Actually it never was. It was just the landscape and surroundings which made it appear the vehicle to be moving uphill, when in fact it was never so"
0,Magnetic_Hill,Sarthak B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Magnetic Hill,"You do experiecne the pull for those few metres of land. Good place to visit to expericen the phenomenon. Otherwise there is option to do quad biking, however it was very hot and no one was interestede in the same"

5,Magnetic_Hill,Sudhakar J,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Non Scientific projection of a phenomenon,"Wrongly named as Magnetic Hill, the place is simply having a slope on the road which appears downwards but vehicles move upwords. This must be because of the levels on global scale are actually opposite than what appears."
6,Magnetic_Hill,Amit G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,"stop by if going further into sham valley, not worth a trip by itself","this is just a spot on the highway to zanskar/indus confluence. the view perspective from one side makes it look like car rolls up a slight gradient. but cross the road over to the other side, and you'll see that it's actually rolling downhill. not a major attraction - but can stop by if passing. avoid the quad bike ride though. its exorbitantly priced at 1200 bucks for one loop of their circuit, which I timed my kids at 2 mins 20 seconds. there is no price brochure, and no receipt. avoid. "

Lo...the car started moving uphill(a slight upward slope of the road) and I was taken aback. Don't know whether there is any magnetic pull of the hills around or it was an optical illusion, but the experience was memorable. The local tour operators of Leh includes this place in Sham valley tour."
6,Magnetic_Hill,Teebaron,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Not necessary,"Don`t book as a Special. If you go to Nubra Valley you will cross anyway. The Hill is not magnetic, only the road goes down."
7,Magnetic_Hill,Traveller Mehedi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,Amazing and mysterious place indeed !,Magnetic Hill is a mysterious place at Leh-Srinagar Highway. There is a mark on the road where the vehicle run towards uphill without engine power. There are some theories behind this mystery. Some explained hills around this area have magnetic interference that's why vehicles run automatically. Another theory is about the optical illusion that means actually vehicles run towards downhill but we see uphill. Isn't it amazing? But local people believe that once there was a gateway to haven. It was a great experience. It is a popular tourist spot in Ladakh. Now ATV ride is available here and there is a cafe for tourist.

1,Magnetic_Hill,ArindamC_Kolkata,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Short visit on the way to Sham valley tour,Magnetic Hill is on LEh Srinagar Highway and is very close to Leh. The place is more of a tourist attraction due to the apparent defiance of gravity demonstrated by car drivers. The car moved against the force of gravity for very small duration / distance. 
2,Magnetic_Hill,Anuradha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Illusion ,Visited over hyped site named ‘Magnetic Hill’ there is no rocket science behind the movement of vehicles defying gravity ! I think it’s illusion. It goes actually downhill that’s why vehicles move ! 
3,Magnetic_Hill,mnrkrishnan,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Nothing to wonder,"If we leave our vehicle on any road with Neutral gear and without any Hand brea), it is natural that the vehicle would move  if the road is sloppy,i.e., from high elevation towards low elevation.  I didn't find any wonder or magnet working.  It is simply to attract the people, some one has erected a board stating Magnet (Zero gravity etc), This is nothing but foolish."

8,Magnetic_Hill,Aanyaigoo,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Waste of time,Fortunately we did not halt for more than 5 minutes here. The explanation for the magnetic effect is an obvious illusion. Even our driver was not convinced about its authenticity and wryly told us about his views.

Sindhu river flows to the east of Magnetic Hill and makes the surrounding a picture perfect frame."
8,Magnetic_Hill,Moeinuk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,Earth's Natural Wonder.,"Some idiot last year, drove up his Mahindra Thar, along with his girl friend on the magnetic hill up to an incline of 45 degrees. Unfortunately, his show-off failed as the car turned turtle and rolled down 50-60 feet. They were rushed to Jammu on a military chooper, but died before reaching the hospital. Eversince they have stopped allowing cars and bikes to drive on the magnetic hill. They have began a RTV service in the spot so you can have some off-roading fun. "
