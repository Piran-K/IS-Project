0,Markha_Valley,Franka v,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 • Solo,"Great, but especially because of the Ladakhi Women’s Travel Company!","Great experience, really recommend the Ladakhi Women’s Travel Company I booked the trekking with! They made sure I had an authentic experience (staying in the homestays and translating instead of camping) even though the Valley is getting more crowded these days and also helped me doing other treks besides Markha Valley (that I even recommend more!)."
1,Markha_Valley,Julian R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Tips for independent trekkers,"Without doubt, this is a premium trekking place and the best region to walk during the northern summer months. I did this trek on my own and I want to share some of my experience, adding a little more info to what it is already said here. So let's start by parts:TransportThere is a big taxi lobby imposing prices and avoiding competence. So strong is their rule that the capital Leh is full of adverts asking for partners to share costs to see the nearby attractions (it is crazy because a fleet of tourist buses will solve all this mess and I bet a lot of people will leave Ladakh missing key places because of this problem). Anyway, at the beginning of the trek in Zingchen and at the end in Chokdo there will be taxis waiting for trekkers. In general local people resort to hitchhiking, because public buses are scarce and not reliable, so in case of needing transport just hitchhike and always reasonably pay the driver. In the case you encounter some taxi driver demanding explanations, always tell them that the driver of the car is your friend and this is not a transport service.GuidesFor an experienced trekker is not really necessary, the paths are clear and you can get nice detailed maps from Android apps like Maps.me and Osmond. I used both on my Mobil phone and do not have many problems. All the paths have the same patron: they follow riverbed; and in the extreme situation of losing your bearings, remember that all the rivers flow to the Zanskar river and Indus river and those rivers had roads and plenty of villages. Also, you can look for piles of rocks and signs of human activity to find your destination. The only problem I had was to find the best place to cross the rivers, so expect to wet your feet especially in the spring season and rainy days.Local People and safetyReally nice people, always asking where are you going and telling you the correct path. When arriving at a village just tell the folks ""Homestay"" and they will find you a room (remember they have a rotation system so everybody gets a fair share of the tourist business, so you are not able to choose accommodation). There are no beggars and everybody is busy working in the fields or building houses and stone walls (summer is the only chance they have to use concrete because the summer weather do not freeze the water, on the other hand the increasing rainfall is pushing people to changing from mud houses to concrete ones). There is a heavy presence of the Indian army along the Indus valley, but they will not interact with tourist unless you enter or take pictures of their facilities.HomestaysMostly all the local Homestays are managed by women, meanwhile men are away in the cities to earn money, these women are very busy because also take care of children, old people and livestock so keep your demands in balance with the situation. Do not expect luxuries: there are squatter compost toilets in small stalls away from the main house. And there is no running water nor bathroom so ask for water for washing (do not expect hot water nor privacy to wash). The kitchen is an important place, always wait to be invited to enter and do not sit in the Ladakhi tables as it is considered quite umpolite. Using Homestays instead of camping reduce the environmental impact on the ecosystem and help the local to improve the economy. Also is a key factor to preserve this national park because peasants will depend less on their livestock and this change will give more space to the snow leopards preys. So avoid the luxury tour agencies who bring less income to the villages.Altitude adaptationA lot of people come to Ladakh as a side trip from the lower regions of India, but this is an error because they are ill prepared and the urge to see as much as possible in a few days ruin the trip because of the high altitude. Usually they start the trek in Chilling to avoid the Gandala pass, but as soon as they reach the 4100m the altitude sickness appears and the trek is really uncomfortable, especially in the Hankar, Nimaling and Chokdo stretch. I recommend spending at least two weeks in Ladakh to enjoy thoroughly this trek; spend a few days in Alchi-Uleytokpo area (the lowest terrain in Ladakh at 3000m), making day treks to the surrounding mountains. For example the first day I did the trek Sumdo-Charatse La (3700m), Yangtang, Rizon Gorge, Uleytokpo and the next day the trek Mangyu-Mangyu La (4137m)-Hipti-Leh highway.. You can return to your accommodation by hitchhiking and rest comfortably a low altitude. Afterwards you can go to Leh (3500m) and spend a couple of days doing some sightseeing to the nearby attractions. Then you can start the Markah trek with some guarantee of almost no suffering altitude sickness. When climbing high passes above 4500m, those people non allergic to ibuprofen can take one 600mg pill several hours before the climbing, to help the body to adjust to altitude and prevent mountain sickness.DogsThere are dogs everywhere in Ladakh mainly in urban áreas, but beware of the dogs because a lot of them are feral, so do not pet them. On summer days they live from the food dumped from tourist establishments, but during the harsh months of winter they turn on wildlife and attacks on humans are not uncommon. Because killing as a method controlling the dog population is not accepted by the locals, a sterilization campaign has been stablished but their effects are yet to be seen.WeatherLadakh and more specifically the Markha trek, let you to walk on high altitudes without snow and not needing technical climbing knowledge. The temperatures are surprisingly warm when the sun is shining, only above the 4.100m when the wind is blowing the body fells the chill cold wind so a light windbreaker and water resistant jacket is needed. Above 4.800m under these same conditions the body loses heat quicklyso is necessary to cover all the exposed parts of the body; so lightweight gloves, balaclava and neck warmer are needed. and if the weather turns cloudy you will need a light fleece jacket. Just to get an idea, in mid August 2019 above 4800m (Nimaling Camp area) the temperature dropped below zero during the nights and snowed for several days.Crossing rivers.One of the main complaints of the Markha Valley trekkers is the river crossing, usually the path follows the streams, so sometimes the bridges are washed away by flash floodings and unexpected streams can appear after a rainy day. So remember to cross always trough the widest place of the river and always downwards the river flow. Water trekking shoes can be useful but there are so many crossings that they are not worth it. So a lightweight hiking shoe with extra grip sole and quick drying are the best choice for trekking this area (if you want to climb a 6000m summit you will need boots). If you must cross rivers and get your feet wet, at the end of the day trek you can ask the Homestay owner to dry your shoes in the kitchen room. Also, you can use adhesive body warmer when the trek is over to regain some warmth for your feet.NimalingNimaling is worthy staying another day, mostly all the trekkers spent one night and continue the trek to Chokdo because the altitude sickness makes the stay unpleasant and want to finish trek as soon as possible. If you are used to the altitude I suggest to spend at least one more day to do some day treks on the area. I recommend two hiking summits if the snow line has receded enough: the Konga Ri (5754 m) and the Reponi Mallai Ri (6116 m). The Konga Ri is a hilly summit at the end of the Markha valley just follow the river, pass the Dzo Jongo Basecamp , then continue through moraine landscape and when you reach a lake, the south hillside is the Konga Ri. You can attempt to climb to the summit through the scree without using crampons. The views are fantastic and you will be immersed in a real Himalayan high peak landscape.The Reponi Mallai Ri route is posted on wikiloc. But if the snow it is too deep I recommend to trek at least till the Kang Yatse view point at 5.200m, to see a spectacular view of the of the Kang Yatse massif and its glaciers. Just go up the hill, follow the small stream that goes behind the Nimaling camp (about 2 hours), this route is also available in wikiloc.Other Ladakh Homestay TreksLadakh has 3 homestay treks: - The Markha trek: the most well-known trek- The Sham Trek: from Likir to Temisgam can be done in 3 days. I recommend to add one more day and end the trek in Skindiang. The highest point is 3800 so this is an ideal trek for altitude acclimatizing. This trek it may be less appealing, but it's really worthy because the villages are really nice and the accommodations are more comfortable.- The Lamayuru to Alchi trek: it is a 5 day trek between remote villages, old monasteries and dramatic landscapes.I will try to add the last 2 mentioned treks to Tripadvisor. Just with the aim of spreading the visitors flow and their money so all the local communities gets a fair share of the business and these remote villages improve their way of living.Managing garbageLadakh has a ban on plastic bags but not in water bottles or other plastic items sold everywhere. There is no proper waste management so carry back to your country, your own garbage (specially plastic packaging and batteries). When trekking make use of the Homestays bins to throw the rests of the day packet lunch and also use hiking water bottles because all the Homestays provide safe drinking water. One more thing, there are some trash open walled holes along the routes and they are a shame because the garbage is not picked up and it spread all over the place, also wildlife rummage these places so do not use them."
2,Markha_Valley,Daniel B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Great walk,We suggest to start from Zingchen rather than Chilling. It took us 8 days (with one day exploring at Nymaling). We were 7 (3 children) autonomous. No need to take a sleeping bag but take a silken bag. There are plenty of wild life to see.Mostly friendly homestay.
3,Markha_Valley,Kaalpurush Apu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Beautiful Markha Valley.,"One of the most beautiful, historical also challenging trek in Ladakh. It takes 6 to 7 days to complete the trek. The trail head is Skiu Village which is easily accessible by car from Leh."
4,Markha_Valley,wonderingcorse,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,homestay trek- general information 1,"I have just come back from trekking Spituk to Hemis and here are some general points:1. do you need a guide? shortly, no. the trail is clear, there are other trekkeres, groups and locals to follow and your best friend- horse manure- will never fail you. of course, a good guide will enrich the experience and will give you much better understanding but for the purpose of finding your way, you are fine by yourselves.2.equipment- go as light as possible. if you want a sleeping bag for emergencies, fine but you are unlikely to use it. good sandals are important, great sunglasses and hat as well as waterproofs.3.start and finish- the road goes now all the way to Zingchang so you can skip this part (from spituk) and avoid the night there. take a taxi and walk to Rumbak to spend the first night. on the other side, most trekkers take a taxi back to Leh from Chokdo. of course many variations are possible and most people begin the trek in skyu.4.villages with homestay: Zingchang, yurutse, ganda la base camp (tent), Shingo, Skyu, Sara, Chalak, thilispe, Markha,umlung,  Hankar, Tuchungtse (tent), Nimaling (tent), Chokdo, shang sumdo. some of these villages like shingo and chokdo work on the rotation system meaning even if there are 6 homestays in the village, just one is recieving guests at any given day.5. costs: the price is fixed all over the valley at 1200 rupees for a room,dinner, breakfast, packed lunch, lots of tea and free purified water. Nimaling is an exception at 1400."
5,Markha_Valley,Peter J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Great place for trekking,"The Markha valley is a dream for trekkers. Stunning landscapes and nice villages. We stayed in homestays, comfort was basic but we really enjoyed spending time with the families, all very friendly and welcoming."
6,Markha_Valley,Sightsee737349,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Remote and good for trekking ,Markha is a remote valley of Ladakh located near Leh . Its world famous for its trekking trails which offer wonderful views and beautiful villages on the way 
7,Markha_Valley,Aban Sheer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Very thrilling,It was an adventurous and thrilling experience of trekking along the 27 kilometres path down the steep slope of the hills and then across the Spituk Valley.
8,Markha_Valley,DanieleG,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,"Amazing trek, beautiful place","The Markha valley is a beautiful preserved valley in the heart of the Himalayan mountains. Trekking there is a treat. Amazing landscapes, beautiful villages where you can discover the village life. We were not lucky enough to spot the famous snow leopard, but we will never forget the week spent there. Highly recommended!"
9,Markha_Valley,Lovers_paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,The Tea House Trek In The Ladakh,"More famously known as the Teahouse Trek of the Ladakh, the Markha Valley Trek commences from Leh to Skiu via Chilling. From Leh to Chilling, easy transport is available whereafter u hit the ropeway due to a broken bridge. The trek route is very interesting and the landscape is very fascinating and unique. From Skiu to Markha, it is an easy trek with almost flat walks on most part of the trail. The views throughout are breathtaking with different and unique rock-scapes and structures of the mountains formed by wind and water erosion."
0,Markha_Valley,royjay2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,The Famous Markha Valley Trek,"The Markha Valley Trek is one of the most popular treks in the Ladakh. There are incredible sights and surreal rock formations, timeless villages, snowy mountains and delightful Buddhist gompas. The Markha Valley trek is by no means an easy one, there are two passes of 4900 m or higher to negotiate, coupled with a possibility of snowfall in the higher reaches, even when the passes are trekkable."
1,Markha_Valley,Fernenanda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,One of the most amazing treks on earth!,"Markha Valley Trek is one the most amazing trek routes on earth IMHO. Everyday the scenery changes so you'll never get bored, and the level of wilderness! Don't expect wi-fi let alone telephone signal here, even the locals still have to use satellite phone. It's better to go by camping than homestay, taking into account the distance from village to village versus campsite to campsite, it's better not to exhaust oneself with a too long distance in a day at that altitude. From Skiu village to Markha village is a 22km walk while from a campsite beyond Skiu village to the next one before Markha village is only 18km. As well as if one starts from Hankar village to Nymaling, it's a rather gruelling 11km walk from 4,000m to 4,800m altitude compare to a 6km walk if one comes from Tachungtse (which is still very tough, believe me).We went with Wild East Adventure and I couldn't recommend them to you enough. A very professional team (the guide, cook and horseman), the guide could speak very well English and took very good care of us. The food they prepared for us was always delicious and you could state your preferences in advance so they could prepare ingredients for you. Beware that meat would get rotten in couple of days though so you'll only be left with vegetables, not that it's different with homestay option. I'd say camping food is better than homestay food, if you like yummy stuff like me."
2,Markha_Valley,cecibono,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Perfect first Himalayan trek!,"If you’re looking for your first trek in the Himalayan mountains then Markha Valley is the one! It can easily be done without a guide but if it’s your first time trekking in the area I recommend hiring one in Leh, so that he can tell you more on the history of the country and help you out in case of need (there are some river crossings and you never know how you’ll react to altitude). Markha Valley trek is great not only for the amazing views but also because it can be done without carrying all the heavy camping stuff. You’ll sleep on homestays along the way that will provide food (dinner, breakfast and packed lunch) and warm blankets at night. The only thing I strongly recommend to bring is a sleeping bag for the last night at Nimaling camp as it’s really freezing up there and the blankets they give you are not enough to keep you warm!They usually suggest to do the trek in 5 days but we did it in 4 as the first stage they usually recommend (Chilling to Skyu) is really short (2 hours with an average pace). If you’re relatively fit I think is a good option to do it in 4 days as it follows:day 1: Chilling to Saraday 2: Sara to Hankarday 3: Hankar to Nimalingday 4: Nimaling to Shang Sondu (cab to Leh)"
3,Markha_Valley,Roxanne,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Unguided Markha Valley Trek - Chilling to Chogdo,"Just got back from the Markha Valley trek – it was really great. We were told the more common starting point of Zingchan wasn’t doable due to a recent mudslide because of heavy rain so we started from Chilling instead. You don’t need a guide or porters for this trek – it is quite easy to follow the valley and unlikely that you would take any wrong turns. Most of the groups go unguided but we did see a couple of very large groups (20-30 people) with processions of ponies carrying all of their tents and food –it made me happy we chose to do the trek on our own. Our route was Chilling – Skiu – Markha – Thachunstse – Nimaling – Chogdo, staying nights in Skiu/Markha/Thachunstse/Nimaling. Our day 1 was short, just a couple of hours of trekking and in hindsight we should have trekked further. Skiu to Markha is incredibly long and flat (20km+) and I recommend having a bigger first day and pushing on from Chilling to Sara or one of the few random homestays past Skiu. I also recommend that people stay the night camping (there are tents available) in Thachunstse instead of Hankar – we found a lot of people on the trek stopped in Hankar which is a couple of hours before Thachunstse and at a lower elevation. Pushing on until Thachunstse on day three helps you adjust to the higher elevation and breaks up the big climb into Nimaling. We didn’t have issues finding accommodation in any of the villages. When you get into a village there is generally someone around to greet you and then you are assigned a homestay based on the village rotation – unfortunately sometimes this means you end up walking a little ways outside of the village to your homestay. Prices for August 2018 were 1200 rupees per person/night in all places apart from Nimaling which was 1400 rupees. This includes dinner, breakfast the next morning and a little lunch pack for the following day. If you have any dietary restrictions I recommend bringing your own food as not much English is spoken and there were no meal options – breakfast was bread with condiments, lunch was usually bread with a boiled egg, boiled potato, chocolate bar and juice box and dinner was usually rice, dal and vegetables. My last but perhaps MOST IMPORTANT tip is to book a taxi from the end point Chogdo back to Leh before you finish your trek. We were told during the trek that there were taxis waiting at the end but there were none and also no phone reception in the village to call one – we had 7 people stuck waiting around for a couple of hours. We were told hiking to the next village to find a taxi would also be unlikely due to the time of day (around 4pm). There is phone reception on the high pass (Kongmaru La) so you can call and book one before you descend – from my understanding taxis have to wait 3hrs for you to arrive so this gives you a bit of a buffer. The trek itself was challenging but very beautiful – the biggest issue was the altitude and I’m glad we spent a few days in Leh first to adjust before trying the trek as it was still hard to breathe at times.If you decide to do it good luck, I'm sure you'll be fine, and don't let people in Leh bully you into a tour as it's not that difficult."
4,Markha_Valley,lizdiscovers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Amazing trek; it is like walking in a movie scenery!,"We just returned from our trip to Ladakh. As part of our 12 day stay we did a 8 day Markha Valley trek with Dreamland. The most amazing experience! The trek is varied and the scenery amazing. It’s like walking in the Hobbit, Lord of the rings and Narnia at the same time. Quaint little rivers, green valley’s and interesting rock formations. The trek is a 3 rating and although fairly easy provides interesting challenges such as crossing rapid streaming rivers, narrow climbing trails, and a serious trek to Kongmaru La (steep incline and decline from time to time) I would personally not want to do it without a guide, yet for the experienced hiker it may be possible. My review on our trekking agency will be posted with Dreamland (which we can certainly recommend).If you visit Ladakh, really would recommend a trek of at least a few days in Markha Valley to see the scenery and visit the villages. It is an amazing experience"
5,Markha_Valley,Akriti Mattu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Markha Valley Trek,"If you truly want to enjoy Markha Valley, plan a trip longer than a week to Leh and go trekking at Markha Valley. Its a lovely route and the trek is moderate. The guides are quite good at their work and the overall vibe is excellent."
6,Markha_Valley,Alan H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Amazing Scenery & Homestays,"Took a 6 day guided tour here to go over the Kongmaru La pass. The scenery in the valley is breathtaking. Absolutely stunning mountains, fields and villages unspoilt by mass tourism. It may be the most popular trek in Leh but you barely see anyone until the Nimaling camp before the pass. Until then it’s mostly Shepard’s and locals waving Jullay at you. Homestays are brilliant as well and the locals are so friendly.  Would recommend to anyone to do as a great cultural experience as well as a physical test (it is by no means an easy trek unless you are 100% acclimatised). "
7,Markha_Valley,abhi420,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017,Decent Place,Good place to visit however time consuming travel.View is pretty much same across ladakh so not much to offfer however if you have time inhand u can visit thr

0,Markha_Valley,Ankit C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,The Astounding Markha Valley Trek,"I recently went to this beautiful trek which is supposed to be one of the best in the region.  It was a 7 day group trek with friends booked via Bikat Adventures which I would be reviewing in a different post. I landed in Leh 1 day before starting to acclimatize with the altitude. The best thing about the place is its untouched gorgeousness. You get to see the dry arid mountains and surprisingly in the next instance you will find wide streams of pure water. The monasteries, comfortable homestays and Ladakhi cuisine are the other major attractions. However, this place is not connected via motorable roads and anybody who wishes to visit has to trek for atleast one day. I reached Markha valley on the 3rd day of my trek after walking through Ganda La Pass starting from Spituk. Several cafes run by the locals are on the way from both sides. The terrain is not difficult but it is suggested to wear high ankle hiking boots. Trust me, your ankles will thank you. Another thing to note is there is no network available anywhere however there is facility of satellite phones near Markha village. The nights could be shivering especially if you plan to stay in a camp which is the only option at Nimaling and proper thermals should be packed."
1,Markha_Valley,Agarwal M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Solo,Markha solo trek,Finished Markha trek completely solo without guide and porter. Enjoyed the local ladakhi dinner at homestays. Completely serene. Loved tent stay at Nimaling.
