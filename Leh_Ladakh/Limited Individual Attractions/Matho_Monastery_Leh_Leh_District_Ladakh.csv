5,Matho_Monastery,lipikaJain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Astounding view!,"Mathos Monastery is mostly off the tourist trail as its 26kms away from Leh. However its worth a visit as it commands an astounding view of the snowy Stok mountain set against  vast arid plains overlooking the Mathos village.We visited Mathos, on our way back from Hemis. The serenity of Mathos, was perfect for meditation without any distractions.  On our visit here, we met with the local women from the village, doing restoration work on the Thanka's. Apparently this is commonly done here to create employment amongst the villagers.Mathos is also famous for its dance festival held in Feb/march, where the Lamas do  daredevil stunts & also predict the future, which attracts people from far to consult them.The admission fee as in all other monastery is 30/- per head. The Monk patiently took us around the Gompa, including the tantric room on top, where me, being a women was asked to see from outside while my husband was allowed in. The museum is a must visit, while here."

8,Matho_Monastery,huys25,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,"Several well maintained temples, peacefull meditation place and interesting museum.","This smaller size monastery is less visited and therefore very peacefull, allowing the special visitor groups to meditate quietly in one of the large gompa's. We were allowed to make photo's in all temples, but not in the museum.The small museum (one room), however turned out to be very interesting with century old documents, statues, army and other artefacts of the first kings, and relics from long past times. The museum closes at lunchtime.In one of the temples we received a cup of buttertea."

4,Matho_Monastery,David P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,This one stands out,We spent 2 weeks in the Indus valley. This monastery was our favorite. The monks were charming and it had so much character. There are few tourists and it is really intimate. When you feel the barley under  your feet you will know what I mean. It is also really photogenic.The other reviews about its location and views are right on.
5,Matho_Monastery,David P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,very peaceful,"Matho village is very close from Leh, it will be at most half an hour drive, yet it has a totally different atmosphere, its a very quiet place with a great view from the other side of the valley,  the drive itself is beatiful (as anywhere in Ladakh), and the monastery, at least when I was there, wasn´t as crowded as many of the other monasteries in Ladakh... I was alone there, and also no tourists in the village, so you kind of get a different feeling over there. Its definitely worth it, if you like to visit monasteries and villages."
6,Matho_Monastery,lotusdiamond,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Superb View!!,Located away from leh on the other side of river Indus. Beautiful view from monastery. Plan to visit if you have time to visit else can be skipped.
7,Matho_Monastery,srirava,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Drive of discovery,This monastery is a bit off the tourist track.  The drive to Matho is well worth it for scenery and views. its interest is that it is the only Sakya order monastery in Ladahk. 
8,Matho_Monastery,srekant99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Only moastery of Sakya pa sect...,The village Matho is around 20Km from Leh. The monastery is the only Sakya pa sect in Ladakh..  The view of the village from the monastery is marvelous..  highly recommends to visit Matho Monastery.
9,Matho_Monastery,Kaneth25341,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,One of the monasteries with great view,"I really like how this monastery is located on the other side of Indus river that from there, I can see a panoramic of monasteries on Leh side such as Thiksey, Stakna, and Shey (palace) monasteries, and even Shanti Stupa in Leh! I wish I could take panoramic photos of what I saw, it was truly something to remember. This could be a short stop over between Stok palace or Stakna monastery, The monastery was closed when I was there but I think the view from there is still worth it and I would recommend anyone to go."

4,Matho_Monastery,itsindia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Good view from the monastery and a good museum.,"Most of the constructions in the monastery is new, but a breathtaking view of the landscape. Museum is definitely worth a visit with a fee. For males (unfortunately females not allowed), Gonkhang that is in the earliest surviving part of the monastery (next to the museum) is a must visit. Good early wall paintings inside Gonkhang. One has to ask a monk to see Gonkhang."
5,Matho_Monastery,SomnathSarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015,Tibetan traditions kept alive,"The Matho monastery was estd in the early 15th century. Destroyed by Muslims in the late 16th century (during the reign of Akbar), it was later rebuilt. The prayers and rituals of this monastery are in direct continuation of Tibetan practices, as the earlier monks of this gompa were trained in Sakya and Ngor in Tibet. The monastery is famous for its annual festival held in Feb/Mar every year, during which two monks enter a trance and become oracles.The monastery has a European style toilet at the parking lot. The steps adjacent to the Matho Gompa School are to be taken to enter the main complex. There are vibrant flowers inside the main complex. Bright yellow and orange flowers dominated the display. One temple of the monastery has a gorgeous statue of the Maitreya Buddha - the most gorgeous and glamorous in Ladakh in my opinion. There is a throne for the leader of the order. The frescoes here are bright and large, and can be photographed (no flash of course). The monks were very helpful and gave time to all the tourists, no matter in how many small groups they came, over and over again, and also patiently and gently answered all queries of the tourists. The museum has a rich and vast collection, and would require min 30 minutes to glance through. There is an entrance fee to the museum, but not to the gompa. The view of the snow capped mountains from the gompa is a treat."
6,Matho_Monastery,Sir_Gaurav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Solo,Matho Monastery,"Matho monastery is modeled on the Saskya monastery in Tibet. The monastery houses about 60 lamas and 30 novitiates.Accommodation options are limited in Matho as there are no hotels in Matho. :(Matho Monastery is popular for the celebration of festival called Matho Nagrang. It is also famous for its oracles. During festivals, the Cham dance and the act of oracles are breathtaking. The acts of oracles under the influence of supernatural powers, leaves everyone in awe and fear as the oracles often run barefoot on the parapets of the monastery roof."
7,Matho_Monastery,DrSudiptaGhosh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015,Fascinating!!,A bit isolated. Picturesque view from the top. Museum is well maintained and worth watching.Festival around March. oracles can be seen during festivals. Lots of folk stories regarding them are popular.

9,Matho_Monastery,Biplav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014,"Off beat, but worth a visit","The monastery on the other side of the river is worth a see.  When we visited in the August of 2012, the place was under renovation with the help of some international experts.One of the most colourful and vibrant exteriors, standing by the ramparts, you get a panoramic view of Leh and the Khardungla pass above, as well as the Thiksey, Stakna and Spituk gompas..."
0,Matho_Monastery,robin t,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Couples,Cool place,This place is very chilled and you will love it. Very clean and maintained place. you will also get a crystal clear water which is said to be very holy here. Do take that once you visit.
1,Matho_Monastery,Arshdeep S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Spiritual world,"This monastery is located 26kms to the southeast of Leh. Seated on the banks of the river Indus, this monastery belongs to the Sakya order. This monastery hosts the annual fest of Matho Nagrang. Over the years this monastery has seen a sharp increase in the number of Buddhists monks here. The uniqueness of this gompalies its 600 year old thangkas."
2,Matho_Monastery,HimalayaCycle,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Great setting,Wonderful monastery. Visited in winter for the Macho Nagrang festival to see the oracles. Went the day before the festival just to see the oracles -great experience and better than on the main day of the festival with less crowds. Do not take photos of the oracles. Some people try to and its annoying.
3,Matho_Monastery,Antje K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,An excellent look at Himalayan craftsmanship with a sweeping view over Leh,"Matho offers a spectacular view of Leh before the Khardung La backdrop. The monastery has undergone a lot of renovation and construction recently, and the new prayer hall offers extraordinary examples of craftsmanship from Nepal (metal work), Bhutan (Buddha statues), Sikkim (murals and interior painting), and Ladakh (woodcarving)—a must-see for anyone interested in Buddhist art. Matho also houses a rare and exquisite Thangkha collection—some date back to the 14th century.Find someone to tell you about the winter festival of the oracles—a truly mesmerizing story!"
4,Matho_Monastery,Soulrtip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Spiritual Sanctuary.,"To get to Matho monastery takes a pull of curiosity and a taste for adventure. The road here that cuts through the hillside is nearly empty and a pure bliss if you come on a motorbike. You will pass through a cozy Matho village where everyone seems happy to see you.Matho is a Sakya Buddhist lineage gompa dedicated to tantric practice. It has a very strong reputation for oracles and it gathers a huge crowd for the festival in February. It has a museum of tantric practice, which maybe an encouraging condition if you're a practitioner. It charges admission fee.The statue of the Buddha Maitreya in the prayer hall shows a unique and extremely elaborate refuge tree. Somehow you can feel a meditating yogi presence in this special place."
5,Matho_Monastery,abhinavhere4,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 • Solo,Matho Monastry.....Leh,It takes 1100km from Delhi to reach Leh and then 22km to Matho Monastry by road.The road is pritty good with a slight glitches. If you are an adventure enthusiast and love a peaceful atmosphere then this is the place for you to visit on a motorbike between May-Sep . As the snow starts melting the road welcomes you to touch the paradise.An ideal destination for people who want to sit and relax under mother nature.An ancient/historic monastery which is under restoration but open for tourists.
