2,Monastery_Circuit,royjay2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,List of Beautiful Monasteries of the Ladakh and the Zanskar,"A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone as hermits.  A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may also serve as an oratory. A large number of beautiful monasteries are in the Ladakh, all of which are worth seeing when on a Ladakh trip. Hemis is the richest and the largest monastery in Leh. Some other very beautiful monasteries are at Thiksey, Spituk, Alchi, Lamayuru, Diskit, Likir, Stakna, Sankar, Mulbekh, Phyang, Matho etc. There are some very beautiful monasteries in the Zanskar as well like the Rangdum Gompa, Stongdey, Pibiting, Karsha, Shargole, Phuktal, Sani, Zongkhul, Stagrimo etc. All worth a visit when on a tour of the Ladakh and the Zanskar."

4,Monastery_Circuit,ZAGREUS Z,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,"""Monastery Meditation & Second Synod of Dort. -,Dordrecht in Leh""","Choglamsar is a village having large number of"" buddisht-Tibetians "" .Activities such as preaching, exhorting, prayer administering the sacraments, having a small monastery.,at the distance of about 10 kms are carried out. I took this circuit and visited on very good roads made for this ""Monastery Circuit"" rheough highway right going up to   Thicksay and Hemis Monasterys. But  very few travelers know that in Choglamsar the meditation center open is a place worth visiting(see my photos here).Also education centre and assembly hall made by tibetian community is a must visit while comming back from two grandest monuments visite. Even the vast area precinct in which these institution operate and meditation centered are made and functions are  alike ""He hath eaten me out of house and home; he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of ""- Shakespeare.his."
5,Monastery_Circuit,bhumika23,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Himalayan Gems - Monastery Circuit,"The raw natural beauty of Ladakh is coupled with its tenacious faith. The Buddhist Monasteries have been constructed in some unimaginable locations with the most stunning views. While one may say theres no point in seeing more than one they are all the same, a few of them are unmissable.Lamayuru has its moonscape like surroundings, Alchi its enchanting frescos, Hemis' beautiful location and lovely courtyard. Diskit or Likir have a larger than life size avatar of Maitreya Buddha along with beautiful paintings and frecos. These are the 4 favourites that I found had something unique and all of which had spectacular views from the top!I took my 73 yr old aunt who climbed to spots as much as she could. It is worth doing it slowly at your own pace. Worth it in the end."
6,Monastery_Circuit,BALASHOTELREVIEW,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Bala's tour to Monasteries,"Visited many Monasteries namely Lamayuru, Alchi, Likir, Deskit, Thiksey. Monasteries visit helped me to gain knowledge about Buddhism, culture of Ladakh people who are very simple, loving and friendly."
7,Monastery_Circuit,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Ladakh - The Land of monasteries,"During our trip to Ladakh, we had visited as many monasteries as possible during our stays in Leh and our trips to Alchi, Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake. It was an amazing experience visiting these abodes of Lord Buddha showcasing local religion and culture. Views from Spituk Gompa were just mesmerizing. Basgo monastery is old but situated amidst beautiful hilly landscape. Likir monastery is big and rich. Alchi complex showcases excavated historic temples. Samstanling Monastery and Diskit Monastery are must visit attractions when in beautiful Nubra Valley. Then there are many more monasteries on the road towards Pangong lake - prominent ones are Shey Monastery, Thikse Monastery and biggest of them all the magnificent Hemis Monastery."
8,Monastery_Circuit,SubishKS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016,Nice monastery,The monastery is located in the beauty of leh city with the easy access to reach. Very pleasant and calm.
9,Monastery_Circuit,huys25,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,In and around Leh are at least 10 monasteries,"To visit them all in three days would be rushed. The best is to spend some time in each monastery, see also the museum (e.g. Matho, Stok) and avoid the commercialized Hemis. From the taxi stand in leh you can book a taxi to see two or three monasteries in one day. The drivers have a tariff card, so you do not have to bargain. They wait patiently one or two hours for you to finalize your visit. The further away monasteries like Lamayuru or Rizong require a whole day."
0,Monastery_Circuit,Sharmistha M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Capture in the cameras...,"Most of the monesteries are in & around Leh only. It take good 2 days cover all popular one. Though concept wise they are same by locations, views & ambience are completely different. Lamayuru, Hemis & Thiksey are one of the major one. They are vibrant, quaint & lovely"
1,Monastery_Circuit,Arun R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,"Ancient , very quiet, colorful and ideal for meditation","Almost all the monasteries are similar looking and yet different in design when looked at closely. Nobody disturbs whether you are mediating, or just sitting idle.The site of priests or the students roaming around in dark mauve  Tibetan clothes is very soothing.Ideal for meditation."
2,Monastery_Circuit,Cojoncio,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,An over commercialized monastery,"On the way up to Hemis monastery we passed a Buddhidt monk driving down in a Fortuner (cost: 25 lakh).  All in all that seemed an apt introduction to this over-commercialized monastery which not only sells entry tickets at nearly double the price of any other monastery but also threatens you with a hefty fine for taking photographs (even non-flash photographs are not allowed).  Of course it is a picturesque place, but for me the atmosphere was vitiated by this subsumed feeling of aggressive commercialism which seems out of place in a Buddhist monastery.  Other monasteries that  we visited (Thiksey, Diskit) were much more pleasant and welcoming."
3,Monastery_Circuit,lotusdiamond,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Plan and visit!!!,Ladakh is full of old heritage spectacular monasteries stretching from Lamayuru in the West and Diskit in the north and Hemis in the South. If you are travelling from Srinagar and visiting leh -Pangong-Nubra you can cover all the famous monasteries. Almost all the monasteries are situated on the top of the hill. From all the monasteries you can enjoy the panoramic/spectacular views. All monasteries have own history and different architecture. Few monasteries are 600-700 years old and very well maintained. Few monasteries are very famous and even Bollywood movies like Dil sey were shoot. You get to see years old Buddhist culture and murals paintings and beautiful architecture. Some have their own significance. The Oldest is Alchi famous for its wooden architecture. Diskit monastery is famous for very tall and huge  Lord Chamba Statue. Thiksey is famous for Indoor 40 feet high Lord Buddha statue and 11 story architecture. Hemis is known  for its annual festival. Likir has tall statue of Future Buddha.

8,Monastery_Circuit,JambiP,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,easy to get overloaded,"I visited Stok, Matho, Stakna, Thiksey and shey on an afternoon. Stok was closed but looked beautiful with the stupas in the foreground. From the lot Thiksey is the most beautiful, although it is easy to get overloaded. If you are with a car, make sure, the driver takes you as close to the monasteries as possible, otherwise you have 5 serious climbs to make."
9,Monastery_Circuit,trvlgrrl_9,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Friends,"Many, many monasteries","There are so many monasteries in the Leh area it's easy to go into overload.  Thiksey and Hemis are very nice and all have great views of the surrounding areas.  The temples and artwork inside are mostly beautiful, but the restoration efforts of some leave a bit to be desired."
