If you walk from Leh Palace, it’s just a few minutes up the hill. It would be a good tracking from Leh Palace to this monastery.The monastery has two parts- the large two storey (8m) statue of the Maitreya Buddha with Avalokitesvara (right) and Manjusri (Left) and a smaller temple above.The view was totally worth. We felt very serene calm at the top, away from the hustle and bustle of Leh Town.  The scenery is stunning with the fluttering prayer flags."

This palace is much different then any other palace in India. Build out of rocks and mud. No marble, No gold, No silver. You will experience the simplicity of the Ladakhi people in the old days. This Palace tells the whole story, no one need to guess. If the king lived such a simple life, what about the rest. You can also see some of the prominent families below the king, there houses are also just below the kings Palace. "

0,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,TRUST006,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Tsemo Gompa Monastery,"I got the chance to visit Leh for my memorable destination "" Stok Kangri"". As you are aware that Leh is located at high altitude which lead Acute Mountain Sickness. Be careful about it and it may hit you as soon as you land to Leh Airport. Please keep one thing in mind that Leh Airport is Air Base also so please don't click any photo there and same time stop others to doing same. If you feel some vomiting sensation or dizziness then don't hesitate to tell your trip partner or local people and ask them to take you to hospital. It is very common for high altitude place where oxygen level is very low due bare land (no trees) or few plantation location. Let's talk about Namgyal Tsemo Gompa. Namgyal Tsemo Gompa is located near Leh Palace. You can spend easily there upto half an hour to tkae better pictures otherside of Leh City.  It has higher height as compared to Leh palace. There is a entry fee ( ~ INR 20/-) for visiting this place which is very less as compared to other places. You can take camera without any additional fee. You can club this visit with Leh Palace.Best time to visit this place is around sunset or sunrice time. so that you can take nice sunset/sunrice views pictures. Even after darkness you can capture good views of Leh city as it looks so beautiful after artificial lightnings within town."

Reaching the gompa requires a smart climb. Views all along the climb are fabulous as the Leh Market and the Leh valley all diminish into the background as you climb up to the monastery. 
2,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,dzejar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Worth seeing,"A small monastery high above Leh. Was there for a sunset and it was far better than watching sunset from Shanti Stupa. There is not much to see in the monastery, for the top part you have to pay some small fee, but there are really nice views of the Leh city and surroundings. Definitely worth climbing up the hill."
3,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,kamakshi2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,The sacred and the beautiful !,"This monastery near the market in the central place is an attraction most people visit during their visit to Leh .

4,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Christopher G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,Worth the hike to the top,"situated close to the palace, we took the small path slowly to reach the monastery.

0,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Bird's eye view of entire Leh town,"During my holidays in Ladakh, I had visited this monastery as part of my full day sightseeing itemary in Leh town. I had visited Leh Palace first and then visited this monastery which is located on a hill higher than the palace. I had gone by car though there is option to reach here on foot up the hill from Leh Palace but from the parking lot also one has to climb steps to reach the monastery. This place is not big but has a giant idol of Maitreya Buddha and beautiful paintings on the inner walls. I also climbed further up the hill to visit Namgyal palace which offers great view of entire Leh town surrounded by mountains."
1,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Solo,Small Gompa with amazing views,"We had visited this Gompa located close to the Leh Palace during our vacation in Leh. One can climb steps up the hill from Leh Palace to reach here but we drove by car. From the parking lot, one has to walk on a inclined path and then climb a steep flight of steps to reach the Gompa. We had to buy 30 rupees ticket for the Gompa. We saw a giant statue of Maitreya Buddha and beautiful paintings all over the walls inside the Gompa. One can also visit the Namgyal palace which is located further up the hill and requires a tiring climb but the birds eye view of the Leh town from the top is amazing."
2,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,918John,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,My symbol of Leh,"Perched on a hill dominating Leh, this Gompa for me is the iconic symbol of Leh. It is visible from all directions and makes a great impact. I never tire of looking at it and is so striking at all times of the day. It is easily accessible by taxi from the Main Market. It is possible to walk to it through the Old Town, but the approach is steep and slippery because of the loose stones. It is wise to take it slowly and use a walking stick. Alternatively, go by taxi and walk down the hill to Chubi, making your way back to the Main Market. In the Prayer room is a huge statue of the Buddha. Usually it is open during the morning but not necessarily each day. Before visiting Tsemo Gompa, I usually buy a string of Prayer Flags in the market and them with the many other strings of flags as an act of reverence for the site, remembrance of family and friends, and a wish for peace and love for the world. It is worth while sitting quietly for some moments enjoying the view and the silence. It is a magical place."
3,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Zwillingsseele,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,Spectacular view,"Directly above Leh you can find this wonderful monastery. If you walk from the Leh Palace, it is just a few minutes up the hill. Right now the monastery is under construction and you cannot see the inside. But the prayer flags and the mountains around are just breathtaking. Don’t forget to take some water with you, it is exhausting at this altitude."
4,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Jira-Jett,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,a nice view of Leh city,panoramic of the sunset at this Namgyal Tsemo was just stunning. I like the Cherenzig or Avalokitesavar and the Namgyalma inside the shrine at the upper hall of the Castle. It was very well kept.  the View from atop was just amazing and i  enjoyed it despite a steep climbs of some steps. Beware of the high ladders .
5,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Yuvika D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Solace in the city,"Next to the gompa there are prayer flags on top of a hill.

6,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Gaurav Choudhary,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017,Top View of Leh Palace,"Small Monastery from where you can have view of leh palace, too windy at the top carrying along with sounds of peace. Though very few pay visit, but for me this ha sits own charm. Try a visit. "

9,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,NicolasCoat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Couples,View of Leh,"This small gompa high above Leh offers one of the best view on the city. The best is to go up there on foot, but don't do that on the first day or you might feel the effect of the altitude."
0,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Peregrineri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016,Worth the hike up,"It’s a vigorous hike up and mainly what you get is a great view when you get up there. The monastery itself is not so special, or at least, it’s not particularly beautiful. But it’s worth the hike up. Viewed from, say, Shanti Stupa, it’s an iconic photo op, especially if the sun is just right."
1,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,zakBKK,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,Magnificent view for watching the sunset in Leh.,It's not a busy tourist spot but you will love it at sundown.  We were saying goodbye to Leh upthere on our night.

Apart from the fort which is right at the top.It's a bit of a slog which ever side you attempt the climb, but the views are great from the top"
6,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Gene R J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Stunning perched location high above Leh.,"We visited here as part of our hotel arranged tour around Leh.  After a short level walk from the parking lot, you begin a circular outside open stairway.  Unfortunately the red Buddhist Temple with its 2 story statue was closed.  We continued winding upward to its white Palace(also closed) with its fine views over the valley.  All very worthwhile. While not for us older folks, we noted some tourists were able to master the steep pathway from the Leh Palace below."
7,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,sarahhhh83,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,Go for the view,It's not the best Gompa/Monastery in Leh but it's worth visiting just for the incredible views of Leh town!
8,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,huys25,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,A good climb and great views over Leh town,"We took the well paved footpath from below to climb to the Tsemo gompa or monastry. There is also a roasway reachng at the rear of the gompa, below the castle. From here it is an easy walk down to the Leh palace.The momastry has two parts; the large two-storey (8 m) statue of the  Maitreya Boeddha with Avalokitesvara (right) and Manjusri (left), and the smaller temple above. In the first temple were were asked to pay Rs 30 per person. The third part is the castle above the monastry, but this is closed. In the small temple we could use our lamp and make pictures.A prayer session was ongoing and we spend some time here until it became too crowded. Especially the prayer session made it very special."

0,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Clayhaus,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Incredible Views Abound,"Someone wrote ""Don't bother...nothing to see!"" This is true... if your eyes are closed. Yes, it is located up a mountain ridge, but, this is Ladakh after all. Hiking from town is doable for those in good shape or just rent a taxi to take you up to the car park below the gompa. Prayer flags sprout from several places and make wonderful photographic subjects. The views out over Leh -- whether from the highest part of the gompa or not -- are very scenic. Go especially later in the afternoon."
1,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,surendra_chelawat,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Couples,A little away but worth visit,The monument is in the midst of mountain range. After car park you have to walk little. The shrines and the surroundings attract your attention.

The Gompa can be seen from different parts of the Leh city. Once the vehicle parks at the entry point, there is a uphill walk to reach the various strategic points of the Gompa. It is taxing at times especially if it is a hot summer day but once atop, you would enjoy the calmness as well as the nice idols in the Gompa."

You can reach it by private taxi via a blacktop road. Or, if you do not mind the climb, start to walk up a winding track which starts near the Namgyal Palace.It is one of the high points in and around Leh from where you can have an excellent view over the city, and towards Zanskar Mountain Range. Sometimes you will find other visitors, sometimes no one. Try to get there when the monk in charge fulfills his duties, so that you can visit the rooms, too."
7,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Sunny K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Friends,Go to the top for a nice panaromic view of Leh,Namgyal Tsemo Gompa can be reached from 2 paths. One is paved and cemented steps and other begins just before the entrance of Leh palance and its a raw winding track. I gone to the top from raw winding track and came down from other side. Once you reach the top buy a ticket and enter. Shanti Stupa is clearly visible from top. There is Climb the small wooden ladder which takes you to the absolute top of Tsemo Gompa and you'll experience a nice panoramic view of Leh. Worth going for an hour and relax.
8,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Jason,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Solo,Beautiful Namgyal Tsemo,Situated high above Leh Namgyal Monastery is well worth the trek.  You can walk to the monastery from Leh Palace up a winding track.  I took the route of walking up to the right of the Monastery to visit the prayer flags from where you get a fantastic view though the climb is not too easy. Also if you visit Shanti Stupa in the late afternoon and the weather conditions are good you will get a fantastic view of Namgyal Tsemo in the evening light.
9,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,interstellar1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Friends,Excellent panoramic view of entire leh city.,"This monastery is the highest point one can go in the leh city to have the bird eye's view of the city. One can reach here after a round about journey covering a small portion of khardung la pass road. We also saw trekkers climbing upto this height also from the city, but i personally won't advice anyone for this trek until you are thoroughly acclimatized in leh.I found this place more fascinating than shanti stupa in term of views it offers. We also spotted a high altitude bird ""black billed magpie"" on the hills of this monastery.This is by far the best place to have nice snaps in leh city and a perfect spot for sunset."

2,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Nick B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Solo,A ruin....,"Not a lot to do or take in once you've made the climb up here as the monastery/prayer room seemed closed at the time, but there are some great views to savour of snow-capped peaks and desert terrain.A lot of restoration work is being carried out as well, so it does look like a half-completed construction site unfortunately."
3,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Nick B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Solo,Serene,"Quite a climb up, but worth it once you're there as there are some great views of Leh town, Khardung-la, and the surrounding mountains. It is also quite peaceful and serene - giving you the opportunity to just sit, relax and ponder for a while without being disturbed.Watch out for the flora (wild heather) on the trek up as well - very beautiful."

4,Namgyal_Tsemo_Monastery,Singababe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015,Splendid View of Leh,"Built on a rock facing the back of Leh Palace,  Namgyal Tsemo Gompa was built in 1430.  The view from the top is a sight to behold.   This old but wonderful monastery offers a fantastic view of the surrounding mountains and Leh city.  The  main attraction here is the three-story high gold statue of Maitrieya Buddha.  This monastery can be reached by hiking up fron Leh Palace. We came by car instead and chose to hike down due to the high altitude.  One of my favorite sites in Ladakh. "

Situated a top a hillock, this place has the most stunning views. The climb within, is a bit tough. So people with knee problems, won't be able to explore this place. But even then, the view of Leh city from here is something to die for. Simply out of this world!"
