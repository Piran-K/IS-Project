2,Nomadic_Woolen_Mills,Katrin R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Real local pashmina products,You can trust this shop; their stuff is made locally and in top quality. You pay the adequate price and you can be sure it's not made in China as I had the impression at other shops. Nice shop owner too!
3,Nomadic_Woolen_Mills,Peregrineri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Solo,Excellent Ladakhi pashmina,"This is one of the very best places to buy Ladakhi pashmina (cashmere). Most of their stock is hand woven or hand knitted, and it is possible to make custom orders for sweaters, etc. I can highly recommend the pashmina hats, which are exceptionally warm and comfortable—and beautiful, too. They have beautiful shawls and scarves and gloves and a few other specialty items, including the cutest handmade animals for children. Quality is very good and everything is genuine, exactly what they say it is. You will never get cheated by these people.  There are no aggressive salespeople to deal with, just some wonderful, friendly Ladakhis. Even local people shop here. They source their pashmina directly from the nomads of the Changthang Plateau. Everything is made locally or in the villages. They have a beautiful shop on the first floor of the building on the corner just opposite the post office in the main market. Adjacent to the shop is a demo room where you can watch the hand weaving, spinning and knitting."
