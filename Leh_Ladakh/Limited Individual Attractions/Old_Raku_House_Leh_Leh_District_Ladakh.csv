7,Old_Raku_House,changchen09,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 â€¢ Friends,Mindfulness & workshops,"It's the best place to hangout during summer in Leh town, especially when there used to be various activities going on where we can learn about mindfulness, yoga, meditation, environment, ethics, moral, cultures; and also it's a great place where we meet people from all different parts of the world with different background and language. The organisation also shows awesome documentaries, short films, and presentations which are always edifying. For leisure also, it's awesome to sit there at the rooftop and enjoy playing/listening some good music! I've attended workshops and small events since two years. It's always on my top recommendation for myself, friends, and other visitors. Youths have the best opportunity to learn and work for a better future there! Must visit :)"
