0,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Anuradha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Hot spring in cold desert ! ,"We stayed at Hunder, but decided to pay a visit to Panamik. It’s a very secluded place with hardly any population. But the hot springs were worth the effort! Water was boiling hot, and seeing it coming from underground is very educative for children. Many people don’t visit this place, but if you appreciate Off beat places with less crowd you must visit. Lunch at small kitchen in the compound was simple but awesome. After eating a lot of maggi and momos, felt like having roti, that too Khmiri roti, was a treat in itself, for me, at least !! I had packed chatni with me and enjoyed eating this roti with chatni! No fancy food ! If you enjoy simple pleasures of life, do go, don’t expect anything great. Personally I loved it.  "
1,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Sayantani Chatterjee,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Waste of time & energy,"It was a long drive from Leh to Panamic to visit this Hot Spring only. Though the water is hot; but the maintenance was poor. Moreover, it doesn't give us a feel of natural thing, which we were expecting at an altitude of 11K feet. The water was coming through pipe into an artificially made tub, where people can take a bath. We were prepared with costumes; but we didn't, as the place looked like a normal public bath, without any natural aspect into it"
2,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Lovers_paradise,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Hot Sulphur Spring Near The Siachen Glacier,"Panamik is a village in the Nubra area of the Ladakh around 150 km from Leh and is located very close to the Siachen Glacier, the highest battle-field in the world. The village attracts travellers from allover the world who come to take a dip in the hot sulphur springs. The hot sulphur springs are located at an altitude of approx. 10500 ft above sea level."
3,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,royjay2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Hot Spring In A Cold Desert,Hot spring in a cold desert is itself a rare phenomenon. It is a must visit place when you are in the Nubra Valley. The Hot Sulphur Spring is located in Panamik village at a distance of about 50 km from Diskit.
4,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Aartichand,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Hot water but not very Clean,It is a long drive to visit specially for the Hot Springs. Yes the water is very hot but the maintenance is poor. It does not give you a clean feeling. Frankly I would avoid it.
5,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,GauravChand,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Not much of an attraction,After stating a night in Hunder we decided to spend a night in Sumur too.  We made a short trip to Panamic to see the area and the Hot Sulphur Springs.  It was an extremely hot afternoon and it took about an hour to reach Panamik.  It looked like a government managed place high up on a hill with a good view.  The bath was in another room below and was not something we felt like going to.  All in all not a place to visit.  Maybe one would feel a little different if it was cold outside.
6,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,nisasu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Nice view and hot water bath,After some one hour drive from Deksit we reached here. On the way we followed the Siachen river and Ladakh mountain range. The journey was a treat to the eyes.The place is small. After climbing some flight of stairs you will reach the spring. Its kind of a small crack from where hot water flows. There is a neat bathroom and fresh towels are provided for nominal fees.
7,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Vinodkumar G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Hot water spring,"After a long ride from leh, natural hot water bath gave very good relief to our body and mountains with white sand refreshed our mind.Good place to take rest when ur passing by panamic."
8,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Subodh,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Don't waste your time,"If you have seen any hot spring anywhere in the world, please avoid wasting your time at Pamamic. There is a trickle of water with a stink of sulphur. Nothing big or picturesque. "
9,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Sk_mahua,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,a very ok place,this place is bit far off from Nubra but the journey is the destination. so the journey to this place is fun. There are streams on the way and we had a chance to relive our childhood in those streams.
0,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Suhas B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Very good for pain relief,Good felicity is provided for taking a bath. separate rooms for men and women. Very much relaxing after a long ride. it will take away all the body pain. Dont stay more than 10 mins in the hot spring. the chemicals in the water is very power full and you will start feeling dizzy.
1,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Siddharthg86,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,yes it is really hot,many will think they are not real but yes they are real. But not that clean to bath. they are white in color not sure how deep. but they are prety hot.
2,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,ruchi_smile,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Couples,Hot Spring in Leh,Hot water spring I have seen at several places now and it is normal place as usual. Only thing that place is available to take hot water bath and you can enjoy.
3,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Lalitjulley,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,seems a small attraction as compared to othersin ladhak,this is a average type of place you cant take bath properly as they are ill developed unless you want to burn yourself...
4,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,shrutikshatriya17,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Couples,It was like siting in a jacuzzi,"When i heard about the visiting hot water spring, i thought that would be an open place but this was a closed room where hot water came into a small pool where you can sit. The water was definitely burning hot and we did climb up to see it flowing down.  So we could just comfortably put our feet in the water, drowning the body felt impossible to me. Someone in our group did that. There are proper bathrooms to change and the pool is separate for men and women."
5,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Sandeep G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,A hot water in ice cold season,The place is a unique to find in Leh. But don't visit specially as time is very important in Leh. The cleanliness is not maintained but yes good small canteen is OK.
6,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Gavin R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Horrible,"Don't waste your time going here, unless it is part of the journey to some other destination. Yes there are sulphur springs, however a majority of them are filled with local  labours bathing in it. If there are women travelling with you I wouldn't recommend going here."
7,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Gatik,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Ok Ok - if you haven't experienced any other Hot Sulphur Spring,"if you haven't experienced any other Hot Sulphur Spring, only then I would recommend going for this. you won't actually get to the actual hot spring - there is a constructed structure with separate bathing rooms for men and women, where there is a small pool (7ftx7ft or so) and you can just take a dip there....not very clean, bathrooms are in bad shape..."
8,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Avidtraveller68,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,Natural Wonders,Neat place and not very populated. Worth the drive and very relaxing to sit with your feet in the hot water. Nice khamir and tea severed that Women support group.Wonderful views of the village below.

0,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Streetbob79,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Not a must do,"In a region where travellers are generally pressed for time because of the large distances involved, i wouldn't recommend the Panamik hot water springs as a must do. We visited the place when we stayed over at Hunder but found it not worth the ride."
1,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Keshav S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Natural heat in a cold land.....,Not a very well known stop for tourists visiting the Nubra valley as it adds about 60 km to your drive but its a drive worth taking. Everyone would have read about natural hot springs but to actually see one is a different experience. It's indeed therapeutic and you could also bathe in the scalding water. Arrangements for taking a bath are available. It's also the place where we had the best momos we have ever had anywhere!
2,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Ritu A A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,The ultimate therapy!,I had a sore back from all the traveling but one bath at these hot springs and all my tiredness and aches were gone!
3,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,TravellingNerd666,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Business,For Bike Enthusiasts,"To be honest there is no requirement of wasting time and bathing in some Hot Water Spring. Better spend additional time at Hunder. HOWEVER, if you are with your Bike Gang then it is a wonderful drive right up to the Army Camp. On the way you'll fine some very beautiful Gonpas and villages. There is a very beautiful gate also. I remember the sun was setting while returning from there and the drive was simply majestic."
4,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,flower2975,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,If you want to experience hot springs...,Calm & quiet place & a hot spring is there. Arrangements are seperate for men & women and you can enjoy the hot spring in privacy and take showers too. Nice place..can be avoided if you have a packed itinerary...
5,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,NILANJAN35,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Panamik Hot spring on the way to Siachen,"The place is calm and quiet. A sulphur hot spring is there. Water is very hot.You can take shower there. Good bathroom arrangement  with big bathtub there. Ticket is Rs. 30/- par person to enter the shower room.You can take picture of Panamik village. It is around an hour journey from Sumoor village.We stayed at Sumoor village at Hotel Rimo.It was an excellent stay in apple garden.You can travel upto Siachen MilitaryBase camp if you have necessary parmit. Parmit you have to collect from Leh. The road is not very good as it was broken during fool and avalanche. But journey is enjoyable. It is other side of river Sayak.If you start from Sumur village in the morning 8:00 am ,you can visit Panamik and can return back to Leh directly at around 5:00 pm."
6,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Debanjan587,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016,May skip the place,"It is said to have medicine effect on body. You may skip the place. It is more than 80 km extra run in total and is waste of time. Along the journey, Shyok River gave some memorizing view."
7,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,hasan1210,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,"Go if you are nearby, do travel for this.",Average place to visit. Go if you have abundance of time. Don't travel for this especially. Hot water is too hot. The sulphur will leave smell and might take 4-5 days to go away.
8,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,werner867,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Panamik,"Once you have crossed the Khardung La pass with 5602 m, which allegedly is the highest motorable pass on earth, and you arrive tired in Hundar, you have the the alternative to drive back the next morning to Leh or to the Southern Lakes, or because of all the effort to stay one more day in the Nubra Valley. We decided to spend one more day in the Nubra Valley in order to see Samtanling and the Panamic hot springs. Please do not go there. There is absolutely nothing to see except some water steam and some pipes with warm water, and hou had to travel some 80 km one way from Hundar. A waste of time and Money."
9,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,anjsha0953,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,Nice,Hot water springs has the amount of hot water which you may not even get with geyser. It is said to have medicinal effect on body.
0,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Aurobindo M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Hot water,"This place was a little over hyped for us. Though it makes for some great shots and views, the hot water is more of a washroom and pipe rather than a natural hot spring."
1,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Anuj C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Really hot,go there and make some maggy or pasta overthere from the hot water spring best place although you find same one in tso moriri way 
2,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Tejaswini P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Very Hot ;-),"Amidst the clod and beautiful place, its surprising we get to witness the boiling water.The hot water springs of Panamik are enriched with a high amount of Sulphur. Bathrooms are available and the water pipes are connected straight from the springs. It was relaxing after taking bath here. Helps in relaxation from body pain particularly. There is a cafe which serves variety of teas, Maggie, Momos. Pretty descent but not a great place. Any traveler don't have to really feel saddened if you miss to visit this place."
3,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Nalini C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Very beautiful place and journey,"On our way to Nubra Valley, we first visited the Panamic Hot Sulphur springs. It is better to reach this place early, by noon so that you dont miss further attractions. The journey along the shyok river and Siachen river gave us mesmerising scenic visuals. There were many bird sightings against the backdrop of barren mountains. Leh berry grew in bunches and we could pluck some and eat them on the way. The hot springs was very well organised and private pool rooms created separate for men and women. Our women pool was small, neat and clean. The Men's pool was not that clean because some indian group of men who just came out when our men went in had peed all over the walls and it was stinking of urine. One man was bathing naked too causing embarrassment to others. The lady caretaker was kind enough to allow our men to join the women's pool as family because no one else was there. Sulphur springs are very good for curing skin problems and the Ladakhi people also cure joint pains in sulphur springs.We dipped ourselves in the hot pool for 20 minutes. Not only all our tiredness vanished but also we felt like stoned completely when we came out. I have been to many hot springs across different countries but the privacy and cleanliness offered here beat all else."
4,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Yogesh M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,It's amazing to see the spings,well  . . . these springs are not well maintained . . . the area is also not very clean . . . but experiencing boiling hot water in chilled surrounding is a nice experience.
5,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Mohan Karthik,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Nothing to see,Definitely do not waste your time driving almost an hour and a half towards Panamic to see the hot springs. They've routed the hot spring water into a bathroom where you can take bath. That's literally it.
6,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Shrutig16,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Nothing Great,"You can go there to take a shower, which is supposed to be good for bones and skin diseases. To see the actual sulphur springs is an uneven trek. Can be avoided if short on time"
7,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Sumashree G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Nothing much to see,"The hot water spring flows from the mountain and is collected in the tanks. The route to the palce is very good and scenic but nothing much to see in the place as such. There is a small cafe near the spring they serve typical ladakhi dishes . we got to try ladakhi butter tea made with yak milk , khambir which is local ladakhi bread and traditionally made momos. All the dishes were good and tasty. "

Its believed that sulphur water improves skin conditions and heal joint pains.If you want to see water coming out then you can find it on the way to Tsomoriri near tsokar lake. Took 2-3 hours from diskit to and fro for a trip to see hot water coming from a pipe.
2,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,fulcrumrider,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Hot Spring water in a Cold Desert,"The Panamik Hot water springs are a major tourist attraction in Nubra Valley. Having crossed the Khardung La pass, one can plan a visit to the Hot Springs first then go on to enjoy the double hump camel ride in Hunder later in the evening. Thereafter one can plan a stay near Hunder as there are a lot of good tent accommodation available. The Hot Springs bathrooms are managed by The Woman's Empowerment Cell in Panamik. They levy a nominal fee of Rs 30 per person for using the bathrooms for experiencing the Hot Water bath where the water is channelised from the natural spring into your bathroom. Washing of clothes and using any soap or detergent is strictly prohibited. "

4,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Deepali P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Average Place,It is a long drive to the springs and that drive is not worth it. The bathrooms are not at all properly maintained. There was very small stream of hot water. Do not waste your time.
5,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,ankit s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,"Carry a towel, take a bath here.","Every one talks about hot springs here. Yes great, they look like 2 open govt pipes (that's how they have planned them). The stream further up is better with a wider flow. you can see the sulphur and other elements deposited here. WAter is really warm. BUT, at this facility they have created a pond indoors from which you can draw water in a bucket and take an enclosed room bath (4 for men and women). Water is hot, so you can really take a good bath here. Carry a towel and moisturiser. "
6,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Begaraaj S M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,Revitalizing our Skin and Body !!!,"I went to this stupendous hot spring on 26th April 2016, hot spring in this cold desert itself is a rare phenomenon, taking bath in this hot spring is very good for our skin and body, I took bath and it was absolutely refreshing and all the tiredness vanished.Its a must visit place when we are in Nubra Valley, located in Panamik village, and about 50km from Diskit, another very important place not to be missed when we are in Panamik is Yarab Tso lake, we have to trek for 10-15 minutes to reach this sacred lake.Happy travelling...Enjoy !!!"
7,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Sudhir M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Refreshing bath,The water is hot and gushes out of the hill. It is directed towards the bathrooms by the local women's co operative. Towels for bathing are to be carried by the visitor. Few towels are available for use at a minimal charge. It was a new and different experience.
8,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,travel_ticker,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Average place,"Average place after a long drive. The place has an entry ticket but is not very well maintained. The bathrooms are not maintained with the taps and showers not functional. The sulphur springs are also not very awesome. However, the view is decent from the place. "
9,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,janaknmistry,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,First and the Only step in Siachen,I wasn't aware about this location initially but when we stayed in Nubra valley for the night it was one of the locals who gave a brief about this place which is not too much of a de-tour from Hunder to Leh but it is worth every second of when you travel and visit this springs. The route to this place is shyok river bridge which is the only bridge which connects Siachen army post to the world by road. A heavily guarded bridge which when crossed would take you to the other side and in to some of the less known villages which are so very different than the one on the route from Manali - leh or Leh to hunder. Sulphur Springs do not have a great flow but they are sure super relaxing. Worth the visit if time permits 
0,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,HelyDoshi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,Not worth the visit,"We travelled for more than 1 hour from our Nubra hotel to reach the Panamic Hot sulphur springs. They were really not worth the drive. There was a very small stream of hot water and that was it!!! there was a nice restaurant there with a lady serving all the famous Ladhakhi food like momos, thukpas, thick Ladakhi bread with goats curd. The food was what we enjoyed there more compared to the hot springs. :)"
1,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,VivekTheTraveler,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015,Hotsprings in Ladakh,"The hot springs are available at many places in Ladakh, Panamic hot spring is not that great and has a small pond and a couple of places from where hot water is coming out. Due to the Hot water the area has become creamish red. The Village of Panamic is near to Nubra valley.  "
2,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,DarshilJhaveri,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Hot Water Springs,"We did travel to the hot water springs in Nubra valley. They're en route to the Siachen Base camp.

3,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,ManeeshGoal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Couples,Can be skipped,"The drive beyond Sumur has nothing special to offer in terms of scenic views. Neither is the place anything to crow about. The water is hot, they have built bathrooms as well as a large Turkish-style bath tub here. Visit this place only if you have time to kill."
4,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,PrashantKamble,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Couples,Refreshing bath and nice view.,"We visited this place whilst our stay at Nubra valley.This is enroute to Siachin glacier.The water comes from some volcanic spring.It is boiling hot and contains lot of minerals and believed to have medicinal properties.There are enclosed bathrooms as well as common pool, separate area for males and females.We took bath here and it was quite refreshing.I didn't feel cold at all for the rest of the day even with close to zero temprature."
5,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,SDS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Boiling hot water in cold weather!,A nominal entry of Rs.30 is taken at the hot springs. You can touch the boiling hot water as you climb up to experience nature at its best.There are also separate sections for ladies and gents with bath tubs filled with the hot spring water where you can relax. Don't forget to take your own towel and change of clothes of course! :)There is a small cafe too. Try the peppermint tea and momos with the most amazing desi chutney - the chutney being the highlight! :)Overall a nice experience. :)
6,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,AlwaysPuranik,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015,Good Visit,"Though it is not considered as one of the attraction, but this fairy tale place attracts huge crowds as has many hot sulphur springs. We found it amazing and beautiful."
7,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,ragjoshi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014,"Over hyped, avoid",The place is an absolute let down. There were hardly any springs or water. Teh solitary bathroom was just a big dirty hall with a trickle flowing in. Disgusting to believe that men and women could have a bath here !The drive and veiws all around are good...worthy of Ladakh
8,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,frmsgp,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Average place,"I didn't liked the fact that they have commercialised the place for hot water instead of having it in natural form. The water was coming from a storage tank, so I thought it is being boiled somewhere. The fact was that they were storing the hot water in the tank & then sending it down through the pipe in the bathroom. I couldn't smell of Sulphur at all.The washroom available was dirty however for taking bath they had lots of rooms, separate for male & female"
9,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,RahulCMeka,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,Go....Relax....Rejuvenate....Don't dare to miss this!!,"This being my first visit to any hot springs....I was so excited and this place has amazed me.J&K Tourism has built a new structure during 2013-14 to divert this chemical rich water for a better use. Inside this structure, a separate mini pool / pond was built for men & women and continuous flow of fresh hot water was ensured. A nominal fee of about INR 30 will be charged to use this facility for about an hour. Changing rooms are available though no facility of bathing towels was made, you can store your valuable safely. A bath in this water helps in curing some major illness including joint pains etc which were more detailed / displayed at the entrance of this building.Only thing you have to do at this place is to Relax.We are four of us on a bike trip in Ladakh and was surprised to have this facility as were are highly exhausted because of our travel through extreme conditions of Himalayas. Our visit to Panamik has helped us feel fresh and were rejuvenated.No restaurant / hotel is available to serve you food. Staff at that place has offered us some snacks at nominal cost.You will be highly disappointed if you go by the words of your tour guide / travel agent, as he will never insist you to go inside this facility. All the guided tourists visited at that time of our visit, returned from that spot in less than 10 mins by just having a look at the origin the stream of Hot water. They have certainly missed a fortune!!"
0,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,VidPamsKris,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Couples,Not worth the effort,"Panamic hot spings is in the panamic valley and if you have seen hot springs before, this is not worth the effort. Even if you have not seen a hot spring, it is not worth the effort if you are on a typical 5 day tour of laddakh. First, it extends your travel time to an additional 4 hours (from Leh) and second, the place has nothing to offer other than a hot water spring. The so called medicinal bath is not worth the effort as the water can be too hot to handle and bath tubs aren't that clean. Instead you can spend the additional 4 hours enjoying the scenic Nubra & hunder Valley."
1,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,AddictedtoLife,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Friends,Please do not miss this!,"OK here it goes..The first view of the spring/ area around it was a major let down.. we wondered why did we even come here, since what we first saw was a building with a water tank!, while we were dreaming about a stream that was steaming ..  Inspired by one of us who plunged into the spring, all of us plunged & it was just too good. The place was not crowded so we really did have the SPA effect. Came out rejuvenated & refreshed.. On a small hike up the stretch behind the building, we did find the springs we had been dreaming about.. Came down, only to be served by fresh momos from the small restaurant aside .So, do not miss this place.."
2,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,sheril t,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Friends,Hot Springs,"The information provided to the tourist is limited about the Spring . We had to ask them to find out . There are three springs and each has different medical properties . One is good for Skin ,Another one for Joint pain and third for gastritis. You will have to ask them for location, no sign boards kept ."

The last bit of the road not being good at all. Your cab driver will ask you for about 2000 extra for this (we settled for 100) but this wasn't worth even Rs 500. Climb up a few slipper steps and you will see a small trail of hot water coming out of a small opening in the hill and disappearing about 150 cms down the line.If you want to take a bath you have to pay and bathe from  a tank where hot water is pre stored, Some overpriced momo is sold if you want to have a quick snack.This place is better avoided"
4,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Indie-Brindie,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Couples,As much charm as a Romanian orphanage,"Avoid this sad shabby affair. The 'baths' are housed in a concrete block with about as much charm as a Romanian orphanage. The male 'changing cubicles' were stuffed full of broken furniture, and the water in the baths was only ankle deep when we arrived. I took one look at it, decided that I stood a good chance of picking up a foot infection and left. Whilst I waited for my travel companions who gamely lay down in the inch deep water, I wandered round the back. Here there are open tanks and pipes. It would be so much better to adapt and create a bathing pool under the open sky. I suspect, however, that their preoccupation with segregated sex bathing is what has resulted in the orphanage style blocks that they currently have. We tagged the Panamik hot springs and Sumoor monastery onto our 2 day Nubra valley excursion for an extra £20 (split between 6). Don't bother! They are both a waste of time. Stick with Diskit monastery and the Hunder sand dune camel rides and buy a beer in Leh with what you save"
5,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Bharti S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Family,Do not waste your time,"After travelling almost  40 kms extra (It doesn't fall en route and  Around 17 kms before hunder/diskit a separate road will take you there) we reached a small 2 room building with 2-3 locals sitting outside and charging 30rs/person as entry fee. The moment we entered the building to visit the so called Natural hot water spring I had the sinister feeling that we were cheated. We entered a small room with a small bath tub like concrete structure. There was a pipe from which hot water was coming out , a small bucket was inside the tub and .........that was it. It was nothing but a bathroom with a small cemented tub. We were completely shocked and clueless. Travelling 40 kms one side which took us around 80 minutes to see such big joke was completely unexpected.We spent total 5 minutes and came out."

7,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Vikas Singh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Family,Panamik hot sulphur spring,"Panamik is the northern most part of India up-to which foreign travelers are permitted to travel in India. The hot water sulphur springs here is situated at an altitude of around 10,442 feet. These hot springs have high amount of sulphur in them and it is believed to have medicinal properties which can cure rheumatism and other ailments. There is lot of sulphur smell in the surrounding area. There is an entry fee of Rs 20/- for tourist into the hot bath complex. This complex has been done up really well with separate pools for men and women. There are also cubical which have showers and changing rooms. There are no restaurants in the village. Hence the restaurant at the complex is the best option to have hot momos and thupkas"

1,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Crescentra,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2013 • Couples,Total waste of time,Definitely not worth the hour long drive to Panamic. We had to pay 20rps per pax for the conservation of the place. We did not see much conservation efforts. All we saw was water gushing out of one small hole in the grounds. Visitors can take a bath. However the conditions and hygiene of the place are so poor that we cannot imagine doing so. Best to avoid.
2,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Curio Cottage,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013,Perfect,I went with my friends. We all just took a time and we dipped our legs in hot spring. I am telling u due to fracture in my ankle i always had a light pain while lifting my legs and same was with my friend. We kept our legs there and we found that when we came back i realized that i am free from my pain. And same was experienced with my friend. Smell in that area is bit unbearable.

4,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Ashish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Friends,Intriguing,"What makes the place worth visiting is its intriguing nature. The boiling hot water of the spring in a place as cold as Leh with a cold river flowing just adjacent it.However, the hygiene level at the place is very poor and it stinks!"
5,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Shibaji D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 • Family,Not worth the salt,"It was quite a let down after all that we had seen in Ladakh - Leh, Khardungla, Sumur and Hunder; it's a small spring with very little hygeine; strongly recommended to give it a miss; not worth the 35 kms each way of travel from Hunder"
6,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,guptamukul,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Friends,Hot springs,"For first time I saw hot water coming out of a hill. It was really nice experience. But, the time taken to come till here really averages out the experience."
7,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,Neha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2012 • Friends,Not so much a spring as a water-pipe...,"The drive through Nubra to Panamik is probably the best part of this excursion. The ""hot springs"" when you get here are rather a let-down. I was expecting an open geyser like spring where one could dip a hand or foot in the water. What we saw instead was a network of pipes which were bringing hot water from somewhere beyond....Still, the area around is pretty scenic."
8,Panamic_Hot_Sulphur_Springs,AnilAggarwal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2012 • Couples,NATURE'S MIRACLE,"Panamic Sulpher Hot Springs are approximately 150 km from Leh in Nubra valley facing Karakoram ranges. After crossing Panamic village, this spot comes to right side of road. When we visited in September 2012, the road for reaching this location was not metalled. There is a woman alliance group of Panamic which looks after this place. The hot springs are on the hill. It is a steep hill and there are no proper stairs there. Sulphur smell is all around. These sulphur springs have medicinal value only under proper guidance of local doctors. Don’t drink its water. They have made a concrete building for bathing purpose for both men and women separately. One can see stunning views of foothills of karakoram ranges from here. There is an entry ticket of INR 20 per person. Even though there are toilets downhill, they generally remain closed. There are small eating facilities around."
