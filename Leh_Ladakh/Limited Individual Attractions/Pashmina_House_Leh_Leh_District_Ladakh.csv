1,Pashmina_House,Cosmopolitan401666,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 â€¢ Friends,Pilgrimage to lndia,"I was travelling with a group of 12 from Canada to India. Our itinerary brought us also to Leh Ladakh. I left my country with the intention to buy a rug. One of the group members ended, after shopping around other carpet stores, at the Pashmina House and bought her piece there. I learned about it and checked it out myself. Majid is a very good sales person, with a lot of knowledge and insights. He is very friendly and funny too.Well, l ended up buying a bigger piece than what l planned. The formalities for shipping were done quickly and l got possession of my piece within one week after leaving lndia. I love my carpet and l can only recommend the Pashmina House and naturally ask for Majid to give you the insights and tips to find the right piece for you."
2,Pashmina_House,GRBAachen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 â€¢ Couples,any time again !!,"Best shop in Leh for Pashmina scarves and shawls. Nicely located, great variety in terms of colors, patterns, quality and prices. The shop is run by the owner family (father and son), as well as some very knowledgable staff. Ask for Majeed, he truly has great taste. Recommendation: enter the store WITHOUT tour guide (tour guides receive 10-20% comission on everything you buy) and be sure to negotiate at least 20% rebate on all marked prices."
