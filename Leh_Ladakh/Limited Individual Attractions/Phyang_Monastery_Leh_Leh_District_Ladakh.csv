4,Phyang_Monastery,royjay2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 â€¢ Couples,Monastery At The Top Of A Hill,"Phyang monastery is located 17 km west of Leh. The name Phyang was derived from Gang Ngonpo that means the blue mountain, which is situated behind the monastery. Since there aren't any restaurants in the area, it is advisable to carry your own food while travelling to the Phyang Monastery"

9,Phyang_Monastery,Jamie F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 â€¢ Couples,Interesting Festival,"We went the the Phyang monastery festival in July, it was very interesting. Somewhat mysterious as our grasp on Tibetan Buddhism was weak. "
0,Phyang_Monastery,Zwillingsseele,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 â€¢ Solo,Great surrounding ,"This gompa is not so familiar as the others around. When I was there, everything was closed so I just could walk around. It is a huge complex and offers a stunning view to the mountains. Anyway I enjoyed the view and the atmosphere there. "
1,Phyang_Monastery,Rc1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017,Good visit,This monastery looks beautiful from afar and from up close. Some parts of the temples were closed as we visited during their lunch/rest hour. But we walked around and got some nice views.
2,Phyang_Monastery,TapasyaKaulRajaram,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Friends,Beautiful! splendid indeed,This monastery is also beautiful! it has a distinct view. All the buddha statues inside are beautiful. Be prepared with putting on sunglasses when you travel to such places. The sun can be harsh.
3,Phyang_Monastery,infoaddict,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Couples,Peaceful and Serene,By Leh standards this gompa is nothing special and all of the temples were locked when we visited. But we were the only tourists there and happily spent an hour wandering around. It's definitely not on the standard tourist route and that appealed to us.The views down the valley in both directions are great
4,Phyang_Monastery,hungryvagabond,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Friends,Tranquil,"Peace comes easily to me t the Phyang Monastery. The roof and the new temple is where most people go, but the older temples offer something different to a lot of other monasteries in Ladakh. Go. Sit there. Soak in the warms wooden charms of the places. Smell the past, the present and the future. Find yourself, if necessary."
5,Phyang_Monastery,Swati_Desai,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Business,Slightly away from main town,This is a small monastery but with a big campus. I was here to shoot a commercial. It is nice to spend some time with the Lamas there and know about their journey and everyday life.
6,Phyang_Monastery,Keith M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 â€¢ Friends,A beautiful secluded monastery,"Phyang Gonpa is far enough from Leh to prevent being overrun with tourists, but near enough to easily fit into a day trip or loop.  The monks are receptive to guests and the view is unparalleled in the area around Leh, Ladakh."
7,Phyang_Monastery,abhishek mitra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 â€¢ Business,New,"Most part of this monastery is newly built and hence has that feeling of ""newness"". Being not very popular as Shey, Thiksey or Hemis it is still a quiet place with very less or no crowd."
8,Phyang_Monastery,lotusdiamond,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Family,"Awesome view, beautiful place.",Located at a distance of 25 km from leh. Take help of local monk to guide you. Monastery has old and new architecture. Nice views perfect for meditation and peaceful environment.
9,Phyang_Monastery,Begaraaj S M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Solo,Peaceful Phyang !!!,"I went to this pleasantly peaceful monastery on 24th April 2016, it's located about 20km from Leh, it's a must visit place when we are in Leh, I took some lovely photos to cherish, we will be very peaceful and feeling relaxed when we sit in silence after doing all the formalities.Happy travelling ...Enjoy !!!"
0,Phyang_Monastery,hungryvagabond,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 â€¢ Friends,Beautiful. Serene.,"Phyang Monastery overlooks the Zanskar Range of the Himalayas. While the new building is imposing and overlooks the valley, the red temple building has two sides to it. The newer, larger prayer room is a place i can sit in for hours and just concentrate on my breath. There is little noise - only the occasional monk chanting and the children running around outside.The old temple, with its door on the other side of the structure, is even more inviting. A young, friendly monk requested us to follow him and showed us a beautiful, old-style prayer room that seemed perfect for meditating even when outside temperatures may drop below freezing.Phyang is a gem, as are its people."
1,Phyang_Monastery,Kelly K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 â€¢ Solo,"Lovely place, warm and kind monks!",The monks at the monastery gave me a tour and welcomed me to share lunch with them. The new temple is painted with the life story of the Buddha and is beautifully done.
2,Phyang_Monastery,ShubH GhosH,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 â€¢ Business,A modern monastery,"This is not your typical heritage monastery as it's quite a modern place. Its lots of glass and chrome building built next to the old Gompa quaintly ensconced in the lap of mountains on way to Nanak Hill.As you take the turn and drive towards the Village the grand structure of the Monastery looms out, The beauty of the structure the paintings inside and the beautiful image of Buddha is mesmerising like all other Gompas"
3,Phyang_Monastery,Lynnchoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015,Interesting place,I am not an ardent fan of monastery but this is interesting and a wide place to cover. Lots to see and experience what's in a monastery.

0,Phyang_Monastery,Sarita2508,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 â€¢ Couples,Good,"We went here along with family friends. Old historical monument, a must visit Keep enough time in hand."

2,Phyang_Monastery,KaiT1972,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 â€¢ Friends,out of the way but loveable,it's a real gem. we spent a really nice day there far away from the touristic traffic you'll find in Thikse or Hemis monasterys. the monks showed us all enclosed rooms of protectived acpects like Mahakala. we got invited to have lunch with them and could even be part of a puja. Highly recommend!
3,Phyang_Monastery,robin t,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 â€¢ Couples,Located near the city area,Nice view of the lake and nice view of the main city from here as it is located at a good height in the main market. This place is really a nice place to visit. Picture taking is really ideal here as it is white and red colour which makes this place a nice one.
4,Phyang_Monastery,Antje K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 â€¢ Friends,Especially great during the summer mask dance festival,"Even though Hemis is most famous for its annual mask dance festival in the summer, Phyang is actually a much better choice for viewing monastic dances. It's a short distance from Leh off the Kargil road, it's been beautifully restored in the last few years, and the dances happen in an intimate courtyard setting, with mostly local visitors. Squeeze your way through the small entry gate and find a place to sit in the shade. If you are lucky, you may even find a chair in one of the upper-level galleries. Most tourists try to arrive in the morning, but if you go in the afternoon, there will be less of a crowd, and the dances are just as spectacular. The costumes are made of rich colorful brocades and the masks are very expressive. Even the clowns look fantastic while doing their local dances and playing jokes on kids."
5,Phyang_Monastery,KGB777,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 â€¢ Solo,Another attractive monastery,This one is just a few kilometres off NH1 and can actually be seen from the highway. Well maintained and freshly painted the exterior looks very pretty. After a day of looking at monasteries it can be a bit of an overload. Still up there as one of the better monasteries.
6,Phyang_Monastery,Julie D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 â€¢ Couples,Fantastic festival!,"One of the highlights of our trip to the Himalayas.We spent 2 days here,experiencing a Buddhist festival day.Absolutely amazing day!Great food,friendly monks and outstanding views from the monastery.WOW!"
7,Phyang_Monastery,rexie,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2013 â€¢ Couples,Peaceful and with beautiful views,"The silence in the main shrine was quite extraordinary.  There are also some interesting paintings and the views from the roof are beautiful: in front down the valley, and across the Indus to the Zanskar Range and the peak of Stok Kangri; behind to the peaceful barley fields."
8,Phyang_Monastery,Resident_N0n_Indian,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2012 â€¢ Friends,"Nice, but similar to others","Phyang monastery is very similar to other monasteries in Ladakh, but it is very picturesquely perched on a hilltop, and is close to Leh if you can hire a taxi, so it is good to visit. Although at least 100 monks belong to the institution, almost all of them are posted away at Dehra Dun, so there are usually only two caretakers keeping the keys and opening rooms for tourists, which gives it a lonely abandoned feel. There are several rooms to see and all are different and beautiful, except the dark one that is different and spooky. The view from the gonpa, of the village spread out is gorgeous.The monastery festival in July is packed with tourists. I didn't like it but I can see why some would enjoy the spectacle of it."
9,Phyang_Monastery,gayatriPune,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2012 â€¢ Friends,Visit,"The lama staying there was very helpful.He took us to all the attrctions & gave information.It was the 1st Monastery we visited in Leh,hence was novel but then you visit so many & the novelty is lost"
0,Phyang_Monastery,shirazina,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2011 â€¢ Family,must see,beautiful monument must visit the place for new comers to experience the best peaceful atmosphere also good for a spiritual people
1,Phyang_Monastery,Addy21,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Phyang - The windy bend of Leh,"Its a must-do when visiting Leh. Its about 10-12 kms from Leh, and you got to take a turn from the main highway (to Manali) and travel for 3-4 kms inside to reach the monastery. This monastery is more than 200 years old. Due to some removation work going on, we could see only 1 out of the 3 chapels there. There are lots of fascinating statues , artefacts to see in the monastery, and to know more about the history, there are also some books available. Apart from the monastery, you also get a fantastic view of the ""windy patch"" of Leh, since the monastery is on a hill-top."
2,Phyang_Monastery,Pavs,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Fewer tourists here,"Phyang monastery is about 12km from Leh town. An imposing structure, can be seen from 9km away, as you turn in from the main road to Manali. Its main prayer hall, and other prayer rooms contain several lifestze statues of their Gods, and also some stuffed birds and animals hang from their ceilings. Compare to the other monasterys Phyang is less frequented by visitors because its not easily accessible and is a bit out of the way."
