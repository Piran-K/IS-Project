It takes more than a day from Leh to reach the Gompa, with an overnight halt at Kargil. Transport is meagre and one needs to hire a vehicle from Leh to reach this place. Accommodation is not available at Rangdum but for a stray tent or two. So do make your arrangements for stay before u venture to try out this place."

2,Rangdum_Gompa,Prasanna N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,A world in its own right,"   Ringdom Gompa is located at the gates of Zanskar valley about Twenty Five kilometres short of Pensi La pass. The monastery which belongs to the Gelukpa sub sect of the Mahayana sect is astride the NH 301 at the peak of a hillock. The Gompa was established in the 17th century by Lobzang Geluk Eashy Takspa who is regarded as the Eight reincarnation of Nari Rinpoche, younger brother of HH Dalai Lama. The Gompa was established during the reign of King Tsewang Namgyal. This was the first Gompa to be established in this region which subsequently led to the birth of Gompas all across the Zanskar region. 	  The Gompa has under its fold a school which offers education up to Class Eigth. There are 39 students in the school presently. The Gompa is regularly endowed with generous assistance from foreign as well as Indian nationals and organisations. The Lions Club, Italy and Casa Del Tibet Italy have established a clinic within the premises of the monastery.  Ulli Salbrechter, an Austrian national was instrumental in renovating the Gompa in the year 2012. A Delhi based NGO 18000 Ft has been extensively contributing to the betterment and welfare of the students studying at the Gompa.	  On 07 July 2000, the Gompa was the target of a militant attack. Militants originating from Kishtwar abducted and killed three monks and a German national. Post this incident the Army has been maintaining its presence as the sentinels of the Zanskar valley. In addition to offering security to the locals, the Indian Army is also actively engaged in executing a plethora of people friendly activities in the Zanskar region.	Though there are a few places to do an overnight stay in Zollydok village close to the Gompa a more comfortable option would be to stay put at Kargil and visit Rangdum and get back. The Gompa is about 5 hours drive from Kargil.Alternately one can plan to hit Padum Valley and take an Hour's break at the Gompa on the way up or down.    This year has already seen a lot of snow and the winters will be extended and severe. The best time to visit is from mid June till mid August."

It is a very old monastery and houses a hostel for students.We were welcomed by Lamas and they were kind enough to offer tea to us and sit with us for a photo-op.  It is a must-see place, while visiting Zanskar Valley."
