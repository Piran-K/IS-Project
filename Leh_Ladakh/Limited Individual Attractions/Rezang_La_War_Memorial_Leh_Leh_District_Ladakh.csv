Opposite to the flag are the hills where the skirmish took place in 1962. The AV chronicling the conflict is inspirational.a must visit place of one is visiting Hanle from Pangong
1,Rezang_La_War_Memorial,JayuVasu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Add this to your itinerary even if its not suggest,We visited this place after Pangong.  I would recommend every Indian to visit here once.  The war memorial of Indo-China war which occured on November 17-18 on 1962 is too good.  Army Personnel take time to show you around. There is a audio-video clip which is narrated by Sri. Amitabh Bachan and written by Sri. Manoj.  Eyes get wet when you pay your respects to the brave 114 army personnel who kiled 1400 Chinese warriors and laid down their lives very happily for their country.  Those days the mortal remains of these great warriors could not be taken to their family.  All of them were cremated here.  Sad we do not learn about Late Shaitaan Singh in our school text books who took several bullets to safe guard his mother land. Hats off to our armed forces

We were guests of Army and had best of stays in remote locations and wonderful  visits to places in Ladakh. Visit to war memorial was unique as it gives full picture of Kargil victory. Sacrifices of these brave men can only be felt. Light & Sound show was newly conceived and it is well written. Many army men participate to give real feeling of action

5,Rezang_La_War_Memorial,royjay2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Rezang La Stands Out,"Rezang La is a high mountain pass at an elevation of 5199 m (17,057ft) above sea level and located on the China-India border on the road to Tsaka La. It is one of the highest mountain roads of the country.The pass links China's Tibet Autonomous Region and India’s Jammu and Kashmir state. Located in the Himalayas, the road to the summit is gravel, rocky, tippy and bumpy at times. It’s impassable in winters. The climb is simply terrible with a notorious lack of oxygen that tests the organisms and a high degree of steepness. Most people feel altitude sickness at around 2,500-2,800 meters. Near the pass oxygen is in short supply. Stay away if you are scared of heights. Drive with care as this is a mountain road with hairpin curves and dangerous dropoffs. The road is narrow and heavily used by military vehicles. The road is called Rezang La Road. Rezang La was the site of the last stand of the 13 Kumaon Regiment during the Sino-Indian War in 1962."

7,Rezang_La_War_Memorial,Abhishek Shenoy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Must visit!,This memorial comes enroute the journey from Pangong to Tsomoriri. We visited this memorial on independence day and spent about 20mins here.It is very close to the China border and the story behind this memorial is very touching. Some jawans who were at the memorial spent some time to brief us about the place and the story. It was a very touching gesture.Must visit esp with kids to make them aware of some of the unsung heroes who fought for our country in some of the toughest terrains.
8,Rezang_La_War_Memorial,NarendraNSC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,The soldiers Mecca ,"The story of Rezang La is perhaps the most touching story in the annals of modern day wars. The place at which this memorial stands is where mass cremation of the 114 soldiers who laid down their lives, fighting a Chinese force, almost ten times their numbers was done. The place of fighting is about 40 minutes away, but not allowed to be visited as it is on the Line of Actual Control.This group of soldiers died fighting in Nov end and then froze there itself in snow (literally). Their bodies were recovered in Mar next year and cremated. What is most touching and gives a glimpse of what the Indian soldier is made of is that all but two of the group died fighting..... surely they would have known seeing the sheer number of Chinese and yet they decided to fight till the end instead of choosing to abandon.It's a must visit not because it looks great but gave me an opportunity to reflect on whether I was doing my bit towards the country and the soldiers.BTW, I also took a pledge never to enjoy a bonfire in my life. Guess why?? I came to know that since there is no wood in the area (for two hours after that I kept observing but didn't find a single tree) the cremation was done using boxes in which ammunition is provided.... when this was insufficient, they used the office furniture!!!!!!May your sacrifices never go in vain....
