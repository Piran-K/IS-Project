3,Riasi_Fort_or_Zorawar_Fort,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 â€¢ Couples,Conqueror of Ladakh,"Ages before getting â€˜Lehâ€™ed became synonymous with clicking selfies at Khardungla top and posing on Kareena Kapoorâ€™s yellow scooter at the â€˜3 idiotsâ€™ lake, a Dogra Rajput did it in style, leading 5000 men all the way from Kishtwar through the source of the Suru (Indus) river. Serving as a â€˜Wazirâ€™ under the ambitious Gulab Singh, Maharaja of Jammu, he subdued the Gyalpo ruler of Ladakh followed by successful campaigns at Kargil, Baltistan and Skardu. The Zorawar fort still lives on as a legacy of this warrior - the indomitable Zorawar Singh, whose military prowess and expertise in mountain warfare has become stuff of legend. Constructed in 1836, Zorawar fort is a national monument now maintained by the Indian Armed Forces. The fort also houses a museum dedicated to brave dogra and ladakhi warriors. Entry is free. Traces of a moat is visible round the fort, which is constructed with mud and stone as per local style. Inside the premises , the army maintains stables.  The â€˜touristyâ€™ types can give it a miss, but for someone who wishes to explore Ladakh beyond its natural beauty, Zorawar fort can be a good starting point."

It is named after General Zorawar Singh who defended Ladhakh from the Chinese invasion. It is presently under occupation of Indian Military. A museum is also built in one part of the fort which gives insight into the history of Ladakh, the paraphernalia of military equipments of those time. The fort is made essentially of clay with use of stones inside. A trench runs through its outer boundary which used to be filled with water during those time but today it is totally dry. A very small temple and a mosque are also built inside the fort. An interesting place for those who have interest in archaeology and artifacts. From outside the fort one can capture the scenic beauty of the valley. "

Alternatively known as General Zorawarâ€™s Fort, it is the place where Jammu's Dogra rulers kept a large portion of their wealth. The fort was owned and named after General Zorawar Singh â€“ a brave warrior who defended Ladakh against Chinese invasion. In present times, the fort houses a rich and impressive collection of stamps, coins and royal treasures. Within the premises, visitors can see an old mosque and a temple dedicated to two Hindu goddesses, namely Goddess Kali and Goddess Durga. A natural spring of water is also present inside this old fort's complex."
4,Riasi_Fort_or_Zorawar_Fort,SurenKaushik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 â€¢ Couples,Historical monument -worth a visit,Zorawar fort also known as Riasi fort built in the 19th century by the Dogra warrior Zorawar Singh. An interesting museum is located inside the fort premises. One can see the personal armory and costumes of Gen. Zorawar. Zorawar Singh's role is very important in the history of Ladakh. His battles with the Chinese wherein he succeeded in driving them out of Ladakh is chronicled by many historians . He was a trusted General of Maharajah Ranjit Singh and led an expedition to prevent the Chinese and Tibetan armies from annexing Ladakh. We were told that there is a sound and light show but no one could guide us about the timings. The fort today houses some Army offices and quarters. I wish the Army and the Government of India gives this place the due importance of a heritage site.
