0,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Hadi1004,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,View is nice but crowded. Even saw a camel care taker hit a camel; some camels' humps were flat; a camel skin had open wound,"As per the title. I really hope the money given for the camel rides (350 Indian rupees per person) are used to take care of the camels. During the camel rides, the camels would be tied together such that one camel care taker is able to guide 1 camel by a leash while the other 4 or 5 camels would follow suit. "

2,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,PoojaNoida,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 • Family,Beautiful ATV ride- Must do,"The Sand dunes and the surrounding valley is just amazing. Beautiful landscape. But the camels are tied to each other with ropes and 1 person takes a group of 5 camels for safari. On the way the camels keep hitting each other. Can be avoided.The dunes are also not that great as the repeated walk by camels on the same route has flattened them.The ATV ride nearby is much more scenic and enjoyable. You get to drive on the actual dunes. It's a long route and very picturesque. We personally enjoyed this a lot. It can be done singly with a helper which costs 1000 or 2 people together along with helper, which costs 1200.Second best activity after Pangong. Must do.."

Going on a camel ride in the evening is more fun.  The sun sets and again there is cool breeze (associated with Sand storms) every now and then,  Surrounded by mountains on one side.  They stand humangous and literally tell you that you are just a miniscule."

The traditional and cultural dresses give the best memories.In winter, Temperature really goes down to minus.Better visit in the summer season.These sand dunes are around 1-2 km from Hunder Village.Overall, I had a great time at this place.I strongly recommend visiting Hunder once, if you are coming to Leh Ladakh."

In some groups 15 people, 15 camels and only one man controlling all camels & riders, as all camels are tied with one rope in line. The camels are sitting. The first one has to jump & climb on camel. Then second person will sit & camel will rise slowly. First it will straighten up its front leg, so you are bound to collapse backwards, then it will straighten up hind legs, so you may fall on camels first hump. You, your friends & other watchers can not control laughing.Enjoyed this ride not only too much but three or four much ! Ha ha ha!"

Like an oasis amidst the cold desert, Hunder Sand Dunes are beautiful beyond imagination. Located at an altitude of 4,000 meters, the desert is cut across by a gentle stream and the beautiful countryside. With such stunning landscapes against the backdrop of the snow-clad mountains, the Hunder Sand Dune looks nothing less than a fairy world. Beyond its beauty, the dunes are home to the Bactrian Camels, the major key players during the ancient silk route, and Pashmina Goats. You can also go on a safari on the Bactrian camel that will take you back to the time when trade was quite prominent in Central Asia, and to the remote village of Hunder."

Not only can you enjoy the view, you can also rent a ride on these camels, though I found it a bit expensive at Rs.1000 per ride. There is also a beautiful steam running through the valley which adds the cherry on top of it and makes for a beautiful picnic site.

In the other side of the not so vast dunes, ATV 4wheeler bikes are available for joyride for 10 mins. There is a small canteen also and valuable seabuckthorn jungles.

1,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Sat_samp,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Leisurely evening walk at the Sand dunes,"This is a very interesting place. Although we were driven to this place to ride on the two-humped Bactrian camels, the area itself makes for a good evening walk. There is a good stretch of grassland, and a nice stream with clear water that flows by - one can dip knee high into this and the water was not very cold. Just a short walk through the grasslands brings one to Sand dunes that are very much desert terrain. This terrain goes for a fair distance upto the mountains. And since this entire area is in a valley, the surrounding mountains make for good viewing. We werent too keen to ride the camels, but it seemed like a crowd puller. There is a cafe as well for a nice cup of tea and some eats. It was also nice to note that trash bins were kept at reasonable distance of each other in this area to encourage tourists to keep the place clean.Of the few places to see in the Nubra Valley, this is a definite recommend, particularly for a nice evening stroll."

3,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Rajeev K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,Overrated!,"The sand dunes are in a small area of nubra valley and although offer a new views of the mountains are nothing spectacular , i had very high hopes about the camels and the and dunes and rode my motorcycle extra to be there but was disappointed .. there are two humped camels there which are managed by locals to provide a ride , and for riding them people literally fight with each  other , also the area has accommodated lots of plastic waste ittered by the tourists which distracts you from the beautyof leh and the chaotic atmosphere created by 100's of tourist vehicles adds to it as wellMy advice: better stay away from it until unless you are really interested in viewing the sand dunes.Accomodation: there are plenty of accomodation near the dunes and are very cheap to begin with.Roads to dunes: the roads constructed by BRO to sand dunes are basically a level above.you would breze along them in your bike or in your taxi."
4,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Peter L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,A bit overrared place when you are a Dutchman.,A relatively smal area with sand dunes and some commercial rides with camels. In Holland we have 300 km of sand dunes along the coast.... So Nubra is a bit overrated in my view. 
5,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,debasis2k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,The double hump camel,It was a lovely experience. The camels are very adorable. Go their in the afternoon so that you can experience the dune and dont feel the heat of the sun. The sand dunes are nice and a new experience. Dont forget to take the photos with the reflection so that you get lovely framing with the mountains. The sun set is a bonus. Dont forget the cultural show in the evening near the park.

7,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,N. Shah,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Beautiful Desert in the middle of mountains.,The dunes are not as big and magnificent as in middle east. But the whole surrounding makes this even more beautiful.

9,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,njan45,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,A desert in the Himalayas,It's white sand every where. A desert in the Himalayas. It is around 150 km from Leh at an altitude of 10000 ft. It is beautiful and I found it more thrilling than the deserts of Arabia. The presence of double humped Bactrian Camels makes it all the more interesting. A desert with a river (SHYOCK) flowing by the side.
0,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Jamie F,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,No much to look at.,"Not worth the trip if all you are doing is taking a selfie in front of the sand dunes. Really, the Nubra Valley is beautiful but the sand dunes are not the highlight."
1,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Aarthik Kanal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Very interesting place in the hills,This place has lots to offer for adventure / thrill seeking enthusiasts. There's also the double hump back camel rides for children and adults alike. There's also ATV experience on the sand dunes. A worth visiting place. 
2,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,DEVDEEPAK70,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,nubra valley sightseeing point,ATV and camel rides available before arriving at Nubra valley.  Visiting a desert at such a high altitude is itself a chance of a lifetime. 
3,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Amaresh M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Must visit place,"You must spend a full day here to absorb the quaint and beauty of this valley.

The rates of both are fixed. The sun can be very strong in the afternoon so its best to go to the dunes around 5pm."

4,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,DreamTraveller17,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,terrible place. Full of Camel droppings and Unhealthy camels.,Sand dune operators are milking money and are not taking care of camels. it's apparent and the trend you see in Nubra. Everyone wants to extract money from you. Very low quality.
5,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Uday Krishna,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Business,Nubra Sanddunes,Nubra Valley is famous for Diskit Monastery and the Sand Dunes. As per history ages ago this place was under water and after the earth restructuring the was a lot of movement and these sanddunes have been here ever since
6,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,vikaagar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,must to camel safari,"Sand dunes of white sand and riding on double back camel is wonderful experience.But careful before camel riding.Do inquire from camel owner about camel behavior as I saw few tourist got injured after falling from camel,no medical help in near vicinity.So use caution and enjoy Nubra valley"
7,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,GokulChandran,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Family trip to Ladakh,"very good place to visit with family but the ride price was overpriced.  given the price, they should allow guests to enjoy the ride for somemore time.  is it because they get to earn only during season?  overall it was a wonderful place with family and kids thoroughly enjoyed it.  Also the sand storms in the evening was a sight to watch (from inside the vehicle though :)."
8,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Wara P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018,Lovely sand dunes and camels!,"The weather was quite humid, however, with breeze. The Park has the sand dunes as its landmark. You could ride camels for 15 min or 30 min. Watch out for the crowd! A pond nearby the parking is where people cool down the temperature. Taking photos with the sand dunes in harmonious atmosphere of mountains, sand, waterways and camels. Can you imagine? :)"
9,Sand_Dunes_Leisure_Park,Anand G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Interesting side track,"Leh is more about monasteries, mountains and military heroism and the sand dunes offer something completely different and refreshes you. Nice camel rides, slightly adventerous ATV rides and a bit of long walk along the dunes recharges you on the way from Nubra/Hunder to Leh. Located close to the Deskit monastery, we can have a double stop before proceeding to Leh or Nubra depending on the direction of driving."
