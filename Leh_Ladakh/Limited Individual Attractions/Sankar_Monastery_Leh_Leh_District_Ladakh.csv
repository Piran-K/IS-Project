It is located within an easy half-hour walk from Leh. It is a relatively modern, attractive cluster of buildings set amongst trees above the town, in the lee of the Khardung La Pass behind Leh leading to the Shyok and Nubra Valleys."
1,Sankar_Monastery,royjay2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Scenic location,Sankar Monastery is located about 2 km away from Leh such that tourists can visit the Gompa easily on foot. The Sankar Monastery belongs to the Gelukpa sect of Buddhism. The monastery remains open from 7 am to 10 am and 5 pm to 7 pm. If you plan to visit the Sankar Gompa then you are going to experience the best of nature’s creations as the surrounding of the monastery shares the marvellous beauty of Himalayas.
2,Sankar_Monastery,debasis2k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,An old monastery,"When we visited them it was closed for lunch and we were tired to wait for an hour. So could not see it from inside. It is a small monastery, nice painting on the wall, dont forget the private museum just outside the monastery about the different stones available in Leh and the history of all such stones."
3,Sankar_Monastery,alinemichael,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Magical and moving.,"Well worth hunting down in the upper valley of Leh.  A smaller gompa compared with many, but with a moving and spiritual atmosphere that seems ancient.  "
4,Sankar_Monastery,njan45,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,An attractive Monastery,"This is hardly half an hour walk from Leh town.Open to visitors only in the early morning and evening. The walls are painted in the traditional style. Compared to the bigger monasteries in Thiksey or Diskit, this is small but beautiful. Worth visiting."
5,Sankar_Monastery,HemanthPai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Our recent visit to Sankar Gompa/Monastery,It is really very eye catching & is worth the visit.It is located in peaceful surroundings like most of the monasteries.
6,Sankar_Monastery,Kaushik G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Peaceful place in Leh,"We had visited this Gompa during our vacation in Leh. This monastery is located in the northern part of Leh amidst peaceful surroundings. This place has limited visiting hours - check before visiting. It is a small but well maintained monastery. No climbing is involved here - so good for senior citizens. I would rate this place average after visiting the magnificent giant gompas in Diskit, Hemis, Thiksey etc."
7,Sankar_Monastery,Pulkita,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Away from the hustle bustle,This was a place we crossed everyday on our way to the market from Sankar. yet we hadn't visited until someone came looking for it and we thought lets venture in and see whats there. Inside was a beautiful monastery. not many monks live here. we were fortunate to have been there with some tourists who were on a guided tour so we found out much more about it than we would have on our own. 
8,Sankar_Monastery,Sandypaulc,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Samkar Gompa,"The famous Thousand handed Buddha !! It was beautiful, elegant and rather awe-strucking !! :) :) :)   :)"
9,Sankar_Monastery,655Denis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Business,Sightseeing around Leh,Well worth the visit.  Bit of climbing but well worth the huffing and puffing with the the reduced oxygen.  
0,Sankar_Monastery,ChauhanRuchi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,One like many !!,Like many other monasteries in the region.There is nothing much to do or see around. There are much better monasteries around in the area to be visited.
1,Sankar_Monastery,neera2014,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Business,Not so special,This is another monastery if u visited the famous one then point going there . Will advice for those who are in culture only
2,Sankar_Monastery,SubhNeha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Small but nice monastery within the city,Sankar Monastery or Sankar Gompa is is a small monastery within the city and anyone can visit there as it does not involve climbing steep steps. Its quite well maintained. Visiting hours are limited and we observed the place comparatively less crowded.Its a calm place and worth a visit if you have time. Elderly people who find it difficult to climb other bigger monasteries may prefer to visit this place to get a feel of local beleif and culture. Nominal entrance fees are charged.
3,Sankar_Monastery,huys25,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Sankar monastry in Leh's northern town in Sankar section,"This Sankar Gompa lies in a quiet neighbourhood in the northern part of the town. The very old building encolses a peace ful and quiet courtyard.However, we went three times at different hours to this place (our hotel was nearby) but all the times the building was closed. According to some signs also no photo's could be made inside, but on these reviews some pictures can be seen from the interior. The entrance fee was indicated as Rs 30. per person."
4,Sankar_Monastery,peter h,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,A peaceful local neighbourhood Gompa,"Many of the reviews here seem to refer to two different Gompas. This review concerns the Sankar Gompa, just off Sankar road on the northern edge of Leh in a quiet residential area. The walk through the back lanes to the Gompa is green, peaceful and very enjoyable. The Gompa is an ordinary place of worship serving the local community - pleasantly serene.  "

7,Sankar_Monastery,jenabaintheworld,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 • Solo,definitely worth a visit-- in a cluster with other Gompas,Sankar Monastery is along the road with a cluster of other monasteries worth a view.   This is a relatively smaller monastery-- but still worth a visit.
8,Sankar_Monastery,Peregrineri,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Solo,A peaceful monastery worth a visit,"While it's not one of the more famous monasteries in the area, it is quite an interesting and charming one. It's away from the main part of Leh in a very quiet area. I like to go in and meditate there. Be sure to go upstairs and also onto the roof.Not accessible as there are a lot of steps up to the entrance."
9,Sankar_Monastery,Simon H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Solo,authentic,unpretentious workaday monastery that exudes atmosphere without too many tourists. At least in June. Too many monasteries are exacting entry fees these days which is good for upkeep but not sure its in the true spirit 
0,Sankar_Monastery,AnilAggarwal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2012 • Couples,Only Gompa on plains,"Sankar Gompa is a royal monastery 3km from Leh in its outskirts. It has a very small gate to enter the premises. It is the seat of Yellowhat Buddhist tradition. It has a formidable collection of miniature statues of pure gold and wall paintings. It is a daughter establishment of SPITUK MONASTERY. There are a few steps to reach main hall. Outside, it has a lot of protector paintings as in all monasteries. Opposite to it, is residence of KUSHOK BAKULA.  There are a  lot of expensive thangkas. Normally this is covered on 1st day of arrival in Leh in evening in most of the planned tours. There is an entry ticket of Rs. 20. Timings are 7 to 10 am and 5 to 7pm. Photography is allowed but without flash."
