Unfortunately, ppl dont know about these buddhist caves with well maintained frescoes, but Saspol is the famous place because of Alchi and Likir monasteries. So highly recommend to visit and enjoy that caves and beautiful view valley from there. "
2,Saspol_Caves,royjay2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,The Rock-Cut Buddhist Caves at Saspol,Buddhist paintings of the Saspol Caves in Jammu and Kashmir from the 13th – 15th century AD are of special significance to Buddhist monks. The paintings are a mix of Indian and Tibetan Buddhist art and the colour blue seems dominant in these paintings. Four caves are lavishly adorned with bright coloured paintings of Buddhist pantheons.

6,Saspol_Caves,simeone2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,Old meditation caves enroute Alchi,"A must visit to these old mediation caves at Saspol. Beautiful frescoes can be seen in these caves. Though only one cave is maintained well, the others still hold significance and the wall paintings and religious relics can still be seen."
7,Saspol_Caves,infoaddict,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,Please Preserve These Caves,"Not easy to find, in fact none of the agents or drivers in Leh knew about them. We had to get our driver to ask and it was the first time he had been. However most people in Alchi know about them and you can spot them on the far hillside.They are also difficult to climb up to enter, apart from the main cave with orange surround. be very careful.The paintings inside are amazing and date to the same period as those at Alchi gompa.Please do nothing to damage or ruin this special place"
8,Saspol_Caves,Niharika C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,Mind-blowing!,"I'm not saying 'mind-blowing' because I was seeing caves for the first time or so. I'm saying this because where and how did those caves come up from. I mean seriously unless you see them yourself you can't make out what I'm saying. Ek toh those hills have such different colours - sea green, megenta! The Zanskar rivers flows from between those hills on both the sides. So, I was just left to wonder how exactly the monks or anyone must have gone inside those caves, because those hills are very steep and rocky and really dangerous. "
9,Saspol_Caves,viralimm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,"Amazing, fragile",Ask around in the village or just look up to the north and see the obvious caves.  Take a courteous path through the fields.  The caves are below the ruins of an old fort. There is little signage and no protection.  These precious art works are the responsibility of all visitors to protect and preserve.

7,Saspol_Caves,SomnathSarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,Caves hiding treasures,"The Saspol caves can be visited while visiting Alchi. There are two ways to visit the caves - park the vehicle opposite the SBI Saspol branch and take a 30 minute walk through verdant fields of wheat, rye and vegetables and wild flowers, over sole-deep water coming from the molten snows, through the village, exchanging pleasantries with the local people as their gardens and residences are passed (the people are charming and helpful) OR to take the vehicle straight to the foot of the hill containing the caves, through a rough road on the left few hundred metres before arriving at the SBI. The first one is highly recommended for its leisurely charm.On the top, there are remnants of an ancient fort and four caves, the main one marked in red and white. The main cave is the easiest to reach. From the bottom of the hill, it is about a 200 m climb to the  top, up a steep incline along a narrow loosely marked path of gravel, that slip as one steps on them. Good shoes with strong grips are needed. At the top, the path gets a bit too narrow for comfort, with irregularly shaped stones acting as steps. There are no handrails anywhere, so NOT recommended for young children and the elderly and ones suffering from vertigo. But the climb is worth the labor and the risk, because both the view as well as the contents are worth it. The rock cut caves and the paintings within date back to the 13th century, and are among the oldest ones on display in Ladakh. It is a miracle that without any maintenance they are still surviving, though badly damaged. Tourists may kindly shut off the flashlights while taking photos, to preserve the paintings for out future generations. There are no guards or guides around, so one has to resist the temptation of using the flashlight inside the dark cave, illuminated by a single lamp. Switching on the museum mode in digital cameras is the best option inside. The paintings are the same as in the other Drukpa monasteries. They are endangered- the walls of the caves showing wide cracks, and flakes of the paints falling off. The government has taken no steps whatsoever to protect them, quite surprisingly. One must take care to close the ricketty door  of the cave shrine while leaving, to protect the precious contents from the vagaries of the weather.The views from the caves are breath taking. The meandering river Indus through the snow capped mountains presents a wonderful photo op. The chill in the air, and the near absolute silence broken occasionally by the cry of a bird - the experience is unforgettable.One can even meditate inside the cave, as  the caves are seldom visited by tourists. The locals, however, care to keep a lamp burning inside."
8,Saspol_Caves,itsindia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,For any visitor interested in early Buddhist paintings,Saspol caves are situated on the hills behind the Saspol village settlement. A 30 min walk (smooth climb) will take you to the caves. Climb is worth as you can see some of the best late 14th/15th century paintings in Ladakh adorning the interiors of these caves.
9,Saspol_Caves,Vikas Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 • Family,Amazing rock cut temples,"Between Leh and Alchi right on the national highway lies the village of Saspol. In the village are located Saspol Caves - amazing rock-cut temples. Four of these caves are richly adorned with paintings of Buddhist theme from 13th - 15th century AD, representing a fusion of Indian and Tibetan Buddhist art. On the top of this rock there are remnants of an ancient fort. From the top one gets beautiful view of the river Indus. The caves are crumbling and in bad shape. Visit them before they are gone for ever. The village also has the first ATM after Leh!"
