0,Serzang_Temple,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Giant idol of Future Buddha,We had visited this temple located at a lower level on a hillock during our visit to Basgo monastery located near the Leh Srinagar highway. This ancient temple from 16th century is built out of mud bricks. One has to walk on a narrow pathway on a cliff and then climb stairs to reach the temple. We had to buy entrance tickets at 30 rupees per person. The temple is a small one with a giant statue of Maitreya Buddha which left us spell bound but the wall paintings inside the temple are not clearly visible.
