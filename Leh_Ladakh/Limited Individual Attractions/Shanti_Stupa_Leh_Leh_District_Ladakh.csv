There was a meditation area for ppl to meditate indoors before going up the slope and the stairs up to Shanti stupa. At Shanti stupa itself, the area is very spacious, and the view of the leh area from the top is amazing. There are quite a number of people there - mostly Indians from other parts of India. But since the area is so spacious, you don't feel like it's packed.The tour itinerary mentioned to see the sunset from Shanti stupa. But too bad our driver sent us there Abit too early.

The stupa also acts like a metaphorical bridge between the people of Japan and Ladakh.The stupa stands in the middle of a large circular space which is surrounded with giant snow mountains. The temple was built as a two level structure. The first one depicts a golden idol of the Buddha in a sitting position and the second level depicts the birth and death of Buddha with other relics. The best part of this monument is the location where one can oversee the panoramic view of the city of Leh. The dwellings of the local villagers covered with poplar trees makes the scenery all the  more picturesque and enchanting. An ideal example where God and Nature can be seen as one. No wonder, the Shanti Stupa has become the face of Ladakh’s tourist attraction.  "

1,Shanti_Stupa,robagdivad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,"3 days in Leh, Ladakh region","Our main suggestion: do not book anything in advance accept directly the accomodation that suits your needs. We stayed at Gomang Boutiqe Hotel, and this was a great choice. Once you arrive you will see how you feel ( high altitude) and depending on that you can plan your stay and the places of your interest direclty in the hotel or anywhere downtown ( plenty of opportunities) this will be surely the cheapest and most meaningful for your stay. We booked a package tour (quite expensive) at a tour agency ahead which turned out to be a mistake we made.On the first day you have to give yourself time to get used to the high altitude.We went in the afternoon to Santhi Stupa and the Leh palace. Both worth the visit! The second day we visited the meeting point of Indus and Zanskar river. This was amasingly beautiful. All the other programs booked and suggested by the touragent were not really interesting (war museum, a small sikh temple) so we were back in town 2 hours later. We asked the guide to take us to Hemis monastery (40 km to other direction -60-70 min drive) wich was very interesting.  For that day I would have suggested to go further the road after Zanskar-Indus meeting point to Lanayuru monastery (till the monastery it is3 hours drive).The third day we went up the Khardung La pass to 5600 m. We were back to our hotel in 4 hours, but you need some rest again after the high altitude. It would have been a nice program in the afternoon to visit either Thiksy or Hemis monastery.As a summary: if you plan to go to the Leh-Ladakh region don’t book a tour ahead. Choose a hotel and ask there for the permits to visit the passes, and book there a driver or anywhere in town."

1,Shanti_Stupa,pujakala2346,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Make a dual visit here!!,"We reached Leh somewhere during the afternoon, after a little rest we decided to head to the market and drive to Shanti Stupa. It was already dark and already had a regret to have not been able to visit here during the day. A few steps to the stupa and the regrets to have come here just vanished. A sparkling 360 degree view of the city was a soothing experience to the eyes with the clear sky and stars. Now i call it a dual visit as the thought of how the city looked during the day kept hovering through my mind.  So just the day we were to leave we decided to head to the stupa and yes again it will leave you startled. the perfect view of the city, clear blue sky and the Khardungla pass at the back .. all of it was the cherry to the trip and time i had in Leh."

3,Shanti_Stupa,2013Deborah2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,just a first bite of all the beauty you will see during your trip,"arrived in Leh on Thursday morning, we decided to go up to Shanti stupa to see the view over there. You can reach the top climbing the stairs ( a lot of stairs),  or going by car/bike from another road.  We decided to climb the stairs...bad decision! Our fault, people told us to not practice physical activities on the day of the arrival, to allow our body to acclimatise to the altitude, but we thought was not going to be a problem for us. guess what? my friends got sick for the altitude and lack of Oxygen. So my tip is, once you arrive in Leh, spend at least one full day in total relax, read, drink a tea with friends, go around by car, but don't climb 500 stairs to reach the shanti stupa. take care of your body and follow the advises of the local people.  If you do that,  your trip will be the trip of your life. going back to shanti stupa, the view over there is nice and i suggest you to go and visit it, but reaching the stupa by car ( if you want to go on the first day of your arrival)."

8,Shanti_Stupa,Anuradha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Peaceful ,"Nice place to relax and meditate. Life of Buddha is depicted through sculpture conceptualised by a Japanese. It was constructed in 1990s, so not very old. "
