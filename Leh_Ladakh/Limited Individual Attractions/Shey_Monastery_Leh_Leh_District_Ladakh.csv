5,Shey_Monastery,John_Doe1011,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Monastery lying in ruins,We visited this monastery as part of local Leh sightseeeing tour. The monastery like many other in the region is centuries old but this one is in ruins. The good part is it offers some very good views of the surrounding areas. One can very well skip this place if visiting other monasteries or gompas.

0,Shey_Monastery,GauravChand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Monastery and palace in bad shape,We visited Shey Monastery on the way back from Thiksey monastery.  The structure looks in bad shape and looks like it may have been damaged during some bad weather or an earthquake.  There is not much climbing.  There is a Buddha statue.  The palace is also there.  A visit provides some good views.  This attraction can be skipped if visiting other monasteries.
1,Shey_Monastery,Peregrineri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,"Interesting, but not well preserved","I first visited here several years ago, when more of the palace was open. Now only the upper hall with the Buddha statue is open. I have always heard of it referred to as Shey Palace. There was one monk there, collecting the Rs30 admission fee, but I didn't see others. The only other activity there that I could see was a hall with many oil lamps. If you go in there without shoes, your feet will get sticky. There's no sign about shoes there, so maybe they are OK. It's disappointing that the place seems to be getting no restoration work done.It's not accessible, You have to walk up quite a few stairs. You get a great view from up there, though."
2,Shey_Monastery,S K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,SHEY MONASTERY,"Presently hosts a Big Buddha Statue this is also once a Palace. The Palace is NOT accessible easily.

People feed them after visiting the Shrine, "
3,Shey_Monastery,debasis2k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,A must visit while in Leh,In a routine visit of the sight seeing you will be visiting this place.

4,Shey_Monastery,Uday V,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Palace with a monastery,Its called Shey palace but it is in ruins. The monastery is in working condition. Thats the best possible thing to see and visit. If hard pressed for time this could be skipped.
5,Shey_Monastery,Rohit J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Bike ride to Ladakh,"A must place to visit when you are in Leh. It is situated at Leh Manali highway, 15 kms from Leh.

7,Shey_Monastery,LaBalise,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Many better ones,Unfortunately this one suffers from neglect and looks more like a rubble-strewn building after an earthquake
8,Shey_Monastery,Anil J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,spritual experience,"We stayed away from the city of Leh close to Shey Monestry. Drive to monastery itself was excellent. there after a tour of the monastery and sitting inside quietly takes you to a different level. one can spend as much time you want and also see young lamas getting training and learning Buddhism. its difficult to explain, one must experience it to about it."
9,Shey_Monastery,Tropicalstorm,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Palace with a monastery,Quaint place. More rustic and quaint than other 'mainstream' monasteries. Going through the alleys of this place you feel as if you are in a magical movie like doctor strange..Don't forget to visit Shey Mosque which is half a kilometre BEFORE the Shey Palace (when coming from main Leh market on the leh-manali Road). This mosque is the first mosque in Ladakh built by the Muslim scholar and preacher Shah Hamdan. He came from central Asia to Ladakh via the Silk Road route. This mosque is very old and basic. The ceiling is made up of small bamboo like wood closely huddled together to keep the temperature warm in winter. The small garden outside is beautiful. It has hand made wooden shelters along with hand made benches.

4,Shey_Monastery,Sanjay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,Shey monastery,As said before one monastery is more than enough as all are same. Sheet monastery may be avoided as there is nothing much out in this monastery compared to the other monasteries
5,Shey_Monastery,Ankita G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017,Huge Gilded Buddha Statue,One has to climb up very high to get to this monastery. The monastery is known for its huge gold Buddha stature which is supposedly second largest in Ladakh. The view from top is scenic which makes it worth visiting.
6,Shey_Monastery,Sk_mahua,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Monastry Visit,The monastery is quite high up. Avoid doing it on the second day as oxygen is rare the body is yet to acclimatise. The place is lovely. 
7,Shey_Monastery,HemanthPai,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Our visit to Shey palace/Monastery,This was a 15th century summer palace of Lehs royal family which also has a monastery.It involved lots of climbing steps & was tiresome.Still from scenic beauty point of view worth the visit

0,Shey_Monastery,smlec,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Gorgeous Site,"The drive itself to Shey is wonderful (in fact, if you pass the monastery, you will see a beautiful field of ancient stupas as you approach the next hilltop monastery).  These gorgeous Buddhist sites constructed within Ladakh's rugged mountainsides are breath-taking.  Take water with you, as summer heat at the high altitudes can be taxing, and there is no fancy rest-stop/restaurant nearby, though some roadside cafes were open during my visit."
1,Shey_Monastery,Ashish D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,Historical monument near the city !,"Most of the monastery is in shambles. The temple is well maintained and the scenery is excellent, on your way up and from the top !"

3,Shey_Monastery,barbschwarz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,"Close to Leh, Shey Monastery and the Shey palace complex are worth a visit.","Shey village was used to be the summer capital of Ladakh and the king took residence at the palace of Shey which, today, lays mostly in ruins.

4,Shey_Monastery,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Beautiful views from the top,"We had visited this ancient palace located on the Leh Manali highway during our sightseeing in Leh. From the parking lot, one has to walk on a inclined path to reach the entrance and then climb a steep flight of steps to check out the palace and the beautiful main temple dedicated to Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha is in sitting posture and the idol is huge - one can view the Lord from a lower temple and again from the upper temple which has a entrance ticket of 30 rupees per person. We also saw a room where hundreds of small & large oil lamps were lighted and it was a beautiful sight. The view of the surrounding valley and mountains from the top is breathtaking."

6,Shey_Monastery,Daniel T,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Worth a visit once,"No more a royal palace, it still stands strong as a reminder of 16th century lifestyle. Old relics still well preserved is just awesome. You get a guide inside the palace & shrine to take you around.Ask the guide as many queries you have about the place to get full knowledge of what the place.Come here during the evening after your done with the city sightseeing, or after coming back from Pangong lake."

0,Shey_Monastery,24x7TravellingBoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017,Into the eyes of Buddh,"The temple is at a steep from ground level. Even from the parking you have to climb some stairs to reach the Monastery, I was almost out of breath when I reached at the top. There are different beautiful views at the top, wind blowing strongly. Many Photographic locations. you will also find many Stupas there. A soon you entered the temple, you will find a huge Buddha statue with awesome painting on the wall, describing stories of Buddha. I was shivering when I saw the eyes of Buddha statue, it was like he entered my mind, I could not move for sometime. A peaceful place."
1,Shey_Monastery,Shoeabs,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,oldest,nothing much to offer other than a stupa with a pure gold top and a 30 ft buddha statue. the manstery is in ruins and has nothing much to offer
2,Shey_Monastery,Granthalok,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Enchanting views from atop,"As you set foot in Leh, the sheer beauty of the place is sure to get you going either on a photographing spree or on a sight-seeing sojourn. But hold on… it is prudent to just curb this urge since Leh is situated at quite an altitude and requires acclimatization at least for a day. This day should be spent leisurely, with visiting tourist spots commencing next day onwards, and that too in Leh.  Ideally your first spot should be visiting the Shey Palace or Monastery located on the Leh-Manali Highway.Situated on a hillock, which requires climbing some steep steps, visiting Shey Monastery is a pleasure in itself. There are beautiful views from the top, with open fields, dotted with poplar trees. There is a highway running beneath, and the traffic running smoothly is a sight to behold. There is complete silence inside the monastery. It is declared a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of India. There is a copper-gilded statue of Lord Buddha which is almost 40 feet tall. It is a treat for researchers and history-buffs."
3,Shey_Monastery,PatrickBuijs,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Small monastery worth a short visit.,When you are near it do give it a visit. Its one of the smaller monasteries in the Leh area. Few nice rooms/area and nice view over the valley and mountains. The weirdest room for me was the one with all the ligths and sticky/oil floor...
4,Shey_Monastery,Digantjhala,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,A smaller version of the Leh Palace,"About 8 kms from Leh, this was the palace of the king earlier. Be warned, there is a lot to climb before you reach the actual palace and monastry. Nothing great about it, but why go up till Leh and not visit a well known point?You will get good panaromic views from the top of the palace.There is a small Tibetian market on the road just opposite to the entrance. Do visit it if you are interested in buying souvenirs, however you might get everything at a cheaper price in the Leh market.Also, do not forget to glance at the holy pond just behind the market. Though it is pretty dirty, there are quite a few varieties of fish, birds, etc in it."
5,Shey_Monastery,Chiragjain17,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Couples,Great views around,Both Shey monastery and Shey palace lie on same hill. This monastery is also same like any other monastery but the view is great. You will find Indus river flowing near to the hill and this gives good views. It houses Shakyamuni Buddha statue and it is worth watching.The one bad thing is you need to do some trekking to reach at the top and enjoy the views.
6,Shey_Monastery,Pulkita,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Undiscovered way that goes up to beautiful views,when you happen to go here... there is this little way going up. just as you reach the end of the steps and you think you have reached the monastery... ahead of you is the line of bells that you must turn clockwise... straight ahead goes to the back side and on your left you see a big (I'm sorry i dont know the name of those things you turn for good luck) if you're at the beginning of the monastery... look right and you will see a way going up in the rocks and stones. we climbed all the way up and were welcomed by dazzling 360 degree views of the valley and the mountains. its beautiful. a must for adventure seekers. we loved climbing up.  ofcourse the monastery itself is breath-takingly beautiful. The little lamp lighting room is also divine. must visit.

Previously it was a palace of royal family  before it shifted to Stok Palace. The large statue of Buddha is the main attraction. The view of snow hills and green valley is mesmerizing from the top of palace.
0,Shey_Monastery,Shailesh_cs3,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,A Good Visit,The Shey Monastery and the Shey Palace complex are structures located on a hillock in Shey and I would recommend a visit for sure. The monastery houses the main Shakyamuni Buddha statue which is a 12 metres (39 ft) icon covering three floors of the monastery  - Said to be the second largest in the region. Importantly we were intrigued by the Chamber of lamps in the monastery – whereby you see hundreds of them lighted in a room – that is all black because of the soot.

1,Shey_Monastery,Saurav S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Lovely statue and monastery ,A good place to visit. Not too far from the city. Advise you to leave early morning if you are looking for any peace and quiet as it tends to get infested with tourists who do not care much to show any respect to the requested silence at the monastery 
2,Shey_Monastery,TapasyaKaulRajaram,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Friends,Shey and Druk Padma school,This is a monastery which is very close to the Druk Padma school where the shooting of 3 idiots was done. It is a beautiful monastery surrounded with mountains all around.

7,Shey_Monastery,akmittal1982,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Couples,NOT SO GOOD,This is an ordinary place not necessary to visit. only a 20-25 minutes to spend. Surrounding locations are also avoidable

9,Shey_Monastery,Gourav99,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Couples,Nothing Special - Could spend around 30 Mins,"Just a few kms frm the main part of Leh you could reach here in abt 15 - 20 mins .Its on the way to Thiksey Monastry and you could stop here for sometime. The Monastry itself isn't that great but the view frm the top is spectacular, good for panoramic shots as my experience. If hungry the restaurant opposite to the ATM below the monastery offers great Tea and Maggi, we stopped here twice and loved it.IF U LIKED MY REVIEW OR THINK ITS HELPFUL PLZ CLICK THE ""THANK"" BUTTON BELOW AND LETS KEEP SHARING OUR STORIES :)"
0,Shey_Monastery,shouches,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,Monastery and palace just outside of Leh,"The area around Leh in Ladakh is dotted with many interesting monasteries. The Shey palace and monastery is one such, just outside of Leh town on the way to Manali.It is a clean place and offers peaceful prayer halls and lovely views of the surroundings. After a while, all the monasteries start to look similar hence I have only given it 3 stars. If you have had your fill of monasteries, you may give it a miss or pay a flying visit while driving towards Manali."
1,Shey_Monastery,infoaddict,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Moderatley Interesting,"This place is on the way to Thiksey, so you will no doubt stop here. It's interesting in it's own way, but it won't become a highlight of your trip."
2,Shey_Monastery,Debashis D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Nice view all around,We visited this monastery while doing the Leh circuit in June 2016. Overall a scenic monastery and a chance to experience the local culture and life.
3,Shey_Monastery,Tenzin B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Pilgrimage place to visit.,I usually visit with my family during festival. You can find beautiful sceneric views surrounded by mountains. There are hotels nearby and a picnic spot where people usually spent their leisure time with family and friends gathering.
4,Shey_Monastery,TravelDiaries_Pulkit,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016,Just another monstery,"In the land of monasteries, this might not stand out. The views from the top of the monastery is good and soothing. The climb can be a little tiring but can be included in the itinerary. "
5,Shey_Monastery,huys25,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,"Combination of ongoing restauration, palace ruins and temples","Every monastry is different from others and in that respect interesting. Here the front facade was largely restored, but inside are a number of empty and dusty rooms, still requiring repairs, windows and interior decoration.The palace section on the right-hand side above the monastry is totally in ruins. The second and higher part is difficult to access, and we did not climb up there.When we were leaving a monk came walking up the stairs. We asked him if he was opening the temple. When he said he was, we and all other tourist went after him to visit the 17 m high Bouddha. We could not see anaything from the alleged jewels."
6,Shey_Monastery,Sharmistha M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Family,Nice one,This monastery is usually visited by all tourists during Leh city tour. Little elevated & will get a glimpse of living style of the lamas. there is a big buddha idol on the higher floor from backside.
7,Shey_Monastery,Sunny S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,A very average place to see,"It is basically a palace, in which a small monastery is built, you will have around 280 degree from this palace, it has a beautiful statue of Budha but apart from this nothing special."
8,Shey_Monastery,anjsha0953,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,Good,"Its a nice monastery, since I'm a birder so I visited the marshes to locate along with the monastery."
9,Shey_Monastery,Review314159,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Very Impressive panorama,Shey palace lying a little above Manali Highway near Leh offers a most impressive panorama of the green Indus valley an the surrounding mountains. Its worth to have a stop there.
