0,Sindhu_Ghat,Adarsh Venkatesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,Good way to spend the day to acclimatize to the altitude,Lovely spot. The water is just a little more than a stream so there is no depth at all. There is place to sit on the banks so one can sit as long as they want with their legs in the cold water of Sindhu. It does get really hot though in summers.

It was a huge disappointment. It is a relatively small river with turbid waters and the Ghat possibly built for prayers/puja. It did not mean much om me. However, you keep seeing the river almost everywhere in Ladakh region. It looks best in Garkhun area."

6,Sindhu_Ghat,Saurabh G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,"Ghat in the making, perhaps","decent place for someone to sit and dip your feet and feel the ice cold water.

You can sit on the 'ghat' (its pretty dirty though) and enjoy the view around amidst the sound of the flowing waters. We went on a cloudy day and the views created by the sand and its shadows were awesome (see pic). Take a few pics and you are done with the place.

6,Sindhu_Ghat,kanu2781,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2013 • Family,Calm and Quiet place,"Sindhu Ghat is close to leh city, it comes on the way to Thiksey and Hemis. Its got a very calm and peaceful atmosphere, there are hardly any people around except for few who wahs their cars and clothes there. The ghats have been constructed nicely , the red stone structures are attractive to look at , but thats it, theres nothing much even the water of teh great Sindhu river is not clean there, as its a ghat a small stream they have diverted. Overall its a place where you can stop for half an hour, dip your legs in the cold waters and move on. Considering its Sindhu Darshan place they could have done much more and ensured that its clean and maintained well."
7,Sindhu_Ghat,BGhosh2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Family,Oh! the romance of standing beside the Indus,"I was deeply moved by the very thought that I was standing beside that very river that was the cradle of Indus Valley Civilization, one of the 4 earliest bronze age civilizations. We sat in the wide riverbank for quite some time and I carried home a bottle of water from river Indus. Our guide-cum-driver laughed at my silliness but I was so enthralled that I could not care less."
8,Sindhu_Ghat,Anuragme,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013,Annual event at Sindhu Ghat,This is the place very near to Leh and for a close look to Sindhu (Indus) river. The place has importance that annual event is held as Sindhu Darshan. But approach to the Ghat is not properly maintained. Some construction is also going on.
9,Sindhu_Ghat,RoadTripDiaries,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Dip your feet in cold water <3,"The sindhu ghat is a little detour from the main road.. If one is looking for a spot where they can dip their feet in some icy cold water of the indus river then this is the place. Not technically a riverside , this is a ghat were usually local villagers come to wash their clothes or their cars.. The water isnt purely clean or suitable for drinking but yes it is completely refreshing when you soak your feet in the glacial waters.. A good place to lounge around and sit in the sun during the day or in the evening. Do give it a try :)"
