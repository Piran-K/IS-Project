0,Spituk_Monastery,SandeepSingh1979,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 â€¢ Friends,Small and beautiful monastery with scenic beauty,This was the second monastery that I visited in Leh. So obviously I was impressed straight away as you have a great range of view to see flights takeoff and landing.As far as monastery it was small one which you can finish in 15-20 min. You would find the Kali Mata temple inside.The surrounding scenery and I just love the landscaping and the Indus River flowing. One should surely come and visit this place when they are here in Leh

5,Spituk_Monastery,Himalayan Destination,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018,Spituk Monastery or Spituk Goompa,"Spituk is yet another interesting monastery, on the hill top near Indus about 18 kms. from Leh on Srinagar road.

It is constructed in a series of tiers with courtyards and steps. Higher up in the hill is a chamber which houses the enormous statue of goddess.

The Gompa was named Spituk (exemplary) by Rinchen Zangpo, a translator came to that place and said that exemplary religious community would rise. Initially the Gompa was run according to the Kadampa school then during the reign of king Gragspa Bumide he converted it to Gayluk Pa order.

The Dukhang Hall is the largest building and has two rows of seats running the length of the walls to a throne at the far end. Sculptures and miniature chortens are displayed on the altar. There is also a collection of ancient masks, antique arms and fine thangkas. Higher up the hill is the Mahakal Temple, containing the shrine of Vajrabhairava.

From the parking lot, one has to climb a flight of steep steps to reach the top where the Gompa is located and this can be difficult for senior citizens. We saw a giant prayer wheel on our way up. Inside the Gompa, a monk was beating a drum and chanting prayers. Apart from Buddha idol, we saw different idols of Kali Mata though the face of the goddess was covered. Locals often refer to this place as Kali Mata Mandir. Devotees have offered tetra pack fruit juice, Mazza, Coca-Cola, Oil bottles to the goddess which was quite an unique sight for us. Beautiful view of the mountains and the river flowing down the lush green valley was just mesmerizing and makes the climb worth it.

The views of the village, fields and the river are superb, The monastery itself is worth exploring though all the rooms are not always open, but the Prayer Hall is mostly accessible and beautiful. It is difficult to know if and when there are special events that mean not all rooms are open but as it is not far from town, it is worth a second visit."
5,Spituk_Monastery,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 â€¢ Couples,Great Views,"A multi-level monastery that offers breathtaking views at every bend, the 14th century Spituk Gompa is one of the prominent monasteries of the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Spituk Gompa contains both old temples and those built in the 1970s. Ancient thankas (traditional wall hangings) are preserved here, some having been taken from the Potala Palace and Lhasa after the Chinese invasion.We were confused when the locals referred to the Gompa as Kali Mata Mandir. Actually the largest temple in the monastery, standing above the other temples near the crest of the rocks is the Gonkhang. Although another name for this temple is Kali Mata, the temple is not dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, but rather to Mahakala, the fiercest Buddhist guardian divinity.The Gompa has several statues and paintings. The views of the surroundings including that of Leh Airport is marvellous. You can drive upto a certain point. There is parking space. A lot of climbing through stairs is needed to explore the place. But the experience is worth it."

3,Spituk_Monastery,surendra_chelawat,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 â€¢ Couples,Nothing special,"Having seen some good monasteries in Leh my experience with Spituk has not been great, though this is most closely located to the town. With no sign posts or stadia you are not sure in which direction you have to move. There is steel rise in gradient making it difficult to walk and climb.The lamp temple is unique but you have to travel."

The temple itself is at the top of the hill (more great views) and is made up of three small rooms. The one on the right is full of burning oil lamps and the final room has a series of large brightly coloured statues, but the main central room was my favourite as it was far more atmospheric than many larger places we visited. Worth the very short trip out of Leh I felt. "

Multiple mud-brick buildings tumble merrily down a steep hillock towards Spituk village on the Indus riverbank. The prayer hall contains yellow statue of  Buddha which is made up of copper as per the local people's tale. The steps going to the monastery are quite raw form and it seems the entire place is not maintain properly by the concerning people. On the very top of the gompa hill is a three-tiered latho (spirit shrine) and the small Palden Lamo temple hiding veiled Hindu-style deities and festival masks in an intimate rear section.Read more: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir/leh/sights/religious/spituk-gompa#ixzz4FutUm87v
8,Spituk_Monastery,llleslly,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 â€¢ Friends,Cycle there !,"The Spituk monastery is probably a short drive away but my friend and I hired some bikes and cycled there and I think that's a great way to get here. The monastery looks very impressive from the distance and when you're cycling around the nearby villages, you get to see the other side of the monastery and it's still a great view. It wasn't on my list to visit but it was on the way while cycling so I just checked it off. Not THAT impressive and nothing much to describe or write about but you could make a flying visit if you have spare time. "

0,Spituk_Monastery,Aniruddha S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Couples,Spituk an Exemplary Monastery!!,"The Spituk words means exemplary...and here you go. The ancient monastery was founded on 11th Century and it is the den of more than 100 monks. You can have a very panoramic view of Leh, from the top. You have to climb a lot of stairs to go to the top (almost a 7 storied apartment) . The location is good, one good ice cream parlour and a decent canteen is there also to tease your taste buds."
1,Spituk_Monastery,subhrashis a,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,11th century monastery that overlooks the Spituk village.,"It is the first Gelugpa, or Yellow Hat, Monastery (as opposed to the more traditional red hats from the red cap that the Buddhists of Nalanda used to wear). There is a chapel devoted to Tara and has 21 images of her in different manifestations. The upper temple is the older one. It has big idols of Vajra Bhairava, Begtse, Vaishravana, White Chintamani, Upasika, Chamundi and Shri-devi. This gompa specifically mentions that alcohol cannot be offered. If I was the god I would be offended by such restrictions!"
2,Spituk_Monastery,sophiapt,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 â€¢ Couples,ancient monastery,Its not far from Leh so totally can visit if you have couple hours nothing to do. The view from Spituk Monastery can give you an over view of Leh which is nice to see. 
3,Spituk_Monastery,guptasanjeev65,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Family,First Monastery on the list,"This is a very small monastery in terms of size and located on a hillock overlooking the Airport. One needs to climb a good number of steps in order to reach the monastery. But after a first day of complete rest for acclimatization, this climb posed no problem. One gets a good view of the airport from the monastery."
4,Spituk_Monastery,Ashok130954,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Couples,Nice and Quiet,It is very nicely placed. Steps are there in each monastery. You would love the place. You would like to sit there and spend some time to meditate.
5,Spituk_Monastery,hgsalunke,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 â€¢ Family,Beautiful,Visited Spituk Monastery during Leh local city tour. The monastery is beautiful and as good as many other monasteries in Leh.
6,Spituk_Monastery,lotusdiamond,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Family,600 years old heritage,Located at one end of the runway on the hill top is Spituk Monastery. Monastery is almost 600 years old and maintained. You need to climb stairs and buy entry ticket to visit inside. This is the place for awesome view of Leh and Runway. Just below the Monastery is located Air Force Station. I am curious to visit monasteries to know more although they all looks similar. All the idols are covered with piece of cloth and removed only once a year for 4 days in the month of Jan.  Spitiuk is famous for its 600 years old heritage nothing else. For beautiful architecture visit Hemis and Thiksey.
7,Spituk_Monastery,travellertrail6,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Friends,Old monastery with a great view,"Like most other monastries, the Spituk Monastery is situated atop a hill. We visited this one on way to leh from the gurudwara. The monastery is about 600 years old and quite well kept and offers some lovely views of leh and the airstip around. I have a curiosity for monastries so i don't mind peeking into each monastery even though they may appear similar."
8,Spituk_Monastery,drkaushikmandal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Couples,Worth visiting........,"Spituk Gompa is a nice monastery close to the city, which is worth visiting at least for those who love photography. The monastery is as usual like a prototype Buddhist monastery, with nothing much to discuss except its age, but the view is spectacular from this place."
9,Spituk_Monastery,ANILJOHAR,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 â€¢ Family,Spituk Monastery,Spituk Monastery is also good as all the monastery is same with different architecture. If you are interested to see the monastery than you can visit but if you have seen Thiksey than it is your choice to visit here also.

2,Spituk_Monastery,BeingNomad,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 â€¢ Couples,Average monastery,"Leh/Ladakh region is full of monasteries and this is one of them. The place is quite close to leh and can be visited during the time you are acclimatizing yourself.Must See: The temple at the top of the hill, airstrip/airport with flights taking off/landing constantly, provides a good view of the Leh city"
3,Spituk_Monastery,travel_ticker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Family,Nice place,Nice monastery and quite near to the city. The temple complex is very nice and the monastery gives a very nice view of the KBR Airport

5,Spituk_Monastery,Begaraaj S M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Solo,Stupendous Spituk !!!,"I went to Leh on 24th April 2016, same day after 2hours of rest I started my tour and went straight to Hall of Fame, but it was closed for renovation, so I went to this wonderful monastery, the location was top class with the view of the Leh airport runway, in fact the 360* views from this place is awesome.Must visit for all age groups since it's located very close to the city, Kali mandir is very famous in this monastery and we can see some beautiful statues, I took some fabulous photos and videos to cherish.Happy travelling ...Enjoy !!!"
6,Spituk_Monastery,Kaneth25341,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Friends,Close to the airport with chances of seeing landing planes,"Its located on a hill near the airport's runway which makes it very easy, and probably the best place to watch planes landing or taking off as planes will pass above the short diverting road to the monastery. There's a sign that said photos of the military area is strictly prohibited but I find that really hard to comply if one were to take photos of Leh from there. The monastery offers 360 degrees of view which were enjoyable. The distance from Leh makes it a must visit and can be done it less than an hour."
7,Spituk_Monastery,yogindery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Couples,giant statue of Kali,"Spituk Monastery in Leh district, Ladakh, northern India, 8 kilometres from Leh. It was founded by Od-de, the elder brother of Lha Lama Changchub Od in the 11th Century. Founded as a Red Hat institution, the monastery was taken over by the Yellow Hat sect in the 15th century. The monastery contains 100 monks and a giant statue of Kali which is only unveiled to the public during the annual Spitok festival. Every year the Gustor Festival is held at Spituk."

9,Spituk_Monastery,ShubH GhosH,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 â€¢ Friends,January Festival for the Goddesses View,"Located on the farther side of the airport at a vantage point overlooking the Leh airport, this place is steeped in local culture, history and spiritualism. The monastery is co-located with Kali Mata Mandir. Of course you cant view the goddesses except if you manage to visit in first week of Jan. The screen is removed and you can view the large demonic deities. Its mesmerising amidst all the chantings. A cultural show is organised by the monks to celebrate this special occassion. The seamless enmeshing of the two religions rightly strengthen the unity of godhood. So if you can plan well, are strong and brave and enjoy adventure to the extreme-- Do visit this Monastery in winters"
