3,Stakna_Monastery,Arunverma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Monastery ,"I visited the monastery alone last year. The Stakna monastery lies at a distance of 25 Kms from Leh on the left bank of the river Indus. The monastery formed part of the one of the many religious estates offered to the great scholar saint of Bhutan called Chosje Jamyang Palkar in about 1580 AD by the Dharmaraja Jamyang Namgial who had invited him to Ladakh. The monastery was built on a hill shaped like a tiger nose  and so its name was given as Stakna (Tiger nose). The most important image in the monastery is that of the sacred Arya Avaloketesvara from Kamrup (Assam). There are about 80 monks in residence. The successive reincarnation of the Stakna Tulku act as the incumbents the monastery and they continue to fulfil the fine responsibility of upholding the teachings of the Dugpa order. The branch monasteries attached to Stakna are those of Mud and Kharu and that of Stakrimo, Bardan and Sani in Zanskar."
4,Stakna_Monastery,Gourav99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Couples,A short ride from Leh,"A short ride from Leh usually takes about 30-45 mins, the view from the top of the Monastery is absolutely amazing . The Monastery is built on a hill and the road is made up of small and big rocks so its quite tricky to ride but quite a bit of fun as well.We didn't really explore the Monastery much just enjoyed the pristine views all around it. The ride till the Monastery is also fun and the picture you see as the destination picture is about 4 kms further on the Highway right next to river Indus, should got there as well after visiting the Monastery.IF U LIKED MY REVIEW OR THINK ITS HELPFUL PLZ CLICK THE ""THANK"" BUTTON BELOW AND LETS KEEP SHARING OUR STORIES Have a Safe n Fun Trip GuysIf any questions feel free to Message me and I'll assist you."
5,Stakna_Monastery,918John,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,A jewel in a beautiful setting,"Stakna Monastery is dramatically perched on a conical outcrop. The sight of it as one approaches is striking and very photogenic. It is a small, compact monastery and has a serene atmosphere. Usually one of the monks is on duty to show visitors around. There is a Prayer Hall and several small rooms where old artifacts, statues and holy scriptures are stored and displayed. The paintings in the one room are very old and not well lit to protect them, so having a small torch handy is useful. The views from the roof are spectacular. As this is a small monastery, it can be combined with a visit to either Thiksey or Matho monastery."
6,Stakna_Monastery,Zwillingsseele,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Solo,Just a small gompa,"The location of this small gompa is just spectacular in a valley of the Indus river surrounded by mountains.

9,Stakna_Monastery,Kotnala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017,Miss it at your own risk,This is not on the regular route.

2,Stakna_Monastery,infoaddict,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Much Overlooked,"Stakna, for us, was a worthwhile trip after Thiksey. hardly anyone visits here and we had the place to ourself. A lovely monk gave us a personal guided tour of all the temples.The views also are lovely"
3,Stakna_Monastery,huys25,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Interesting gompa with several temples.,"Because there were ony three other visitors, the resident monk took us around the three different temples, one of them which is normally not open. He explained a number of details as well as special artefacts that were exhibited here.Interesting was that some deteriorated wall paintings were meticulously restored, while some other paintings that were too much damaged were not touched. Luckely they had not repainted these in poor quality.At the end of the tour we received an apple from the monk."

2,Stakna_Monastery,Kaneth25341,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,Best interior and well-located,"Its a small monastery compared to most places, but for me it has the nicest interior which is colorful and quaint. I was there when the monks were having a praying session, so I decided not to enter the praying room even though my guide said it was ok. I which I could go up to the rooftop to see the view it I wasn't allowed. I would say it is best to view Stakna Monastery on a rod from direction of Hemis so one could skip this if on a limited time for more famous places like Thiksey but should at least stop for photos from the road from Hemis direction."
3,Stakna_Monastery,rshweta189,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,One of the great monastery,"The monastery was so named because it was built on a hill, which is shaped just like a tiger's nose."

9,Stakna_Monastery,CorneliaS2,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Friends,Nice monastery! ,"Stakna is a small, quiet monastery,  not crowded and usually not many people visit it, because they prefer the Thiksey -Hemis-Shey-Trip. But Stakna is worth the visit!  It lies on top of a hill and you spot it easily."
0,Stakna_Monastery,akshattyagi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015,Stunning,"The view and location is wow, like all monasteries  in leh it is a steep climb ,many tourists give it a miss as it is close to leh. The meandering river and the hill provide and excellent photo op."
1,Stakna_Monastery,Freelander270,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Interesting,Not many people come here but it is worth a visit. The road crosses the Indus over a narrow bridge that allows barely one vehicle at a time. The views from the monastery are terriffic - one can see the Thiksey monastery from there. The statues of the three Buddhas within is especially interesting.
2,Stakna_Monastery,SurenKaushik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Couples,Stakna Monastery where time stays still,Stakna is around 25 kilometers from Leh . Both the drive and landscape is enjoyable. The view from the hill top is enchanting. This is a small monastery and by road one has to drive and cross over a wooden bridge suspended by iron ropes. The Monastery per se is not anywhere near the grandeur of some of the big monasteries of Ladakh. Of importance is the sacred Arya Avalokitesvara statue .We met a monk who lives at the foot of the monastery . The peace of his gaze and the wrinkles on his face made a lasting impression on me and my wife.

Revered by Chose Jamyang, a Bhutanese holy person and researcher who created the religious community in the second 50% of the 16th century, this gompa is a visual showcase of the religious and social legacy of India and Buddhism. While there isn't much to see inside keeping in mind its much littler than different religious communities in the territory, it has a charging position on the slope and with the stream circling the front of it and the mountains behind it make for a staggering setting. From the top of Stakna Monastery visitors can have a striking perspective of Indus valley and waterway. There is likewise a Tathok Moonastery close-by Stakna, a fascination 50km from Leh where Guru Padmashmbhava intervened."

3,Stakna_Monastery,lesleysaxmundhamUK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,dramatic location and friendly welcome,This Gompa doesn't seem to be so well visited as some others. Shame because of there are only 2 monks left there now and the one who showed us around was outstandingly friendly and knowledgeable. The layout reminded me of a Moroccan Riayad- although all other similarities stop there. Stakna oozes antiquity and atmosphere- well worth a visit.
4,Stakna_Monastery,Soulrtip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 • Solo,Will Affect Your Mind Positively.,"Stakna Gompa appears to be an exotic location. It emanates its aesthetic power form far away.  It attracts your attention from a distance like a mysterious jewel situated on a top of a hill.It is a functional Drukpa lineage monastery, which means it is fertile ground for realization for tantric adepts and initiates. It is not geared up toward accommodation of tourists — it doesn't charge an entry fee, but relies on donations and probably wins the hearts and wallets of those who comes.To get there you need to cross a mighty Hindus river and it has a great effect of leaving something behind. The monastery is well maintained and offers a feast for a sight even for those who might not be a Dharma practitioner — the murals are very elaborate and rich in details, the ancient lineage masters statues and stupas with holy relics are on par with elegant work of arts. The energy of the space on the monastery grounds works to one's advantage as well — the backdrop is a Hindus river on one side and a Stock Kangri Massif on another provides an excellent conditions for letting go of the ordinary world — it offers a space to liberate you. Just Powerful and Positively Impressive Place!"

2,Stakna_Monastery,Angshu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,A Little Gem on the 'Tiger's Nose',"Crowning a small hillock on the right bank of the River Indus in Ladakh, Stakna Monastery or Gompa is easily accessible by road about 25 km from the town of Leh. Small but visually impressive, Stakna Monastery looms impressively just 800m across the Indus from Km449 (where Leh–Thiksey buses terminate), though the gompa’s winding access road adds another 900m. The narrow suspension bridge is just wide enough for small taxi-vans. The name, 'Stakna' literally means 'tiger's nose'. The monastery was so named because the outcrop on which it stands is shaped like a tiger's nose. Stakna belongs to the Drugpa Buddhist sect and was founded by Chosje Jamyang Palkar in 16th century, the great scholar saint of Bhutan. Inside the Gompa, four rooms with vivid new Tantric murals are worth a visit. Behind the main prayer hall, smaller shrines which still has the 400+ year old sandalwood statues, original frescoes and statuettes of the Bhutanese lamas who founded the monastery. Climb to Stakna's roof to get a fantastic 360-degree breathtaking view of the Indus valley including the view of the Thiksey Monastery.Visited June 2011"
