0,Stok_Kangri,Nick B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,When brothers unite,"Climbed it this summer with my 3 close cousins. This one ticks all the boxes, scenic beauty, challenging , amazing people on the trail and more. We heard it may close down for a bit on account of ecological damage so if you do manage to go please respect the mountain. Do not underestimate it though, it is on the boundary between trekking and climbing and altitude speaks for itself. We got rain lower down and snow from base camp onwards so made the last section technical with use of ropes and crampons etc. the summit ridge is steep and exposed and tricky  under snow and ice, so you need to be comfortable with at least a class 3 scramble. Summit day is also long with 1200 meters to climb and you need to summit early morning if snowed in or you turn back. Little objective danger though I. E no hanging seracs etc. I suggest the Stok la route which is prettier and longer and much better for acclimatising as you cross a 4900 meter pass and descend ahead of climbing. Take the time to acclimatise well or you will suffer and hate it on summit day. Overall truly amazing and also keep a few days for Leh and surrounds as this is a culturally fascinating area."

3,Stok_Kangri,Mohit M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Stok Kangri summit trek,"Done stok Kangri trek in Aug 2019. Stok Kangri peak located at ladakh at an altitude of 6153 mtrs and is a hotspot for trekkers.The trek starts from Stok village located approx 25 kms from leh town. Very beautiful trek with variety of landscapes. The trek leads from stok village to chang ma, mankorma and stok kangri base camp. Acclimatization is the key factor for this trek. One needs to get proper acclimatize before and during the trek to complete it. The trek grade is moderate to difficult. the day of the summit is very challenging and the trek is of difficult level. Having a rest day/training day is good a base camp before attempting the summit. for summit one needs to start the trek midnight around 12:00. If snow will be there one needs crampons, harness and ropes to climb.The view from the summit is amazing with kang yatse peak, karakoram ranges, mountains at tibet all are visible. I loved the experience of this trek and able to make the summit."

5,Stok_Kangri,SujanAzadParikh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,A great mountaineering expedition,"Stok Kangri is a perfect place for novice mountaineers. Not much technical, but still quite challenging, an expedition to this peak can be considered as an initial test before going on to capture higher and more difficult mountains. But that doesn’t mean Stok Kangri is a cakewalk. This mountain stands at an altitude of 20,128 feet (6,135 meters), the trek still requires great mental and physical stamina. The breathtaking scenery throughout the trip does make all the hard work worth it in the end. Try the eight-day expedition from Adventure Nation to see the best of Stok Kangri."

8,Stok_Kangri,Rajesh Kumar Rabiya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Stok Kangri winter expedition and tracking,"Stok Kangri is the highest peak in the Stok range of Himalayas. It's about 6153meters. This is world's highest trackable peak. This is really good tracking peak in summer but in winter it's become some technical and difficult to climb. Those who are doing above 8000 meter above peak they preferably doing Stok Kangri winter expedition. It is situated in Hemi's reserve area. For this you have to go to Stok village from Leh by road. Tracking start from Stok village. You can reach Mankorma base camp in one day, you may set advance base camp to next day. for summit you have to cross one glacier which have found crevasses, you have to ropeup to cross over. It's really so good and amazing experience."

The peak is located in Hemis National Park, at 6153 metre (20187 ft) above sea level. The trek starts from the stok village which is roughly 20km from main city Leh. The whole trek passes through the barren grey landscape of Ladakh Range. You will reach the base camp. From there you had to trek for almost 5-6 hours to reach the summit. The route will take you through multiple glaciers and steep slopes until you reach the top.. Must do trek if you like adventure.. "
