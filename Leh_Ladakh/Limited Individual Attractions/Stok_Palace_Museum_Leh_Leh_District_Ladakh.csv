Try climbing slowly if you are not properly acclimatised .Else one may experience dizziness and breathlessness .It is a well maintained property . It gives a glimpse of the royal life with their traditional costumes ,  ornate crowns and jewellery , decor, kitchen area, prayer rooms etc . Photos of the members of royal family and several celebrities including Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, Smt Indira Gandhi , Jackie Chan adorn the walls . It houses around 30 Thangkas (Sooth Paintings -more than 400 year old) which was the highlight for me.

One cannot go inside this palace to view the insides. (since nothing is maintained in here). There was a small temple above the palace, one can take stairs adjacent to the palace and view it.

1,Stok_Palace_Museum,Nilma S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,average,"The Stok palace has no gradeur of a palace, either in architecture or interiors. There is not much to see other than the view from the top. The temple is the only place worth a visit. It could be given a skip if you have seen the Potala Palace in Lhasa as this is a poor copy of it on the same style of architecture. All in all there is nothing Royal about the Palace."
2,Stok_Palace_Museum,thejas r,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Good for visiting Tibetian history,We spent a lot of time here and enjoyed seeing this palace. Must have been tough to bring the construction items to build this. Amazing architecture.

It is a small museum with intriguing collection of Buddhist art, weaponry, coins, seals, thangka paintings, other items from the royal household, but the best of the lot are Queen's ceremonial jewellery and ceremonial headgear of the rulers.How to Reach: Sharing Auto is available from LEH market. Otherwise you can go by booking cab anyway."

A perfect retreat in the valleys, rooms are available ( on request ) for staying.

Some floors and rooms have been converted into a museum with memorabilia of the Royals of Ladakh, and some descendants still live in the Palace. there is a nice restaurant in the ground floor, serving piping hot, but Continental cuisine..no surprises !! Terraces offer a beautiful view of the palace behind and the nearby landscape."

Shows the history and living of the ladakhi royals. Lots of Thangka paintings, weapons and wares used by the royal family, photographs of the royals, a small temple, make up this museum. Among all the monasteries on your itinerary, this is the only palace you will visit, if you take out Shey palace, where no one lives, per se. So include it in your plan. "

5,Stok_Palace_Museum,Arunverma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,A must visit ,"I  visited Stok Palace and museum last year with my family. It was a pleasure drive from our Hotel in Leh to this place. It was an unforgettable experience. , built by King Tsespal Tondup Namgyal in 1825, in the present times is the residential palace of the royal descendants of King Sengge Namgyal. The architecture of this palace is a perfect mix of the traditional and the contemporary architectural styles. This palatial property consists of a number of beautiful gardens as well as a library that has around 108 volumes of the Kangyur (a collection of teachings of Lord Buddha). The palace is located around 15 kms away from the main city of Leh.This Museum has one of the best panaromic views on the Valley from its terrace. This Palace and Museum is partially open for Visitors. And I was not allowed to take photos. On the whole very eye opening trip though we could not meet the royalty "
6,Stok_Palace_Museum,Parag P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Couples,Beautifule preserved old Ladakhi heritage.,A MUST go for people to know ancient Ladakhi history.Its full of nice numismatic stuff that would be rare to find anywhere else.For Non-Indians its a good thing to know about ANCIENT INDIA.
7,Stok_Palace_Museum,Tyche75,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Solo,Odd but worthy museum,"Perhaps because the museum is within the royal palace (still occupied by royals), when you visit it, you are basically led around by an attendant.  This can be helpful if you have questions about some items, such as the queen's crown (a very elaborate item!), but it can also feel a bit stifling.  I found the items within to help me better understand some of the history I had read about Ladakh."
8,Stok_Palace_Museum,Shailesh_cs3,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Add it to your itinerary if not already,"We added this to our itinerary late as we changed some other travel plan. This Palace is actually the residence of the descendants of the Royal Family. We were excited to visit this but alas it was not open for the season yet and would be open in a couple of days – should be open by now for sure (check). If so, its worth visiting to see how royalty at Leh stay in the palaces :). A nice cafe at the entrance with a grand view of the STOK range to enjoy.. have a coffee/ tea and soak it in.Next to the palace you will see a ~70 feet High seated Gautama Buddha statue and temple, constructed and consecrated by HH the 14th Dalai Lama in 2016. A visit is warranted to just view the magnanimity of statue and the view from this."
9,Stok_Palace_Museum,Gavin R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,If your lucky you could meet royalty,"First of we weren't lucky enough to meet the Royal family, however the palace was worth seeing.

0,Stok_Palace_Museum,Vinay K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Historical building,The building is quite old and required maintenance but i would say it is one of the photogenic places with a nice scenic beauty but the ticket to the museum is on higher side which is not worth. Ticket was around Rs 100Overall a good place

3,Stok_Palace_Museum,Ashwini K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016,Amazing 360 degree views on the Valley,"This Museum has one of the best 360 Degree views on the Valley from its terrace. This Palace/Museum is partially open for Visitors. Precious artifacts and relics related to Ladakh's old monarchy are well-preserved in this museum, which particularly attract historians and anthropologists. Ancient coins, royal seals, regal costumes, precious jewelry and photographs are also displayed here. This palace museum has a separate room for exhibiting the warfare equipment of Ladakh's kingdom, where people can see an impressive assortment of swords, shields, bows, arrows, quivers and guns. In simple words, the Stok Palace Museum is a place where visitors get familiarized with the splendid heritage of this Himalayan kingdom."

8,Stok_Palace_Museum,Subha S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Avarage Palace,Stock Palace is an average Palace. Nothing great to see. The  entry ticket is very Pricey and most of the places inside are not open to visitors. We cannot also click pictures at most of the places.
9,Stok_Palace_Museum,Debanjan587,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,Don’t visit,Do not waste time. It is not a palace. It is a very low graded museum with entry fee Rs 70.00 per head. Only attraction of the place is wide angle view of beautiful stock village from top which you may observe outside the museum.   
0,Stok_Palace_Museum,huys25,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,The museum is rather special but no photo's allowed.,"The whole building is well maintained because people live in it. The museum is in the top floor, while the royal family lives in the floor below.The topfloor seemed to be very accomodating as living  quarters in the summer period, and is organised as a museum, having a large number of very interestng articles.From the various musea we have seen in the Ladakh region, this is certainly one of the best and worthwhile the short trip from Leh."

4,Stok_Palace_Museum,Nitin S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Boring museum with nothing explained,"This is a place which you can skip without losing anything. It takes time and effort to reach anywhere in Leh and hence an itinerary should include the best places, which this is certainly not.The museum is about 4-5 rooms having items of Ladakhi culture, but nothing is explained, except some random notes. The sole attendant tells little about the articles and their significance to the culture.Didn't visited restaurant as it was closed that time"
5,Stok_Palace_Museum,Giulio1412,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,"Worth visiting, decently arranged","Quite better kept than Shey, and not only because the royal family is still owning part of it. The museum inside is worth visiting, it’s an interesting display of Ladakh history and religion. Less visitors seem to appreciate it than Shey, probably since it is not on the main road, but it is definitely more worth seeing. Beautiful is the inner courtyard with a coffee shop, with tables arranged along the parapet, overlooking the valley."

It has a entry fee of Rs.70 per person. It allows you tour some 5-6 rooms displaying the Ladakhi culture. What i liked was the restaurant setting, Sitting along the wall with the butter tea and views aplenty was one of my best moments on the trip."
4,Stok_Palace_Museum,guptasanjeev65,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,A living palace,"The Stok Palace was last on our itinerary while returning to Leh after a visit to Pangong Lake. The Palace is situated at a distance from the Leh-Manali highway. There is a fee of Rs. 70 for entrance to the palace. The palace was buit around 200 years ago and the descendants of the royal family still live in the major portion of the palace. A few rooms on one of the floors are open to public for displaying the photographs, dresses, utensils and miscellaneous items related to the royal family. Photography is strictly banned inside. Certainly worth a visit."

0,Stok_Palace_Museum,Pavan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,Not a total waste of time..,Leh already has less places to visit. So this place adds to the small local sight seeing list. It's a palace cum museum. Tells a great deal about ladhaki people and their history. It won't take you more than 30mins to tour the entire palace.
1,Stok_Palace_Museum,Travel_amazingly_007,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Okay! ~Amazing,"Its worth a visit if you're a royal family enthusiast they have a lot of information about the Royal family how they lived, etc etc... But the part that is amazing is that right across the museum is a cafe that has a just unbeatable view, perhaps one of the best in Ladakh. Sunset over there is probably to die for if you're not a trekker..."

3,Stok_Palace_Museum,VivekH,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Fascinating glimpse into Ladakh history,We stayed at the palace so were fortunate to be guided around the museum by our host. It's a small museum but has a good collection of tankhas and a fairly diverse collection of interesting artefacts.
4,Stok_Palace_Museum,nikrang,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Couples,lovely insight,"Quaint, authentic and gives a very good insight into daily life in the bygone days. The kitchen and Thanks room in particular are note worthy places to spend time in . Dont forget to see the old photos in a verandah at the rear."
5,Stok_Palace_Museum,subhrashis a,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,Known for antique Thankas,"This palace is known for antique Thankas - handmade painting of gods and religious bodies on cloth using natural rock colour, including gold. Some of them are the oldest paintings in the region. Apart from that there is a royal palanquin, kings armoury (which was very primitive, like wooden bow and arrow), king and queen’s crown, wooden royal throne and jewelries.  Some of the jewelries are studded with turquoises- a precious stone from Tibet. Turquoises are more expensive than gold, and as per Ladakhi custom it is given by bride's family to the bride during marriage. There is a Chorten or stupa, made in the memory of someone from the royal family. The museum also has 500 year old measuring instruments, locks etc. Apart from the museum there is a temple containing lots of idols - Hayagriva, White Tara, Green Tara and Amitavus. Hiyagriva literally means 'having neck of a horse'. He is the yaksha attendant of Avalokiteshvara . His special ability is to cure skin diseases. Tara is born from the tears of Avalokiteshvara as he saw the sufferings of the universe . Green Tara protects devotees from danger while White Tara gives longevity, merit and wisdom. There are other small sections as well, like the royal kitchen, etc. The Royal family still stays here. In case you wonder, they are in no mood to meet you."

8,Stok_Palace_Museum,Avijitsen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,"Lovely visit, would love to come back and stay in the Heritage rooms of the Hotel.","Along with the Museum it is also the residence of the Tibetan Royal family. Additional they have converted some rooms into a Heritage hotel. Firstly the Museum is small but gives us a view of the tibetan Royalty and how they used to live in the earlier periods.We requested to view the hotel room and were lucky enough to be shown the rooms by the Manager. I would highly recommend the property as its simply awesome from inside. Although u have some tough and narrow climbs, but once inside the room, its quite luxurious. The best part is the room is of heritage style but the bathrooms are completely modern. They also have a small restaurant, where the views are magnificent."
9,Stok_Palace_Museum,Joe D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Solo,"Very interesting, but a little small",The museum area that is open to the public is very interesting. Some prior knowledge of the history of Ladakh is important if you want to get the most out of this particular place. There are some amazing views over Stok and Choglamsar from the cafe (and excellent bod ja (Tibetan tea) for those with a taste for it. It does close for lunch so time your visit carefully. If you are in the area I would definately reccomend visiting.
0,Stok_Palace_Museum,Umesh C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,A little bit of a let down,A little out of the way. Rs 70 ticket. Closed for lunch at one to two are minor irritants. Its a very small museum.  Can be avoided if one gets access to similar material closer to center of town
1,Stok_Palace_Museum,lotusdiamond,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Nothing great,Away from the city located at a drive of almost an hour or so. Privately owned palace and museum.Owned by former King of leh .Nothing great or interesting inside the Museum except few old utensils used by king. Very small palace. But the palace is well maintained. Small restaurant with beautiful sitting area on the terrace with awesome view.  You need to visit this place specially off the main road. In case you are short of time this place can be avoided . Nothing great.
