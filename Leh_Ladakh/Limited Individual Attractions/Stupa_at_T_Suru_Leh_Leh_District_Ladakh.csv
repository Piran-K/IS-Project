1,Stupa_at_T_Suru,Peregrineri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Don't go out of your way,"I believe this is the largest stupa in Ladakh and it is a historical place. It's under the supposed protection of the Archeological Survey of India and theoretically closed to the public for now. However, the fence is broken in one or two places, so anyone can walk right in with no problem. No one was there when I went.It's quite an old stupa, and because it's crumbling they've plastered the stupa walls. There's some graffiti, and no way to go in. You can only walk around it. The location is peaceful, with nice views of the mountains."
