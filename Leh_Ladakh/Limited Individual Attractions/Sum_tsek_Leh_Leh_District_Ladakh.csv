0,Sum_tsek,Dalbir_S_Virdi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Amazing Wood carvings and paintings,Sum-tsek is one of the main temples inside Alchi Monastery. Photography is not allowed inside the temple. Exterior of the Temple has beautiful wood carvings and depicts Lord Buddha in different forms. Inside the Temple is huge statue of Lord Buddha  extending to 2nd floor of the structure and almost reaching the roof which is open to sky and natural light falls on the statue. Couldn't make out if the opening on the top of the structure is covered with glass or any other transparent sheet to protect the artifacts.

We liked the beautiful wooden carvings at the temple entrance and inside we saw 3 giant idols of Lord Buddha depicting his different incarnations - Bodhisatva, Maitreya and Manjushree. This temple is definitely one of the best inside the Alchi monastery complex. Entrance fee is there for this temple."

1,Sum_tsek,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 • Family,Must visit temple in Alchi,"This is the first temple that you see as you enter the Alchi monastery complex. It is three storied building with an elaborate beautifully carved wooden facade. This is the only temple in whole :Ladakh where you can see such exquisite wood work from the 11th century.Photography is not permitted insiide. To protect the centuries old murals, illumination is dim. So do carry torch to see the murals and to appreciate the art. Look out for the mural of world famous green tara near the Bodhisattva on the left.It will help if you can hire a guide from the Alchi village to explain the murals and the images."
