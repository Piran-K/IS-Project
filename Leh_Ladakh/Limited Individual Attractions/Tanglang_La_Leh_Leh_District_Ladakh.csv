1,Tanglang_La,Indiabyroad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Like a roof of the World Indeed ...,"A Request before the Review- In the Service and Our Gratitude to the BRO and the Labourers who keep the road in pitch condition in such difficult living conditions- PS: Offer some edible/snacks items and drinking water to those people who you see working here ...I have realized it after I have interacted with the labourers a couple times about the difficulty and their inability to stock sufficient food due to various factors- few are - high and dry landscape, extreme working conditions, nearest proper market and shops available at Kharu (almost 90 Kms away)  and their financial barrier and expenses incurred to usually buy and stock food and water . Such genneroua offers may cost you nothing but means a lot to them - maybe a packet or two of biscuits, snacks items , bottle of water etc which otherwise would not be needed by you once you reach your destination ..A beautiful drive and an unimaginable scenic place to see .... The roads on either side has been kept in excellent condition by our BRO Team and their workforce .. It's a great place but usually travellers skip it only because on the way to Leh - travellers are anticipating more to reach Leh ASAP and evade acclamatizarion issues . While travelling from Leh towards Manali- they are in hurry to cover up the lap to reach their destination ASAP ... "

I can say, most of the peak are alike, but no harm to stop and snap a photo. Really enjoy my journey in Kashmir (srinagar and ladakh). Spectacular view."
8,Tanglang_La,Ashish Dugar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 â€¢ Solo,Best riding experience amongst the high passes of Leh/Ladakh,"Taglangla undoubtedly has the best roads if you want to compare khardungla, changla, baralacha, nakeela, etc etc. Hence, the ride comfort is much much better in comparison. No compromise on the view and nature that you can see around.However, do not plan to stay to long at the peak (5-10 mins max), due to air pressure and lack of oxygen. I personally experienced more breathlessness at taglangla in comparison with khardungla, even though, khardungla is marginally higher altitude."

Road from Here on till Leh was awesome!!  I am glad that I was able to reach Leh well on time as there was a time when I was thinking that we will have to halt some where on the way but it was because of desire to see and cross Thanlangla during day light made me concentrate and I kept going!! But do carry Oxygen,  even the fittest of you can start feeling dizzy and showing signs of AMS!! We made it to Leh on time and Crossed Thanlangla during day light,  thanks to all my co-travellers, my SafariDicor and More Plains :-)!! Regards, Narinder Kohli (PicMyNature) "

Even if one doesn't go to Tso Moriri or Tso Kar, it is worth going to this pass.

2,Tanglang_La,SoboRay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Couples,Amazing,The approach to Tanglang La on the Leh-Manali highway was much easier than Khardung La or Chang La. There is a small cafe at the top. But be careful as you the altitude might get you dizzy!
3,Tanglang_La,Anmol m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Family,Cool la to pass compared to others,We passed this pass while our way from Leh to Manali. This pass was pretty straighforward with well mettled road. Chilly winds were apparent as we are 17K+ ft above sea level.
4,Tanglang_La,prasi_in,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Friends,An awesome drive through snow and fog.,This is the best route to drive your vehicle . The road is nice and smooth and the view of the snow clad mountains just outside your window is mesmersing. Its really a drive for a lifetime. If mountain sickness does not bother you then this is the road to drive .
5,Tanglang_La,tentse07,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017,high and cold,gotta wear a cap or hat at this altitude or it'll leave you with a bad headache later. the place itself is pretty cool
6,Tanglang_La,Achin K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Couples,Freezing cold and Winds,"We passed this pass while coming from Manali to Leh via Jispa. We faced the coldest winds here at this pass. With temperature of around 0 degrees, it was very difficult to be at this pass. We could hardly stay for 8-10 photos before we got into the car again :)Since we came from Manali, we saw Rohtang pass as well. Tanglang La pass is much better than Rohtang pass and has a lot cleaner and fresh ice."
7,Tanglang_La,Rajm133,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Family,Smoothest pass to negotiate,"Although the pass is at a height of 17600 feet, it is the only one with proper road access, and therefore easiest to cross. the Khardungla and changla passes approach is Kuccha, rocky, slippery roads, and therefore it was a pleasant surprise."
8,Tanglang_La,AbhikomPatna,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 â€¢ Friends,Thanks to Our Army,We were here with friends and our car got stucked in snow strom. We were standing at same place for more than 5 hrs and all cloths which we use to think are best became useless. Oxygen level is low there and if travelling 3-4 people always buy big cylinder of oxygen.
9,Tanglang_La,Keshav S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 â€¢ Couples,A step below the top of the world.....,"Th second highest motorable pass, this is on the Leh-manali highway. It is a windy and cold place with the usual temple and pennants that are a part of every pass. The roads are very well maintained but the place is usually deserted as people only stop there for a photo-op on the way or while returning from Leh. Excellent all round view and a deep sense of achievement lingers after you cross. Take some time to stop and appreciate the efforts that go into maintaining the place."

1,Tanglang_La,anjan_mukherjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 â€¢ Family,excellent place,"while coming back from Pangong lake we crossed this place , quite high altitude , off beat place to visit "
2,Tanglang_La,Jaison J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Couples,Awesomess !!!,"It's the third highest motorable road. Its place worth taking a stop and clicking few pics. Needless to say even at 4.00 evening when we reached there it was chilling cold there. Unfortnately for me my health didn't allow me to enjoy this place. The second day of the travel after trouble in Sarachu, I had gastric issues. I believe the low pressure in atmosphere affects the gastric performance."
3,Tanglang_La,Travelohollic,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 â€¢ Family,"""From the Greens to the Sands""",The lush greens suddenly start disappearing after one crosses the Rohtang Pass which is the first pass on Manali - Leh highway. The Tangling La is the second highest motorable road in the world & leads the traveller from lush greens to dry arid landscape of Leh. 
4,Tanglang_La,Streetbob79,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Friends,On top of the world,The Tanglang-la pass is encountered on the Manali Leh highway. The views are spectacular but that is true in case of this entire mountainous area. I guess visiting this pass would be more of a test of stamina and a sense of achievement rather than any particular disitinguishing feature present here.
5,Tanglang_La,Ritu A A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 â€¢ Friends,Do stop and get clicked here!,It may not be the second highest motorable pass in the world but it surely is within India. Definitely a stop and look place!
6,Tanglang_La,shashindrak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 â€¢ Solo,A PROUD MOMENT FOR EVERY TRAVELLER,"Visiting Ladakh is a life time achievement , that too by road completing Manali -Leh & Leh -Srinagar circuit. this requires tremendous  strong will power.Both the routes are very challenging as one has to cross many mighty passes.From Manali side to reach Leh one has to cross 5 mighty passes, Rohtang La, Baralachha La,  Naki la, Lachang La & TANGLANG LA.Breathing problem grips every traveler during entire trip.From lush green Manali to snow capped mountains up to Baralachha La & after that slowly turning into barren cold desert .I am lucky  to visit this wonderland thrice. Twice by road from Manali side & ending at Srinagar. The highest  motorable  Pass from both side is TANGLANG LA about 375 kms from Manali & 115 kms from Leh. Immense beauty Of Grater Himalayan rivers,mountain peaks,glaciers, lakes,amazing creations of nature can be seen & all this make you addicted.I was lucky to cross this mighty pass TANGLANG LA (+5300 meters) 3rd time while I was coming back from Tsomoriri, Kyagar tso via Tsokar traversing Rupsu plateau. So i can boost that I have seen almost entire beauty of Ladakh. At Tanglang La for any breathing problem army medical facility is available.One should avoid moving fast on all such passes.I will advise all the traveler & nature lovers to visit Ladakh by road at least once but with strong will power & proper acclimatization .Minimum +15 days are needed for this memorable visit."
7,Tanglang_La,AbhinavDave,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Couples,Very nice views! And less crowded.,"KhardungLa is very nice - but I liked this pass equally, if not more. This location is more open, less crowded and the views are spectacular. There is snow pretty much throughout the year if that's your thing. Good place to stop, take photos and chill for a bit."
8,Tanglang_La,Debashis D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Friends,Highest Motorable Road,"Great experience. But be careful of low oxygen problems here. Do not rush, smoke or run. Enjoyed the view and the location. "
9,Tanglang_La,Sumanth C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 â€¢ Friends,mesmerizing,The sight is simply exhilarating especially if you are driving from Manali where you would experience the first feeling of being on top of the world. 17500 ft of sheer beauty. The peaks simply seem like they are next to you and you could just walk there and touch them. This is the third highest motorable road in the world after Kardungla and Changla passes. The road leading to this pass is good and we should really thank the Border Roads for their untiring work throughout the year in upkeeping of this road
