In my view to experience the actuality of Himalayas, villages like Sumda Chun are the places to visit. It is a very beautiful village nestled in the mountains and unlike anything which urban citizens can fathom. What made this experience memorable was Mountain Homestays. I cannot hold myself but commend how wonderfully everything was organised. These homestays offer an opportunity to experience ancient art, enchanting local lifestyle, culture, adventure and culinary flavours, all bundled into one!Truly a life altering journey."

3,Temple_at_Sumda_Chun,Jason,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Solo,Unspoilt Beautiful Monastery,"Sumda Chun Monastery is over a thousand years old and contains two huge Future Buddha statues and absolutely fantastic painted stucco work. This monastery is one of the most important and beautiful early Tibetan Monasteries still surviving in Ladakh.  However, it is not easy to get to, which is probably why it has survived, requiring a trek of one to two hours up a small picturesque valley from where the road ends.The valley leading up to the monastery has a lovely mountain stream cascading through it which is also home to Himalayan Dippers.Due to recent rains the road and track to the Monastery were not in an ideal condition but this just made reaching the Monastery more worthwhile.If you are fit and enjoy visiting unique and beautiful buildings this is somewhere you should visit if you can."

This monastery is only accessible by foot since there is no road access. The buildings were restored 2008-2011 and interior artworks cleaned so it is a beautiful place to see 12th century Tibetan Buddhist temple and religious works. Restoration was done in a very sensitive manner and received an UNESCO Heritage Award. While hiking to the temple met three lovely local women who were making a pilgrimage to the site.

Great paintings,"Sumda Chun temple is a late 12th/early 13th century structure with a unique assemblage of sculptures, the only one of its kind in Ladakh.
