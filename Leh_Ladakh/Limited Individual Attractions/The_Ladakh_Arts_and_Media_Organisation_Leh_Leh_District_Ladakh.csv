0,The_Ladakh_Arts_and_Media_Organisation,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Ladakhi Culture Lesson,"LAMO is located just below the Leh Palace which means that you've to ascend a bit to reach here. When I visited, I was the only one as it was off season. The entry ticket was INR 100.The 'museum' is built in a traditional house. The first gallery had an exhibition of the early travelers to Ladakh. Further on, I got a glimpse of how locals lived in the early days in traditional houses.Be prepared to climb narrow & steep stairs even inside LAMO. In summer, the organization conducts workshops for local children. One can volunteer here too. Not a big museum but a good one to learn about Ladakhi culture & heritage.A small room in the front also sells souvenirs."

2,The_Ladakh_Arts_and_Media_Organisation,Rehman R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,You decide,"Some of us are adventures, go hiking and tracking; others are beach lovers and then some enjoys the sun on a beach. Well there is no beach but rivers, couple of lakes that's like a beach since the water is salty. But you must be sophisticated to enjoy arts. Much education can be achieved about a culture if that is where your interest is. I would visit again."

7,The_Ladakh_Arts_and_Media_Organisation,Peregrineri,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Not to be Missed!,"LAMO is located just below the palace, spread over two adjacent houses. The houses themselves are some of the best preserved traditional old houses and are beautiful and fascinating. The construction is quite amazing. They were just setting up some exhibitions to be opened the next day, so not everything was on display. If you have any interest at all in the Ladakhi culture (which I hope you do!), make this a high priority."

4,The_Ladakh_Arts_and_Media_Organisation,mzank,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,A hidden gem of architectural and artistic value,"When in Leh, don't fail to visit LAMO. The Ladakh Arts and Media Organization was founded by two women artists from Mumbai who poured their hearts and not a little money into rebuilding the historic residence of the king's chief secretary and turning it into a center for study and studio/exhibition space for local visual artists. The library is small but thoughtfully stocked especially with books on Ladakhi culture and a children's section, and its a lovely place to hang. The historical parts of the building are great examples of an old upper class old Ladakhi living space. (Closed Sundays)"

The trek was a 4 days 3 nights experience, with dinning tent, shower tent, horses to carry our luggage etc. Attention to details, quality of the food and 4 dedicated staff for us (only a couple actually) were great. The majority of the clients are French as this company is very well connected with lots of travel agencies in France. We highly recommend using Djulé adventures."

These are some of the best remaining examples of domestic vernacular architecture of the 17th Century. Munshi house was the residence of Togoche family who served as secretary in the Ladakhi court. Gyaoo house was the residence of upper rank of court artisans who performed for the king. Both the houses have been  restored by LAMO (The Ladakh Arts and Media Organisation) and converted to an arts space with galleries, offices, a library and reading room, screening room, conference room, and open-air performance site"
