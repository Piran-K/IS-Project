0,Pangong_Tso,Ali Asgar B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Diwali Trip,"We visisted Pangong Lake in October 2022 when tempratures were _8 at the lake. the lake view is mesmerising and you don't want to leave from this place. the lake has crystal clear blue waters which changes colors during morning, afternoon and evening. If you are visiting kindly take enough winter clothes as electricity is very limited so you won't get heaters for full day. also there are no electric geysers in hotels for hot water."

5,Pangong_Tso,Subhendu S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,It's a Heaven,"Exotic place. Every one should visit once in Life, those who are having very sound health. Aged person should avoid. Though I have not faced any difficulties but my wife, my sister, friends have faced problem. Oxygen Cylinders should be available with you, if you are visiting & spending night here. "
6,Pangong_Tso,Taz9,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 â€¢ Family,Beautiful experience ,"I just canâ€™t get over this place. It is peaceful, beautiful, magnificent, comforting and full of love.

9,Pangong_Tso,Sachin Mahadeshwar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Pangong Lake,"Most beautiful place in Ladakh. As suggested by a friend, do visit the place before sunset to see the Blue water. Fading light view is just awesome to see how the Blue lake turns to a black tinge. Drivers paradise. Awesome weather and really happy to see the locals taking care of the place.."
0,Pangong_Tso,Narayantravelogue,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Trip to the Paradise,Drive from Nubra to Pangong was scenic with ever changing landscape.  The first sight of Pangong Tso was just superb.  The lake as said and written in various reviews keeps changing colour as the day goes. Mountains around look majestic.
1,Pangong_Tso,Aimless Vagabonds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,"Great place to visit, think before you decide to stay the night!","Pangong Tso has slowly become one of the highlights of Ladakh, and sans doubt, it is one of the most eye pleasing destinations. Talking about a stay here- Unless you are adventurous, I would recommend doing a day trip of the Pangong Tso and not spend the night here. Being remote, you have to make do with limited water and basic food."
2,Pangong_Tso,Manik Dhodi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 â€¢ Solo,Canvas in a Canvas,"The places is beyond words. Atleast I can't fine the appropriate words in the vocabulary to describe the beauty of Pangong lake. It is like many canvases within one big canvas. The colours of sky, water, and the mountains are unbelievably beautiful and one can't just stop looking at them. I could spend hours and hours just looking around as well as listening to the sound of water and breeze. Though a 24 hrs stay is enough here, but one can spend day after days to enjoy the beauty and calm here. "
3,Pangong_Tso,Rajesh Malhotra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Paradise on Earth,"Its a most picturesque spot in the world. 130 km long lake  extending into China, surrounded with mountain rang. The color of the lake water changes with the sun giving rainbow effect..."
4,Pangong_Tso,Ruchirz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,If there is one word- its Mesmerizing,"Pangong lake is absolutely mesmerizing. Though the approach road is under construction and takes time to reach there, once you catch a glimpse of the lake, you get fixated to the surreal beauty. Clear blue sky, crystal clear waters, lovely mountains. In all an absolutely must visit"
5,Pangong_Tso,Chrisagtk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Heaven on earth,"I was on my solo bike ride. Place was just beautiful. Road trip was bit nasty because of rough road as widening road was being done so most of the road was not patched, a bumpy ride but it was worth the trip as I finally saw the lake. "
6,Pangong_Tso,Ravsh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 â€¢ Family,Ok Ok,"A mixed experience. Its a huge lake lengthwise-actually a small very small sea. Go there only if you enjoy beauty of nature, want to do meditation etc. Otherwise its just a lake. No activity at the lake except a few three idiot type activities like bum pose, scooter, ladakhi dress etc. There are numerous basic tents, cottages along the lake to stay-mostly average, lack of electricity, etc.-don't look for luxury. I would suggest at least a day's stay to enjoy the view as journey from both Leh and Nubra is 5-6 hours with some bad patches of road en-route. No shop except few restaurants. Road from Nubra along Shyok river is more beautiful, though road condition is not that good. Again travel 5-6 hours on difficult roads only if you like natural beauty."
7,Pangong_Tso,84robertantony,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,What a Lake,"Lake looks amazing when sun is out, at night, one of the clearest views of the Milky way and bright stars. all in all an unique experience "
8,Pangong_Tso,Ramesh Ramakrishnan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,What a View!,The tough journey is rewarded with a Unforgettable view of changing colours of the lake. Don't skip this place.
9,Pangong_Tso,NayantSavani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,A sight to see,A calming serene lake with changing colour as per the sun rays. With mountains on both sides this lake is just 30% within India. A lot of tents and cottages have come up in this area for tourist to stay over. There is no full time electricity and food is available in each tent area. The place get cold and is very windy. Walking on the lake path is an experience. The 3 idiots famous final scene was shot here. Some share the opinion that it could be a day return journey fro Leh. Tend to agree with that view. However the roads leading to Pangong Tso is rough. Even coming in from Nubra valley carries the risk of being blocked out if water melting its was causes the roads to become non navigating.
0,Pangong_Tso,Avinash Chandra A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 â€¢ Couples,Most Beautiful Lake one would ever see,"it was mesmerizing, as beautiful as expected. sun rise was amazing and the lake is one of the best. The journey from Nubra Valley is tiring but worth it."
1,Pangong_Tso,Sandeep,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Not Seen before,"The lake is around 5 to 6 hours journey from Hotel Grand willow, Leh. very calm, cool  soothing lake, never seen before in life."
2,Pangong_Tso,Amit Singh S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Heaven on earth is Pangong Tso,"The lake very huge with different colors at different times of the day, plan to visit in early hours as it gets chilly winds after 17:00 and one cannot stay near Pangong lake.Those who are panning to stay near this place should book accommodation in wooden cottage as normal tents won't protect you from spine chilling cold during night time.There will be no power after 22:00 so charge your electronic devices before hand or carry power banks. Moreover there will be no mobile network (Jio, Airtel or BSNL) available in this area so plan accordingly."
3,Pangong_Tso,Sanjiv Pandey,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 â€¢ Friends,Amazing place,"What a place!! One has to see it to believe it. Road from  Leh to Pangong and beyond is being widened, not that it is in very bad shape as of now. Crystal clear water, cold as ice and changing hues with every passing minute â€“ it is not easy to describe this magical lake. Accommodation here is basic because the government does not want to leave a permanent dent on the natural beauty perhaps. Tents and wooden cottages only. Our place of stay, Virgo Cottages were spic and span. Haider, the caretaker and Ajay, the cook from Jharkhand were amazing. Ajay cooked good food esp. the egg curry and Aloo ka Paratha were sumptuous. No network here. Jio works a bit at some isolated spots and of course, BSNL. Vodafone doesnâ€™t work at all in Ladakh. Govt must tell these operators to have few satellite phones to take care of any emergency."
4,Pangong_Tso,Aditya B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Scenic views like no other,"After the grueling journey from Leh to Pangong by road (which is really bad if you have motion sickness or weak back), you witness the natural beauty which makes everything worthwhile. The lake and its colors are cannot be replicated even on a canvas. Its the uniqueness which makes visiting this lake special. See it to believe it."
5,Pangong_Tso,SandeepGadgil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Superb! The lake looks blue and beautiful even when it's cloudy,This is an amazing place. Just be mindful that it can get cold and windy and can have light snowfall (enroute) even in May. So be prepared. But a must-see location
6,Pangong_Tso,vikramkanodia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Main attraction of LEH!!,"Beautiful view, worth visiting. The experience to reach there is awesome. We started early morning from Hunder and the route is amazing, army controlled, need to apply online pass before travel inside LEH"
7,Pangong_Tso,Isha G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Magical place; Ernest request to tourists to keep this place clean,"The lake is truly magical and is a natural wonder. I have seen similar lakes in new zealand, but Pangong Tso surpassed all expectations.The journey to this place is a bit hard  because some roads are broken and are being constructed again, so the ride is quite bumpy. But that's true for most places in ladakh outside leh.I stayed overnight in a camp there and could not sleep. Perhaps it was due to low oxygen level which did sometimes make me uncomfortable. But we did not need an oxygen cylinder. It is an individual preference whether to stay overnight or return the same day. we definitely did not want to travel so much same day so stayed overnight.I also want to urge tourists to keep this place as pristine as it originally is and not throw plastic bottles and chips wrappers around."
8,Pangong_Tso,thisisshail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 â€¢ Family,Amazingly beautiful - huge blue water lake,You have to see it to believe it - surrounded by mountains this blue water lake is a picture perfect destination for all ages
9,Pangong_Tso,Aka,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 â€¢ Friends,The view took my breath away..,"The view took my breath away in scenic way as well and in literal way tooâ€¦I experienced immense breathlessness at night after a meal, so itâ€™s advisable to take oxygen cylinder. This place is worth visiting once in lifetime just make sure you return safely!"
0,Pangong_Tso,travellerZ6006SK,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 â€¢ Friends,Horrible journey,Overhyped lake..treacherous journey with the world's filthiest toilets en route.Horrible roads and stray dogs all over Leh and vicinity
1,Pangong_Tso,Samrat Mitra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 â€¢ Family,LADAKH....HEAVEN OF MOUNTAINS,Just awesome...tso camps are superb in decoration as well as boarding. The rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable. The food is really good and delicious with so much variety every time. The management is also great. We kept our luggages at the hotel and it was beautifully managed by them. I would absolutely recommend anyone staying in Leh to stay in this second home and have the best homely experience away from home.
2,Pangong_Tso,Deepak_01,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Excellent magical lake & night sky full of stars,"A must visit in this sector for the serene & mesmerising lake.The vibrant green-blue turquoise colours of the water is truly amazing.The lake looks endless with picturesque mountains on the other side.The shooting spot with yellow scooters & multi coloured 3 seaters are allover the stretch  for clicking pictures.Accomodation in Pangong is very basic with tents,except for a few wooden huts.Night temperatures are sub-zero with low oxygen & heavy winds.One has to carry oxygen cylinders and plan accordingly based on individual health conditions.Else,skip the night stay in Pangong.But the night sky view is an extremely magical experience with bright stars & milky way  ,seemingly very close, which should never be missed."
3,Pangong_Tso,PoojaNoida,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 â€¢ Family,Majestic Pangong,"Must visit place in Leh. Extremely beautiful, colour changing lake and mountains. Opposite side has snow peaks.By the time you reach Pangong from Nubra, it's already 3-4 pm. Though the mountains have sunlight but lake becomes dull. Best is to stay overnight at some wooden cottages, star gaze at night and checkout from your cottage around 9 am and enroute Leh, beautiful colours of lake can be seen. A clear, sunny day adds to its beauty.It's warmer also in the morning as compared to the evening time. Night becomes chilly and you need to be wrapped head to toe.Facilities are basic but if you are well wrapped, the blankets and hot water bottles provided by the cottages are sufficient. Food is good.Ample of small food joints/ dhabas are on the way to Pangong. Food is not a problem. But some stretches of roads are kutchha in between which makes the journey to and fro little tiring. Takes min 5 hours."
4,Pangong_Tso,533arpitm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Worth the hype,"Some touristy spots leave you underwhelmed, but not this one. Wish there was a way to spend more time here. Absolutely loved it.."
5,Pangong_Tso,MaithiliSave,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 â€¢ Family,Beautiful,"It is very beautiful lake. Loved it, but you need to take a pain to travel by gravel road. We visited at around 3 pm. Saw beautiful blue- green colours of the lake. We stayed in tents at the Lake. I think that can be avoided, there is nothing else to do. You can spend around 2-3 hrs at the lake, take pictures. If you decide to spend a night, book a cottage instead of tent. It is very windy sometimes at night and very cold."
6,Pangong_Tso,Arvind 1990,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Some very useful tips about Pangong Tso visit,"1. Best time of day to visit Pangong lake is between 12.0 Noon to 4.0 PM. We visit the western bank of Pangong Lake, so in forenoon when we click photos with lake in background, the sun is in our back side and faces and hills in background remain shady thus photos clicked do not look great.It is also the least windy time of the day, so one can shed woolens and click some memorable snaps.2. At Pangong never ever stay in tents. The nights at Pangong are quite chilly and windy which make stay at tents really a horrible experience. Now a lot of wooden huts are also available at Pangong, which make a better choice to stay there. At least they save you from the winds and comparatively much more comfortable.3. Do not go with high hopes about the accommodation in Pangong to prevent any disappointment and grudges later.These are temporary arrangements with bare minimum facilities. All of them offer the same basic amenities irrespective of your package.Do not get fooled by great photos available on travel sites of these camps, these are fake. So do not waste your time in choosing one over other. They all are almost the same.4. At Pangong electricity remains available between 7.0 PM to 10.0-11.0 PM only so carry your cameras, phones and power banks in fully charged status or charge them during these hours.5. Mobile phones do not work in Pangong. Forewarn your relatives and friends before leaving for Pangong that you will remain unreachable for next one day.Even the camps at Pangong do not have any kind of communication facilities.6. Why to stay at PangongA lot of your friends will advise you that with all these limitations it is not worth to stay at Pangong at all. But I beg to differ here as journey from both Nubra Valley and Leh to Pangong is approximately 5-6 hours long.Thus, doing Nubra-Pangong-Leh or Leh-Pangong-Leh in a day means 10-12 hours of travelling time on dangerous mountainous roads which is hard on you and your driver both.Apart from this at Pangong instead of enjoying the unparalleled beauty of the place and clicking some lifetime memories you will keep on worrying about getting late.You are here not to participate in a race but to enjoy and relax with your family and friends.Therefore, take it easy and appreciate the pristine beauty of majestic Pangong Tso tension free.Happy Journey"
7,Pangong_Tso,V B,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 â€¢ Friends,Filthy toilets treacherous roads. Overhyped,Filthy toilets on way and at lake. Treacherous roads with extremely bumpy areas. Perilous car journey with several cars noted to have fallen off the cliff. It is an overhyped place and not worth the journey 
8,Pangong_Tso,MADHU PRASAD K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Serene and wonderful Place,We had high expectations on our Trip to Pangong and it met most of them . The whole atmosphere is serene and view of the lake surrounded by mountains is breath taking.  The lake looks in different colours and cant believe that this place is in India.  The weather is cold you need to be appropriately dressed.  The restaurants are not that great.
9,Pangong_Tso,Sai K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 â€¢ Family,Beautiful place,A must visit on your trip to Ladakh. Great for Photoshoot. Visit during morning hours. Sunlight gives that beautiful blue colour to the lake. Stay not advisable. Washrooms in poor condition.
0,Pangong_Tso,DEBASHISHMUKHERJEE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021,"MESMERISING PANGONG AT 14,500FT","Oh!!! What a beautiful, serene, captivating landscape. The beautiful 150km long lake east west , with around 30 km within India is a mesmersing natural splendor worth capturing on the lens and treasuring as memory. The sheer blue of the sky and the hue of the lake changing colors as per the  time of day and the mood of the sky, is a sight to behold. The best approach to Pangong Tso is from Leh, through the 17,900ft Chang La pass , then reaching Durbuk-Tangtse. From this last habitat the distance  to the lake is around 45 min drive, through the jaw dropping landscape of Changthang plateau. The stay at lake is not recommended as there are very few accomodations and the altitude is so high, it can cause various types of altitude related sickness - viz., pulmonary edema, cerebral edema and acute mountain sickness . Beware!!! Old people should avoid a prolonged stay at this height."
1,Pangong_Tso,Nagmani2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 â€¢ Solo,Solo bike ride to Pangong Tso lake,"It was my solo bike ride to Pangong lake from Gujarat (Mithapur). It is always said that Journey is more beautiful than the destination. But when u reach at this destination,  u will find that its difficult to judge which one is more beautiful. In my opinion, both r equally beautiful and rewarding. Experiencing this lake can't be described in words, but felt only.. It's great, truly amazing. I didn't have much time and had to return same day, hence I couldn't enjoy much. But in my next trip, I will. If you have time, plan staying there. Everything is available there. Temperature during day time was between 10-12 celsius. Night may be a little colder. So nothing to worry about cold, one can enjoy even with kids. High altitude sickness may happen only at higher passes like Khardungla, Changla, even if u r staying there for longer. But it's advisable to carry medicines to counter this problem."

In case you love adventure then plan to stay in the tent near to Pangong Lake. It might be quite cold in the night and you might feel uncomfortable but it is a lifetime experience. We traveled with the kids of ages around 8-9 years and they were fine without Oxygen, so don't worry too much. Must visit for everyone."

Words are less to describe the peace this place has to offer. It mesmerizing. Weather was extremely cold upto -6Â° at night and the water too is very cold even on hot days.The Hotels, Tents around Pangong are very basic, some of them do not have even power backup . Please do not expect any luxury in these stays. Bathing is also not a good idea if you are not used to extreme cold. Also, if you have health issues, staying here is a risk, but at times you will not have an option also, since it's based on how your iternary goes. We reached Pangong in the evening, and hence, we had to stay, since night travel was not possible towards Changla pass. Our phones were completely dead, even the bsnl ones. The locals over there has established business for clicking pics on 3 idiots scooters, trunks etc. and Kareena's red choli. For scooter they said one person for 200, but we bargained for  4 PPL for 300."
