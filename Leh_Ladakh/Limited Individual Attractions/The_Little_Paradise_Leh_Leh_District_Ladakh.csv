1,The_Little_Paradise,Peregrineri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,OK,"Friendly owner, but I wasn't dazzled by the stock. It's rather hard to sort out what's there as it's mostly crammed rather tightly on shelves. I think there might be some nice pieces in all that, but I didn't see anything I couldn't do without."
