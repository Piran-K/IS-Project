9,Tibetan_Market,zuki12,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 â€¢ Friends,Mostly (winter) clothes market,"This market located near centre old market Leh, Ladakh. Interestingly, I rarely saw people selling Tibetan stuff in this. Instead they sell mostly clothes. Since I visited this in October 2014, they sell winter clothes. Not really unique clothes, mostly clothes like fake The North Face, Adidas, jackets, trousers, t-shirts. I didn't check the quality, so perhaps they have good quality products."
0,Tibetan_Market,Indrani S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 â€¢ Family,Nothing great to buy but everything expensive,"If you want to buy something from Leh, it could be some Pashmina or Yak woollen stoles and scarfs. Stones, artifacts and other curios are too expensive"

4,Tibetan_Market,Navkant,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 â€¢ Solo,Good Choices but Overpriced at Places!!,There are many refugee markets in and around the Leh Center. Be careful with the prices. The same necklace ranged from 200-2000Rs in different places. Its a delight for the people with SLRs. There are some exotic gift items to be brought back for your near and dear ones.
5,Tibetan_Market,Rahul Ajmera,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 â€¢ Family,"Antiques, winter-wear & stones","There are a lot of Tibetan markets in Leh and all of them have the same stuff on offer. You will find antiques (many from Delhi), winter-wear (from Tibet) and so-called semi precious stones, whose authenticity is difficult to verify.The market is good to visit once. Most goods are overpriced considering that it is a flea market, which really ruins the experience."
6,Tibetan_Market,Sirisha D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2012 â€¢ Friends,Good antiques,Good variety of antiques but the prices quoted are abnormally high. Bargain hard. Ask only 30 or 40% of that they have quoted. Mostly you get it if you increase your price 10-20 INR. The precious stones they show you may not be real. Don't buy unless you can judge by yourself.
7,Tibetan_Market,Mihir Shah,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2012 â€¢ Friends,Good for antiques and handicrafts but bargain hard,"Nice to see different articles, antiques and handicrafts on sale. Lot of variety and choices but be ready to get ripped of if you do not bargain hard. The shopkeepers were kind and friendly. Refrain from buying precious stones. They will mostly be fake."
8,Tibetan_Market,Somnath Chatterjee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2010,Quaint but bargain hard,"Must visit this place when in Leh. However, be careful and bargain very hard (upwards of 50%) at times.

Visits to the tibetan markets was a daily affair for us when we visited leh in july 2009.Shopkeepers are friendly and in some instances , I felt that they had better stuff than the overpriced shops.But ask for a receipt if u r buying some statuttes as I had  a tough time at Leh airport without a proof of my purchase."
