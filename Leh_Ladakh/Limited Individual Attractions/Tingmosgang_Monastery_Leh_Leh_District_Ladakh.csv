0,Tingmosgang_Monastery,huys25,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Couples,Thimosgang monastery above Themisgang village,"Our visit to Themisgang Gompa was interesting and we were allowed to make photographs inside the temples. A very frienly monk showed us around and opened all teh temples for us, because we were that day the only visitors. Probably because it was the end of September and very few other people ware going along this route.Also here is a several storey high Bouddha, where you can climb to the topfloor.Another temple has an interesting double room with a timber screen in between."
