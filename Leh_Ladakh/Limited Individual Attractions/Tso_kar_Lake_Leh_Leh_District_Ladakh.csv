0,Tso_kar_Lake,Rajnish,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,Disappointing!,The lake has all dired up with piles of salt and patches of water. the worst part is the road to reach here is not a road. 
1,Tso_kar_Lake,soodrajen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A beautiful place in the lap of the nature. Calm and quiet with zero pollution of any sort.,We were there in a group of 18 people which included families with senior citizens. Everyone liked the place and would like to go back. The trip was wonderfully organised by Roopkatha Tours and Travels of Kolkata.
2,Tso_kar_Lake,Aruneet Dutta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,"Hidden Treasure in Changtang, Ladakh","Tsokar is more of a fluctuating saline water lake near Leh- Manali highway, not as grand picturesque as Pangong Tso or Tso Moriri. But this lake offers salt beads, snow capped peaks and barren rugged fields going up to horizon. Also this lake hasn't been invaded by tourists, so it's way peaceful than other places.The lake gives a good chance of wildlife spotting including gazelles, kiang and crebes, black necked cranes among the birds. It was truly a great visit."
3,Tso_kar_Lake,jatinlodaya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,salt lake with a view,"we merely had a photostop here, but it was a large lake with sale deposits seen from far.  excellent views of the mountains.  a must stop."
4,Tso_kar_Lake,C L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Another great lake!,"The lakes in the region are distant from the more populous areas, making them great for pictures and sightseeing.  Crowds are small and few.  "
5,Tso_kar_Lake,rads2k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,In the midst of nowhere!!!,"Visited this place last year but my review is late. There was actually no water when I went, however the amazing night sky and the experience I had was something that I have never experienced anywhere.Star studded, shooting stars, milky way and what not. A must visit if you are in to birding or want some astronomical delight!!!"
6,Tso_kar_Lake,Th_vicker,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018,"Nice lake, peaceful, beautiful scenery","Not much to do around the lake, but just walking by and discovering the amazing landscape, the mountains surrounding the lake is worth the trip. Few restaurant and guest house in Thukje. The trek to Tsomoriri is easy to find and pretty."
7,Tso_kar_Lake,Pradip P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Great sights tovisit,"Sights are something out of world.Water is clear blue clean. Monastary are quite high in hilly area, it amazing how the manage to build this in old days with no cranes available."
8,Tso_kar_Lake,Rish Agarwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,"Forget Pangong, Visit Tsomoriri - Rare & Beautiful","Tsomoriri is a place which (thankfully) is not yet ruined by Bollywood & tourists. The scenic beauty & calmness of this place is beyond words. Unlike Pangong, which has turbulent & flowing water, this place is absolutely calm. At certain times, you can see a perfect mirror image which is naturally formed by the calm water in the lakeOften termed as a treat for bird watchers (sometimes also spotting of black necked cranes is reported), you can go for overnight camps with nomadic families & spend the nightIt's almost an 8 hour drive from Panong towards Tsomoriri but once you reach, it's absolutely worth it. Attaching pictures I took at the lake for reference"
9,Tso_kar_Lake,royjay2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Scenic Tso Kar,Tso Kar is a high mountain lake at an elevation of 4530 meters above sea level located in the southern part of Ladakh. It is known for its scenic beauty and the wide variety of wildlife it supports. It is one of the three high altitude salt water lakes in Ladakh. The lake is very popular with bird watchers as the marshlands surrounding the lake support an amazing array of bird life.
0,Tso_kar_Lake,Lovers_paradise,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,The White Lake!!,"The Tso Kar is a fluctuating salt lake situated in the Rupshu valley in the southern Ladakh. It lies 160 km south of Leh while the Leh-Manali road passes 30 km west of it. The Tso Kar is also known as the ""White Lake"" because of the white colour of the salt deposited all over its shores. Tso Kar is the smallest among the three important lakes in the Ladakh. "
1,Tso_kar_Lake,Sally L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,A lovely lake,To me this is even more beautiful than Pangong Lake and you can visit much more of it.  Accommodation - unless you come trekking or with your own tent - is really only available in the main town so you would have to do day walks out from that point.
2,Tso_kar_Lake,Atish B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Awesome Place for birding !,"This was one of our stop on our birdwatching trip in Ladakh. It is an amazing hidden gem for birdwatching and would recommend all birders to visit before it is over run with tourists. We saw a few raptors, ground peckers, Tibetan snow-finches, citrine wagtail and rose-finches. Unfortunately we did not get time to visit the fresh water lake which would have other types of birds."
3,Tso_kar_Lake,vinay_galactus,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Another great lake in leh,A great and beautiful lake on the way back to Leh from Tso Moriri. Not everyone has Tso Moriri in their itinerary. We visited this place in mid september. Our itinerary for this place was: Leh to Tsomoriri via Chumatang and Kiagar Tso and back to leh via Tso kar and Tanglang la pass. https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297624-d319681-r534230360-Tso_Moriri-Ladakh_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html#
4,Tso_kar_Lake,ThePrateekSethi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Great lake for birdwatching!,Another one of ladakh's gems. The place is a bird watchers paradise. The salt deposits on the far side are also an intriguing visual of natures many formations.
5,Tso_kar_Lake,Anshuman2707,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Spotted the rare black neck crane!,"This is a lake with swamp and salt deposits around, perfect breeding ground for the rare black neck crane. We saw two black neck cranes in all their glory. Underrated but a very important lake from a ecological perspective. Ladakh never ceases to amaze you!"
6,Tso_kar_Lake,Siddharthg86,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Couples,Another spell bind lake of Laddak region,Some natural things which one would find to be rare to see. Its salt deposits and pangong extends makes it more probable place.
7,Tso_kar_Lake,exploredaunexplored,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,check the salt deposits on the way to Tsokar,We were told we will get to see a lot of migratory birds at Tsokar lake and that was one reason we chose to drive through this route instead of the shorter Chumantang route. No birds when we went. the lake gets over before u get the feel of it. more interesting are salt deposits on the way to the lake. After seeing few tals on the manali leh highway and post pangong and tso moriri this seems to be a put off. its pretty but nothing extra ordinary. I would advise take the chumantang route as it might save u some time.
8,Tso_kar_Lake,Mahua S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,Desolate beauty!,"For the recreational tourists expecting a thriving bustling spot to indulge in sporting activities, this is not the place. Tso Kar is lesser known lake, on the Rupshu plains, with banks crusted with salt, brackish water and seemingly no population of wild life or tribes. Its size keeps fluctuating depending on the season. The lake used to be an important source of salt for the Changpa tribe. If you are lucky you may spot the Changpa tents near around. The lake in the forenoon casts a spell on the travellors very easily. Picturesque and still, two mountain peaks offer a breathtaking backdrop to this desolate beauty! Not a place to stay, but a place to stopover and fill your soul with its sight."
9,Tso_kar_Lake,shashindrak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Solo,A DREAM DESTINAION,"I was lucky that during my 3rd visit to Ladakh I could able to to visit 1 more wonder of Ladakh i.e. Tsokar while coming back from Tsomoriri via Sumdo, Puga. This high altitude saline water lake is situated at an elevation of +4500 meters in Rupsu plateau. Tsokar is a salt water lake covering about 20sq km. Changpa nomads were exporting salt to Tibet from this lake, The temp. varies from -40 degree in winter to + 30 degree in summer.As usual through out the trip tremendous scenery is on grand scale.In 2 days Leh - Tsomoriri- Kyagartso- Tsokar _ Tanglangla can be covered.The entire area is paradise for trekkers."
0,Tso_kar_Lake,AbhinavDave,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Couples,Very old lake..huge salt deposits!,"This was an interesting place to visit - the lake itself is drying up and leaving a large amount of salt deposits on the lake bed. It's in the middle of nowhere, even for Leh.I was told that it's a very old lake. It's worth a visit before it disappears completely (hopefully not!)."
1,Tso_kar_Lake,Charline091,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,Land of nomads with less tourist,"I love this place and it's region. Because this is the region where Himalayan nomads stay. So on the way you can visit nomadic tents made out of Yak wool and schools with beautiful Himalayan faces! The lake and it's surroundings beauty are can never be expressed enough. lush green pasture with birds, kyang and many more animals to witness according to your luck! so test your luck"
2,Tso_kar_Lake,huys25,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Drying up and loosing its attraction soon,"This is a popular stop when travelling from Keylong in the direction of Leh, since there are no othe places for overnight camping.The lake, however, is drying up and the water has retracted beyond the swampy grasslands, as compared to 5-8 years ago when the lake was still full.Because you hardly can see the water, the rating for the lake I consider poor but around the lake some wild horses or Black Headed Cranes, and the greatly eroded mountains are interesting.We were the last visitors (end September) to the Lotus tented camp before it closed for the winter until May next year. At night it was freezing already."
3,Tso_kar_Lake,Avijitsen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,High amount of salt Deposits,"On our way from Tso Moriri towards Sarchu, we halted here to admire the beautiful frozen lake of Tso Kar, its quite smaller than the famous Pangong and Tso Moriri lake, but nevertheless quite beautiful due to its remoteness and if lucky one can spot wildlife too."
4,Tso_kar_Lake,shubha22,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,Amazing lake,Tsokar lake is one of the most beautiful lake I have ever seen. Although to reach there is bit hectic.You will not find much people there. You can have soulful talk to yourself in this place. It's calm quite and beautiful scenery.
5,Tso_kar_Lake,Sushmita Biswas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,A tough terrain to thrive,"We , a group of 8, reached Tsokar from Jespa ....took about 13 to 14 hours of non stop drive. The terrain massively changed from mere mountains to a severe cold dessert...A few in our group got sick here....its the highest place in Ladakh which is inhabited...something around 18,600 ft above sea level.The tents we were offered were gud...the service was also gud ...they helped us with all the possible they could.Should indulge in very light food...lOts and lots of water is must.I enjoyed the stay...yet i would say, its much a skippable place."
6,Tso_kar_Lake,angtravel18,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Not impressed ....,"..... by either the lake, surrounding scenery or the camp itself.Firstly, it is a long drive - over a terrible dusty road - from the main Manali-Leh highway. And when you get there, the lake is unimpressive - small with little in the way of birdlife - and the mountains in the background are not spectacular. I was there late summer, so little in the way of snow. The land is dry and unattractive with little vegetation. The lake cannot be seen from the campsite. The campsite on first appearances looks great! No so!Positives: tents are large and clean, and there is enough bedding. And a hot water bottle was provided.Negatives: nothing in the tent on which to put night-time essentials like water bottle, alarm, torch, spectacles etc. Small table recommended. Also nowhere to put suitcase except floor (back-breaking for older folk!). Tents SO close together that you can hear everything from the people inside on both sides! And one cannot even get between them to get to the ablution facilities. The toilet facilities were really poor. They are some distance from the tents; in poor condition: some tilting over, doors that don't close properly, no paper, no adequate lighting for midnight visits, no running water in 2 of the basins. All in all well below acceptable standards.The dining tent was not too bad: large and comfortable., but no heating (and it gets COLD here!). Dinner and breakfast were acceptable considering the distance that ingredients must come from.The staff were friendly and helpful."
7,Tso_kar_Lake,Amit S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,Visit only if you think about wildlife. ,"I was here with my wife in September 2015. This lake was not so great compared to pangong and tso-moriri. The salt deposits were all around the lake. That's the reason why one can find lots of wildlife activity (mammals &  birds). If you are not a wildlife enthusiast and have already visited pangong and tso-moriri then this lake won't interest you. This was the coldest place in my whole trip, the water in toilet got frozen at night ;-) if you are travelling from tso-moriri to Leh then definitely you can take a short trip to Tso-kar on the way. "
8,Tso_kar_Lake,RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Couples,"Relax, meditate or just get lost - go to Tsokar Lake","This lake is located near Thugje village and has camping sites, home stays etc.we just passed by this lake enroute from Two Moriri to Leh via Taglang La pass. The place is extremely pictursque and bereft of humdrum of cities. A great spot for nature lovers and photographers. You may spot wild animals near the lake. This used to be a source of raw salt for people of Ladakh a few years back. There are very few restaurants who serve very basic food."
9,Tso_kar_Lake,syamantak_mukherji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Family,The Thundering Tsokar,"By far the best place to see wild life in Ladakh Tsokar glistens like a jewel oasis amongst the vast expanse of the dry arid terrain. If you drive carefully you can access this place from Jispa in around 6-7 hours after crossing Baralacha Pass, Suraj Taal, Sarchu and Paang, If you are there in mid june then five star camps awaits you with luxirious rooms and attached toilets, But if you brave a little more chill then a visit from Leh ( around 4-5 hrs away ) in Nov - Feb may reward you with majestic views of the Kiangs, Marmots, Red Foxes, Wolves and the very very elusive snow leopards. Avifauna like ruddy shelled ducks, siberaian black necked cranes are all present some as residental and others as migratory. The stay itself is a bliss as you see the salt water lake glistening like a pearl and surrounded by mountains with snow on top of it. Be a little careful and carry an oxygen cylinder and some mountain altitude sickness pills before venturing out. Acclaimatisation for 2-3 days in Manali and Jispa is essential. Due to the salinity of the Tso Kar, most of the resident fauna is found in its tributaries and in Startsapuk Tso. There are large breeding colonies of grebes and Brown-headed gulls, and some Strip geese, rust geese and terns. In the vicinity of the lake Black-necked Cranes and Tibetan grouse are relatively common. The basin of the Tso Kar and the adjoining More Plains constitute one of the most important habitats of the kiang, Tibetan gazelles, Tibetan wolves and foxes; there are steppe marmots in the higher reaches. The Tso Kar is connected by an inlet stream at its south-west end to a small lake, Startsapuk Tso, and together they form the 9 km2 More plains pool, which is dominated by the peaks of two mountains, Thugje (6050 m) and Gursan (6370 m). From the geology of the More Plains, it can be concluded that the Tso Kar in historical times ranged up to this high valley. Until a few years ago the lake was an important source of salt, which the Changpa nomads used to export to Tibet. The nomadic settlement of Thugje is located 3 km in the north. Due to the high altitude, the climate is extreme in the winter; temperatures below -40°C are not uncommon. In the summer the temperature rises above 30°C, with extreme fluctuations during the day."
0,Tso_kar_Lake,Cyril Kuhn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,For the adventure seekers,"This lake is one that is rarely visited (thank god for that!) but infinitely beautiful. It is tiny in comparison to Tso Moriri or Pangong Tso (the more popular choices) which are both quite vast but no less pleasurable to visit. The lake is quite a walk away from the main road largely because each step is double the effort for the sand keeps shifting under your feet and letting you sink in a little. As you get very close to the lake there is mud which is deceptively loose so one must watch out as one will otherwise sink in and get this very smelly grey mud on your shoes. However i have never been to such a strange lake which quite literally stinks (of sulphur) and where you cannot really enter the water because the mud close to it is too soft. A bizarre but extremely fascinating and beautiful little lake. For those who have time and are truly out on an adventure to see something extraordinary, this should definitely be on your list. A little off the main Manali - Leh highway, you can either start making your way there from Debring or otherwise if you are visiting Tso Moriri it is a good idea to head back this way, i.e. via Tso Kar and then Debring."
1,Tso_kar_Lake,stephen g,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Couples,yawns uncontrollably,"the tour book said its used by nomads the tour leader says there havent been nomads there for yearsits really a big puddle of unspectacular water, not worth the effort"
2,Tso_kar_Lake,Dhruv6373,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Beautiful lake - but too small to consider it as a must visit !,"Very small but beautiful lake.  This simple and short words define the Tsokar lake. I passed it on my way to Tsomoriri which is a much larger lake and equally beautiful. There are a few lakes in this region and Tsokar is sure not worth spending your night there nor specially visiting the place. Though I would not want to take the picturesque location and the beauty away from my words. It sure is very peaceful and serene location to laze and relax. In simple words, if it's on your way, do visit Tsokar, otherwise don't consider it as an itinerary must travel spot."
3,Tso_kar_Lake,Vishalda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 • Friends,A blessing to be here,"Tsokar is not 'touristic' like Pangong Tso or Tso Moriri and perhaps this is what makes ""TsoKar - White Lake"" so blessed because it's small, pure and personal. Yet another beautiful gift of Mother Nature. There are only a few yak sheds, a monastery and a couple of nomadic families in the surrounding. An overnight camp here is recommended. Also recommended is to be on Diamox"
4,Tso_kar_Lake,nowdrifting,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2013 • Friends,Heavenly at sunset,"Reached Tso Kar driving from Tso Moriri via Sumdo village - end September 2013. The late rays of the setting sun, struggling to peer through the clouds, the proximity of the mountains with their peaks proudly rising above those clouds and yes, the quiet lake awaiting the onset of the winter. What a sight !"
5,Tso_kar_Lake,Pratik_krp,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2013 • Couples,Best place to watch High Altitude Birds,We had visited this place when we were returning from Tso Moriri to Leh. This place is 30 Km. west to Leh-Manali highway so anyone can visit this place from Leh-Manali highway.This place is also having tent accommodations for night stay.This is salted lake of Ladakh. Surprisingly this place is having more birds than Tso Moriri. Because of that this place is popular for bird watcher.
6,Tso_kar_Lake,dranujkiran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2011,The hidden gem of Ladakh,"If you thought Pangong and Tso moriri were remote , wait till you see this stunning , desolate lake in the windswept '' back of the beyond '' area of Ladakh . There is precious little evidence of civilization here ; only the Gods in the heavens above . The accomodation is on the western end , near the exit to the Manali Leh Road [ 3kms from the lake ] . A row of fairly sturdy and new tents that may or may not be there . Advance booking is a must from Leh - even then be prepared for very basic food and camp like toilet facilities . But the Lake makes up for it .  It is some 200 feet higher than tsomoriri and encompasses a condiderably greater marshy area . Excellent territory to see the Black Necked crane - once considered one of the rarest birds in the world till some relatively large colonies were discovered in Bhutan and Tibet . There will be only 3-4 breeding pairs in Ladakh Summers so it is a priveleged sighting .  Kiang will be seen here for sure . They come down for a drink in the evening and maintain a very studied arms length from the local feral ponies . The best way to see this lake is to come via Tsomoriri and depart via the Morey Plains and Tang lang la pass to reach Leh by the ZManali road . Please do not land here in late afternoon as the availability of accommodation is never assured . So keep enough time to carry on to Leh .  Do not miss the native sulphur mines on the way in .Ironically , though very few people come to see this lake , it is clearly visible from the plane approaching [ right side ] or departing [ left side ] Leh Airport ."
