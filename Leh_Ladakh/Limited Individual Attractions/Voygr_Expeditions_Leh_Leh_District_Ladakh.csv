0,Voygr_Expeditions,Ian Cartwright,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,"Snow leopards, Hemis National Park, Ladakh. Simply thunderstruck!","My trip with Voygr was outstanding and enlightening in so many ways; spiritually, physically, and emotionally. I remarked to Rigzin, a truly remarkable guide who quickly became a real friend, that I felt overwhelmed (in a most enlightened way) by the various aspects of Ladakhi life, including attending payer ceremonies at Buddhist monasteries, to which I was introduced. Being among centuries of tradition, customs, and history will induce you to contemplate those deep, soul-searching questions about your role in the universe.I should note here that whereas Ladakh is part of India geopolitically, it is wholly unlike how we typically know India, and I love India having travelled to many parts in search of wildlife. Ladakh is quintessentially Himalayan (it was once its own autonomous kingdom) with cultures and traditions closer to Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan.While the opportunity to witness snow leopards was the “hook” for me, and I was rewarded with some incredible sightings, this was only part of the “big picture” of experiencing the physical beauty, remoteness, and spiritual significance of Ladakh and Hemis National Park. Indeed, I suggest you cannot appreciate the snow leopard without experiencing and understanding the environment they share with us. With the uncertainty of sightings, having this wider understanding reinforces just how truly special sightings are. To this end, the leopard spotters are truly world class: I thoroughly enjoyed and felt privileged to be in their company.None of these would have been possible without the outstanding and world class organization and hospitality of Bezhad, Rashid, and the amazing Voygr “family”. I emphasize family because that was how Voygr made me feel. Voygr welcomed me into their “family” and went out of their way to ensure my visit was exceptional. Lungmar Remote Camp in the breathtaking Hemis Nation Park is very comfortable, full-service accommodation. I am a budget conscious traveler and while my trip was not inexpensive, the quality and value greatly exceeded my expectations. The camp staff were great hosts and excellent cooks!Flexibility was built in and we consulted every day on opportunities for upcoming day(s). Flexibility meant I was able to visit Rigzin’s village and experience the Losar (Ladahki New Year) festivities which was a unique once in a lifetime experience. Indeed, Voygr gave me the opportunity to meet and share time with several local families and these people touched my soul. These are truly amazing people.I originally booked a snow leopard tour with Natural Habitat Adventures (NatHab) having participated in a successful polar bear tour last year. But after discovering and researching Voygr I switched because I believed Voygr could provide a more personal experience. It was somewhat a leap of faith but one which for which my instinct was acutely accurate. Voygr provided a personal and flexible program of impeccable quality.  Everything from original inquiry, custom itinerary planning and booking, through many ad-hoc communications to the in-territory logistics was super organized. I cannot emphasize enough how highly I recommend Voygr. Voygr simply must be the gold standard in this area."
1,Voygr_Expeditions,Olga Q,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Amazing time in Leh,What an exciting trip it was to go see the Snow Leopards in Leh.  I was not sure what to expect but what I experienced far exceeded it.  We were able to see 7 snow leopard sightings.  On top of  the beautiful scenery was the wonderful staff Voygr they tended to all of our needs.  I highly recommend going on a trip with Voygr Behzad and team understand service
2,Voygr_Expeditions,P M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Family,Expedition Exceeded expectations,"We visited Ladakh to see snow leopards with Behzad Larry and Voygr expeditions in March 2022. We saw 7 snow leopards, including a mating pair that we were able to observe for several hours. Behzad and his entire team are very passionate about their work. From exceptional (and warm) accommodations in below freezing temperatures to a wide variety of delicious food, we were very well taken care of. When we were watching snow leopards in the wild, meals would be brought to us, so that we would not lose any opportunity to see these magnificent animals. Behzad is also dedicated to conservation of rare wildlife. I hope there are more people like him, it would increase the chances that our children and grandchildren will get to experience the same magic that we did."
3,Voygr_Expeditions,Nai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Friends,Snow leopards,"Behzad and his team planned everything to perfection, worked tirelessly, and offered comfort that one can only dream of. The team of spotters would leave at the crack of dawn to begin the work of spotting leopards. Sonam always had plan B if leopards decided to take a day off and did not want to be seen. Rashid worked behind the scenes to took care of every detail. I will plan future trips without hesitation."
4,Voygr_Expeditions,sjs248,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Warm experience in Cold country,"We started out on this journey a little apprehensive,  as the optimal time to see the snow leopard is the COLD winter.  The type of COLD experienced in that part of the world is something that we had never sensed living in a tent.  But we were eager to get a glimpse of the illusive snow leopard in its habitat.  We spent a total of 13 days in Leh and Hemis.  The first two days were spent acclimatizing to the altitude after which we were transported to our ""luxury tents"" in the middle of the most beautiful setting amongst the mountains.  The outside temperature was as cold as expected.  But inside the tent it was warm and cozy.  The hot water showers, the beautiful carpets and the comfortable beds was something that we had not expected in a tented facility.  The food was another surprise, as they catered to all our dietary needs and more.  The food was plentiful, delicious and prepared with a lot of care.  We had three course meals even when we were away from camp waiting to spot a snow leopard.  They sent out beds for us to sit on or lie down on while we waited.   We were successful in sighting the snow leopard 6 times.  Our first sighting was a mating.  It was an absolute thrill and one that we will never forget.  The second was a kill.  We did not witness the kill but saw the leopard by the kill.  The next few were of the snow leopard stocking blue sheep.  The team that Behzad has put together is world class.  We went to see the snow leopard apprehensive of the COLD.  We returned, WARM from the experience not only because we saw the snow leopard but because of the kindest, friendliest and whole-hearted hospitality that we have ever experienced in all our travels.  It was better than a 5 star experience and one that we would like to experience again !!!."
5,Voygr_Expeditions,Nisha Mehta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Roughing it... with 5- course meals and incredibly hot showers ;),"We spent 10 days in Behzad's camp in Shang in a totally immersive Snow Leopard experience.From the day we arrived in Leh, Behzad and Sonam made us feel so cared for as we acclimatized to the altitude in Ladakh. After 3 days we arrived at the ""camp"" (if you can call it that - more like a 5-star property in the middle of the mountains). There are two phenomal suite-style ""tents"" (again, a loose definition) that we stayed in that each have their own bathrooms inside; this was so nice given the temperatures outside.From morning to evening, Rigzin (camp manager), and crew were SO attentive to all of our requests. We had 4 different types of egg orders each morning, 6 different tea and coffee orders, and each ask was met with so much kindness and care. We felt at home on this trip, which made leaving even more difficult. As far as Snow Leopards, we had 8 sightings. The first was a mating pair and for days afterwards we saw a single leopard in the mountains. As we sat out for days, Behzad's team brought us hot chai, biscuits, breakfast, lunch, and so much more to make us feel so comfortable. We even had beds to sleep on!Needless to say we cannot wait for our next trip with Voygr!"
6,Voygr_Expeditions,rjverma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Solo,Look no Further than Voygr!,"Incredible visit to Ladakh to see the snow leopards with Behzad and his team who provided an unparalleled experience. Employing the best trackers in the field, alongside incredible Ladakhi hospitality, each days trekking for the Snow Leopard was an absolute thrill. Accommodations are without a doubt the best in the area for an expedition such as this - no comparison. Tents were incredibly warm and cozy, hot water for showers and food was delicious. Somehow in an extreme weather environment, Behzad has created an oasis of comfort. Staff is beyond helpful and everyone is completely dedicated to the experience of glimpsing the Snow Leopard. In the end, Voygr has the best spotters so they are best chance you have at spotting the Snow Leopard. Highly recommended!"
7,Voygr_Expeditions,jacobsg88,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022 • Couples,Dream trip to see snow leopards!,"My wife and I had a dream trip up to Leh/Hemis National Park with Voyagr Expeditions and Behzad and were lucky enough to see several snow leopards! We even saw a mum and 2 cubs playing around in snow from a few hundred meters!Behzad and his team are renowned for being the world’s best snow leopard trackers. When you combine this with the best spotting scopes in the industry (Swarovski BTX scopes with 50x magnification and 1.7x extender to 85x), you get (basically) guaranteed snow leopard sightings!The camp provides by far the best accomodation possible for snow leopard tracking anywhere on earth. My wife and I stayed in the Shan dome suite. It was beautifully appointed with wooden floorboards, stone bathroom and a high pressure hot shower! The bed was huge and very comfortable. The rooms were very well heated - my wife and I live on a tropical island hate the cold yet were happy walking around the room in underwear.We extended our snow leopard trip with side trips to Ranthambore (tigers), Jawai (leopards) and Rajasthan. Voyagr and Behzad were amazing and put together a perfect trip! The drivers and guides Behzad chose were fantastic as were the hotel recommendations!All in all there is a reason Voyagr has a perfect 5* rating on TripAdvisor… We certainly plan to book all future remote holidays with Behzad!"
8,Voygr_Expeditions,123,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Amazing,"This adventure absolutely exceeded my expectations.  It was a unique combination of being totally in nature with many upscale comforts. The staff was exceptional, they anticipated your every need and were especially accommodating. I have such respect for everyone who made this a trip to remember. I really never thought about conservation before but this was a introduction to a group of individuals who are completely committed. It was inspirational."
9,Voygr_Expeditions,Nevena Boteva,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Such an amazing adventure - loved the snow leopards!,"I did this adventure in february 2020  together with my father, who is a passionate wild life photographer.We liked Leh and I really loved visiting a monestery for the morning prayers. It deeply toched me and it was very intersting. I am so thankful to Behzad, Brad, Kenrab, Dzordje, Rashid,.... the whole staff, who was taking such a great care of us and made all of this possible for us. It was all very well organised. And I managed to learn so much from you. About snow leopards, about Hemis, about conservetion, enviroment. Of course VOYGR wants to offer you a nice holiday and some nice seeings of snow leopards.  But what I truelly loved is that these people are dedicated to what they do. You can see and feel its not just a job - its a passion, its an ispiration and vocation to make life better for the animals, for the village people, for nature.  We really enjoyed some nice seeing of a snow leopard. Once we spent a whole afternoon watching a mum and her two cubes. It was so amazing! The spotters did a great job too so we could also see blue sheeps, golden eagles, wolves, lammergeyersVOYGR always had an open ear for our individual needs and personal interests. And I was so happy being able to go for hiking with a guide anything I wanted.The camp in Hamis national park is really nice and comfortable as possible for the conditions there. I didnt miss anything at all in our sleeping tent, toilet or wash room. Our ""social tent"" where we could sit together, chat, have meels was cozy. Food was always great. I loved the apple cider ritual every late afternoon for warming up after going to the field trying to spot some interesting animals.For anyone who is  interested in snow leopards, who is looking for a adventure I would highly recommend VOYGR."
0,Voygr_Expeditions,Brent G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,My week with Snow Leopards in the Himalayas,"I had the great good fortune to hear about Voygr Expeditions from Brad Josephs, who was our head guide on the trip I took in February.  We camped for eight nights at an altitude of just below 4,000 meters in Hemis National Park in Ladakh.  Nights were a bit frosty, but Voygr's campsite was superbly equipped and our stay was very comfortable with a few unexpected luxuries!  Along with Brad our group was led by Behzad Larry, the CEO of Voygr, and a large group of local support staff including the best snow leopard spotters in India.  We were privilged to spot many leopards along with a number of other species of mammals and birds.  I learned so much from Behzad and all of the guides, and left with a deep and lasting impression of the warmth and kindness of the people of Ladakh and of their passion for snow leopards and the mountain ecosystem that is their only home.  For anyone interested in snow leopards or seeking an exceptional adventure, I would highly recommend that you contact Voygr."
1,Voygr_Expeditions,Carrie W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Truly exceptional,"I was lucky enough to book a snow leopard expedition with Behzad and simply can't say enough good things. Behzad's passion for snow leopards, his true love of Hemis National Park, his desire to improve and expand the experiences he has for his guests, and the team that surrounds you on his expeditions is truly extraordinary. The joy, excitement, passion and caring that every member of the team displayed was above any expectation I could have set going in to this trip. If you're considering a snow leopard expedition look no further than Behzad and Voygr!"
2,Voygr_Expeditions,JoJM49,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Beyond all expectations Voygr. Simply amazing!,"What a wonderful place is Ladakh. And thanks to Behzad Larry, Rashid, and Australian cultural photographer, Robert van Koesveld, we have seen the very best of it. Voygr – you are unique. You offer it all. So knowledgeable: history, geography, religion, culture, wild life, conservation, photography.  And, most special, the personal engagement with the beautiful Ladakhi people in villages, monasteries and nomad camps, and the flexibility to stop wherever, whenever, to chat to interesting locals and take photographs. Every day was jam packed with photographic opportunity, serendipitous encounters and magic moments, but we never felt rushed. We have never encountered a company with leaders, guides and interpreters so committed and so caring, and such delightful company. Easygoing and fun. But behind the scenes, every detail is covered - our trust in you complete. We felt safe. Great drivers, and the fabulous homecooked, food was plentiful and ‘clean’. ‘Off the beaten track’, driving across the Tibetan Plateau, following the tracks of the nomads and camping alongside their yaks and gorgeous pashmina goats was a highlight. As were prayers with Buddhist monks in 10th century monasteries perched high up in the oh-so-scenic mountains, joining in song at wheat harvest and dining in the ancient caravanserai. Brilliant.So Voygr, thank you for such a joyful trip, and for opening our eyes to a part of the world about which we knew so little. Only 5 stars? You deserve 100! Sensational! "
3,Voygr_Expeditions,GAM47,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,An outstanding photography tour in every respect.,"My wife and I were privileged join Voygr Expeditions' 14-day Ladakh Photography Tour Sept 29-Oct 12, 2019 very ably lead by Behzad, Rashid and travel photographer Robert Van Koesveld. Behzad and Rashid's warm, friendly approach, impressive regional knowledge and genuine concern for guest comfort along with Robert’s excellent photography guidance meant that this photo/travel experience has exceeded all of our expectations.The ~ 1000km road trip itinerary in individual vehicles covered all of the most significant Ladakhi highlights including Thiksey, Lamayuro, Alchi, Hemis and Diskit monasteries, the Nubra Valley, Tangyar village and Tso Moriri lake, with stays in a 4 star hotel back in Leh between each segment. We were also privileged to shoot portraits and have an evening meal under stars in Voygr's refurbished Caravanserai, last used by Silk Road traders over 70 years ago. With its considerable exposure to Ladakhi culture generally; its nomad pashmina goat, sheep and yak herders in particular, and; its stark, colourful and high-impact terrain, this trip stands out as one of our best ever travel experiences."
4,Voygr_Expeditions,ajsdelhi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,"A wonderful Ladakh experience, courtesy Voygr....","My son and I spent 12 days with Behzad and team in Ladakh in June-July 2019.  I am an experienced hiker and climber, but this was my first trip with a top-class tour company - and the experience was simply, absolutely outstanding!  We were keen to do some hikes and also learn photography.  Behzad created a customized itinerary for us to do multiple treks; observe and learn about snow leopard tracking and conservation from the folks who are world-leaders in this field; see the impact of efforts to encourage eco-tourism and preserve the traditional way of village life; and explore varied terrain ranging from Leh to Hemis National Park to the Nubra Valley, ending up with a wonderful trek/jeep safari from Tso Kar to Tso Moriri.  Along the way, Behzad taught us the ins and outs of landscape and portrait photography, and got us to the most wonderful situations (outdoors and indoors) and people to photograph.  The type of access Voygr has to experts, geographies, people - I cannot conceive of anyone else being able to offer anything that comes close.Logistics and equipment were top-notch.  I felt a bit guilty about the wonderful style in which we stayed, but hey, you only live once.  The camping facilities (complete with a loo--with-a-view tent), the outstanding food that was drummed up seemingly out of nowhere, and the terrific service by the camp staff - all of it made for a memorable experience.  I want to single out Sharif for exemplary dedication and service - I don't have the right words to praise him, he is such an outstanding human being and guide.We engaged Behzad to be with for all the 12 days, and it was the best decision we made!  He is absolutely delightful company - knowledgeable, engaging, with a terrific sense of humor.  Rashid joined us for the last 4 days, and we got to know another terrific professional - I am coming back to Ladakh next summer to go climbing with Rashid.So, all in all, easily one of the best travel experiences I have ever had.  We will be back, repeatedly."
5,Voygr_Expeditions,ltsuit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,A True Adventure,"This is the second time I've traveled with Voygr Expeditions, and I'm sure to come back for more. What makes Voygr so special is that they have created adventures that are deeply aligned with and respectful of the land, the people, and the wildlife who live where we travel. The Snow Leopard tour is a true adventure. You're a few hours hike in the Himalayas, and you camp surrounded by nothing but ridges and peaks for miles and miles. You have all of the freedom you would want to explore, but they also provide the comforts you would expect from a high end luxury tour. Compared to other companies in the area, we no doubt had the best set up - the best guides, meals, tent (more like giant yurts) set ups (we had in tent heaters turned on at sunrise, and about an hour before we went to bed), and Expert trackers. Behzad and his team were great with the communications and planning ahead of time, pick up was a breeze, and everything was taken care of from beginning to end. All I had to worry about was being present and enjoying every moment of the trip. The service was unlike anything I've seen. No matter where you were, tea and cookies would find you. Each meal was multi coursed and delicious. It was a great mix of local style food, Indian food, and good old comfort food (pancakes were a treat). I went into this trip with zero expectations around seeing a snow leopard or any other wildlife. I was excited to just be in the mountains, and meet great people, but I ended up seeing so much more than I could have imagined - tibetan wolves, eurasian lynx, beautiful golden eagles, lammergeiers, and of course the snow leopard. Viewing the snow leopard for hours was truly special, and Behzad's team and the others on the trip were the perfect people to enjoy it with. Lastly, the thing I appreciated most about this trip was how much of a positive impact this expedition has on the local community, the national park, and wildlife conservation in general. The entire crew is local, the trackers are local, and so much money is flowing back into the communities and directly towards leopard and wildlife conservation. Behzad and his team care so much about this, and do whatever they can to add value to the communities and lands where they travel.Thanks Behzad, Rashid, Caitlin and team. See you sometime soon. :)"
6,Voygr_Expeditions,bradjosephs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,One of greatest wildlife trips in my life,"I have been focused on wildlife my entire life, and seeing a snow leopard was at the top of my list since I can remember.  I have tried several times in other regions of Himalayas and Tibetan plateau with no success, but this time it happened with Voygr!  The thrill of seeing a snow leopard in the wild is a wildlife experience in a class by itself. The scenery in Hemis National Park is as stunning as any I have ever seen.  We saw lots of other wildlife including many up close blue sheep, 7 Tibetan wolves, Eurasian lynx, fox, Tibetan Partridge, chukar, griffon, lammergeier, golden eagles, and snowcock.  The system of snow leopard expeditions in Hemis is the best anywhere in terms of being the perfect model of conservation, as the park fees are pooled to fund projects for villagers that help live sustainably in snow leopard habitat.  The region is not overgrazed with livestock, as it is outside the park, so there are no conflicts between herders and snow leopards, so leopards do not fear people.  There is excellent food resources and habitat for blue sheep which are abundant which sustains high density of snow leopards.   The crew for the camps are all locals, so they all have an equal, vested interest in healthy snow leopard populations.    When you visit Hemis in the winter for snow leopards, you are directly supporting snow leopard conservation.  We stayed in luxury tents, with cots, heaters, and super warm sleeping bags.  The food was amazing, and we had a huge heated tent to hang out and eat in.  We hired the top snow leopard experts from the wildlife department, which guided BBC planet earth 2 team, to find us wildlife ( this is the main reason they have had 100 percent success of snow leopard sightings in the last 4 years! This is the best operation to run snow leopard expeditions, in the best location, which is why I have picked them to run my snow leopard tours that we are organizing for 2020 as I am a career wildlife expedition leader.  It is solid, professional team in the best place to see and photograph these amazing big cats.  Everyone I spoke to in Ladakh had nothing but top respect for this operation, and they treated all support staff and locals with the same respect,  which is my style.  Hats off to owners Rashed and Behzad! These guys have set the bar high.  "
7,Voygr_Expeditions,Shravan R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Fantastic team that made a dream come true,"The recent expedition for snow leopards with Behzad, Rashid, Khenrab, Dorje, Sajan and team was outstanding. The communication from the first e-mail enquiring about the trip to the time we got back, was very good.•The expedition was very well organized. Behzad ensured each of us acclimatized to the high altitude in the first two days. None of us felt altitude sickness. Behzad and the team also kept a close watch on our physical ability and mental awareness throughout the trip. Their attention was key in a very enjoyable experience.•The camp site was perfect. Behzad had pitched the tents well in advance of our arrival, to take the best position. The tents themselves were luxurious, with a bed ensuring we were not sore or cold by sleeping on the ground. The food was delicious, with pizzas, pastas, noodles, dumplings and Indian food for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was elaborate, with porridge, eggs, bread and cereal. Many varieties of tea and coffee were always available through the day.•The sightings were exceptional. Khenrab Phuntsog, the renowned tracker from BBC Planet Earth 2, is not only a great tracker, but also one of the lead conservationists in Hemis National Park. He gave many, many insights into the ecology, animal behaviour, culture and conservation aspects of what we experienced. He delivered in spades each day: we had 7 snow leopard sightings including one from a few hundred feet and two from the camp (a first, I am told), 5 tibetan wolf sightings, including one from the camp (a first again). We also saw a red fox, many blue sheep and birds. The calls on four different mornings of 'snow leopard' even before the first cup of tea, and the first time I saw a snow leopard, will always remain with me. •This trip was supposed to see the snow leopard, to take it off it off my bucket list. Instead, it has turned into the first of hopefully many more trips to see the snow leopards again."
8,Voygr_Expeditions,Wayne and Sally,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Overwhelmingly sensational!,"We wanted to see snow leopards and we wanted an adventure. Our expectations were exceeded! This trip delivered in spades. It was a game changer for us. How we travel going forward will be forever influenced by this trip. And it wouldn't have been so incredible without Voygr. We couldn't have had the deep and broad connective experience we had without Voygr's:- close, influential network in the region, which provided amazing 'access'- the care and expertise of the individuals Rashid, Khenrab, Dorjay, Sajan and broader team supporting us (emphasis on the word 'care' - expertise was overflowing but it was the care factor that warmed up the very cold days and nights)- the effort from everyone to ensure our experiences with wildlife, with the communities, in/around camp, out hiking etc. were maximised at every opportunity- the support of the team to help us manage well in the harsh altitude and super cold winter conditions (nourishment, warmth, protection, equipment).  What did we like best? For us, the most memorable experiences traveling are those when we feel as though we are immersed in the environment and culture of a place, and when we feel as though we are learning and contributing in some small way to something important (in the context of the protection and prosperity of wildlife and the natural world). This is what we loved most on this trip. Voygr gave us access and opportunity to have this type of experience. It felt very personal and very 'big' if that makes sense. Hard to find words really, and we're still trying to process how amazing it was. We observed the incredible wildlife (including rare snow leopards), learned the challenges and opportunities of the region, met local villagers and learned their way of life, experienced the harsh environment, felt part of the beautiful mountains and valleys. Overwhelmingly sensational!What did we like least? Nothing really! But be warned if you go in January everything is going to freeze. Everything! Moisturizer, toothpaste.... haha! So be prepared for that! A few extra thoughts: We didn't have any problem with our camera equipment in the cold, we were able to charge our batteries each night (and kept spare batteries warm in our pockets). We did take our own little power pack for the iPhone which was super helpful out in the field (we took a lot of landscape shots and videos with the phone so having it outside the batteries could run out super quick!). Don't be tempted to stay in your warm sleeping bag too long in the mornings! It's prime spotting time! The team will let you know if they spot any wildlife but if you're still tucked up, by the time you get your clothes on and get up there (huffing and puffing, everything is harder at altitude!) you can miss that wolf on the ridge line or that snow leopard as it disappears over the ridge. Before leaving home for the trip and while we were in Leh acclimatising before starting the expedition we got good, detailed advice on so many things from both Behzad and Rashid, which we followed to the letter. And we're so glad we did, we're so thankful. They really know what they are doing and they cared about setting us up for success. Follow their advice.By the way, our expedition was for 8 nights in Hemis National Park. And even though we didn't see a snow leopard until the evening of the 6th day, at no time did we think that we wouldn't see one because we had full confidence in the expertise of the team. And aside from that we had such a fulfilling wildlife experience in the lead up to the 6th day observing lynx, wolves, blue sheep and other wildlife. It was truly wonderful before we even got to observe and photograph the beautiful snow leopard in the wild.Get this on your bucket list! It was the experience of a lifetime for us!!!"
9,Voygr_Expeditions,Julia T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Trip of a lifetime,"We wanted to visit Ladakh and Rajasthan and asked Rashid, who we met 10 years ago when he led us on a trek to the Nanda Devi East Base Camp, and who impressed us then by his attention to detail and caring attitude, to organise a trip for us. And we were not disappointed.  He and his staff took care of all arrangements regarding accomodation and travel, and in Ladakh the permits required to visit Hemis National Park and the Nubra Valley. Himself Ladakhi he shared his vast knowledge of the culture, wildlife and history of the country and we marvelled at the majestic mountains and beautiful isolation of the Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake after crossing the Khardung La mountain pass, the highest motorable road in the world!. In Hemis we stayed in a Homestay in Rumbuk, experiencing the extremely difficult life lived by these hardy mountain people. But unfortunately, we didn't spot any snow leopards!Our trip round Rajasthan was very different but equally enjoyable, thanks to Rashid's planning and organisation. We arrived in Jodhpur for the 2 day Marwar festival of Rajasthani folk music and dance, visited a Marwari horse stud farm in Narlai and the Ranthambore national park where we were fortunate to see 6 tigers.  And the splendour and magnificence of the palaces, forts and temples are just stunning.Rashid accompanied us on the whole trip and he and Jitu our driver in Rajasthan, were very amicable and fun travel companions, and knowledgeable, also very helpful and reassuring if you have a problem. We can highly recommend Voygr and Rashid for their professional approach to planning and organising your trip and the care and attention they give to make sure you have the experience you expect.  Not cheap but the attention to detail and the trouble they go to to make your trip trouble free and memorable can't be matched.Julia T"
0,Voygr_Expeditions,Nicole M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Voygr is the best in the business!,"If you are currently researching tour operators for your trip to Ladakh, you can stop searching now. Voygr is not only the best choice – from here on out it will be my ONLY choice, regardless of the difference in cost. Other tour companies in India sub-contract random local guides and drivers, leaving you on your own if things don’t go according to plan. Not Voygr - the people you talk to during your pre-vacation planning stages are the same ones that will be there with you during the tour. During our month-long trip to India last month, we booked 2 separate tour companies for different destinations. We had the unique opportunity to experience both types of tours and, believe me, it makes a big/huge difference in the quality of your experience. Voygr is the way to go, hands down.My fiancée and I wanted to see Leh, Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake in a very short time and, at the same time, get help with our new photography hobby. Voygr was able to handle these demands with ease. Both Behzad and Rashid taught us so much about how to use our cameras and photography concepts in general. Behzad even gave us a PowerPoint presentation on photography and let my fiancée borrow a couple of lenses during our trip.They were professional, extremely knowledgeable, and prepared for anything. During our stay at Pangong Lake, my fiancée ended up needing oxygen. The campsite was supposed to have a supply of oxygen, but didn’t. Rashid came to the rescue with a tank that Voygr brings on every trip. Beware – this trip is not for the faint of heart. The high altitude/lack of oxygen combined with the bumpiness of the roads throughout the mountains makes for quite a difficult ride; however, we felt extremely safe with Rashid driving. He definitely knows his way around the mountains!As for our accommodations, The Kesar in Nubra valley was a great stay with delicious food and a beautiful garden. The Hermitage “tent” at Pangong Lake was wonderful. It was located far enough away from all the other touristy places that you truly felt isolated.We came away with beautiful pictures, profound experiences, and a ton of knowledge – not just about photography, but about the places we visited. We can’t thank them enough - both Behzad and Rashid were amazing! They exceeded all of our expectations during the trip. We will gladly refer all of our friends and family to Voygr for tours in the Ladakh region."
1,Voygr_Expeditions,Bindi P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Experience of a Lifetime,"I flew to Ladakh with Voygr, through an organization called WorldTeach. I did not know what to expect, but the moment I met the staff - Behzad, Rashid and our guide Rigzin, all the puzzle pieces came together. They are an extremely caring and intelligent group. They made our experience extremely beneficial and planned everything thoroughly. Because they are locals of Ladakh and India, they knew all the best places, and where to go to find them. Seeing the grand Himalayan mountains and learning the history behind many of the glaciers was mainly possible because of Voygr staff. We were able to experience Yak irrigation, cow milking, the ladakhi culture, their food, a ladakhi wedding, and wear traditional outfits. This organization has exceeded my expectations and if I get the chance, I will definitely travel with Voygr again. Thanks to the staff for making our experience life-changing."
2,Voygr_Expeditions,elizabeth g,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Bucket List - Trip of a lifetime!,"My sister and I had a bucket list wish of going to Ladakh.  We started searching for travel companies that could arrange our trip. Voygr was by far the company with the most prompt and in depth information.Arriving in Leh we were warmly greeted by Bezhad and Rashid at the airport.  We immediately felt we were in the right hands.  These guys are so knowledgeable and on top of that have great senses of humour.   They advised us well on how to handle the altitude and through the whole trip kept a vigilant eye on us to ensure we were always safe and well.Bezhad and Rashid are well known and respected by many across Ladakh.  They know monks and lamas at many monasteries and also many of the nomadic communities.  We were so thrilled that while travelling to Tso Moriri we stopped at a nomad camp and were invited into their tents to say hello as Rashid was friends with them.  When in Nubra Valley we got to see The Dalai Lama up close because of the  contacts these guys have.  This trip delivered everything we could have hoped for and more.Liz and Renata, Perth Australia"
3,Voygr_Expeditions,Ellie M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,There is honeslty no one better,"I came to Ladakh through an organization called World Teach, with which Voygr worked as the in-country contact and host. Any and all expectations I could have possibly had were immediately surpassed. The team at Voygr is prepared for anything and can see and solve problems before you even know they’re there. They listen to and care about the client’s goals and ambitions for the expedition and are prepared and able to make each one a reality. The staff understands the importance of the overall experience of the client and will provide exactly what you hope for. Behzad and Rashid are well known by everyone in the community and are thus able to gain exclusive access to monks and nomads alike. You will be able to photograph and speak with people who wouldn’t otherwise interact so closely with tourists, providing you with a truly remarkable opportunity to be embedded in a local culture and appreciate the lifestyle and story of the subjects of your photos. Whatever you are traveling with Voygr to do, you will have special access, the staff’s extensive knowledge, and a just genuinely fun travel buddy throughout the whole journey. I wouldn’t travel in the region without them."
4,Voygr_Expeditions,Ryker M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,"IF YOU'RE NOT TRAVELING WITH VOYGR, YOU'RE WRONG.","I came to Ladakh through Voygr as part of the WorldTeach program.  I am currently a college student and have been in Ladakh for two months this summer, teaching in Zanskar for most of the experience.  Voygr facilitated the whole program and exceeded all my expectations doing so.Voygr is a well-oiled machine.  All staff members and guides are extremely experienced in traveling, planning, and adapting.  They have the ability to see challenges develop before they happen and quickly devise solutions before the client even knows a solution was needed.  They are keen to listen to the client's specific wants and needs, and they immediately make sure each one is fulfilled.  The staff understand the importance of making careful plans, planning for contingencies, and working hard to be flexible when it is best for the client.  Without exaggeration, the client is always treated like royalty.*Touring with Voygr will without a doubt give the client the best possible experience—better than any other tour company—for many reasons.  The staff are among the most well-respected people in all of Ladakh.  Everybody knows and loves them, and this gives the client privileged access to absolutely everything.  Whether the client is a photographer, trekker, wildlife enthusiast, or tourist just exploring the world, the astronomical number of connections Voygr has will give the client the most superior experience.  To name a few of the many examples: the staff knows the monks and lamas at many monasteries; they are familiar with many nomadic communities; the staff even includes the man who tracked the snow leopards for BBC’s Planet Earth II: Mountains, the best tracker in the entire world.  It is completely impossible to be disappointed with Voygr considering their many connections, and the client’s experience is enhanced even more by the unique and incredible staff (the three I interacted with the most were Behzad, Rashid, and Rigzin).Behzad is the best photographer I have ever met; but don’t take my word for it, just go look at his pictures on the Voygr website!  He is a wizard of an artist, and when he shoots, he makes it fun and educational for everyone.  He is extraordinary at getting along with every single type of person.  Behzad is like a walking google: you can ask him any question, and he will know the answer 99% of the time (100% if it involves photography, geography, or health).  Oh, and he speaks seven languages.Rashid is an extremely kind and outgoing man who overtly dedicates himself to making sure his client has the ultimate experience; he can make plans on the fly like no other (his IQ is probably around 180, Behzad’s too).  Rashid is an integral part of Voygr’s business, as he is hands down one of the most adored people in all of Ladakh; if you don’t know who Rashid is, then you probably aren’t Ladakhi.  He is a national champion boxer, an esteemed mountaineer, and an excellent photographer.I had the incredible opportunity to live and teach with ache (big sister) Rigzin for more than a month.  From the oldest village in all of Ladakh, she is a true Ladakhi: hard-working, helpful, and always happy.  She is extremely smart and well-educated, and it is her dream to climb all the highest mountains in the world.  She knows everything there is to know about how to be a good mountain guide, especially when it comes to her people-skills.  It is in her blood to truly be present as an exceptional support.  One example of this happened after school one day: I told her I would do laundry with her right after I took a quick bath, but when I came out, my laundry was already half-finished while hers hadn’t even been started.  This was a completely normal thing to happen, and when I expressed gratitude she would always say, “You don’t need to thank your ache!”  She is superb at her job with Voygr, but she’s an even better ache!Overall, if you’re not traveling with Voygr, you’re wrong.*Palm leaf fans not included: This is the beautiful Himalayas, not some disgusting and overpopulated beach, thank God."

This was the second tour I arranged them and I went the specific goal of capturing some great portraits of the Ladakhi people. I had high expectations and specific requirements. Rashid and Juma did not disappoint. There professional, can do attitude exceeded all my expectations. It was clear Rashid’s local knowledge and connections meant all my requests were going to be met without any problem. I really felt like I was backed up by a highly professional team. They were able to open up access to exclusive situations which gave me amazing opportunities to get some great portraits.This was the second tour I arranged with Voygr and will hopefully get the opportunity to book another customised photography tour with them in the future. I would highly recommend this team."

8,Voygr_Expeditions,behzadlarry,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Solo,Photography tour of Ladakh,"Just came back from an 8-night trekking expedition with the Voygr crew.  Wow.  Unbelievable camp experience with some nice amenities (e.g. cots/carpets/side tables in the tents), and great food prepared 3x daily (lunch was delivered to us wherever we were in the valley that day).  Voygr uses the best guides (for real, these guys are total pros with decades of experience), and will be happy to take care of any need you may have.  One example stands out to me - after leaving camp, we ask if we can trek further into the valley that day and use a local homestay for lodging that night.  Logistics would be uncertain as none of us had left camp thinking we wouldn't be back that evening.  10 minutes later, we see a guy with a horse heading back toward our camp.  Rashid arranges for him to pick up some supplies from our camp and bring them to our destination, as well as sends a message to camp to bring our lunch about 2.5 hour hike away to where we'll be.  I was so impressed with their ability to make adjustments on the fly, take care of their clients, and deliver an exceptional experience.  We also had a great snow leopard spotting one day and decided that we should visit other parts of Ladakh the following day.  No problems - Behzad and Rashid made arrangements and took us all over Nubra Valley and all the way to Pangong Lake.  These guys are totally dedicated.  They have the connections all over Ladakh to make anything happen.  I'll definitely be coming back for another tour!"

11,Voygr_Expeditions,daniellakb,,,,"I arranged a return tour with Voygr with high expectations from my first trip and had a really fantastic time again. This was a customised photography tour focussing on my interest in people photography, and visiting some remote areas in Nubra, Zanskar and Kashmir. From beginning to end Voygr went out of their way to make sure they delivered an exceptional experience that not only gave me unusual and interesting photographic opportunities but also a great cultural experience which was exactly what I was looking for. As a solo traveller this time I had the flexibility to keep changing the itinerary as we went along according to the opportunities that arose, which they managed seamlessly and without any objections. My every request and need was met with a 'no problem' and 'can do' attitude which was refreshing and lead to some amazing experiences off the beaten track which I just wouldn't have been able to have on my own or with a less specialised/experienced tour company. Arguably just as important as their professional expertise at delivering a top notch trip, was that Behzad, Rashid and their team of staff and local guides are fantastic people to travel with and spend time with, and as a solo traveller I was in great company and had lots of wonderful fun moments to remember. I'm sure this one won't be my last trip with these guys - don't hesitate to choose them for your next adventure and book your slot early as they're always in demand from repeat customers. I can't recommend them highly enough!"
12,,,,,,I contacted Bezhad to arrange a tailor-made photography tour of Ladakh. From start to finish I felt the tour organisation was very professional. The day I arrived Behzad and Sharif met me at the airport in Leh and went through the plan. After allowing sometime to get used to the altitude my adventure began. They took me to some amazing locations and through there local knowledge they were able to arrange access to do portrait sittings with some incredible local people. I could tell everywhere I went they are very well respected in the local community. Nothing was too much trouble. I will be booking another trip in the future and would highly recommend Voygr if your looking for a personalised photography trip.
13,,,,,,Bezhad and the Voygr team where amazing! Great organisation and recommendations on all the best activities and food around Leh. We were lucky enough to also visit the newly opened Kesar in Nubra Valley - WHAT A TREAT! The staff we're so welcoming and friendly. If going to Leh you MUST get in touch with Voygr and their team
0,Voygr_Expeditions,Beatrice S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,The experience of a lifetime thanks to Voygr!,"Jullay!As part of a 5 week volunteer trip to Sumur Valley, the fantastic Voygr team was coordinating and overseeing all onsite activities for us volunteers. Behzad, Rashid, and Rigzin not only prepared us well on all things involving life in a Sumur Valley village but also introduced us to Ladakhi culture and its natural beauty during an amazing 5 day camping/trekking trip to Lake Tsomoriri and Lake Tso Kar at the end of our stay.I always felt safe and well-taken care of by the entire team. Everyone made sure that we have the best possible experience and did so in the most professional way. Especially the glamorous tents and the amazing cooking by the Nepali staff made it a very special kind of camping trip, which we appropriately called ""glamping"". To everyone who is considering visiting Ladakh, I can full-heartedly recommend Voygr Expeditions. You will get so much more out of your trekking than just hundreds of fantastic pictures, you will win new friends, teachers, and an experience of a lifetime when trekking with Behzad and Rashid and their most wonderful, caring and extremely knowledgable support staff."
1,Voygr_Expeditions,360plus2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Business,Voygr led student trip - a wonderful experience!,"360+ Leadership Collective has partnered with Voygr to support logistics for our summer travel program for the past three years. Our students are age 16-19 and come from across the U.S. and India. This year, we opted to hold the Leadership Collective in Ladakh for thematic reasons but also so we could benefit from having the Voygr team's physically presence on our trip. What an absolutely excellent decision. I cannot say enough positive things about Behzad, Rashid, and our guides Rigzin and Sharif. Behzad was extremely responsive in the lead up to the trip ( this has been consistently true over our past three years of partnering with Voygr) responding to emails with detail and focus. There are so many details when planning a student trip for nearly 40 people and Bezhad made it seem easy. Rashid was always there to give additional information or make more contacts if needed. Both of them are funny and always keep things entertaining while managing to stay professional. When we arrived in Leh we were met at the airport by a smiling Voygr team and whisked to our guest houses. When traveling with so many students things don't always go as planned , in fact, they can sometimes seem in constant flux. Sharif and Rigzin ( who traveled with us from the moment we landed until the moment we left) handled everything beautifully. From letting us borrow phones to finding restaurants that the kids consistently loved to helping run errands they were always there and always genuinely eager to help. Rigzin and Sharif were more than just extra hands however, they were truly our guides and interpreters during our time in Ladakh adding their perspective as community members whenever an opportunity presented itself. This was truly invaluable. The students adored them and we as staff did too. We also had the chance to stay at the new Voygr guest house in the Nubra Valley ( Kesar Guest house) which was really, really lovely. Excellent chefs in the kitchen and spacious, sun filled rooms. Students are still telling me they wish they could go back! All in all, we are very proud of our partnership with Voygr and believe they offer an unparalleled level of attention to detail, clear communication, and genuine thoughtfulness about their trip planning. Highly recommend this partnership for student groups or large tour groups in general. Voygr has the capacity and people you need to run a flawless, low stress trip."

3,Voygr_Expeditions,Martin W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Solo,Snow leopard expedition 2017,"This was a very successful and well led trip to Ladakh, organised by Behzad and Rashid and a splendid assembly of porters and cooks, and especially local guides Khenrab, from the Snow Leopard Conservancy in the Hemis National Park and Rigzin Wangdu in the Nubra valley. Behzad and Rashid are very interesting and personable guys and very good company and provided great insights into Ladakh, Leh and pretty much anything else! Being a winter trip at altitude it was chilly though we were well prepared and well catered for. Hot sweet tea would miraculously appear at intervals even on the top of snowy ridges! Spotting the leopards is not guaranteed but chances are maximised by the quality of the crew and there was a wealth of knowledge to draw from. We saw leopards on three of the four days in Hemis and also saw many tracks, marking rocks and leopard skat. Large raptors abound in the park as well as bharal (blue sheep) which are the snow leopards' principal prey. The itinerary on this trip was flexible. We could have stayed longer but elected to travel farther afield with reports of sightings elsewhere. We visited Ullay and crossed the spectacular Kardhung-La into the fascinating Nubra valley where we spent a few days identifying sites to put camera traps. Sadly we saw no more leopards though did see a beautiful red fox and a lot of interesting geology and topography, not to mention petroglyphs in a number of locations. This is a fairly hardy trip with the cold and altitude but if you are up for it it makes for a brilliant experience."

We went on a motorcycle tour / fishing trip and Rashid led our team.  The team was incredibly thorough and knowledgeable.  Ladakh is truly one of the most beautiful places I've ever been and the prep, skill, and care the team put into our safety and trip left me feeling incredibly at ease and truly able to enjoy my vacation.  The motorcycle was sick and a really great bike.  In fact, our team was so prepared that we even rescued a guy who's chain had broken.  Can't recommend enough."
5,Voygr_Expeditions,christinmacgillivray,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,If I Could Give Voygr Ten Stars Out of Five I Would,"Voygr created a mind blowing experience in Ladakh. As for many - traveling through the more remote areas of Ladakh was a new experience for me. Voygr ensured everything was taken care of at a top notch level every step of the way. The guides - Behzad and Rashid - provide complimentary skills from a global and local perspective. They were able to craft a unique experience off the beaten track while providing rich environmental and cultural knowledge on the way.Within our trip, we pitched tents with nomads to explore Pashmina production, visited remote monasteries and trekked across beautiful landscapes. Behzad also gave lessons on time lapse and night sky photography, which as an aspiring photographer I found tremendously helpful. It will change how I look at the night sky through my lens.In addition to this - Vogyr has ethical guide practises. Their guides are paid fairly and they have an environment-first mindset. They will not cut corners on cost at the price of ethics, which sadly we cannot say of many of the tour companies in the region.It is without a nanogram of hesitation that I recommend Voygr as your choice in Ladakh. Enjoy Ladakh !"
6,Voygr_Expeditions,Lukas B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Unbelievably Awesome,"I did a motorcycle camping/fishing trip with Rashid.  Ladakh is so beautiful and different and we got to see so many different things.  The temples are incredible.  The landscape and terrain is super varied and interesting.  Maybe the coolest part was meeting some of the native nomadic people.These guys are such pros, I felt a little guilty.  They cook really good food and wake you up in your tent in the morning with hot tea.  We went a little late in the season and it was pretty cold, but we had a lot of fun.Rashid is fantastic.  He's the perfect combination of hyper competent and friendly.  I can't believe he took time off from leading trekking expeditions and doing search and rescue missions to help a couple of idiots on motorcycles not kill themselves in the mountains and try to catch fish.Every step of working with Voygr was great.  They are responsive and followed through on every request."
7,Voygr_Expeditions,Clare R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Why this is who to choose for your trip to Ladakh,"Exceptional experience from the beginning to end. I recently did a tailor made photography trip with Behzad J. Larry and his team from Voygr in Ladakh. Communication before the trip was very responsive and professional and together we worked out an ideal trip. The combination of Behzad's expertise, personality, photographic experience and enthusiasm and historical insights combined with Rashid's local knowledge, contacts and connections, capabilities and personality give a winning combination that is unbeatable. As a travel photographer, I know how important local knowledge and connections in gaining access to privileged situations which result in great photographic opportunities and this is exactly what you get with Voygr, all delivered with the utmost professionalism and attention to detail, be people who go to great lengths to make sure they're delivering what you're looking at the same time as being great fun and entertaining travel companions. I am already planning my next trip with them and can't recommend them highly enough."

We were presened with great locations and wonderful people to photograph; I doubt that anyone else could give the level of privileged access that we had. The amount of planning and groundwork done by Voygr was evident in their warm welcome from local people wherever we went, at any altitude. Great staff made the adventure as comfortable as it could be in an, at times, very harsh climate. The overal impression is that I was greatly privileged to have visited some very special people in Ladakh and I could not have done it in any better company."
9,Voygr_Expeditions,Anulekha G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Unbelievable experience!,"The trip customized by Voyagr for our group was fabulous. It kept in mind acclimitization and travel time. They took care of hotel, permits, transportation, the best guides and driver (Chozkin and Stanzin - you are wonderful!) and meals on the road.  When travelling to this region of India it is important to remember that it is still developing and was not open to tourists until recently. Given the incipient nature of the tourist industry in Ladakh, Voyagr left us with very little to worry about and we were happy to be in their very capable hands. Voyagr met us at the airport, and from then on it was all up to them. Our group of 6 travelled in a well kept Tempo Traveller, everyone had a window seat. There was always an oxygen tank. Our guide Chozkin was very knowledgeable about the history of Ladakh and our driver Stanzin knew all the roads. We travelled for 5 days covering Leh, Diskit, Hunder and Turtuk via KhardungLa. Voyagr is very flexible to your needs and to the environment. Our day in Leh visiting monasteries had to be replanned as all the monks had gone to see the Dalai Lama. Voyagr took us to see the Dalai Lama to speak as well! How awesome! The landscape is unbelievably beautiful and unspoilt. Voyagr took care of our homestays with wonderful people in Turtuk and the tents of Hunder were very comfortable with wifi to boot! Voyagr also arranged our camel ride in Hunder - another once in a lifetime experience in a mountain desert sand dune. We were accomodated for any requests we had like stopping at pharmacies or other places along the journey. Voyagr staff is known by everyone in Leh. I was very comfortable with them. They are used to tourists from overseas and our guide spoke English. It is the best way to travel the region. Let Voyagr handle it all and you just soak in the wonder of the mountains. Would definitely go again!"
0,Voygr_Expeditions,Breedfreak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,Fantastic experience with Voygr.,"I have traveled the world but this is the first time I went with a guide. Looking back it was a good move, Rashid was PHENOMENAL and almost too good. I guess that maybe it was a given that he would get me where I needed to go and basically give me an all access pass to Ladakh (including expert itinerary and all that jazz) but, in my opinion, Rashid went over and above anything that I would have expected. For example, when we were out shooting stars, I was pretty happy with where we were but Rashid was not happy at the fact there was a lightbulb 500 yards in the distance. So, at 10PM we jumped in the car and drove 10 minutes into the darkness just to get a better picture. These guys were fantastic. NOTE: it was a little confusing for me when I first found Behzad and Voygr.  This entry in Trip Advisor is listed as Behzad Larry Photography. The reason I have been talking about Rashid and Voyager is that Behzad and Rashid are the owners of Voygr.com which is an adventure tour operator based in Leh. They do much much more than what you see in this entry. Bottom line: 1000% percent happy with these guys and would recommend them to anyone and everyone."

Behzad put together the perfect itinerary for us. We stayed at guest houses and camps which were simple yet comfortable and experienced great hospitality. Chamtse guest house in Leh started to feel like home by the end of our trip. Our driver, Imran was the best guide and we couldn't have seen Ladakh with anyone better. I'm not a big fan of long drives but in Ladakh I almost never wanted it to end. Our itinerary included Leh, Khardung la, Hunder, Turtuk, Tso Kar, Tso Moriri. I would definitely want to go back someday and visit Kargil, Zanskar and would love to go back to Turtuk and probably do a bit of rafting too. I would however skip Tso Kar - too deserted, too much walking and not much to eat."

I chased Keang (wild donkey/horse) on foot, and have hilarious photos to prove it (Behzad captured)3. I camped out with the Changpa Nomads for 2 nights - eating dinner with them, herding goats, sleeping underneath the brightest stars I have ever seen.4. I took the best photos of my life - portraits of Tibetan nomads, wild animals, incredible landscapes.5. I hiked to the top of StokLa at 17,000 feet, and was just constantly blown away by all of the views around each turn, and above every crest.6. I saw a family of Blue Sheep, Black Necked Cranes, hundreds of Wild Keang, a Marmot, Yaks, thousands of Pashmina Goats, Tibetan Mastiffs.7. I met amazing people, and built lasting relationships.He and his team did everything in their power to make these experiences happen. This included flying in film from New Delhi so I could take photos with my film camera!!! Also, because I could not find the battery to the digital camera I had brought, they hunted down an extra digital camera for me so I could take photos on our two day expedition to camp out with the ChangPa Tibet Nomads. They truly went above and beyond in every way.I already miss the land and people of Ladakh, and cannot wait to come back."

21,,,,,,"Did a Photography expedition with Behzad and Voygr and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Ladakh is stunning and as a photographer to be along with other photographers  gave us the opportunity to work together at getting the shots we wanted at our own pace. I lost count of the number of times we stopped the car to take photos of interesting scenes and amazing landscapes! :) Behzad is a great guide and photographer, patient, enthusiastic and up for anything. He is very knowledgeable about his subject, be it photography or the history of the region and goes to pains to ensure you have a great experience. If you are a photographer and want to check out Ladakh (the lesser known places especially) i would highly recommend checking out Voygr and Behzad Larry Photography."

He was not only able to instruct me in taking great pictures, but also had great tidbits about each monastery. I got some of my favorite pictures from my whole trip that day, along with some great stories!"
