1,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Ankeet G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,An epic Ganga expedition,"We went for a kayak and ducky expedition with Chotak and his amazing team of paddlers - Stanzin, Kunga, Devi, Namghyal, Manish and crew. Being in the Ganga for 4 days with this amazing team was a dream come true. They did a fantastic job of getting us to run the rapids and had us feel amazingly comfortable.More than the time on the rapids, I truly cherish the time I was able to spend with the team in the camps and on the river. Thanks Chotak! Will see you soon."
2,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,vibha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,An unforgettable experience,"We did a Kayak expedition on the Ganges, starting from Alaknanda, all the way to Rishikesh. We completed it in 3 nights and 4 days. It was an absolutely amazing trip and a great experience. Chotak and his team are so very hospitable, the trip is unforgettable. And they are all very skilled and trained in rafting and kayaking and the safety measures they take is of great importance and gave us a lot of confidence in the river. We totally trusted them and felt at ease in the river. Writing this makes me relive those moments and I already miss the team and the river. If you’re looking for some great adventure, then you’re at the right place."
3,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Esti_sai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Friends,Extraordinary,Kayaking with Wet N Wild was the best experience I've ever had! The team is extremely professional and even in the most dangerous  rapids one feels safe and looked after. Apart of that they are super fun and great companions. We laughed  a lot and had time of our life. Definitely  worth the money!
4,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Rini Biswas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Solo,"Wet N Wild Explorations, an elite expedition & rafting company","My experience as a kayak-student and part of one of their trail-blazer expeditions through the entire length of Upper-to-lower Indus river has been a journey enriched with learning, excitement and fun. Mr. Tsering Chotak, the owner of Wet N Wild Explorations, is a true-blood adventurer with amazing rafting and kayaking skills and knows exactly what to offer to his students and clients. Can't thank him enough for the lessons and hospitality he has extended towards me."

6,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Ankush G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,White Water Kayaking on Zanskar and Indus River,"Had an amazing 2 weeks of white water kayaking on the Zanskar and Indus rivers with Wet N Wild Explorations. Did multiple day trips on both Zanskar and Indus rivers and a full self-supported expedition on the Zanskar river from Padum to Sangam with my friend Naval. Stayed at the beautiful camp of WetNWild right next to the river with amazing views.Cook da cooked delicious and nutritious food for us every day at the camp. Chotak and his team provided all the necessary logistics and gear such as kayaks, paddles, safety gear, transportation, roadside safety, and guidance on the river.I would like to thank Chotak for bringing samosas for us in the evening, organizing everyday kayaking trips, and cooking for us on the expedition. Kunga for his amazing support on the Zanskar expedition, anuj for all the amazing stories and helping me organize this trip, Ringzen for picking and dropping me at the airport and driving us around, and the rest of the team for making this trip so much fun. And the cost for 2 weeks which includes everything was very minimal and affordable. Thank you Chotak :)"
7,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Naval,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,A self-supported Kayak expedition on Zanskar,"This review is about my Zanskar self-supported Kayak expedition with Chotak and Kunga. Me and Ankush went on a Kayak trip from Padum, to Phisu, to Sacred Waterfalls and finally reaching Nimmo on the fifth day. I did multiple grade 3 and some grade 4 rapids in the Zanskar valley and am now a better paddler. Besides the tough rapids, there were amazing experiences over the camping too. The drive to Padum was beautiful, through across two high passes and through a narrow valley. At our second camp in Phisu, we drank chang (local alcohol) at a local wedding and roamed the untouched village. Chotak is a wonderful river chef and I think I could have learn how he makes Alloo Phing. Sleeping under the sacred waterfall in the Zanskar valley, under the full moon was again a super memorable experience. I am not the best paddler and was rescued safely by Kunga at the Gate rapid and Surprise 1 rapid. He also make a great friend during the trip. I have to plan doing Zanskar again very soon with Chotak.The only improvement I can think of adding to WetAndWild company is adding longer kayak paddles to the inventory. Rest we also stayed at camp site many days. On some days, we did two runs down Chilling and Scopoche rapids. The tent gets hot for few hours during the day, but everything else is great. The cook makes good stuff, we had BYOB parties and celebrated on multiple occasions."
8,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,sandesh gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A Lifetime Trip to White Leh !!,"Based on their very positive TripAdvisor reviews, we booked our 8 days Leh trip with Wet N Wild Explorations. Our trip includes local sightseeing, Khardungla-pass, Nubra valley, and 3-day Chadar trek. Our hotel stay was cozy and comfortable. Chotak took care of all the permits and paperwork required for the trek. The best part of the trip was the experience of walking on Frozen river (Chadar Trek). On the trek, we were accompanied by porters, guide, and Chotak himself. He took care of us really well during the whole trek. We were treated with scrumptious meals throughout the trek. The guide (Abdul) was quite informative and enthusiastically engaged us in activities at night in camp.  We were extremely happy with Chotak's planning, tips, local driver and level of personal attention. Highly recommend!!   Thank you Wet n wild exploration and especially Chotak for providing a lifetime memorable experience."
9,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Agam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Solo,My firstever outdoor adventure,I travel to Leh ladakh Indian.And it was my first trip with out any proper plan.I went out from  my room to explore Leh I saw signboard of wet and wild Explorations(a company which deals with  outdoor activities).I plan to do whitewater river rafting then I went in side n booked a trip on the zanskar river. And it trun out amazing trip with the great safety standard and service. So I planned to book my entire trip with them only. Can't explain it well in writing but it was the best choice ever I had in my life. And I would like to recommend this company whoever's travels to ladakh. Thank you team of the company. With Love Agam.
0,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Kinley Bhutan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Can't express enough!!!,"I got a chance to visit ladakh in 2019 August by reference of a friend of mine, and got touched with Mr tsering Chotak the owner of the company for our trip. What he promised through our bookings and he went beyond to make our trip comfortable and memorable. i highly recommend Wet n wild for tose who are keen in real Adventure trip to ladakh."
1,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Martin B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,A world class adventure in Ladakh,"Nine of us have just returned to Australia and Canada after an amazing three-week Ladakh adventure with Chotak and his extremely fine-tuned Wet-n-Wild team.  With local sightseeing, home-stay lunches, mountain biking down some of the highest motorable roads in the world, plus the main focus of our adventure, kayaking on the Indus, Shyok, Hundar, and our finale, the world classic Zanskar gorge – it was an exceptional, and memorable adventure!  My best-ever adventure trip, and possibly the best organized in over 20 years of kayaking across the Himalayas. The camping was almost ‘glamping’, with hot towels before snacks, and the best range of camp food, including birthday cakes, fresh bread and pizza etc I’ve ever experienced on a river trip.  Well done Ramish.  All gear, equipment and kayak hire were first class.  Safety and rescues on the water was swift and professional.   Chotak’s communications throughout the whole organization of the trip were first class, and his commitment to detail and genuine customer care made for a relaxed stress-free adventure, and that was despite having to cancel our Srinagar acclimatization intro only 10 days before we were due to fly.  A highly recommended 5 star outfit.  Thank you Chotak and the boys."
2,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Julian R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Greedy company and irresposible crew,"It seems this company has a lot of good reviews but my experience differs the mainstream opinion. I booked the Scorpochey - Nimo Stretch for two persons per suggestion of the company because we are newbies and just want some thrill and lots of splash of water. My partner has to return to Spain and I notify the company this fact. Without my knowledge the company changed the White Water Rafting to a Ducky raft and the Scorpoche to Nimmoo strech to the Chilling to Nimmoo stretch. As the company said in their website they upgraded me without inform me from one stretch ""especially good for the beginners"" to a stretch for ""hardcore adventure seekers"", everything because they wanted to avoid to refund the money of my partner.Naively I trust the company competence even when I saw that the inflatable raft changed to a ducky raft, maybe it is more suitable for beginners I thought.Far from what I thought the trip was a nightmare. I was falling constantly on the cold waters of the Zanskar. After falling 3 times the suit was filled with water and dropping quickly body temperature. My muscles were numb and asked to get out of the river but they keep me pushing to continue, everybody was having fun but me. Here I blame the company raft team for a lack of assessment to stop me from continue the trip because I was in a bad condition and I was not enjoying the activity.Despite my request to finish my trip I would fall again in the river, terrified, gasping for air and unable to hang on to the boat because my muscles were numb. At the end of the trip I was with symptoms of hypothermia, shaking body and cold sweat because of a terrifying experience.I was blaming myself after failing so miserably in this trip but after going to the office to collect the money from my friend who didn't come; they told me that I was not entitled to the money because I was upgraded to a more expensive (and more challenging) stretch of the river. Soon I realize why I fail so badly: they put a newbie in a strech for experienced rafters. I write my experience to offer some info to all newbies looking for a raft discovery experience because they may be subjected to the same experience I lived. Maybe the lack of tourists force the companies to this kind of practices, so please check the following:- Check the stretch of the river difficulty- Check the kind of boat they offer you.- Be clear about what kind of experience you want; for me a lot of splash of water is fun but falling into the water is not fun.- Ask about the possibility of falling in the water, keep in mind that after falling 3 times the wet suit fails to keep you warm and the trip becomes really unpleasant.- Demand that as soon as you ask to get out of the river, to comply with your wishes.Maybe this is a company for experienced rafters but for newbies I can not recommend this company."
3,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Likhita Nimmagadda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Kayaking at the Confluence of Indus and Zanskar,"We were two girls who wanted go rafting but Wet N Wild Explorations had suggested that we do kayaking instead. We were so glad that we went ahead with their suggestion. It was an exhilarating experience! We had two 2 people assist us both through out the process (Shivam and Hari). They made the experience even better for us. Definitely recommend them to everyone! Good equipment, Great staff!"
4,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Bernard M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Spectacular 28 km duckey trip on Zanskar river,"Excellent, super spectacular 28 km rafting trip on Zanskar river. Wet N Wild Explorations delivered on their offer for a great rafting on a super charged river (with ice cold water).  Excellent organisation, clear focus on safety with a very professional and competent team of 4 safety kayaks along the rafts. Necessary that day, because most of us flipped over in the major rapid.  There is no comparison between the 28 km rafting and the shorter versions : we did both, and the 28 km really qualifies as spectacular white water river rafting.  I wish this competent & sympathetic team best of luck for further developing their incredible rafting offer in Ladakh. Bernard, Luca and Samuel"
5,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Max Emil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Whitewater expertise,"I came to Leh as a solo kayaker and met Chotak in the Wet N Wild camp. He and all his staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful, and I was able to come along on several commercial trips which were all efficiently and professionally run - a really clean and personal experience on some amazing sections of whitewater. Staying in camp is great, with clean and comfortable accommodation and delicious food cooked for every meal."

7,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,siminacernat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,Awsome experience,"I went on duckey trip with my friends and we had an amazing time. Everything happened on time, our guides were very professional,they took good care of our safety and encouraged us to have fun. They offer you all the gear, information and assistance you need. Also, a very yummy lunch after the trip is available. Everybody in the camp is very sweet and helpful.Because of such a good experience,I decided to start a kayaking course with them and it's going very well so far. They also organise all other kind of adventure expeditions (trekking, cycling, biking). I honestly highly recommend Wet n Wild."
8,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Ashrut,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Personalised hospitality,"I got their reference from a senior colleague of mine. However, when I had my visit to Leh and surroundings, from day one I felt their personalised attending. I and my daughter faced Acute Mountain Sickness. Their followup, standing in queue at Hospital and not accepting money for my daughter's medicine touched my heart. Trip started from Khardung-la, Nubra, Pangyong, Changla, Stok, Hemis, Rafting at Sangam of and Heritage tour and other places. Driver at stay arrangements, as per my package were good ones. Tour designing also was apt. Camps at Pangyong, though were very shaky throughout night because it being very windy there. But nearly all camps at that place were like that only. At Sangam, their camp is really at a nice place, where they arranged our lunch after rafting. In hilly areas, getting a simple, freash n hot food was a taste to stay. Also, in between I wanted to purchase something for my office and their person case to assist me in local market. In between, my daughter had her birthday also, for which Mr. Chotak arranged gift and a dinner, which was tip of the iceberg. Thanks team Wet n Wild, it was really an experience that one usually cherishes long. Would give them 7 stars out of five, if it permits 😊😊😊All the best."
9,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,RAKESH Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,Astonishing places with Astonishing people,"It all started at Leh Airport when got a warm welcome from WET N WILD EXPLORATIONS crew. At the very first moment they made me so comfortable and started with funny conversations . Reaching at riverside camp made me feel like that I am in the lap of nature, cold winds, clear sky , thundering sound of INDUS,boulders and the most beautiful creature i.e cyrus (dog) welcomed me there with a cute gesture. All the crew members are so  humble , cool and fun loving that you will be like a group of friends of same interest. Chotak Bhai ( owner) is the coolest person I have ever met .

All other members are also amazing with their own skills . Food quality will  make you to full your belly more than your capacity . its so delicious that make you to lick your fingers twice .

0,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,boomtangboy,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,"Absolutely amazing people, but.....","If you in Leh and in for some adventure, you definitely must contact Chotak and his team. While in Leh these guys helped me out right from tours to getting the necessary permits. I also was completely floored with their hospitality. So then why the poor rating? Well I coordinated and booked my rafting trip in June with Chotak in March and confirmed the same with him in May. There were some external factors that affected the price of the trip but I was assured there would be some work around / mid way. A day before the trip I went to the store and confirmed the same but on the day of the trip well the shutters were closed and when they finally opened shop they told me the price would be almost double of what was agreed. It was a real let down and also caused me to cancel an overnight trip."
1,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,binalembo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Exceptional 1 week fully organized tour in Ladakh (and 28 KM rafting trip),"We are a couple and chose Wet N Wild for the full organization of our 1 week tour in Ladakh last august, it has been the best choice, they even gave us oxygen supply throughout our trip and we always had refreshments. everything was perfect from the choice of sleeping arrangments to the help on deciding the itinerary (we did Leh, lamayuru, nubra valley and pangong lake). Our DRIVER RIGZEN was amazing, extremely professional and we always felt so safe even on the cliff drives. we also did the 28Km rafting trip and it was fun and we had all the necessary equipment."
2,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Andreacolorado,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Priceless day in paradise -already dreaming of next (longer trip),"I wish I could give more stars. Our day on the Zanskar was our stand out day of amazing trip to India. My advise - plan for more - my only regret is that I didn’t realize just how special this would be, and now have to go back to India for more (my dream is the 6 day expedition!) Just for perspective on this review - I have rafted a lot - my brother in law owns a rafting company in Colorado and myself and my 16 and 21 yr old daughters have spent dozens of days (and nights) on spectacular rivers. I knew that a day on the river was one of the best ways to really experience the spectacular natural beauty in Ladakh. I also was concerned about safety and equipment and training of guides and communication with the guides in a foreign land.  I chose Wet and Wild due to reviews that addressed these concerns and I can more than confirm that the professionalism of this company is way beyond the expectation at the highest standard. Additionally, my girls were super nervous because though we had been passengers in rafts so often, since we were just three customers, we could not afford to rent the whole raft. Chotak encouraged us to go for the Ducky’s (inflatable kayaks that require the paddler to paddle - you don’t just depend on your guide for the paddling - you depend on yourself) The timing was great for this as the rapids were still class three, still safe for adventurous beginners with the exceptional support of the guides in kayaks who taught us how to paddle through the rapids and never left our side. They carefully explained what to do if we did swim and assured us that if we did swim, they would be right there and that we could count on them. Sure enough I swam through a rapid and thanks to excellent gear was not even cold in the glacier run off and felt completely safe through the rescue. The Zanskar River is beyond spectacular and we were the only people on the river for 28 km stretch from Chillig to Nimmu. The three guides two on the river (and the driver who was not only an essential part of the safety team spotting through each rapid but also a professional photographer and guide himself) were all fun, helpful, teaching us and encouraging us, all with great personal stories and their love of the river was absolutely infectious - such cool people to spend the day with! These guys are top quality guides -dedicated to the safety and comfort and all around enjoyment of their spectacular home, again this is not just by India standards, I mean international standards of service! My daughters were beyond thrilled with the day -favorite day of the whole trip- and one of them is now determined to learn to kayak, she loved it so much. I just can’t thank Chotak enough for making that priceless memory possible for us!I would advise anyone to go on the longer day trip rafting or ducky trip (even beginners )the shorter trip will leave you wishing you had done the 28km (more rapids and more spectacular beauty to enjoy!) If you experienced or a kayaker, this is the company that can provide the support and comrades to share a mind blowing amazing trip. Anyone heading Rishikesh (year round rafting) -these guys can take care of you there. If you have more time- seriously consider the multi day options. Your only regret will be that you will wish you had time for more!"
3,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Adam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Wet N Wild gets 5 stars from a whitewater kayaker,"I traveled to Leh in August 2018 and only by happenstance ran into Chotak and his team at Wet N Wild. We were a group of traveling kayakers (not rafters) on a private trip. One day we walked into Wet N Wild HQ and met Chotak and his team. They really came through for us. I would go so far as to say they made our trip. Chotak let us tag along on one of their commercial raft trips. Then, in the following days, we paddled the Lower Indus with Chotak himself. After that, we were on the Wet N Wild program for the next three weeks. Punsok was our driver and friend and masterfully navigated our group through any obstacle presented (even when we were grumpy!). I was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of this organization. Skills, safety, and communication--the complete package. You really cannot go wrong in choosing Wet N Wild for whatever your next adventure may be."

The camp site is a beautiful place upon Zanskar. Safety was taken care of with durable helmets and reliable personal floating devices. There were an ample number of kayakers for the safety of the visitors."

13,,,,,,We went to Wet n Wild Explorations for our first rafting experience in the first week of September.  It was a nice scenic ride.  We opted for the one hour trip which did not have any rapids.  The rafts were good and we were given a short safety briefing.  Their staff are experienced and make sure you enjoy your rafting experience. It was quite a fun laid back slow ride during which we enjoyed the incredible views it offers of the mountains on both sides.  Next time we will surely take a more challenging trip with rapids.  I would surely recommend Wet n Wild in Leh for rafting.
14,,,,,,"Recently I returned from Leh after completing Ladakh marathon! Just before returning, I wanted to do rafting in Zanskar. I registered my slot through 'Great Ladakh Tours and Travels'. Their overall organisation of the event was quite good including transport, lunch and the main event 'rafting'. I had opted for 28 km rafting from Chilling to Nimmu. One of the highlights of rafting was their attention to safety. Participants were instructed in detail about the technique and safety measures. It was a thrilling experience to do rafting with Wet N Wild Explorations. Would love to join next time on a different rafting route!"
15,,,,,,"I made a one day trip of rafting in the river and had the best time! The staff is super friendly and funny, and in the same time is really careful about safety, they pick and drop you up in Leh, and give you a really good meal after the rafting session. You can book with them eyes closed it's all good!"
0,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,kumar Anshuman,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Awesome experience,"We visited Leh in the month of May-June18. In the run up to our trip we searched and enquired with many operators including Yatra and SOTC but we finally decided to go with 'Wet n wild'. At that point it was important for us that we were in touch with the tour operator Mr. Chotak(+91 94198 19721) directly, he is the owner and I always got responses from him unlike the other tour operator where u talk to the marketing guy and not the real people who are going to arrange and going be with you on the trip (I had very bitter experience of going with famed operators on one of my past tours).  I would have contacted him several times over a period of 3 weeks and he would patiently answer questions and when his phone was un reachable, I could get in touch with his team members.  And what a good decision it turned out to be. Mr Chotak is a gem of a person and all his team members are just so caring. This was the best guided tour of my life . He advised me to balance the tour with site seeing and adventure activity. No doubt that the Wet and wild company has the mastery on adventure activity. We loved the white water surfing so did my daughter who is just 8. He was a perfect host for us from the time we landed to the time we left Leh. As days passed, I realised that these people will advice you and will go extra mile to ensure your safety and comfort. You don't need to get worried at all, just leave everything to him. He hosted a additional parting dinner and a sumptuous lunch for us which was never in our package. I could not believe the full course lunch we enjoyed in the middle of desert, at a camp side.  I can't think anyone else for Leh. He told he is planning to organise tours in NE and I have already decided on my next tour, it has to be NE. "

And it couldn't have got better if not at zanskar with these wonderful bunch of people!! If you miss the 28km rafting in the morning you can still do the 14 km one in the noon..... The guides here are fun loving.. also there is pick and drop service from your hotel and lunch too. You really don't have to worry about anything just get in touch with them and things shall fall in place.. and of course don't forget to ask for a go pro... You don't want to miss out on that surely....

10,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Nathan G,,,,I have visited Leh in the month of May-18.The master mind behind the tour is Mr. Chotuk (Wet n wild ). Mr. Chotuk is a gem of a person. This is the best guided tour in my life . Mr. Chotuk balanced the tour with site seeing and adventure activity.  No doubt that the Wet and wild company has the mastery on adventure activity. I strongly recommend Mr. Chotuk and company to those who are planning to Leh  Ladhak . The service from them is unexpected.Lastly I thanks Mr.Chotuk and company for the mesmerising tour in my life.
11,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,DavidovicMirko,,,,This was our first time white water rafting and even though I was so nervous I have to thank Adip and Dave for making our time the most unforgettable experience that we ever had! I wish I could rate you guys higher than five stars!!!! It was thrilling exhilarating and totally awesome! We had an amazing group as well who were super friendly and will be so cherished. All the equipment and gear were really good and the ride was all we could wish for! Thanks a ton Adip and Dave for taking care of us and especially making sure that the kids had a great time. We will do it again with you guys in a heartbeat! 
12,,,,,,"I had the pleasure of working for Me Chotak in Ladakh for a couple of months this season. So because of that this review will come from a slightly different angle. I first met Chotak at Ganga kayak festival and after he managed the logistics for my friends 7 day kayak trip around Uttarakhand. His knowledge and experience on and off the water where invaluable, from arranging transport to cooking incredible food on an open fire.In Ladakh chotak has a range of guides from India, Nepal and a couple of western guides too. All his guides are well trained and very experienced. They are also qualified in first aid. Wet N wild is not just a rafting company. They will happily assist with any aspect of expedition planning and preparation. The company offers an invaluable resource for western kayakers. "
13,,,,,,"One of the best experiences in my life!Base camo is situated on a perfect locatin near the river and Nimmu rapids.It is a basic campsite, with all of the comodites. Food is literaly perfect, never in my life tasted so good food!It is mostly vegan and vegetarian meals, and it was soooo tasty.Specail thanks to cook Dave :)This guys are the most proffesinoal company for rafting in Leh, they have security at the top level, al experienced guides and safety kayakers.Specail thanks to Stansin who made every trip and staying overthere special. Also thanks to Warun, Neeraj, Shivam, Daman and the rest of the boys, and ofcourse Dave :)Tsangpo from the office was really heplpfull and make Leh experience really comfortable.If you want to have a perfect rafting trip on Zanskar and Indus, this is place for that."
0,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Digantjhala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,The best for adventure activities in Ladakh,"I was super happy with the work of this company. I came upon their details while surfing thru a book on Ladakh as well on Google. As this was our first experience at river rafting, we were a bit apprehensive, however we are so glad we chose ""Wet N Wild.""Both Zyangpo as well the owner Tsering Chotak were lovely people. They explained to us each minute detail and solved all the doubts and fears we had regarding river rafting. On the day of rafting, their bus picked us up from our hotel and then took the entire group to Nimoo, where they have a campsite. We were given wetsuits and the instructors gave us loads of helpful advice.We had chosen the route from Skorpoche to Nimoo, which was of 18kms and approx 2 hours. At the starting point, there was this lovely instructor called Marc who took almost half an hour and explained to us each and every little detail about rafting. He demonstrated to us what to do if one of us fell down, if the raft overturned. He gave us an important lesson - To always smile, irrespective of whatever happened.On the raft, we had a guide named ""Daman"" who was a fabulous guy. the seven of us and Daman had loads of fun throughout the entire 2 hours. We sang songs, braved rapids together, got down in the chilling water, and what not. Daman was a brilliant guide well versed with his job. I will never forget his style of saying, ""Okay team, paddle forwards.""\By the time we reached the end point, it was almost as if a family had been formed among the 8 of us.There was lunch at the camp after the rafting, and by the time we left, we had bonded with everyone.This was one of the most exhilerating experiences of my life, and I cannot thank ""Wet N Wild"" enough.Special mention to the owner Mr Tsering Chotak who was a gem of a person, ever polite and courteous whenever I called him. I would recommend everyone to engage with this company for any kind of adventure activities in Ladakh. When the owner himself drives your bus to the rafting point, you know he is really taking good care of you.Special mention to Laxman, the kayak guy who was an extra protector but enjoyed more than any of us."

2,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,ashwinmurali1988,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,"If it's river rafting, it's got to be Wet n'Wild","It is by sheer luck that we walked into to the office of Wet n'Wild when we thought about rafting. The rest, as they say, is history. Had one of the most unforgettable experiences rafting in the Indus river, courtesy Wet n'Wild. Their team is so experienced that they made the whole experience so comfortable and enjoyable for us. They ensured our safety while also making sure we experienced the joys and thrills of rafting. Due to rough weather on 14th July, 2017, we could not go for rafting in Zanskar river, but the 2 and a half hour rafting in the Indus more than satisfied the adventure seeker in us. There again, I'd like to commend the team for taking us to Indus keeping in mind our safety as the utmost priority. The facilities they had at the finishing point were top notch and the sumptuous lunch was a bonus. Totally enjoyed our experience with Wet n'Wild."

Also they will take care on each and every detail, make sure you are having a good time ! Let me tell you one secret - they have a rule that if the boat flips completely, the main guy on the boat has to give party to everybody on the camp. We tried but not so successful. They have kayakers who are amongst the top 5 of India. Amazing experience !!! Thumbs up !! Keep up the good work !!!"
8,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,hareetds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Leave it to the professionals!,"Came across them on Trip Advisor and trusted their rating here. I am glad to say that they went way beyond our expectations. Very professionally run organisation which took care of everything (pickup, rafting, lunch, drop) at an excellent price. They took us to their camp (very well maintained) in nemo for a quick briefing given by Dave the camp manager and then they sent us on our way to the starting point.We did the Chilling to Nemo stretch which is around 28 km long, takes around 3 hours and has some excellent rapids. It takes around 1 to 1.5 hrs to get to the starting point in their van. The instructor we had (Manish) was really enthusiastic and explained everything to us properly. He would also brief us about the rapids that were coming up (fell in at one of the rapids and lost my specs too :O which was a rather fun experience). We thoroughly enjoyed his company on the raft (Wishing him luck for his Kayaking competition in Iceland). Also his favourite quote is,""What to do, Kathmandu"".Thanks for the awesome experience! Would highly recommend them if you are planning to raft in Leh.Also would recommend the Chilling to Nemo stretch, it is epic!"

Their knowledge of the local rivers is exceptional and they helped us organise a week long expedition to the Ganga, Bangarati, Alaknanda and Pindar rivers.  Wet N Wild have great local contacts and were able to organise cheap and reliable transport for us during our stay and for our return to Delhi airport.I was very impressed with the way they treated their clients, the quality of their rental equipment and the emphasis they place on safety.  They also have an office and trips run from Leh (Ladakh).  My experience in Rishikesh was so good that I'm already trying to fit in a trip to Ladakh within the next two years."

4,Wet_N_Wild_Explorations,Rohit Varma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,An exceptional holiday to rermember!!!,"We had a week of river rafting and camping along the Alakhnanda/ Ganga river. That one week was just magical! The organisers were so meticulous that even the minutest of detail was precisely planned to ensure our comfort. At the outset, we were picked up from the airport and transported to the main camp site where well laid out, clean tents, sleeping bags and sumptuous food awaited us. After the safety briefing, we started off on our adventure the next day. The day time used to be in the rumbling waters, enjoying the roller coaster ride of our lives. By the time we finished, piping hot delicacies and camp fires awaited us. Overall, this is one experience that everyone must strive to have at least once in their life time. Kudos to the organising team for making this adventure what it is!!"

I work within the Rafting industry training & Assessing river guides.Wet N Wild are one of the only companies in Leh that strive to provide internationally recognized training & certification for there guides. In terms of safety this puts the team ahead of its competitors. The guide team at Wet N Wild all work 12 months of the year as river guides so they are true river professionals.The operating equipment at Wet N Wild is on par with any other operator in the western world. One of my favorite aspects of Wet N Wild is the beautiful basecamp and the amazing food that they provide.

Its awesome experience and you will not regret. I think there are two operators  and both are equally qualified and good. You may arrange prior booking with your tour operator or hotel to avoid rush. The guides were qualified and from Rishikesh and all safety gears are available. There are 2 stages to opt. One with multiple rapids whereas the other one includes calmer waters. The water was freezingly chill but we got used to after a while.  Remember to take an extra set of underwears :-)"

A real adventure..!!,"I have done rafting a few times before at different places, but the experience is so different. The team is very helpful & enthusiastic. Just before i entered the raft i was very exited n told a friend that my raft has never capsized so far n things like this are very rare. And finally in this trip i experienced that too in a long grade 3+ rapid. The best thing was the speedy rescue by the safety kayakers. All the 9 members on board were rescued n put back in the raft within minutes. Special thanks to Dinesh the safety kayaker who rescued two of us together. It was commendable. They have a very good safety setup thats essential for adventure activities."
