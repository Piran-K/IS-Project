0,Yama_Adventures,Daniela,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 • Friends,The perfect holiday!,"I just came back from Ladakh where I had a beautiful experience thanks to the professionalism of Namgyal who organised my nine days tour in Nubra Valley, Pangong Tso and the monasteries from Leh to Kargil. He provided a car with a driver and a guide for a reasonable price. The guide had a good knowledge about Buddhism and monasteries which made everything more interesting. The driver was well experienced and I always felt safe, which is so important when you are on roads around Ladakh. The guest houses were all clean and food home made of a good quality! Without any doubt I really suggest this travel agency to groups of people or solo travelers."
1,Yama_Adventures,soma s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Ladakh Road Trip,"For our trip to Ladakh, we arranged our road travel via Yama Adventures which was arguably the best decision! From the very beginning, Rinchen (Owner of Yama Adventures) was very kind to share all the pertinent and practical information required for organizing our trip. After we landed at the airport, Rinchen and Stanzin (our driver for the entire road trip) were very hands-on with our itinerary and time efficient so as to ensure we soak up the local atmosphere and cover all the sights we wanted to see. If you are looking at Ladakh and would like assistance from a travel agency, look no further Yama Adventures is the way to go!!"

Rinchen Namgial of Yama Adventures put together the itinerary and made all the arrangements for us. It was all very professionally done. The guide Jigmet was very informative and helpful.

13,,,,,,An amazing experience. A most professional team who pandered to all our wishes and looked after all our needs. Jigi is a great guide with extensive knowledge of the terrain and a budding Budhist philosopher who always grounded me when I would be flagging after the long hikes.Namgial who runs this establishment is soft spoken yet organised and made our whole experience seamless by accommodating certain last minute changes which happened due to changed personal circumstances. Recommend YAMA highly and planning to use them again.

Both of them are good hosts. Well i may say, very good. They were attentive and put so much care on us, the tourists. Their clients. Rincen Namgial greeted us personally in Kidar hotel. He also there when we had our first breakfast in his resto where we met Jigmet, our tour guide for the first time. Rincen treated us like family. We feel home. He gave us good and clean hotel which is Kidar Hotel, good food, good service, good tour guide and many more. The last day before we were back to Delhi, he brought beers for everyone. wow.... its a pity i dont drink beer so i gave my share to Dukduk our driver. Dont forget Dukduk is an amazing driver. He was driving his car like dancing. Yes...he was dancing with his car around Himalayan mountains, so i can sleep beautifully. Though the altitude is bothering me, im so happy to be with the group in Leh-Ladakh. Rincen you are rocking ! Jigmet you served us nicely! Thank you so much. Keep it up guys! YAMA ADVENTURES is the BEST!"

6,Yama_Adventures,irawatisantoso,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,Wanna visit Ladakh? Let Yama Adventure arrange for you,"Yama Adventures took great care of me for two weeks during my stay in Ladakh. They proposed a daily itinerary that for the first few days included time to acclimatize, visit monasteries, forts, and other interesting sites in the area. Our staff and itinerary for the Markha Valley was great. Delicious food, attentive and caring staff, my guide was awesome. Could not have been happier. Towards the end of the trek we camped at Kang Yatse Base Camp. Which set me up nicely to summit the following day. Once I returned to Leh and became aware that my flight home was canceled, the owner Namgial let me use his cell phone literally for hours to fix the situation. Thank you again Namgial, Lazes from the office, Ram my cook and Tag the cook assistant, Manla my horseman, and most importantly the person who spent the most time with me my awesome rockstar guide Jigmet!

9,Yama_Adventures,DJW,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,excellent tours,"I want to say thank you and send my warm regards to Jigmet and Rinchen, who organized almost two week trekking tour for me. I was in the very beginning of May, so most of the high routes were still covered with snow, however there is lots of beauty even on popular treks and destinations like Markha Valley, Lamayuru or Thiksey. Ladakh is love, I’ll definitely come back for more remote areas. Undoubtedly, with Yama Adventures )"
10,Yama_Adventures,Kamensind,,,,"We did a 10 day tour through Ladakh visiting Pangong Lake and Markha valley as well as some other attractions. Namgyal and the rest of Yama adventures were amazing. The guides and drivers were knowledgeable fun and excellent. But most importantly, the company was incredibly flexible. We modified our itinerary twice, once our trip had started due to unforeseen circumstances. Namgyal and the rest of his company were so helpful and understanding and reworked our trip to make it ideal for us. Would 100% recommend."

Would recommend this company without hesitation to anybody."

In this very short time I experienced an incredible stay thanks to Namgial excellent organization and support. I travelled solo and was very important for me to feel safe and able to interact as much as possible with local people. I enjoyed some beautiful landscape as Khardungla Pass, Pangong lake, Changla Pass. My smart guide and very expert driver gave me lot of interesting information about present and past life in Ladakh. I'll come back as soon as possible for a longer stay in order to complete my experience with some trekking and/or motorbikes rides. I strongly recommend Yama adventure and Namgial!"

2,Yama_Adventures,Jody G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Six Summers of outstanding support,"After six seasons running small groups in Ladakh for monasteries and  trekking, nothing but respect and deep affection for Namgial and his entire team. Whether booking excursions to monasteries or planning lengthy treks, details are handled flawlessly and always with politeness. Things change quickly in Ladakh--perhaps His Holiness the Dalai Lama is in town, or maybe there has been a landslide across the middle of your trekking route. Namgial and his team make sure that you can change your plans as needed. The trekking guides are very knowledgable and if you trek your every need will be taken care of. Cannot say enough good things about Yama Adventures and their wonderful staff."

6,Yama_Adventures,santi w,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Yama adventure is the best way to travel around…!!,"Three years ago I’ve been to Ladakh. This trip was my second time travelling to Ladakh with friends. We choose Yama Adventure again as our organizer since we were happy with their arrangement and services.Namgial, the owner of Yama Adventure, is a professional and very well organised. He looks after his clients very well. During our stay in Leh, He visited to our hotel every morning just to say hi or discussed about the tour and the trekking needs. He would accommodate our concern for the trekking, discuss it with us and make alteration for the itinerary if it’s necessaryOn my first trip to Ladakh I have done overland trip from Srinagar to Leh and I really enjoy it. So in this trip I want to try Markha Valley trek. It will take 6 days and 5 nights. I am so excited!! Before we start our trekking, it is necessary for me to get use to with the altitude so I did sightseeing around Leh and visited to some places like Lamayuru, Nubra Valley and Pangong Tso.Jigmet, our guide, on this trip is a very friendly guide. We had him as our guide from our previous trip. His abilities as a guide have met our expectation. So we’re happy that we were able to meet again in this trip. When we were in Lamayuru, we had the opportunity to meet Jigmet’s family. He introduce us his famiy who are very welcome. We’re so lucky be able to meet his family and taste their local drinks. It’s nice that we’re able to meet his family and see how they live. It’s warm our heart. Jigmet knowledge of the local attraction is excellent. He is also very patient with us during our trekking. As a group leader he is able to read the situation very well. He would discuss any problems that arise during our trekking. We also blessed that we got a very good crew member. During our trekking we had 3 cooks and 2 horsemen who took care of 12 horses. Those horses are the one that carry all our food and equipment. Ram, Rafi and Laksamana are amazing cook. They always surprise us with the food they gave us. Sometimes I feel guilty to eat what they had prepared for us because the food presentation was very pretty. Not just pretty but they are also very tasty. What surprise us the most was on the last day of our trip they can provide us a CAKE!! I don’t know how they made it with their limited cooking facilities at the camp site. Every day during our trekking trip, Laksamana would wait for us at certain point patiently.One of the memorable moments for me is on the 4th day when we were so late to get to our camp site. We’re already so tired from the walking and we just wanted to stop and tried to catch our breath. From where we stood we could see our camp for the night. It might be only about 10 or 15 min walk to the camp. Unexpectedly, I could see someone running towards us with the smile in his face. Apparently It was Ram. He brought us pineapple juice. I was so happy to see him and I think that the best pineapple juice that I’ve ever had. I could not say thank you enough to Ram! Whenever we reached our camp site, there always plenty of snacks and warm drink were ready to welcome us. The crew member always tried to give us what we need and make us comfortable during the trip. When we were in Nimaling, the place was windy and cold. So we were worried that we might not be able to sleep because it was too cold for us. However, they made something to warm our sleeping bag. They made a hot water then put the hot water in the rubber hot water bag. That rubber hot water beg helped us through the night. We could sleep comfortably. I love all the small things that they have gave us. I would say thank you to Yamatreks, Jigmet, Ram, Rafi and Laksamana. You are very helpful during our trip to Markha Valley. Again, you have made our trip one of the most memorable. "

It’s was the best ‘stumble’!  We (6 of us) arrived on May 21st from Kuala Lumpur and enjoyed a 3day acclimatisation which is crucial as you fly in at 3500m. Every care was taken by YA from the word GO! Trekking started on the 4th day after hotel breakfast and therein our adventure truly began. Together with our entourage of ponies, donkeys and crew, we embarked for 7 days on the most scenic, breathtaking and unforgettable trek any of us had ever seen.The Markha Valley is by no means an easy trek, but the dedication, friendliness, patience and smiles of the crew and our beloved guide Jigmat, helped ease our journey. Not to mention an array of food served piping hot at every mealtime become a routine of some sorts, with us looking forward to after a hard long day of trekking. My sincere gratitude to Namgial Rinchen and Jigmet who saw to every detail in making our 10 day adventure of a lifetime an unforgettable beautiful and humbling experience. Jit Furrah"

9,Yama_Adventures,Travel6956,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,"Mesmerising Leh, Ladakh","One word to describe my experience with Yama Adventures is, WOW! Leh, Ladakh experience was simply mind-blowing. It’s tough yet worthwhile. Excruciating yet rewarding. One must experience the Beauty at least once in your lifetime. The scenery is breathtaking and accomplishing the mission is better than winning a Jackpot coz I did it on my own. I had very little knowledge of high mountains, experienced altitude sickness, bleeding nose yet I was determined to scale the heights and now when I think of my maiden trip, I am left mesmerize by nature’s charm. I'm determined to pay my respects to the beautiful Mountains where God lives again.A big Thank you to Mr. Jigmet who patiently accompanied me and my group throughout the journey, Organizer of the trip Mr. Rinchen Namgial and all his Sharpas. Yama Adventure took good care of us in terms of safety, lodging, and food plus accommodated to our ad-hoc changes. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart.😘🙂"
0,Yama_Adventures,Chris Cuthbertson,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Highly recommend - very reliable and honest!,"I booked a tour with Yama Adventures, a local tour company in Leh. RInchen Namgial, the Owner, (namgial@gmail.com  Cell: 00919419178763) is spectacular, reliable and a very nice man. One of the main ways I decide on a tour or guide is whether they get back to me with my questions via email. I am a solo (woman) traveler so honesty and reliability are my top priority!Namgial has a great reputation and he has definitely earned it. He is honest and was “on the minute” on time at every turn. He was waiting for me with one of his drivers at the airport when I arrived, so I felt immediately comfortable.I had the same driver and guide for the entire 6 days. The driver was very experienced and I felt safe.   The tour guide was packed with local information and really loves Leh, where he lives. There was nothing I asked that he couldn’t answer! I highly recommend Yama Adventures without a doubt. I had a wonderful time. You will not regret traveling with this company.I would like to add that the internet is only “so-so” reliable in Leh and surroundings, especially in the mountains so it can take a few days to get through and for them to get back. They are working on a better server system in Leh."

0,Yama_Adventures,Yeniwati T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Adventure of a lifetime,"This is my second time with Yama Adventures, first time was on 2015. This time we spent 13 days exploring Ladhak ( 5 days sightseeing, 6 days trekking to Markha Valley and 2 day of resting). All the trips was very well organized, great service and full of warmth. Starting from preparation about 8 months ago, Namgial (the owner) always very responsive and will explained all of our question, He was always accommodating what our group requested. Specially during our 6 days trekking to Markha Valley, we (6 person) felt very comfortable and happy. The service (equipment, crew, guide, foods) was very satisfying. The Crew was taking good care of us. As most of us is quite new on trekking, the guide is patiently lead us to complete the trek and continuously encouraged us with his motivational words. The foods provided during trekking was SUPER GOOD, it's beyond our expectation. They made pizza, beautiful salad, tasty soup, momo, fried chicken, and delicious cake, etc. In between there was cookies or fruit with our favorite Ginder+Lemon+Honey tea. We are also surprised on the last night, they provided a bag of hot water that we can hug so we will felt warmth during the night as it was very cold, even though we already have sleeping bag and fleece. The scenery was amazingly beautiful. We enjoyed every single moment and it was a truly memorable journey to us. Our guide (Jigmet) was very experienced and good, he is the best. So if you want to experience the best of Ladhak, make sure you contact Yama Adventures."

Angmo, our young guide at Leh was very knowledgable and friendly that it was a pleasure spending the day with her.Not only were they checking on us each day, Namgial was very open and flexible to changing our prefixed itinerary due to  health issues and suggested enjoyable alternatives.

4,Yama_Adventures,Twouscyclists,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Outstanding Attention To Detail!,"My husband and I needed to modify the usual Markha Valley Trek, due to not acclimatizing well after arriving in Leh.Namgial and his Team have been phenomenal to work with, since we first made contact, at the recommendation of friends, after their successful trek.All the logistics before, during, and after the trek worked smoothly, and Namgial was able to flex the schedule when we needed a later start to allow proper acclimatization.We lucked out and had Jigmet as our guide. He is a a great manager of the Team, he knows the route very well, and is an open & honest person, whom we fully trusted.We trekked through small villages, saw beautiful landscapes of varying colors and formations. The food was tasty and plentiful, and we were impressed with the variety despite the basic cooking facilities at the camp sites. We highly recommend Yama Adventures, and the Markha Valley Trek!!Namgial also made arrangements for us to visit Agra & the Taj Mahal after the trek.Please know that internet service in Leh is limited, and at times not working. Namgial will get back to you, but there could be a delay not due to any fault of his."

6,Yama_Adventures,HuongNguyen233,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Our great Ladakh trip,"Yama Adventures helped to bring us an amazing trip in Ladakh with their dedication and thoughtful service. Namgial (the owner) has made us feel comfortable with his calmness, warmth and good solution (as he found out our next trip to Spiti Valley has a bit of unreasonable travel time) while Jigmet (the tour guide) is really dedicated and took care us well, especially when some of us got AMS. The driver is also really cute and kind, even though he doesn't speak much English but he also made us feel comfortable with his smiles and kind gestures. overall, I would recommend Yama Adventures if you want to have a trip in Ladakh. their service mind will add a big plus to your trip and make it as much pleasant as possible."
7,Yama_Adventures,Valerie G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Unforgettable Kala Patthar/Everest Base Camp trek,"I trekked as part of a small group on the Everest Base Camp route some years ago with Yama Adventures. Yama Adventures made this truly a once in a lifetime experience. From start to end the arrangements were handled smoothly, professionally, and with great consideration to the individual traveler’s needs. I was the lone female in this group, but always felt safe and included. The entire staff did an amazing job. The food was excellent and varied. Camping spots were well positioned and the equipment and porters were very good. The Buddhist monasteries and cultural features in the area are fascinating. A main highlight of the trip was hiking to the summit of Kala Patthar (18, 514 feet). The climb was well planned. We began hiking before dawn, reaching the summit in time for spectacular sunrise views of Mt. Everest and the surrounding peaks. Throughout the trek I was impressed by the attention given to each customer’s personal well-being. I would not hesitate booking future travels with Yama Adventures. The cost of the trek I took with Yama also was a very good value for the services provided compared to other companies I researched."

Previously we booked a trip to Pangong Lake with Yama Adventures with a journey that was as amazing as the colour of the lake itself and we were happy for Rinchen to organise our permits then and now.He is extremely knowledgable about the area and any trips that interest you and gives you those snippets of information about the culture that makes you want to return. And he just has that easy manner that makes you feel comfortable, especially when you're sitting in his coffee shop with him and smelling the great coffee and eating apricot cake.  We may decide on a future booking to Stok Kangri, and if we go we will go with Rinchen as we trust him completely and know we will have an enlightened and fabulous time.Ladakh is spectacular - verdant villages nestled amongst moonscape mountains. You will not regret going or using Yama Adventures."

7,Yama_Adventures,Pik Fong T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,Enchanted Ladakh,"My friends and I (a group of 5) visited Ladakh last August for 8 days. We had an unforgettable trip in Ladakh. Ladakh is gorgeous... seduced us with its enchanting view, peaceful atmosphere, and the charm of friendly Ladakhis. We covered all the must-visit places in Ladakh, from Alchi, Likir, Thiksey Monasteries to the first, second, and third highest motor-able passes (Kardungla, Chang la, and Taglang la). From Nubra Valley, Pangong lake, and Tsomoriri lake. The views along the way to those destinations were awesome and breathtaking. We are so grateful to have Richen Namgial, the owner of Yama Adventures to have made this happen. There was an incredible amount of rigour and attention to detail in designing the itinerary. Namgial made sure that we could experience the best of Ladakh.However, the single, greatest thing about Namgial and Yama Adventures was the kindness they had. Namgial was attentive to all of our concerns, and was deeply concerned in ensuring we were happy and safe. Namgial was also sincere in trying to make us comfortable at the high altitudes. Additionally, our guide, Nigmet Jorgais Khema is nice and kind, and our chauffeur, Tsering Nurbo is a marvelous driver. In conclusion, Yama Adventures was truly committed in giving us the best possible experience during our trip. From the planning to execution, everything was perfect. I don’t think the trip could’ve been so great without the help of Yama Adventures. I strongly recommend Yama Adventures!"

The guide for this part was awesome. Overall, there was a huge attention to detail by the owner Mr.Namgial and this made all the difference. Would love to go back one day and do a longer trek.

The Markha Valley was gorgeous, although I daresay a decent level of physical fitness is required for the trek, especially if not used to trekking at such high altitudes. The views of the valley and the surrounding mountain ranges were amazing, and the locals we met along the way were friendly and polite. Namigal and his crew were wonderful and took good care of us during the trek, making sure that we were safe, well rested and well fed. This comes highly recommended!"
2,Yama_Adventures,jennacjohnson,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Trekking and Culture Trip Perfectly Curated,"My husband and I had 9 days to spend in Ladakh and wanted to the make the most of trekking time. Namgial recommended the 6-day Markah Valley trek, which we found astoundingly beautiful with the right amount of physical challenge. Our guide, Nawang, and support folks, Bim, Stanzin, and Jigmet, were experienced and made our trip both special and totally stress-free. Namgial was responsive, despite difficulties inherent in being located in Leh (internet/phone connection). When my husband became ill (with a run-of-the-mill flu), Namgial arranged a physicians visit and worked with us to adapt our trekking schedule to make the most of our time.  I would definitely recommend Yama to anyone interested in a Himalayan getaway."

I was fianlly able to realize this dream this summer.  Rinchen Namgial and Yama Adventures helped me plan the perfect trip for myself and two friends.  We were able to find the right mix of treking, Buddhist culture, village life and norhtern India because of Rinchen Namgial breadth of knowledge and experience.  After we arrived, we needed to make adjustments in the itinerary and Namgial was fantastic about finding flexibility where we needed it and ensuring we still met our travel goals.  We were especially lucky to have jigmet as our fantastic guide to Buddhism in Ladakh as well as village life and traditional Ladakhi culture.  He was a fantastic and patient guide.  I cannot recommend Yama Adventures highly enough."

We enjoyed every interaction with Namgial.  The itinerary was extremely well designed, reasonably priced and choice of hotels suggested were awesome.  We had to change the itinerary and hotels in between as one of our member was unwell and had to be admitted in Leh hospital.  Namgial coordinated all the changes, ensured that hospitalisation is taken care of, he organised food for hospital visitors, stayed back and regularly interacted with hospital staff and did everything to make our stay memorable.  I cannot imagine a tour coordinator going over board to this extent.  He didn't charge us for any of these changes.  Gem of a man.  He would visit us everyday in Leh to enquire our plans and suggested multiple options to suit our need.His niece Anu (Mingur Angmo) guided us during our local Leh tour.  She was amazingly good.  Well educated, passionate, friendly and patient.  She assisted us in local shopping as well.I would recommend Namgial anytime, and look forward to take his services for other tours where possible."
6,Yama_Adventures,Bridget K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Couples,3 day trek: Spitok to Stok,"We had a very nice trek with Yama Adventures. Because we only had a few days in Leh, we needed to do a shorter trek and Yama Adventures had just the right one for us. Namgial arranged everything for us and came to our hotel the night before we left to go over everything in person. Our driver picked us up from the hotel and we hiked along the road for the first day. We started off with our guide, Nawong, kinda in the middle of nowhere, then went up into the valley toward Stok mtn. He made sure we were going at a comfortable pace and pointed out animals or interesting features of the landscape. Our first night was spent in Jing Chan at a home stay. We were informed that it was going to be basic accommodations, and that is exactly right. There were mats on the floor to sleep on and the food was very, very simple. (This is the main reason for the 4 stars. I had thought that the food would be a little more varied and might have supplemented had I really known the limits of the home stays)The second day was the shortest and we hiked 3-4 hours to Rumbak. We could have done a little extra walking to Yurutse, but decided not to since we wanted to conserve our energy for the last and most arduous day. The homestay at Rumbak was quite nice and there was more space to spread out. The food was nicer here and our room had thicker mats to sleep on. The third day was tough! We climbed up to 16,000ft and made it over the pass. It was a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains and we saw a lot of animals on this day. Nawong was so helpful and even carried my small pack for a bit since I was really tired at the end of the day. We walked a total of 10 miles and were so glad to have finished the trek. We ought to have stopped a bit sooner to have lunch, but its customary to eat the mid day meal around 2pm - which is about when we ate, but I should have asked to eat earlier since we had eaten breakfast at 7:30am. Our driver was waiting for us in Stok and took us directly back to our hotel."

He is kind, knowledgable, and able to make anything possible!  I have used Yama Adventures multiple times for trips in Ladakh and each experience has been a true pleasure.  Whether trekking, visiting villages, or seeing the sites, we were provided above and beyond with everything we needed.  We had great cultural information and felt safe, particularly with the great drivers that kept us safe on the mountain roads.  10/10 would recommend for any travel in the Himalayas!"

We (2 adults & 2 kids under 12) made the right decision by choosing Yama Adventures to handle this trip. Namgial, the owner, has shown us sincerity and kindness as true as Ladakhi hospitality. He took care of everything from our houseboat in Srinagar, transportation, accommodation, meals, helped us in changing our itinerary in the last minutes (since we were too tired to go to Tso Moriri as planned, we cancelled it and go for Leh city tour instead), changing our flight (we decided not to go back to Srinagar to fly to Delhi but took new flight from Leh to Delhi) and even visited us almost every night just to make sure that we are as comfort as can be.And all of that without charging us any extra fee! He treat us like a family and prepare everything to ensure we could experienced the best Ladakh trip ever. You'll be in the right hand with their experiences and expertise in arranging any trip in Kashmir and Ladakh. Thanks again Namgial, keep up the good work!Tips : if you are foreigner that doesn't really fancy Indian food, please be prepare and bring your own instant food, since you will be exploring villages and isolated places where there are not any international food available but simple Indian vegetarian dishes. And also bring enough jacket. Even in the heat of the summer, some places in Ladakh are as cold as winter with snow & rain."

While I was planning our trip from home, the owner, Namgial, was very helpful and responsive via email and helped me to plan all aspects of my trip. He even helped to book out air tickets from Delhi. We had time only for a short trip to Ladakh and due to permit issues, we could not visit Nubra or Panggong. However, Namgial and guide Jigmet offered many alternatives which still made our trip very memorable. We were taken river rafting and also to various off-the-beaten path areas. Jigmet and driver  Stanzin were both very professional, knowledgeable and caring about our safety and health. The accommodation which were recommended were also great. What I really liked was that our itinerary was super flexible - we could decide what we wanted to do on the very day itself, which is a perfect fit for my travelling style. Highly recommended!!"

He modified the itinerary until it all fits our requirements and we had so much fun and great experiences from what he offered. All the accommodations that he contacted for us are really good especially Mahabhodi Choglamsar. Our tour guide, Jigmet, was also exceptional. He got all our requests during the journey fulfilled. He cared so much about how we felt and what we wanted to do in each place we went, the surroundings, the accommodation and the food. His knowledge on landscape, cultures and religions were eye-opening.

Ladakh was magnificent, and Yama's staff are quintessentially Ladakhi. In other words, incredibly kind, and generous. The option I chose was the 10 day trek in the Markha Valley, and Yama delivered everything they promised at a great price. My guide, Georgi also imparted his significant knowledgeable on Buddhism which added to the experience. As I expected, the facilities were basic. There is no plumbing or cell service and very limited electricity in the Markha Valley. This trek is best for those with high-altitude trekking experience, are in decent shape, and want to experience peaceful, grounding bliss. Lastly, Yama also owns a cafe, Yama Cafe? that was one of my favorite casual hangouts in Leh."

Hard to stand there / on this height more than 20-30 minutes is injurious to health who are exploring the height first time.Reaching Leh not so exciting as we used to feel when reach to other hill station.

9,Yama_Adventures,Oycejay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Trekking with great aloo!,"My sister and I went on an 11 day a camping trek through the Markha Valley and above with Yama Adventures.  What a great group to go with! Rinchen Namgial (the owner) was amazing--he took care of every detail and he even had fresh vegetables delivered to us in Chilling (about 4 days into the trip)!  Our guide Jignet was incredible and very knowledgable about Buddhism.  He made it possible for us to connect with the people living nearby, including showing us how to make yak/goat butter in the Nimling Valley.  If you want to go for a shorter trek, you could do homestays, but I would still advise going with Yama and a guide so that you could communicate with the people you are staying with.  Because we were going in areas where there were no homestays available, we traveled with a guide, great cooks, a pony man and his horses.  While it seemed a bit much for just the two of us, it wasn't too expensive and we had a great time, with all of us playing cards in the evenings.  We saw great monasteries before and during the trek.  The food was amazing--with incredible curries--how the cooks managed to make piazza and bake a cook on a propane burner is beyond me!  You couldn't go with a better, friendlier group than Yama Adventures!"

His team on the trail Lobsang and Ram are excellent, every detail is covered including the early morning pick up for my last morning in Leh. If you're looking at this beautiful region for short trek or long trek, it's great to deal with a local company to put your mind at ease among the myriad of tour operators."
1,Yama_Adventures,zanyzoie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Solo,A remarkable experience!,"I have chosen Yama Adventures based on reviews here. I couldn't agree more to all the positive things about Rinchen and his service. My Markha Valley trek was organized by Yama and I didn't expect to enjoy every single moment of it. I wanted to do camping and Richen made that possible without having to use horses or donkeys. Instead, I had 2 local guides with me: Rigzen and Tundup. Both were incredibly kind, supportive, informational and hilarious. As a solo traveler, Rinchen suggested few options of how I can see and enjoy the best of Ladakh. I trusted him and didn't have any doubt that he'll provide me with an exceptional service. I also did a 6 day sightseeing tour with Yama covering the famous lakes, Nubra Valley and a little detour to see and experi ence another small but thriving village. Oh, it was as if I was dreaming. There's no words to describe how magical Ladakh is. Look no more. You'll be guaranteed an exceptional and honest service from a true born Ladakhi. Best regards!"
2,Yama_Adventures,Travelling_Louise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Don't trek with anyone else,"We had an excellent  trekking experience with Yama Adventures who were super organized and professional. They took care of every detail. One of our party changed his mind and decided to do the Markha valley trek after all after Rinchen organized a riding horse and equipment that he needed such as a sleeping bag. Our cook, Ram, was excellent and served an entirely different and delicious meal every night. The staff on the trek could not have been more accommodating, making sure that we were always comfortable.  Extra sleeping bags were provided in case we were cold. Our guide, Lobsang, even loaned us money on the trek when we ran out.  We also enjoyed our discussions with Lakhbar, a shirpa,  who spoke remarkably good English and who had met Sir Edmund Hillary. The trek itself was tough but we always felt safe and in good hands. Highly recommend this company."
3,Yama_Adventures,MissNolwenn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,It was a wonderful trek,"Namgial provided us a exceptional team with a cook, an assistant, an horseman and 6 horses! Our guide Jigmet explains us a lot about religion, politics, Ladakh ... It was ten days out the ""world"". Conditions are extrem in April but we have sunny mornings every days and we were well equiped. I recommend without restriction to make this trek with Yama!"

5,Yama_Adventures,Stewart J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,Simply The Best,"You are in very good hands when you travel with Yama Adventures. The owner Namgial is a lovely, honest intelligent man who runs a very professional outfit. He clearly attracts good people. That means everyone including his staff, local horsemen, drivers, guesthouse operators et cetera are all really nice people. In November 2015, five of us from Australia did a Yama tour in the Darjeeling area of India and in Bhutan.  A great holiday. Over the years, my partner and I have travelled with other operators as well as by ourselves in South Asia.  We have now done four trips with Yama Adventures and have no doubt that it is by far the best.  Every component of their tour is excellent - the staff are professional, knowledgeable and helpful ,lots of delicious food including on trek; good equipment; comfortable vehicles; delightful guesthouses providing clean and comfortable lodgings; and prompt and reliable transfers to and from airports and train stations. Namgial often looks at ways of making improvements to your itinerary as you go along. If a problem arises such as bad weather or sickness that may interrupt your program, he or his staff will calmly find a solution or a good alternative.  Namgial is not at all pushy and is happy to give you ideas on how you can visit other parts of India by yourself. However, it is well worth asking him if he can arrange it for you.  He knows things like how long you’ll need to see the point of interest, the best modes of transport and the connections needed.  He takes away the worry of booking the right domestic flights or express trains, and vehicle hire.  And his prices are very reasonable.  Whether you are brand-new or an old hand in India, give Yama Adventures a go.  You won’t be sorry.A tip - Namgial is based in Leh the capital of Ladakh, a high altitude area in the far north of India. If you haven’t been there, it’s a fantastic area for sightseeing, trekking and experiencing a remote Himalayan Buddhist culture and an extraordinary landscape."

7,Yama_Adventures,Michael M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,"Excellent organization, guide and team of our mountain trekking trip","We arranged for a Markhan valley trekking trip of 6 days/nights with Yama and set off after acclimatizing for 2 days in Leh. Our team was lead by guide Lobzang and further consisted of cook Bim, helpers Nubu and Jiggy and the horseman. This clearly was a great team.When it became clear during the first day that Markhan valley was not possible (people returning reported the river was impassable because flooded) our capable and experienced guide Lobzang offered a good alternative parallel route.When one of our team got altitude sickness during the trip and required a descent in the night, our guide Lobzang and one of the helpers helped her and husband down the mountain and to safety.Overall the trip was organized perfectly and challenges found on the way were met with creativity towards good alternative solutions. The crew and team were great people to be around, capable and very professional.Even in the middle of nowhere in the mountains the food provided and prepared for breakfast, lunch and dinner was of excellent quality and taste. We were surprised every day with great and creative food. Wonderful and almost surreal.The horses that carried the tents and most of the luggage were in good health and clearly taken good care off. The horseman set the horses free each night and has the incredible task of collecting them again from the mountain meadows each very early morning. But this guy was a professional that clearly loved his job and the horses he worked with. All in all the trip and team exceeded expectations by far. It's the best organized event that I have witnessed so far in India."

0,Yama_Adventures,jody-ji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Business,3 years happily using Leh's premier guiding service,"After three summers working with Namgial and the Yama team, I give them my highest recommendation—six stars out of five! I bring small groups of Americans to Ladakh each summer to tour Gompas, trek, and enjoy the beauties and wonders of this very special land. Namgial has found beautiful and comfortable guesthouses for us to stay. His staff, from guides to cooks to drivers, is professional, courteous, and knowledgable. In three years, I have not had a single complaint. The food is delicious, the accommodations comfortable, and the trekking perfectly designed for the groups. This year we needed to change our itinerary repeatedly due to weather related circumstances, and Namgial was swift and responsive in helping me to design and redesign our itinerary. He has also helped friends and students I know to design personalized trips for solo travelers. Yama is clearly the leader in travel in Ladakh, and you will not be disappointed."
1,Yama_Adventures,Matthias_Silke,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Couples,"Reliable, friendly and competent - Yama Adventures is a great tour organizer","We organized our combined two-week tailor-made sightseeing (Indus Valley Monasteries with stays in Alchi and Temisgam) and trekking tour (Markha Valley from Zingchen to Chang Sumdo) with Yama Adventures from back-home in Europe. Namgial, the competent and helpful owner of Yama gave us with his emails a good feeling that all would be ready once we reached Leh - and it was indeed so. Some changes had to be made to the schedule due to our health (adapting to altitude) and the weather, but that was no problem at all. On the tour, our guide Stanzin was an extremely warm, friendly  and resourceful company, both when organizing homestays, introducing local customs, visiting monasteries and on the trek. Our whole group (the excellent Nepali cook Bim, who surprised us with his dishes out of his tent kitchen and his son plus the Tibetean horseman) were fun to travel with.We would surely chose again Yama when travelling in Ladakh."
2,Yama_Adventures,kirti2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,leh and ladakh  just amazing,"laddakh, especially pangong lake  just beautiful, but one can be sure to take enough warm cloth and wollen cap is must. the view is just amzing . one can stay here for one night. but if with kids then avoid to stay in pangong lake. the food for vegetarian is only noodle.the next attraction is nubravally, the  road for reaching nubravally is wonder ful. . i think , bike riding is also a wonderful idea from leh but should be in group and only young person can do itthose who are interested to see monestry then leh laddakh is the best place for them. there are so many monestry in leh laddakh."
3,Yama_Adventures,RonnWen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Couples,Fantastic Trip with Yama Adventures,"We visited beautiful, breathtaking Ladakh for 10 days in June 2015 with Yama Adventures…….from our home town, Melbourne,  Australia at sea level. As retirees we were concerned about the altitude but had a sense of anticipation and adventure. Yama organised a road trip itinerary covering most of Ladakh, totally organised with great care for our welfare at altitude. Ladakh is one of the most beautiful places we have seen. Our driver Naawang  and Guide  Jigmet were so friendly, knowledgable and helpful and we found there was flexibility in our itinerary each day, they even took us to 6am prayers at a monastery.  Namgial kept making sure all was well. Don't go to Ladakh expecting the Taj and 5 star. Part of the beauty is it is unspoilt. Our hotels, food and all Namgial organised were excellent. We will travel with him again. And don't forget the Yama Coffee Shop. Our home town is the coffee capital of the world, Yama's coffee rates among the best we have had, and the cake is a perfect way to end every day."
4,Yama_Adventures,sublimetime,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Extensive trekking expertise,"Completed two separate treks with Yama Adventures and both were seamlessly organized and perfectly executed. In an area of India where road closures, landslides, bad weather, and trail closures are common having the Yama Adventures staff coordinate and suggest alternatives was a godsend. On the trail the guides were knowledgeable and thoughtful. They looked after everyone in the group. The cooks were amazing and spoiled us with endless dishes and hot Chai at every turn. Yama Adventures is an excellent guide company. Without hesitation we would use them again. "
5,Yama_Adventures,Dina S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Nice experience.,"I contacted Mr Namgial about a 3-day tour in ladakh. Once we arrived, he checked on us, wether we need anything to adjust for the altitude, which was nice of him to do, the guesthouse he booked us in was beautiful, I only have a negative comment about the prepared plan. For the first day we had to stay at the guesthouse to adjust to the altitude, which was okay for us, the next day we went to Thiksey, Hemis and shey monastries, they were beautiful, however the guide didn't know much about the practice, she just knew some facts and a general idea about buddhism, which left us a little confused. For the third day, pangong lake was planned we spent 6 hours going to the lake only to sit there for an hour and a half and head back to Leh for another 6 hours! So we spent 12 hours on the road, wasting half of the day when we could have been doing something useful! If it was planned on the second day, maybe stay there for a night then head to the monasteries for the third day, that would have been much better! But all in all, Mr Namgial is a good man, when we talked to him about this plan, he listened. So yeah."
6,Yama_Adventures,LondonTimetraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Friends,Excellent Service,"I travelled extensively with Yama Adventures in Ladakh, India (Sikkim, Darjeeling, Dharamsala, etc) and Nepal and always had a fabulous time. Trips and treks were well-planned, costs were very reasonable and the company was always convival, helpful and friendly. We saw some amazing sights and I learnt so much about local people. I would highly recommend them, especially Namgial who is an excellent tour guide, extremely reliable and honest, personable and knowledgeable."
7,Yama_Adventures,Kate-Adie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Relaxed and flexible people to travel with,"One thing I learned on this trip is that I am not a trekker. But I think Yama's boss Namgial sensed this way before my own revelation! It's not easy doing business in Leh. The internet goes down all the time. Roads close, flights are cancelled, clients get altitude sickness. All this happened to us and through it all, Namgial remained calm, patient and helpful. He sent my friend to the hospital for oxygen when we were being terribly British about making a thing about the altitude sickness. Our trek was pushed back without complaint because we were feeling ropey (definitely worth leaving a buffer around your trek in case it happens to you). Every driver spoke English and I was impressed when one pulled over during fog on the notorious Zojila Pass to let it clear (nice one, Prem). Our trekking guide Jigmet was fun, smart and as patient as his boss. He invited us for lunch at his family house and having butter tea churned by his mum was a highlight of the trip.We were on the Sham trek, a more easy route a couple of hours to the east of Leh that takes you through barren, hot mountains into cool, green oasis of villages. You reach passes marked by prayer flags before walking down into barley fields and apricot groves marked out by poplars.We stayed in homestays, but if you don't fancy carrying your gear, another option is to base yourself at Namra Hotel in Temisgam and do day walks. When you get to Leh, you're faced with row after row of tour operators. My tip? It's much more relaxing to let Namigal sort it all out for you before you arrive."
8,Yama_Adventures,yuhsie L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Amazing trip in Leh,"Yama Adventures arranged our trip in Leh (8 people), and we really enjoy our stay in Leh, everyday is a new adventure here :) . They have good services, great guide, know what they are doing, know the area very well and always think the best for their customers. Hope we can get back to Leh for another great adventures in the future. It is a memorable journey."
9,Yama_Adventures,Yeniwati T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Unforgettable journey,"We have been experiencing many challenges due to unpredictable natural condition like landslide, disconnected bridge, etc that made us change the route and rearrange for the whole trip. But Yamatrek and our guide are really doing their best to make sure that we can are arrived in Leh safely. Despite of these challenges, we are grateful that this trip becomes our lifetime adventures that we will remember always and glad that we have chosen the right travel agent.  Overall the whole science is very beautiful and the peoples we meet all is very kind and warmth. Another compliment is for Yama Cofffee Shop owned Yamatrek serve the best coffee in town and for delicious food they have. Our group felt very happy when we able to eat these delicious food like tom youm, pad thai, pizza, pasta, thai green curry and their fresh mango juice. For sure I recommended Yamatrek for arranging your amazing trip to explore Ladakh. And don't forget to visit Yama Coffee Shop if you are in Leh."
