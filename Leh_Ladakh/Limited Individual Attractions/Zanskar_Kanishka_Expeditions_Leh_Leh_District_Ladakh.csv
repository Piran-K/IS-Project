Thanks to the wonderful and extremely professional team! Our main guide Chozang and his team (Khenrab, Dorjay, Thukjey and Tsering) were the once who put all the energy into this FANTASTIC adventure.Besides the guidance they made WONDERFUL breakfast/lunch and dinner on the different spots we stayed over.This team has a very unique and perfect sense to the needs of their clients.They did everything in their power to make us feel comfortable which we felt from beginning till end.Intelligent gentleman’s with a great sense of humor and a big attachment with this region.  Also a big compliment to the manager of Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions, Lobzang. The communication was alway easy, fast and positive.

1,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,Linepau,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,trek in Zanskar,"Last summer, I went on a trek in Zanskar with friends and it was an absolutely amazing experience. The scenery in Zanskar is breathtaking, with towering mountain peaks and crystal clear streams. We were able to see a variety of wildlife, including blue sheep, and the local people were incredibly welcoming.The trek itself was challenging at times, but the sense of accomplishment we felt upon reaching the summit was indescribable. Overall, I would highly recommend this trek to anyone looking for an adventure in a beautiful and remote location. The scenery, culture, and sense of accomplishment make it an experience that I will never forget."

3,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,ReetamBanerjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Couples,Zanskar on your own terms at the best guidance and price,"Our Zanskar trip couldn't have been better arranged  Lobzang Sherap, the tour operator tailored our trip according to our customized plan, even accommodating late changes. He is a very gentle person who listens to you and gives the best guidance possible. Being a local of Zanskar region, Lobzang knows the entire area very well. He provided us with a comfortable Innova which was driven by the most saintly person we have met, Tenzing. He is a very skilled driver, who always keeps his calm, helps people on road, and also helped us going out of the way beyond his duty. He is very knowledgeable of Zanskar and Ladakh as a whole, and he is a local of Zanskar region as well. Lobzang even helped us make changes on the run, when we were stuck with a taxi union strike at Kargil, and made the necessary changes.I would strongly recommend ""Zanskar Kanishka Expedition"" anyone who is planning to hire the service of a tour operator for their Zanskar trip. You will get the best tour in an economic bespoke package."
4,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,Katharina G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,I will chose them for any future trip. We had a great experience.,"This is my third time traveling with Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions and I will continue to choose them for any future trip. After making two trips to Ladakh as the leader of a group, this year I traveled with my husband. Lobsang advised us knowledgeably and with good suggestions from the beginning of the trip planning. I appreciate him very much as a reliable tour operator at all times. During our trip, he was always available to us if we had any questions or a problem needed to be solved. Everything was well organized so that we could fully enjoy our great trip! For next year I am planning another group trip and I am already looking forward to working with Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions."

Highlly recommended.,"I wanted to spend a couple of weeks in Ladakh as an alternative to Tibetan lands in China and found the circuit Leh-Kargil-Padum-Leh even better than my Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu or Tibet experiences. The trip was well organised by Lobzang who made sure everything was going on according to the plan. Knowledgeable, competent, he's highly recommended to any traveller coming to Leh."
6,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,fayez k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 • Couples,Very dependable and professional travel agency to Leh -Zanskar,"I traveled with my wife to Leh -Zanskar with Kanishka expedition. We couldnt be happier. Lobzang, the owner of the agency is a Zanskary himself living in Leh. He has the best advise on where to go and not to go, which hotel is the best to book. We changed our itenerary many times to suite our need, Lobzang was always gracious to redo the itenerary and the pricing. Because we are photographers, Lobzang ensured we trecked through routes with best scenic views for photography. He was kind enough to get us homestays in villages like Purne where we experienced the life of the locals. There were times when we needed oxygen support owing to AMS and everything was provisioned for. Our driver and the guide were very knowledgeable and made us feel super safe. We highly recommed Kaniksha travels and will always chose them as our travel partners"
7,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,Fun&Adventure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Excellent company to book with.,"Working with Lobzang and his team has been a pleasant and painless experience.  Lobzang made up a great acclimatizing trekking for our attempt to summit Mentok Kangri on the shore of Tso Moriri.  We were blessed with excellent guides, top chefs and horsemen who did everything they could to make it as comfortable as possible in the harsh conditions of the mountains.  The used gear was of excellent quality, even on very rainy days we stayed dry inside the tents. I can surely recommend this company for trekkings and expeditions."

Lobzang met us up in our Leh guesthouse and gave us more information about the trip (beforehand already communicated with him alot via whatsapp)Knowing 2 of our friends are not so into trekking, Lobzang even arranged a guide to lead us to Phuktal Monastery. It was certainly good foresight and having a guide with us certainly makes everything easier and safer.Everything was great during the one week trip to Zanskar. Good accommodation, good vehicle and driver, nice and fun guide. A fantastic trip, planned and oversee by Lobzang. It can never go wrong. "

There were very few who were accommodating to our requests of covering all three of Zanskar valley, Nubra and Pangon. Lobjang and team not only ensured that our trip gets smooth with the iterinary, but also accomodate some last minute requests. Everything was very well planned and back up plans were also in place in case of any adversary.In Padum and Leh, hotel staff were known to Lobjang and took special care of us. special mention to Jigmet who was with us for the whole trip not only as a driverbut as a friend.Thanks to Lobjang and team for such wonderful memories."

9,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,claudia0104,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Couples,Good service....highly recommended,If you are planning a trip to Ladakh..one point solution is Mr. Lobzang for all guidance and bookings. In July'2021 I had visited with my 6 years' old daughter..he has helped in all situations..my daughter was not well in the beginning due to AMS and her oxygen level came down below 75 ..but right from checking with local doctor and then hospitalization..he helped a lot. Within couple of days we got acclimatized and then successfully completed the tour and without Mr. Lobzang and his mama Mr. Tenzing - it would have not been possible.We enjoyed thoroughly all parts and it will remain as life time experience. Thanks

12,,,,,,"It is always be someone's concerns when trek into mountains with altitude. However, Zanskar Kanishkar provides us the confidence with their well planning and caring.During our Markha valley trek, Lobzang's experienced team showed us their professionalism. They prepared very good camping gears. The thick form mattresses, army double zip sleep bags, and even hot water bags make us sleep in peace. The kitchen is even more fantastic. Every night, we have a 7 courses meal not even repeatingly for the 5 camping nights. Besides, our experienced guides always give stories about Ladakh, tips on how to take care of us with altitude, enjoy the journey the same as us etc..Talking about the safety, we always carry bottles of oxygen throughout the journey for any unexpected circumstances. We have extra horses during trekking for any emergency evacuation. All of those made a wonderful Ladakh experience for our tourmate. Do not hesitate to contact them for your next dreaming trip. Thanks Zanskar Kanishkar! Thanks Lobzang! See you again."
13,,,,,,"We booked the trip for 6 days. Lobzang had done the great job in helping us with the itenerary. The driver; who I forgot the name, had provided us with such an excellent service. He gave us good advices the whole trip and drove very professionally. Such a good team!!!"
0,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,Frances C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,An amazing 3 week trek in Ladakh!,"Tenzin organised a fantastic 3 week trek for us through the Markha Valley and the Chang Thang plateau, which was once part of Western Tibet. We walked over 400 km, and it was the trek of a lifetime! Our highly experienced guide, Angla was amazing- so kind, considerate and professional, as well as being extremely knowledgable on all aspects of the local area and culture. He was also terrific with our 14 year old son, and made an extra effort to cheer him up at the end of a couple of the more strenuous days, which we really appreciated. Gompo our cook was lovely and cooked us the most delicious high altitude meals you could ever ask for- we were amazed by the number and variety of dishes he was able to make on his tiny kerosene stove with what seemed like very limited ingredients! We especially loved his 'bed tea' every morning! I can't recommend this company highly enough- they were well organised, efficient and thoughtful, and we felt that we were safe and in good hands at all times, which is extremely important in such remote areas at very high altitude."
1,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,ssjain1988,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Cab Booking,We had clearly asked for Innova for our travel from Srinagar to Leh ladakh..But at last moment they deny innova saying that advance was not paid whereas the same wad never asked.. Post which they say we can stil do it at a higher price..It's amazing how can you change the price once the same is decided...
2,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,Lobzang S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Beyond Excellent,"Hello Sir, 

If you have not made the advance payment how can we send a Innova car from Leh to Srinagar which is 230 Kms away from Leh ???

and you have never clearly mention that you want to confirm the trip you have just made the enquiry and fro the enquiry we do not entertain until or unless you pay advance amount. 

So it is unethical to blame on others

We had limited days but Lobzang managed to organize a customized itinerary that covered everything we wanted. Though there were some accommodation issues at Pangong Tso, alternatives were quickly arranged.Our guide, Angla was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the region, culture & Buddhism. He took great care of us throughout our trip and made several stops to allow us to take in the breathtaking views of Ladakh as well as to take a few memorable snaps.Our driver, Angchuk was an experienced, safe and skillful driver. We had an amazing trip and we can't recommend the entire team at Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions enough. Thank you Lobzang, Angla & Angchuk for making this trip a memorable one."

7,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,jose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Incredible Chadar Trek,"We did exporing Ladakh tour. Angla was our guide. He was very knowledgeable about monastery and Ladalk culture, also very funny and very helpful. Noang the driver was very skillful on the high passes and helpful. We made a lot of stops for photos and drone video. Angla and Noang were very accomodative to our requests.It is recommended to go to Ladakh from May to October. But ladakh in March is beautiful in its own way as the mountains was covered in snow. If you go in winter, make sure to wear enough layers and have a good pair of shoes ( we had to change our socks every hour when we were on Khadungla pass). Going in cold season also beats the crowd. We even had Pangong lake by ourself."

An agency to be trusted one 100%Advice: If traveling to ZANASKAR it is best to do it with an agency from Zanskar. It is also fair to do so.

From the moment we arrived in Leh we felt extremely well looked after and got the sense that Lobzang, our guides Angla and Gawa as well as the extended proter team were all working very hard to make sure that our group had a great experience and a genuine look at Zanskar region and the wider culture. The equipment we were given to use was clean and in good condition. The homestays were ideal, the food was a minor miracle and when we needed help with a potentially serious medical situation, the team proved to be very efficient and professional. If you arrange a trip with Lobzang you will be in good hands and you will leave feeling that you have made new friends."

Angla and Gawa took care of all the small details, were very proactive with our needs and together with the porters they made sure we were very looked after. Even when we had a medical emergency, Angla and Gawa together with Lobsang in Leh coordinated perfectly all the team and the porters went above and beyond to evacuate with a helicopter the person needing medical treatment.I had the time on my life on the trek and Zanskar Kanishka team were a very big part why.

Travelling through Ladakh without knowing the roads and the conditions can cause lost of many hours/days.We had the pleasure of the personal care of Lobzang, every wish or problem immediately handled.I had a problem with my laptop, he took it tried to solve it, just amazing.The Ladakh area is one of the most amazing in India. Due to altitude and very short period that the weather allow enjoying this wonderful area, you need to plan it carefully. The people are mostly Tibetans , the views amazing, just call Lobzang and go there."

Everything was perfectly organised and went smoothly except for the weather as we experienced unexpected snow storms while camping in Reru Valley; nevertheless, the team of support people Lobzang had assembled for us did wonders to keep our spirits up and enable us to carry out or work in spite of the challenging conditions. However, in the end, we decided to leave Zanskar a day early due to the adverse weather conditions and once we were back in Leh, Lobzang helped us to fill our time by arranging a rafting trip along the Zanskar river and a visit to the beautiful Thiksay Monastery.I would recommend the Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions company 100% for a visit to explore Ladakh. Lobzang is highly professional, responsive to queries and challenges, and was able to accommodate the demands of our expedition perfectly."

I can only say great things about Lobzang, very responsive, flexible to any requests we had before and during our trip, highly professional knows very well the area, what is possible and what not and what can be achieved in one day or requires multiple days. We were able to see so many things during this relative short trip that for others it can take a month. Just as an example most agencies will suggest to go to Nubra Valley and return to Leh and then go to Pangong lake (this requires to traverse 4 times a couple of high passes), Lobzang was the only one who told me about the direct road from Nubra to Pangong, not only making the trip more efficient but also taking us thru one of the beautiful roads in Ladakh. If an issue came up during the trip he immediately took responsibility and found us an alternative solution in no time. In short I highly recommend his company."

He came to meet me prior to that at the guest house i stayed, and provided some very useful tips to deal with high altitude. I cant thank him enough for that : it made the whole trek absolutely enjoyable.He arranged everything to perfection : the guide, the porter, even the medicines in case needed (which I didnt). The guides were fantastic, and i thoroughly enjoyed the trek. After the trek was done, he also arranged a taxi to drop me at the airport, and it was complimentary. Now that was a pleasant surprise !!I left Leh with memories that will stay for me ever, all thanks to Mr lobzang. In fact i whenever i have to go to Ladakh, i will simply get in touch with him and be carefree !I would recommend Zanskar Kanishka expeditions without hesitation to anybody who wants to explore Ladakh.

They could not do enough for us and always made sure we were as comfortable as possible.A wake up coffee in the morning before breakfast (in a proper kitchen tent) tea and snacks after the days treking and really fantastic meals prepared by our cook meant that we looked forward to each meal, rather than dread it as has happened on other treks we've done. We were even given a basin of hot water every morning for washing.I celebrated my 50th birthday during the trek, and the cook managed to surprise me with a birthday cake, and the guide presented us with a bottle of wine, compliments of the company. Touches like this really make a difference to the whole experience. This is a professional company that knows what it's doing, and knows how to prepare for and run a trek. We had great service from start to finish, and we both whole heartedly recommend using them.George and Sonia ( Scotland)"

Thanks to Lobzang and Angchuk this was fulfilled in the month of August 2018. Lobzang organized an 8 day trip covering Leh , Nubra Valley , Pangong Tso and Tso Moriri. All the places chosen for accommodation were good. The pricing was economical and most importantly Lobzang took great care while we were in Leh. He even oversaw / took care of a few others from different other groups who were slightly affected due to altitude sickness. Lobzang would personally come and meet us and enquire about the trip etc. Our driver , Angchuk was a super friendly person who has a great knack and control in driving around the region. There were a couple of stream crossings where Angchuk showed his skill by leading the way and clearing the small rocks on the way , paving for a smoother journey for others along the route. We had a great 8 days in Leh and look forward to being there once again to experience the rich diversity , culture and natural heritage of the region. I would wholeheartedly recommend ""Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions"" for any of your trips in the Ladakh and Zanskar region. They are the best out there for both Indians and non-Indians. Go for it without a second thought and you will come back smiling !Keep up the good work, Lobzang !"

4,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,SeanXu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Your choice of expedition in Zanskar and Ladakh,"Julley!With the help from Zanskar Kanishka, we had a wonderful road trip (13 days) from Manali to Leh. We continues exploring the Ladakh range after that and joined the Hemis festival. What a wonderful journey. Zanskar Kanishka understands our needs and carefully planned accordingly, not only for the food, accommodation and transportation, but also providing oxygen to ensure we are safe on the road. The team sent to us is professional. Eventually we becomes friends in the end. Lopzang and Angla from Zanskar Kanishka are very familiar with all the trekking routes in Zanskar and Ladakh. Both of them are from Zanskar region. They know every village even every house there. With their help and advice, I did my trek for a month there. I am very confident that no matter camping trek or homestay trek, they will provide you the best service, out of expectation experience. Do not hesitate to contact them!"

Lopzang and his agency organized everything so well. We had a wonderful team with young men, always with a great responsibility for us, the horses and the group. The meals were fantastic, always fresh bread, different vegetables, also cakes and even sometimes pizza, all done on two fuel stove. Fantastic. All days were beautiful, the experience of Tenzin, who had lived 8 years in a monestry, he could explain so many things. We had a lot of fun with Sonam, Ninjung and Tenzin. Thank you so much for the 23 days. The price was very good!"

We had a short trip but were able to see so many beautiful places. The drive from Nubra Valley to Pangong was stunning! Lobzang came to get us at the airport and we were in contact regularly. The guides were very knowledgeable and felt very comfortable driving with them on the curvy twisty mountainy roads. The stays they arranged along the way were nice, clean, and good food. Excellent trip."

Lobzang was very helpful from the beginning when we were still planning the trip till the day we left. He is always very responsive to our e-mails, giving advice and adaptive to our requests during our preparation stage, and came to care about us to see how things go in between our trip.  Our guide and driver, Stanzin, was another great great person that we met and we were very happy to have him with us throughout the whole trip. He was full of humour, very informative and shared with us tons of information about Ladakh, which we learnt and understood the place more from him. He was also a super safe driver when we appreciated a lot, and you do not need to worry even you fell asleep (but of course you will miss the good views of the area...). He was also very meticulous that he knew our needs without telling him and he always tried his best effort in accommodating our needs and requests. I would definitely recommend Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions who are planning to travel in Ladakh and I definitely will go back to them if I visit Ladakh again."

Our journey was full of fun!"

They entire team including the porters and the support staff were very friendly and caring in true Ladakhi spirit. We were helped and guided by them throughout the trek. During the phase of the trek when the route became treacherous, they ensured that each one of us were taken care of. Special mention must be made of the travel guides Mr Aung La and Mr Gawa. The tour organiser Mr Lobsang also is very knowledgeable and is someone who is always present when the team needs no matter how silly the requirement is. Not to forget the delicious food provided by them during the trek. The tents and all other facilities provided by them was top class. Overall 5 stars to Zanskar Kanishka.

We face some damage path of ice which was not solid to go for, the guides team always help us to analyze the situation and lead us through using the safest way.We running out of stamina and feel fatique easily due to high altitude which we are not familiar of, the guides team helping us with our day pack, even at certain point they have to carry 2-3 bags at once and still doing the guiding job perfectly.Porters team always moving direct to either lunch point or camping point first as guides will always take care of us. But when they discover certain location that need more man power to ensure our safety, they stay back at the area waiting for us, and work along with guides to help us pass through one and one obstacles.Although having lesser interaction with porters team compare to guides, but from day to day and night to night, I do see and appreciate their effort not just carrying our stuff, but also building camp, cooking, boil water, serving and cleaning to ensure we have the best experience throughout the journey. Without these professional, I know we will not able to complete our itinerary and plan for sure. I am glad that our bonding in the end is not just business relationship, but had build up into close friendship! It was emotional when we are going to part way at the end of the journey!To Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions, thanks for the perfect trip with perfect guidance and perfect services! Recommended for sure!

2,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,Ping,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Solo,"Prompt Response, Customised Itinerary & Excellent Guide","I travelled to Ladakh (Zanskar Valley & Tsomoriri Lake) on a 14 days trip in August 2017. I contacted a few travel agencies and ended up selecting Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions as Lobzang was very prompt in responding and allowed for various customisation (changes in itinerary and my own hotel choice in Padum, Zanskar Valley). He gave a reasonable quote and most importantly was able to provide a female guide as I was travelling alone. The guide, Ms. Sonam Angmo was excellent and one of the best I ever came across! She speaks fluent English and could really preempt all the guest's needs. As we were travelling long distances on some days (6-13 hours car ride), she would prepare fruits and snacks to make sure I am not hungry. She knows that I like Thukpa (Tibetan Noodles Soup) so she got the Hotel to prepare Thukpa specially for me in addition to the standard buffet dinner. It was a joy to chat with her as she is really knowledgeable about the region and have so many interesting life experiences & stories to share. Angmo is also very resourceful. My original plan was to visit Zanskar Valley and the Aryan Villages Dha Hanu but due to landslides and roadblocks on the road towards Dha Hanu, we head towards Tsomoriri Lake instead. As the permit took some time to settle in Leh, on the first night at Tsomoriri Lake we arrived late in the evening with not much options and stayed in a rather shabby hut. Angmo could tell that I was not satisfied with the accommodation. The next morning, she immediately brought me to look for another place after breakfast. She used her extensive connections, pulled some strings and managed to get me a comfortable room with hot shower. It was peak tourist season and around India's Independence Day so I was very impressed.   Angmo is also really kind and helpful. At the guesthouse in Lamayuru, we met an Israeli couple and she helped to arrange transportation & negotiated a discounted price as the guest house owner could not speak English and the Israeli couple had 3 young children, alot of luggage and rather specific requests for the type of vehicle.Angmo have many friends & relatives in Ladakh and it is amazing as she got me access to many places that are not on a usual tourist route. An example was an invite into the teacher's quarter for tea at Puga Nomad Residential School as her relative is teaching there. Overall, I enjoyed the trip very much and a huge thanks to Angmo for making it so fantastic with her exceptional service & friendship!"

He helped me a lots and answer very clearly eg. plan the trip, book the hotels (some places such as Pangong lake and Tso moriri are vey hard to book the hotel because you have to transfer the money across the country for booking). I also have to transfer the deposit money to him to confirm my tour booking. Over 9 days and 8 nights at Leh, my driver (Nima and Tenzin) drove us to many beautiful places. They are very good in driving and very nice in term of service. If you plan to visit Leh, I recommend to book the tour with Zanskar Kanishka Expeditions and Lobzang will help you everything that you need."

Lobzang kept in constant email contact and given Ladakh's unreliable internet that was no easy task. His staff is experienced, friendly, professional and safe. From our guide Angla, fluent in English, we learned about Ladakh's history, culture and religion. Our cook, Gonbo, did a super job of preparing gluten free meals. Cholden proved to be a skillful driver on Ladakh's roads and found the 4X4 in good shape and comfortable. Our horseman was friendly and knew how to care and handle his ponies.For the first half of the trek we met up with the jeep at the end of the day at campsites and relied on ponies to porter gear and luggage on the second half. The different modes of transportation and pick up times were well-organized, punctual and dependable. The exceptional service to clients provided by Lobzang and his staff is why I highly recommend them to those travelling in Ladakh."

Not only the itinerary was stunning and varied, but the organization was perfect and the team kind and professional. First of all, I had an excellent contact by email with Lobzang to prepare and plan the trip.When you know how unreliable the internet connection is in Leh, it is quite a performance. Lobzang was very quick to reply, preparing detailed, well presented itineraries.During the trek, my guide had to go back to Leh for personal reasons, and a new guide arrived quickly to replace him without wait time or disrupting the trek program. Second, the 2 teams were simply excellent : our guides could speak very good English, they knew the best places to camp, were open to day to day slight program adaptations; the cook (the CHEF !) was 5 stars ; helper and horsemen very friendly and helpful. It is important to understand how important a good horseman is … if you do not want horses and your packs to be lost in the mountain.The 2 private transports by minibus and taxi, arranged to get to Kanji and come back from Korzok, were both comfortable and flexible. Overall, that was a memorable trip with outstanding service and supportI highly recommend Zanskar Kanishka Exp agency. Lobzang, many thanks again from the 3 of us. Take care. Kind RegardsRemi"

There was a lot of driving, 7-9 hrs a day. Our assigned driver Sonam, while still young, was polite and knew the routes well, even on roads that didn't appear to have any track.

During the trip, due to altitude sickness, we have difficulty with the trip, and Lobzang's flexibily has helped us to have a pleasant trip. The choice for his guides is also excellent, we highly recommend Stanzin, chubby guy (driver), Gyatzel (Guide), Tenzin (helper) and Thiring (Chef) if they are available. His choice for the homestay in Leh is excellent, we stayed in a Ladakhi homestay (Dream Ladakh) and received really warm hospitality.

They're very friendly and service-minded and experts in the area. The supporting staff, like guides, cooks, porters or horse men are really friendly and helpful and fun too, but also very experienced and come from the region! So that means that during trekking you often pass by family members and also have a tea in a local house which is great for the local experience.I did already 2 times the Chadar trek with them and got always great help from Lobzang Sherap during the tours and with the staff, I had the best tours. Lobbying Sherap always tries to help you with good advice and try to reply the emails in time but the problem with Ladakh is that the emails not always working so even if you don't get reply sometimes it's because of the internet system. If that's the case, then in the worse case, he can help you later when you've arrived in Leh and you go and see him in the office (in Summer Time).  He always can help you with designing your tour or excursions, trekkings and he and his staff member are the most friendly & experienced group as you can imagine!So get the best out of your Ladakh & Zanskar & Spiti experience and get your stay organised by Zanskar Kanishka Expeditations and contact Lobzang Sherap!"

Contacting Lobzang 5 months ahead of time from Thailand; he has helped managed it through, by responding in timely manner via email, which I found out later that Internet was hardly available in Leh.  Once we arrived Leh, 4 out of 5 luggages did not show up!! Lobzang helped coordinate and drove us to pick them up the next morning to ensure we would start our Leh experience at the very best and we really appreciated that. Since we focused on culture, Shozang was our tour guide. He was well-rounded in history and religions, especially Buddhism, dynamic with advanced trekking skills. Our driver, Nima, a young energetic driver worked well with Shozang to get us through traffics up on mountains and ensured we had a good time traveling on super winding mountainous roads on high altitudes.  Driving through villages and monasteries, we learned new things everyday. Thanks to Shozang and Nima. All and all, we finished the cultural tour with big smiles, though the weather was unexpectedly colder than we thought. Wish to have more time to learn more about Ladakh 😄😃I would recommend anyone interested in traveling to Ladakh to contact Lobzang. He definitely gives you good advices on how to make the best Ladakh experience. "

10,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,bnapthine,,,,"We organized our trip locally (in Leh). We got good advices and short-term services from Lobsang Sherap (i.e. going to Pangong lake.)  This was our third trip supported by Kanishka (included Shingu-La trek, Zanskar, Tso Moriri and Spiti visits) All trips were indiviually planned and organizations worked well.Special Thanks to our  Shingu-La guide Stanzin Gawa and his team - the are best carer on my varous asia trips.Maybe they are not so cheap (I am not sure), but service surely is!"
11,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,j_paul_murzin7,,,,"We appreciated the reactivity of Lobstang (we needed to change our plans 10 days before leaving), his understanding of our needs and his additional advices about tips and the last part of our trip (Manali – Dehli). We felt secure during the entire trip with our guide Sonam and the special alimentation to resist altitude. The drivers were also excellent in very difficult conditions. New roads are flourishing. Don’t wait for visiting Zanskar with the help of natives Lobstang and Sonam !"
12,Zanskar_Kanishka_Expeditions,Gian Paolo P,,,,I had a wonderful trip in LadakhThe staffs are very friendly and helpful with all the information that you need to know
13,,,,,,I booked over the internet hoping everything would work out - it did and we had a fantastic trip. The company was very well run and the organization excellent. We wanted to tailor the trip to our needs and they happily did this for us. Our guide lacked some experience but the cook and others made up for this. In fact the food was amazing. I can highly recommend using Lobzang and this company. We were so happy after the trek we got them to arrange our jeep trip to the Nubra Valley.
14,,,,,,"Outstanding service , friendly and warm, well knows the Ladakh and Zanskar area and may propose circuits that change the marked trails"
15,,,,,,"Nice very helpful staff and l, good jeep and cars. Good accomodation even in extreme place.Just a pair of inconvenience for wheel puntured"
