0,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,Eric C,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020,"Visit on your own terms, preferably alone.","What an intensely obnoxious title. People live in Zanskar and there's nothing 'virgin' about it, except maybe it's had a lack of domestic indian tourists until recently.Who even created this item as a 'feature' in trip advisor? And why are there reviews?My advice: if you stay in your vehicle you won't see anything but dust. Hire local's who will find you horses to take up up into the remote valleys. The people that live here are amazing and the entire reason to visit is to spend time with them.Trip Advisor: remove this 'attraction', its a place with real people living there."

3,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,Martin B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Amazing place for adventurers,"The drive from Kargil up the Suru valley and then down the Stod/Doda valley to Padam and the Zanskar is world class.  Glaciers you can almost touch, isolated monasteries and exceptional scenary.  To raft or kayak down the spectacular  Zanskar gorge is on par with the Grand Canyon of the Colarado. "

Sometimes you see to the village or the mountains or an oasis. Very spiritually and good for you mind."

8,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,Moeinuk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,"If there is Paradise for Road Trips, its here!","We were out on a road trip to Ladhak. I joined a group of 8 in Chandigarh who were driving down from Bangaluru. We went up to Leh via Jammu & Kashmir and came down via Manali. Zanskar valley is out of this world. Great roads maintained by BRO (Border Roads Organisation) in a pristine, virgin valley, that hasn't yet been spoilt by human civilisation. "
9,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,Rajivglobaltraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Zanskar the Virgin Valley,"Zanskar the Virgin Valley is well-known as the 'land of white copper'. This valley is situated in Ladakh and has an elevation ranging from around 3,500 m to 7,000 m above sea level. It is considered to be one of the remotest regions in the world and has remained in veil till 1994. Opened for tourists coming to Ladakh from 1995, this place is situated along two rivers that meet in the plains of Padum Valley.It is one of the coldest regions in Ladakh, and witnesses a temperature of -400 Celsius during winter season. Local inhabitants living here stay very far from one another and take several weeks to travel to each others place."

1,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,Lovers_paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,The secluded Zanskar,"Bound by the Zanskar Himalayan range, Padum is the main district of the Zanskar valley. Padum is approachable from Leh via Kargil using an untarred road that leads you through the secluded districts of Sankhoo, Panikher, Parkachik  and Rangdum. The Nun and Kun peaks are clearly visible from this route as also the Drang Drung glacier which lies just after the Penzi La mountain-pass. Padum is virgin, untouched and amazing......an extremely blissful hideout in the Ladakh. "
2,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,royjay2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Remotely located Zanskar,"Zanskar is remotely located and not accessible to the normal tourist. The road to Zanskar from Leh cuts through Kargil when one needs to halt overnight. The road from Kargil to Padum in the Zanskar valley is treacherous but holds you spellbound with the scenic beauty. En route one crosses Rangdum and the Penzi La high altitude mountain-pass. Padum in the Zanskar valley is the final halt and the place gives ample peace of mind and a wonderful view of the Zanskar range of the Indian Himalayas. Hotels are few in the Zanskar as the place is still not preferred by Indian tourists owing to its remote location. As they say, either the best of friends or the worst of enemies visit Zanskar, such is the remoteness of its location."
3,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,lilsherpa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Always worth the trek,I am very saddened to see the road progressing to Phuktal.  This is going to change the trekking industry and greatly influence the rich culture of this region.
4,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,Anand G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Refreshing,The river has a soul of its own and the drive along side the river and walk around during breaks was quite refreshing during the grueling trip to Ladakh region where we had to cover too many things in 7-8 days. The beauty of the mountain peaks around and the silence make it a great feel.

An amazing place. Stark mountain beauty at its finest. We were hosted by one of our guides for lunch. We toured the monastery and Padum. We had local dancers entertain us outside in the sub zero temps. This is a winter fairyland that I am glad our tour company, Adventure Sindbad made part of the travel plan. We were here two nights before heading back to the Chadar to finish. "

2,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,NithinKrish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Chadar - a treacherous trail.....,"The most challenging and treacherous trail I have experienced in the recent past, Chadar really tests you to the fullest. Chose this trek wisely since the season you do this trek (winter) is the harshest at the time in entire Ladakh region. But if chosen to trek this beautiful valley through Zanskar then you have almost made to one of the best treks of your life. Winter in Ladakh region is harsh and the sub zero temperatures can reach as low as -30 to -35 making it difficult for your body to cope. Be prepared to face the extreme cold with adequate warm clothes and carry essential medicines to combat any discomfort during the trek. Daily trek of 10-15 kms with your backpack or rucksacks can be tiring so pack only essentials. Get yourself acquainted to sleep in sleeping bags.Chadar trek is mostly organized by well experienced trekking or mountaineering clubs and they should provide the details of do's and dont's well ahead of the trek. Have your trek planned with additional buffer days as the weather can get worse sometimes and the trek can be delayed or postponed or even in some cases can be cut short. There are frequent flights to Leh from Delhi and Srinagar and chances of these flights getting cancelled is a common affair during winter due to bad weather.Ladakhis are friendly and you can experience that in the trek crew or the porters who keep their spirits high to support you along the trek.Chadar trek has turned out to be one of the most memorable trek of my life and its one of the treks I recommend only for people who are fit and have a strong will to complete the trek.Your main enemy through out the trek is only the severe cold !!"

7,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,InMobi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Nature at its ridiculous best,"If your idea of travelling is just comfortable hotel stays and taxi tours, this place is probably not for you. This place is known for its mesmerising backdrops, untouched beauty, glaciers, enigmatic mountains and daunting trekking tours. The accommodation is seldom comfortable and you might not even get basic facilities like electricity and hot water for most of the day. You could start you journey to the Zanskar valley from Kargil and cross Panikhar, Parkhachik, Randum on the way to Padum. You will see a mixture of greenery, seas of sand, snowy mountain peaks and rocky hills on the way. Spare a day for an amazing trek up a glacier (Kangrez is beautiful). Visit this place if you love nature and aren't used to the 5 star comfort of luxury hotels. This place if for the adventurous and the tough."
8,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,Yashvardhan V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,A mesmerizing place!,"The Zanskar valley is a must visit on your trip to Leh. Due to its relatively low profile, there's less crowd here and is thus less spoilt by the civilization. A bike ride to the paths less taken really opens your heart and mind and fills it with wonder!"
9,Zanskar_the_Virgin_Valley,lotusdiamond,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Zanskar Valley.,Zanskar valley is very popular for trekking and famous among foreigners for long treks. You need to trek from Sangam to Zanskar Valley. It is supposed to be beautiful valley with nature wonders. You will be surprised to see old heritage buildings of Gompas and monasteries. Not much of facilities are available at this place.
