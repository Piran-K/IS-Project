1857_Memorial_Museum,Robert G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Great background to the history of the siege,"There's a more than a little poetic licence in the narrative of some of the exhibits; ""war of independence"" is stretching things somewhat, given that only one region of India was involved in the uprising, for example.However, the tragic history is well documented in the museum and the atmospheric ruins tell their story."

1857_Memorial_Museum,sumantra_travel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,"1857 Memorial Museum, 19 Sep'15","19 September, 2015.One of the prime highlights of our tour of the city was a visitto the 1857 Memorial Museum, co-located inside the BritishResidency, Lucknow. The small, but extremely well-maintainedmuseum does not allow visitors to take cameras, or mobile phonesinside the premises: the above items have to be left behind inlockers, located conveniently outside the pathway to the maingate. The museum is located centrally inside one of the mainbuildings in the British Residency. There are cannons outside theentrance. The museum chronicles the events in the First War ofIndian Independence, of 1857, in historical documents,photographs, lithographs, paintings, and arms and ammunition ofthe era. A number of historical maps also trace the chronologicalorder in which the events of the uprising happened, over the area.The museum includes a model of the Residency itself, in one ofthe rooms. One of the rooms has a bas relief of Ms. SusannaPalmer, who had died due to a cannon ball hitting the room: thepoint of impact of the shell in the building can still be seen."

1857_Memorial_Museum,Aloy M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 • Family,Reminds of the First War of Independence,A very good collection of the Historical artifacts from the vestiges of the Residency reminding of the war of 1857. A little cleanliness will be better appreciated. But the sheer historical importance of the articles displayed outweighs any other negatives. A must visit for any Indian to Lucknow. Reminds of at least the first Collective effort for the Independence by the Otherwise divided Indians!
