Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,Rohit B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,"Very grand, very majestic!","This place exudes power and grandeur in a sprawling expanse of Rajasthani stone work. The 80 odd royal elephants dot the backend of the park, while various other structures and monuments inside are all fantastic picture spots and a place to spend a lazy evening."
Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,Vidhata bache,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,Biggest monumental waste,"Biggest waste of environmental disaster, cement, steel, prime land, green space etc. What could have been done in rightly and duely in some 20000 sq ft is wasted in acres of land and greenery. No trees, no benches, just stone, stone and different stones, elephants, statues, open space exposing you to harsh weather. Monumental waste. Same money could have fed, educated, poor of UP."

Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,krishna292,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,No Park only a Memorial with Stone Statues,"After checking out from Hotel Hilton we planned to visit Dr Ambedkar Memorial Park  before taking our flight for Delhi as we had heard a lot about it being one of the modern tourist attractions. The memorial has been made in the memory of Dr. B R Ambedkar,  one of the most popular social reformer and famous lawyer who drafted Indian Constitution after independence. That is why many people visit it and we also wanted to visit it. The credit for the construction of the memorial goes to the top leader of a political party of downtrodden and backward masses who had come to power in the State of UP. During our earlier trips to Lucknow about 45 years back, we had seen various well known historical monuments like Chota Imambada, Bara Imambada, Residency etc. and so we did not want to go there. However, after reaching the memorial we were disappointed to see its vast Lay out of stony statues. It is not a park and to go around the whole area of the Memorial during a a warm day (even in the month of March) is very tiresome, particularly for senior citizens. The time of our visit was around 11 AM and because of stony structures every where, without any shelters, we felt very uncomfortable. There is no greenery or shelter in this so called park for visitors to have some respite. The memorial occupies a large area with stony statues of elephants and icons of some leaders also. There are several stoops and structures with inscriptions. There are a large number of elephant statues and even these elephants have been made on the top of towers spread throughout the park., because elephant is the symbol of that political party. Whosoever had designed this Memorial should have taken care to plant trees and shelters from rains or sun. As such, this place should only be visited in evenings or on cloudy days. Because of shortage of time we did not go inside the halls and galleries exhibiting items in the memory of political leaders and social reformers of India."
Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,Niket Kumar Dixit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,"Amazing Memorial, but definitely not a park","Architecturally this is an amazing place. Opulence reflects in the way this is constructed. This is the legacy of this city, however found that maintenance and security wise, I found this to be not well treated. Thing to note is either visit this memorial in morning or evening that too till 4 PM, because in afternoon you would not find any trees or greenery here and it will be too hot. Ideally this is a memorial and not a park. But it is good place, a must visit if you are in Lucknow. Time to visit 11 - 4 PM, visit on a not so hot day and keep around 2 hours for this memorial."
Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,JoyBose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A clean and well maintained park containing statues of Dalit icons and a Buddhist stupa,"This is a huge park, built in Gomti nagar Lucknow by the previous chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Smt Mayawati. It is one of the tourist attractions of Lucknow and also called Parivartan sthal. The park is quite spacious, the main highlight is a Buddhist stupa containing the relics of the Buddha. The pat to the stupa is decorated with rows of elephants. There are statues and sculptures of dalit icons including Kanshi Ram, Mayawati and Ambedkar, Jyotiba Phule, Sahuji maharaj, along with a summary of their life and contributions. There are also scenes from the Buddha's life inside the main building. It is a good place to learn about the dalit struggle, injustice of caste system and social equality in India. Its quite clean and well maintained. Its a good place to hang out with friends. There is an entry ticket at a cheap price."

Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,Somaseshu Gutala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"My Visit to Ambedkar Memorial Park, Lucknow","Lucknow has a rich cultural heritage with many historic monuments, gardens and famous parks. Everywhere one can see greenery with shady trees and spacious parks. nearly there are one hundred parks such as Gautam Buddha park, Dr.Ram Manohar Lohia Park, Janeshwar Mishra Park, Swarna Jayanti Smriti Vihar Park, Chandrasekhar Azad Park etc.  The Nawabs of Awadh beautified this city with many gardens, palaces and mosques. During my short stay there I had an opportunity of visiting the Ambedkar Memorial Park, a public park and memorial in Gomti Nagar. Ms. Mayavati, the former Chief Minister and leader of B.S.P. established this park with many monuments and pillars to represent the democratic ideals of social reformers and noble persons who worked for the upliftment of Dalit people. The foundation stone for this memorial park was laid in 1995. It was called Dr.Bhimrao Udyan. Construction and development work continued up to 2002 and the park was re-named as Dr.Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial. In 2007 it was further renovated and developed. On April 14, 2008 the park was opened to the public. Finally in 2012 the park was re-named as Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial. Red sandstone from Rajasthan was used for this megalithic construction. Nearly seven billion rupees were spent to build this lofty monument which has become the pride and glorious symbol of this city. Unlike other parks, here one does not find much greenery and gigantic trees. So we don’t find any shelter if it suddenly rains. It would be better if the authorities have set up some shelters for visitors to protect themselves from intense heat of summer and rainy showers. You will see a very spacious land of 107 acres with a broad stretch of road flanked by sixty-two stone elephants on either side at the main entrance. This spot is called “Pratibimb Sthal”. Priority is given to statues of elephants as the elephant is the election symbol of Mayavati’s Bahujan Samaj Party and also of  Ambedkar’s Republican Party. Nearly three thousand elephant figures are seen in this grand construction.  In the center of the park there is a massive musical fountain. It stands as a symbol of Dalit empowerment and dignity. On the left side of the park one can see a huge building called Ambedkar Sthupa located on a mound. Inside the Sthupa one can see a big bronze statue of Ambedkar seated in a chair. At the base of the statue a message in Hindi is engraved which means “My struggle of life is my only message.” Many statues are seen depicting the life of Ambedkar. In Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Sangrahalay spread over 2.5 acres, one can see a monument with two domes. Under one building one can see the statues of eminent social reformers like Jyothi Rao Phule, Shri Narayana Guru, Dr.Ambedkar, Kanshi Ramji and Rajarshi Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj . In the second building the marble statues of Gautam Buddha, Sant Kabir Das, Sant Ravi Das, Guru Ghasi Das and Sri Birsa Munda are seen. This monument is an objective representation of equality, humanity and social justice. In Drashya Sthal one can see an eighty- foot tall pyramid structure with water flowing from its top. From here one can have a panoramic view of the whole park with its monuments and pillars spread around. In Dr.Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Gallery spread over four acres one can see many bronze murals. It would better serve the purpose of spreading the ideals and message of Ambedkar and other leaders if a gift shop is set up there where one can buy books, photos and souvenirs that contain the teachings and messages of these noble personalities. This park is open from 11.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. on all days except on Monday. This park was under the supervision of the Lucknow Development Authority."

But lots of design flaws leaves this park a potential unutilized. As far as this fact I'd concerned, lots of public money seems wasted. 9 large statues of mayavati is the lowest point in making of this park. Don't ever think of visiting this park on a summer noon.

Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,felicityjg1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Vast!,"It is certainly worth visiting the Dr Ambedkar Park, but in the heat, with the sun reflecting off the marble (or whatever shiny stone was on the ground) it made for quite an exhausting outing.  However, it was very enjoyable although we didn't see it all due to the amount of steps up to many of the structures."

Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,Manoj Johny,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Pride place for depressed class,"There are crores of temples in India where public is looted in the name of chadawa/ dan. But this is a temple of those real gods, sho have fought for equality in society, as such all the so called upper caste people indicate it as waste tax payers money. Modi had wasted more than 100times of that in their luxury life and foreign visits, but no one called the waste of tax payers money. Why? No one had pointed that gold in golden temple is waste of money, khajana of all temples are public property and should be used by government. But only ambedkar park, why?"

Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,Avdheshshukla,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Phenomenal Waste of Tax Payers Money,"The Ambedkar Park is concrete park, decorated with stones & sculptures. It is quite beautiful & artistic but extremely hot & uncomfortable, particularly in noon. It was widely criticized for the amount of funds spent by the government on construction & subsequent reconstructions. The park is one of the most famous & well built parks in India and though there is some rush at the ticket counter, the vast size ensures enough space to crowd inside.The best time to visit is evening & rain, but remember to bring your umbrella/raincoat as the park offers little shelter.Overall a good place to go on weekdays."
