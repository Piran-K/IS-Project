Right from the clothes to shoes or grocery or cosmetics......you just think of it and you will find every thing in this market. We visited Lucknow for some marriage function and had to shop lot many item belonging to marriage function as well as other needs; so every one suggested us to go to Aminabad only. And believe me, we got every thing, right from the smallest item like pooja items to utensils to clothes. The only thing with Aminabad is that it is very very crowdy and conjusted  but dont get panicky with the crowd, it is same as you find in the crowford market of Mumbai or Bara Bazar/Satya narayan park area of Kolkata. One more interesting thing I observed is typical names of the shops and markets. I saw one Gadbad jhala market; which means every thing mess or wrong. But the market is very beautiful and systematic. We loved and enjoyed shopping at Aminabad. If you are planning to go to Lucknow, you must visit and shop at this market."

I found many things which were of decent quality but of amazing value for money price.1. I bought a kilo of walnuts for Rs. 500 (I was quote Rs. 850)2. My wife bought some fancy blouses for Rs. 250 each which she swears would cost Rs. 1500 at any showroom.3. She also bought sandals for Rs. 150 and slips for Rs. 2504. 4x heavy bangles for Rs. 80And the list goes on. Some tips for shopping in Aminabad market.1. Plan to visit at around 13:00. Grab lunch at Tunday Kababi or similar and start the shopping.2. Make sure you carry a small backpack so that you can dump all the small items into it which makes carrying easy.3. Prakash Kulfi is a must. If you are lucky you will find some carts selling Makhan Malai.4. Bargain hard, you will know when someone will not reduce the price further but do you best as you can never be sure.5. It is best to buy items such as sarees, dress etc which need a thorough inspection during the day. Make sure you check for damages spots tears etc. We almost bought two sarees only to realize just before we paid that there were many spots.6. Market starts winding up at around 20:00 but some stalls will remain till 21:007. On your way from Naka towards the market, you will find some sweet shops which are awesome and very easy on the pocket if you wish to carry sweets back home.Hope this helps."

Aminabad,MSircar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,"If its Lucknow Chikan Work you are after, this is the place!","Aminadad is 'the' destination for Lucknow chikan work. I would certainly recommend Krishna - a store which keeps all the latest in Chikan hadnwork. Post shopping, stop by Prakash Kulfi (very close to Krishna in Aminabad), a 60+ yr old establishment to satisfy your sweet cravings. "
Aminabad,YatriForever,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,"Crowded , noisy local market.","Braving the crowd is not easy here. The hygiene level of the street food is questionable. The noise of those 3 wheeler could be annoying.  Unless there's a specific reason to be here, I wouldn't recommend this place to any first time  visitor to Lucknow. Not certainly a tourist attraction. "

Aminabad,Sonia B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,Absolutely crazy,"This is one of the craziest places I have ever been to. It's hard enough to get there - so crowded it is at all times. We left our car at a distance and walked to the market. It took us a good 10 minutes to cross the road and enter the shopping area, which is a sea of shops, stalls, and people. It's easy to get lost. There isn't anything you cannot find here. You may have to bargain, but most things are pretty cheap or reasonably priced. Take care of your belongings while you are there."

Aminabad,MariaK638ET,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Great Shopping Trip,"Aminabad is the most popular shopping area of Lucknow. For traditional clothing and items like bangles and costume jewellery, it's hard to beat. It has winding, twisting alleyways and shops within shops. It's really exciting to shop there. But there's only one problem. To get the best out of this traditional shopping area of Lucknow, you have to have good, old-fashioned haggling skills. And I don't! But....my friend and adopted sister-in-law Babita does. So when Aine,a friend from my native Ireland, was here recently, we called up Babita and beseeched her to help us out. She brought us on an incredible journey. Thanks to her, I got several armfuls of lovely bangles. My Aine did too. She also picked up some nice ethnic items, i.e, shawls and the like, for friends back in Ireland. Again, thanks to Babita. Like I said, Aminabad is great for a visit. But there are a few things you have to sort out before you go. Firstly, you should decide what you need to buy before you go there. Secondly, you should bring someone with you who knows how to bargain. Satisfaction guaranteed!"
Aminabad,arvindkanchan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Heart of Lucknow,"Aminabad is basically a crowded market place. All the varieties of dresses, books, medicines, jewellary, food ingredients, dry fruits, household items etc..etc..everything is available here.Tunday kababi the famous non-veg restaurant is also a big crowd puller. Obviously parking is a big problem."
