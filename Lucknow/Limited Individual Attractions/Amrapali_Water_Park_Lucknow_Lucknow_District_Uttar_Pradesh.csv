Amrapali_Water_Park,Prosico,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,An Average Place To Go With Family,"Hi my name is Pranav. I visited this place last month, it was a good experience. I been there with my friends there are nearly three pools in which two is for adults and one is for childrens. It is an awesome place for birthday celebrations or anniversary or any group celebrations. But there are nearly seven rides and a rain dancing place in the place and two huge parks but there are insects and a junk-yard of amrapali and from seven rides there are only nearly three or four rides which works. So, for family enjoyment an excellent place but for solo or with an friend not good. Thanks Pranav"

Amrapali_Water_Park,nitesh911,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,An average water park,"In the modern times when Amusement Parks are the better deal, water-parks alone don't hold too much attraction in India. It is very far from the main city. There are few rides like merry-go-round, roller coaster, etc. The main attraction is the water park slides which have decent length. If you are a family person having a day's time and want to take your kids for an enjoyable experience then I will recommend you this place. However tourists should look for other attractions in Lucknow.Visiting hours- 9am to 11pm.What to bring- Swimwear"
