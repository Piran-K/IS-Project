Anandi_Magic_World,raj kamal singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 â€¢ Friends,Anandi magic water park a day out,"This place us about 20 kms from lucknow airport. Roads are good for travelling. Place is too big and many people are unaware about this location. The day we went some school trip was also there probably promotion for future......Since so many slides are there I feel it was difficult for them to manage as many of the slides didn't have water supple so could not be used. Some of the places tiles were broken. All in all I didn't enjoy the water park much. This place also has an amusement park which starts from 1600. This was good. There was a puppet show and rajasthani folk dance and swings were amazing wrt all ages.We had taken up rooms and rooms were decent but seems no one uses them. Food that was served during the lunch, the buffet, was below average. Dinner we ordered separately and that was also not that good. Snacks were tooooo oily.But yes one can plan for a day trip and that is enough for this place. Night time leaving the premises is risky as it's about 2 to 3 kms to reach the highway and you have to pass through the local village. So if you are alone dont think of departing in night."
