Anandi_Water_Park,Mukesh Srivastava,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Expensive and poorly maintained resort,"I visited anandi water park today.The turn for the resort is not marked prominently. If you are coming from BBD side,  u have to take a turn immediately after crossing the canal,  cross it again and take left turn,  the road is almost a service road adjacent to the canals and has different coloured flag all along till the resort. For a weekday the entry was for 700 rs for adults. Lunch was an addon for 150 rs, which we didn't opt for. The guy at the reception offered us private changing rooms for additional amount which we declined, a decision we regretted. The entry amount included one small cold drink,  a small cup of ice cream and one snack with choice between pav bhaji and noodles. The management dies not allow outside Food and your bag is checked. Food offered was of average quality. The pool and the slides are good and continuous DJ plays on quite loudly,  we enjoyed this part. The sour point were the changing rooms which were actually filthy,  cubicle doors were broken,  in ladies room people had thrown used sanitary pads,  so it was a real bad experience. The do provide costumes on payment both for men and women but people in the shirts baniyans and other dresses were also visible. Coming to pool and slides they have a good assortment but all if them do not function simultaneously.  I was there from 12 to 330 and the wave pool was not operative. Some youngsters with life guard t shirts are present.  But they were actually doing crowd management next to slides and blowing whistles.  The sitting area of the restaurant  was again dirty and unkempt.  Though tired we moved away from there quite fast. Go there if you are only in for pool and slides. Also the parking is not free. They do provide a small locker in the men's changing room. It can accomadate a small back pack. "

Though tubes are too less.  Wave pool is operated ONLY on the days when there is crowd.  On our two visitsfrom 10-2 pm,  wave pool and water cascade were not operated."

Anandi_Water_Park,Siddharth G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great initiative by Anandi Water Park to give discounted rides for all their visitors,"Got to know at Anandi, that they have partnered with Uber and they are offering their customers a ride at Rs.149 or less to/or from the whole city. This offer came to us when we needed it the most as we were not having any personal transport to go so far in this heat."

Anandi_Water_Park,maddash-traveler,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Bad design, under staffed but good value ","This place is okay for adults or teenagers but is less than optimum for young kids. Why? Because the designers crammed dozens of rides in a small area. To reduce footprint, they eliminated the long flat landing Lane and instead made the landing zone for every slide deeper by ~1 feet. That makes it unsafe for smaller kids below 4 years. There is one life guard for every set of slides but on a busy day they can't literally catch all the small kids. My day was spent in catching my son as opposed to letting my 4 year old son enjoy on his own. The upkeep especially of the changing areas is a bit lacking in hygiene and could do with better standards. It's very 90s.The tube slides have tubes which are massively under inflated. The place is good value because the ticket includes clothes, lockers and a round of food. That leads to some mess since people keep going in and out of the water into the garden to eat and the water gets a bit muddied. There's a lazy river but there is no directional flow not tubes on which you can sit. Defeats the whole purpose. Lastly, the wave pool operates with limited frequency and at that time other rides are switched off. The waves are nice but the pool is gender segregated. My wife and mother in law enjoyed separately from us!I paid 1.5x the price in Gurgaon for Oysters but it is totally worth it! "
Anandi_Water_Park,Ashish,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Pathetic water park,Overly pricesVery bad foodBad condition of changing rooms and washroomPlease visit at your own risk.
Anandi_Water_Park,harshnegi,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family,A decent effort led down steeply by lack commitment to keep any standards,"With few options for kids around Lucknow (I mean monuments of historical importance is not an equivalent alternative), a water park is a logical options. The dept of the water is apt for kids, even my 2 years old can be comfortable, but it is dirty.There is no demaraction of area for children and dont think there is anyone to enforce it. The condition of change room not for discussion, but it is also dirty. They charge full tickets for kids more than 120 cms , measured on a board standing at the entrance (Rs 600) . They also force you to buy meal coupons to eat from inside.The Paw-Bhajji , Chowmein and some other option they give along with ice-cream (not sure which brand) and a small drink (200mL coke). We took Pav-Bajji and Chowmein and did not eat, wasted it(it tasted weird) (like others did before us).(A little effort could do into prepare the dish and can save some food wastage). Tips to have good time would be visit on working days, carry some food, your own towel, locker space given is really small so carry a polybag to keep your sandals/slippers, which is also a tip for foot wear."
Anandi_Water_Park,RBS2706,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 ‚Ä¢ Family,Clearly not geared up for the big event,"This property is a water park, with about 50 rooms.  For a wedding in the family, we booked this place with almost all rooms occupied by the two sides.  However, it was clear from the very beginning that the property management team is not geared up for such a big occasion.  The rooms were extremely dusty.  Even after repeated reminders there were no one to clean the rooms.  We were there for 2 nights 3 days.  Since it was quite cold we did not try the water park.  However, best avoided."
Anandi_Water_Park,ravi p,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Pathetic Water Park, water is too dirty, rides are old and rusty","I have visited this water park on 26 June 2014 with my wife, cousin and his wife. We thought of it a decent water park, with sub par facilities. But my experience is turned bad with the water quality and rides maintenance. I seriously do not advice this to families. Though its way too economical and budget friendly but no one love to take risks for price factor. This water park was way too better when it opened and few later years as I have visited this during my school days back in 2003. My suggestion skip this, there are far too many options available in Lucknow, check them out."
