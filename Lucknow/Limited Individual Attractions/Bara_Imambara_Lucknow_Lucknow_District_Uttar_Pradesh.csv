The main structure has a big  hall which has no support in the middle stretch . the alleys in one part are so formed that a person may loose his way , this is known as Bhulbhulaiya literally meaning confusing. There is a waterbody too and it is believed that if you loose your way you may get trapped in the waterbody .The Imambara was built by Nawad Asifudaulah to feed his subjects by engaging them in construction at the time of a severe famine."

Bara_Imambara,SVAYAMBHU C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Bara Imambara Dec 2022,Our Savaari cab took us next to Bara Imambara complex. We had about an hour of sunlight left and the sound decision that we took was to complete Bara Imambara and not do the others and try to come back to it. Bara Imambara was quite something with its large halls without any pillars. Our private guide was knowledgeable and gave us the right context. The Bhulbhulaiya or The Labarynth is one of the most intricate man-made creations I have seen. We walked through pitch dark corridors and reached junction points made up of four roads of which only one was right. There were different groups in the maze and we were able to come out only because we had the services of a guide. The bawli or step well was awe inspiring and hats off to the engenuity of the builders of that era.
Bara_Imambara,Akshay Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,An iconic place of Lucknow,"This is one of the prime historical areas of Lucknow and one has to see it to believe it.

Bara_Imambara,gpradeepshenoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Solo,Good place,"Staying in Charbagh area of Lucknow , took a share auto from Charbagh to parivartan chowk(Rs 15 per person) and from parivartan chowk took another share auto to teeli wali masjid(Rs 10 per person).From teeli wali masjid bara Imambara is about 10-15 minutes walk. I am not sure if we get share autos to bara Imambara from parivartan chowk.          Combined entrance ticket for Bhool bhulaya (Labyrinth), bowli,chota Imambara, picture gallery with entrance ticket for bara Imambara costs Rs 50 per person.          Guide charges for bara Imambara, bhul bhulaya and bowli costs Rs 150 for 1-2 persons. But one guide will have 10 - 15 people in one group by combining many group of tourists which is not correct. The administration of bara Imambara must look into this. Guides are mandatory for couples who want to visit bhul bhulaya.          Footwear has to removed before entering Bara Imambara and the same must be deposited at footwear keeping centre which is at right side of entrance to Bara Imambara by paying Rs 2 per persons footwear. Imambara is impressive and beautiful. Bhul bhulaya is also good but the tourists must act responsibly as they have scribbled in walls of bhul bhulaya. Bowli area must be maintained more neatly.        There ia a mosque too called Asifi masjid in Courtyard of bara Imambara but tourists are not allowed inside this mosque.          Do carry sufficient drinking water with you when visiting this place especially in afternoon. Try to visit this place in morning before it gets too hot.       Just outside of bara Imambara we can take auto/tongas to go to chota Imambara, roomi darwaza, ghanta ghar & picture gallery. Roomi darwaza, ghanta ghar & picture gallery is on the way to chota Imambara from bara Imambara. One can also walk from bara Imambara to chota Imambara seeing roomi darwaza,ghanta ghar & picture gallery."

Bara_Imambara,AnupamSharan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Bhool Bhulaiya is a misnomer,"The Bhool Bhulaiya inside Bara Imam Bara was actually not built to be a labyrinth.

Bara_Imambara,JoyBose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,"The must see attraction in Luckno, complex contains baoli, mosque, labrynth and main building","This was built by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah in the 17th century to save people from a famine. It is a religious building as well as a touristic building. The complex consists of an outer gate, inner countyard, inner gate and buildings. The main building is a sacred building in Shia islam, so one has to take off shoes and deposit them.  In the first floor, one can clap from one side fo the building and it will echo on the other side. Bhul bulaiya labrynth is part of the complex, a place with narrow openings where one can get lost easily. It is better to take a guide. Asaf Ali mosque is amazingly beautiful. The baoli was built for the city's water supply from river Gomti, the guide can explain how it works and take you to the lower levels. Entry combined ticket is Rs 50 for Indians and 300 for foreigners. Guide costs Rs 100, more for bigger groups. It is closed during namaz time on Fridays. "

Bara_Imambara,R1chardN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Impressive architecture,"The Bara Imambara is an impressive building.  Even more so as it was built to create work for about 20,000 people during the great famine in the late 1700's'.  An imambara is a tomb for a Muslim holy man.  Although we did not see visitors being given scarves or similar clothes you should dress appropriately for this religious site. Inside the entrance gate is a large formal garden leading to the main building.  The gardens are attractive and well maintained.  The architecture of the main building is beautiful.  There are three storeys that house many grand rooms but we did not go inside..There is a step well that we did not go to as we had previously visited Abhaneri (the home of one of the steepest step wells in India).  To the right of the main building is the Asifi Masjid where only Muslims are allowed.Our visit was part of a city highlights tour with our guide.  It is a fascinating building and well worth taking the time to visit."
Bara_Imambara,Somaseshu Gutala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"MY VISIT TO BADA IMAMBARA (ASAFI IMAMBARA), LUCKNOW","Lucknow was ruled by AwadhNawabs for nearly sixteen decades. Here we still find the glorious tradition and heritage of Nawabs in the form of great mansions, palaces, mosques and gardens. BadaImambara is the star attraction and most popular historic monument in Lucknow. Every day nearly three thousand people visit this beautiful mansion with spacious courtyards, carvings and massive arches. The word Imambara means the residence of Imam or a Muslim priest who leads prayers in a mosque. So it is a prayer hall where religious congregations are held through the month of Muharram and on other important occasions by Shia Muslims. In cities like Cairo, Aleppo and Baghdad this type of prayer hall is seen as an annexe to the main Mosque.  In 1722 the Mughal emperor Muhummad Shah made Mohd. Amin Masawi or Sadat Ali Khan I as Governor of Awadh. Sadat was the grandson of a rich trader from Khorasan in Iran who migrated to India. Thus the rule of AwadhNawabs (a native Governor appointed by Mughal emperors) began. In 1775 the fourth NawabAsaf-ud-Daula ascended the throne. He shifted the capital from Faizabad to Lucknow. During his rule there was a severe famine almost for one decade. To provide employment to starving people Asaf-ud-Daula undertook the construction of this Imambara which was started in 1784 and completed in 1798. Nearly twenty thousand people were employed to complete this huge mansion. The Nawab spent nearly one crore rupees for this construction. Every year he spent four to five lakhs to beautify and maintain this building. He selected an architect from Delhi, Kifayitullah, who used his talent and skills to construct this building in ornamental Mughal style. The western entrance called “Roomi Gate or Turkish Gate” is the west-facing 59 feet high entrance gate with three arches done with lavish decorations.  The  arches have the royal insignia of dual fish carved on them. It was built in ancient Awadhi style and resembles the gateway at Istanbule, Turkey, once the capital of the Roman Byzantine Empire. The word “Roomi” is the changed version of the word “Rome”. On the top of the three-storied Darwaja, a small octagonal place called “Chattri or Umbrella” is seen looking over both sides of the gate. A staircase leads up to it. This place was used for vigilance or for ligting up the gate. Four minarets are seen at four corners.  The 67-foot tall Husainabad clock tower adjacent to Roomi gate was constructed by Nawab Nasir-ud-Din Haider in 1881 to mark the arrival of Sir George Couper, the first Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces of Awadh. The eastern entrance gate was destroyed by the British in 1858 when this building was converted to a military fort.The roof of Imambara was made from rice husk and the roof has been put together with interlocking bricks without any beam or girder. No wood or metal has been used in this building. This is a unique building with arched entrances without having any pillars for support. Unlike the Mughals who used red stone, the Nawabs of Lucknow used limestone which is delicate and can be carved with designs of creepers, various flowers and intricate designs. This building has three halls—China hall with decorative domes, Persian hall with the graves of Nawab’s family and Tazias (replicas of the tombs) of Imam Hussain and Hasan who sacrificed their lives at Karbala in 680 A.D. and the Kharbooza Hall the domed ceiling of which is shaped like a watermelon.  The Persian Hall is the most spacious hall measuring 170x55x15 feet without any supporting columns. In the center of large vaulted Persian hall the graves of Asf-Ud-Daula, his wife and the architect, Khifayoitullah are seen. Just above the central hall one can see eight chambers with different heights permitting the space above to be re-constructed as a labyrinth or maze (called BhulBhulaiya) with interconnected one thousand passage ways through 489 identical doorways. This maze supports the weight of the building. Our guide told us that the royal ladies used to come through secret underground passage to attend the prayers conducted in the central hall. People say that there are many secret passages leading to Gomti River and even up to Agra and Allahabad. It would be better to enter the maze with the help of a guide as there is a risk of losing one’s way in the labyrinth with so many passages and doors.  On the left side of this building there is a step well of Pre-Nawabi Era with five stories called ‘ShahiBaoli” built in Indo-Islamic style. It is a water reservoir used for supplying water to people. This reservoir is connected to Gomti River. Only the topmost two stories of the step well are seen and the three stories are under water. On the right side of the building there is Asifi Masjid where only Muslims are permitted. This monument is open from 6.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. One should go in decent dress to visit this sacred religious place. The entry fee is rs.50/- per person and Rs.500/- for NRIs. It would be better to take the help of a guide. We bought a ticket from U.P. Tourism office at 400/- per person. They will provide the vehicle along with the guide. We need not pay the entrance and parking fee. Of course only historic monuments are included in the schedule and not temples or parks. This monument is really a worth seeing construction with many unique features and is a typical specimen of the Indo-Mughal architecture."
Bara_Imambara,Tom B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,It's okay - didn't think it was amazing.,This is obviously a very important piece of Lucknow history but as a tourist it wasn't amazing to go around.  I must add that we had a tour guide for the first part which I believe everyone probably gets - he was amazing and by far the best part of the experience.  
Bara_Imambara,Sarika,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,Amusing visit,"I went to Imambara with my family. It was truly amazing to explore it. The guide we hired explained us stories and beliefs behind the architecture and artefacts present in the Imambara. It had a hallway where one can hear whisperings so loud and clear regardless of the long distance present in between the source of sound and the listener. The labyrinth present was cool to explore and without a guide one can surely get lost. It also had a stepping well and one can see the person's reflection in the well, who is standing outside of the gate from inside. Overall its a nice place to explore on a fine day. Also the monument is aesthetically pleasing as the architecture is remarkable."

When we decided to leave the guide came up and started showing us the labyrinth and the history and it became really interesting and felt safe. I normally dont use guides but in this case I really recommend to understand the history of the place and to get out of the labyrinth!"

You will need to take a guide here - the good thing is the guide prices are fixed, however, each section has a different guide and price. We enjoyed the architecture of the Baoli well. In the Labyrinth(Bhool-Bhulaiya), do take the guide as it is well worth it. They will also leave you to find your way out (don't worry, they will be around ;) ). It's a good experience overall and gets completed in around 1 hour."

Bara_Imambara,chikpick,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Good to visit once...,"Dress decently and modestly. On entering it gives a very grand view but not so well maintained. Taking a guide is a chaos. Also a much hyped ""bhul bhulaiyya"" is so much overcrowded that one loses the feel of it. Avoid fridays as it is quite crowded. "
Bara_Imambara,Hemant M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Imposing presence,"The bada imambara is well worth a visit, it has an imposing presence and gives a great feeling of its historical significance. Very conveniently located it can be visited very easily.Avoid the Bhool Bhulaiyan, it was a very bad experience. The entire bhoolbhulaiyan is really narrow and claustrophbic but the worst part is it stinks of sweat and grime and make it impossible to stay there but once youre in youre trapped till the guide takes you out. Not worth getting in, Enjoy the Imambara and its features like the Jal Mahal which is beautiful if tall and a no of steps."

Bara_Imambara,ShikshaC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,The main attraction of Lucknow…,I visited Bara Imambara on my visit to Lucknow during the evening. As it was near closing time we had to go in a guided group tour of the place. Also couples need to mandatorily take a guide here. The place has good architecture with the Baoli and Bhul Bhulaiya being the main attractions. The place also has a mosque in its compound along with the famous Rumi Darwaza. Also you need to take off your shoes when visiting the place.

Bara_Imambara,Sarah H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,"Expensive, but interesting! ","The Bara Imambara is one of Lucknow's most well known buildings, and is worth a visit.It costs 500r to enter as a foreigner (much steeper than the 50r for Indian's), but it's easy to spend a few hours exploring, and is ultimately worth the money.I particularly enjoyed the Labyrinth on the top floor of the maze, great fun to find your way around!

Bara_Imambara,umalaviya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A must visit place in Lucknow,"one of the most famous monuments of Lucknow is Bara Imambara. Bara Imambara is very famous for its incredible maze, known by the name “Bhul Bhulaiya “ and is located on the first floor of this monument. Bhul Bhulaiya has around 1024 ways to get inside but only two ways to come out. People can also view the grave of Nawab Asaf-Ud-Dowlah and his crown, kept in the middle of the hall. This Monument is famous for its religious as well as architectural importance. Bara Imambara is the largest Civil structure that is made without the use of wood or metal and is still standing without the support of beams. It is considered an an outstanding specimen of engineering and the best example of the Mughal Architecture.It is a worth seeing place of Lucknow."

Bara_Imambara,scud56,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Disappointing...,"I visited this place some time ago and really enjoyed my visit.. However, this time around I was disappointed to learn that the admission price was ~£5 per person. Furthermore, you could no longer take a camera into the main hall or visit the labyrinth/rooftop above the hall.Came away felling robbed this time around!"
Bara_Imambara,SunnyandBuster,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Huge mosque and gate,The grounds here are extensive and include an impressive massive ornamental gate called the Rumi Darwaza. We were told no photos but noticed all the other visitors were taking pictures with their cameras without incident. You are not able to bring in an actual camera but they don’t prevent phones (with cameras). Head covering was not required for us here. There is a really cool labyrinth to explore but be sure to have someone with you. 
Bara_Imambara,Mayank Gupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,One time visit,Bhool bhulaiya is good and must visit. Architecture wise nice to see but getting worn off. Go atleast once if you have time in Lucknow. I dont think so you will remember any history but a guide is a must
Bara_Imambara,varunamayya1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Beautiful architecture.,"Loved the place. Would have preferred if they had audio guide available too to get more details on the history of the place. However, I guess you will need a person as a guide in the Bhool Bhulaiya so that you do not get lost."
Bara_Imambara,Dibyendu87,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Best place in Lucknow ,"The best place in lucknow. This imambara has three portions with separate entry tickets. 1.Bauli 2.Imambara 3. Bhool Bhoolaiya. The bhool bhoolaiya is amazing. You can easily lose your way out inside. So better to take a guide. It will take atleast 2.5hrs to cover the Bara Imambara. You can buy a combined ticket of Rs 50 which also  include entry to chota imambara, Picture gallery just within 1km of Bara Imambara. Beware of fake guides and e rickshaw drivers posing as guide as they don't have the permission to enter the monuments. official guide is available inside the monument."

Bara_Imambara,Shardul Bahuguna,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"Mesmerizing piece of history, terribly disappointing tour","I visited Bada Imambara to revisit the place I had been to, more than 25 years ago and was expecting a similarly exciting tour of Bhul Bhulaiya along with the baoli.The buildings are legendary, the architecture impeccable and the history associated with it is remarkable.But the overall tour was disappointing. May be I was unlucky to get a terrible guide. But the tour was very short compared to what I had see all those years ago. In fact lot of details I remembered, I had to ask the guide and he did not know off. he finally told us that government has shortened the tours. Visit the place for the fascinating monuments but don't bank too much on the tour guides."
Bara_Imambara,nilesh_nagar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,History revisited ,This is one of the famous places in Lucknow.

Bara_Imambara,JPHStVincent,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Awesome,"It is an awesome place. Even the gatehouse is a fantastic thing, so you are impressed well before you get to the main building. That is just astonishing. I was not expecting the so-called labyrinth to be up to much, but it really is a labyrinth, but on that is upstairs and three-dimensional, spreading over several floors. Superb views once you get to the top and well worth the effort. The only annoyance about this place is that they don't allow taking of photos with real cameras, but allow any kind of photo with a phone."
