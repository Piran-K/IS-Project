Begum_Hazrat_Mahal_Park,EnakshiC,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Solo,Saw it in passing,"The central architecture an eye catcher which makes the park inviting. One feels like sitting in the shade, while watching the world pass by. The park was mostly empty, probably the heat kept people indoors. There are some rides for children, and of course the attraction of street hawkers and food on the go. Nice place if you want to roam around."
Begum_Hazrat_Mahal_Park,Sonia B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,"Pretty, but can be better maintained","It's not huge, as some people claim - it's average size with lawns, fountains, and children's play area. But there's stench near the water. Surely, the authorities can do something about the stinking water fountains?However, it's a good place to spend some time with your children. If you do not have kids, don't bother to enter the park; just drive around it, if possible at night, when the monument looks lovely."
