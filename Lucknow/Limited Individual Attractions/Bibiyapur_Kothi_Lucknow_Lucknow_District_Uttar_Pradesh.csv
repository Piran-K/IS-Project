Bibiyapur_Kothi,Sajeed K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,Double Storeyed Structure,"It is located on the right bank of river Gomti on the south east of the city. This royal building was built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. The double storeyed structure was simple but attractive in design, consisting of spacious halls, high ceilings with wooden beams and rafters, spiral stair cases (probably first time in India) and imposing double columns. The large hall was tastefully embellished with white and blue European tiles. The building is constructed on a rectangular ground plan with lakhauri bricks laid in lime mortar and coated with thick lime plaster"

Bibiyapur_Kothi,Sarbari G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Friends,a garden house for the nawab and his beloved,"situated on the banks of the Gomti river (at its romantic best too) is the Bibiyapur Kothi, surrounded by Army barracks.
