Botanical_Gardens,pensioner090,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Outstanding research institute with lovely gardens open to public,"We found the Botanical Gardens by accident. They are not on any tour routes. They are open only from 6.30 - 9.00 am each morning and are well worth the visit if you like gardens and if you want to see real residents of Lucknow out for their  morning exercise...power walking, jogging and just enjoying the gardens. It was a splendid way to begin our day and the gardens are lovely.This is a research institute, not a public garden so they are not open during the hours when scientists are working in the gardens and premises.The gardens are only a 10 minute easy walk down a straight road from the end of Shahnajaf Road where it intersects with Rana Pratap Marg. The lovely Shah Najaf Imambara complex is located at this intersection. When you finish walking around the gardens, walk up the road to the Shah Najaf Imambara and spend a delightful hour there."
