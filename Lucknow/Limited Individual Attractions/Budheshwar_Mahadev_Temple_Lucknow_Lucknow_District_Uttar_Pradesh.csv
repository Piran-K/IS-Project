Budheshwar_Mahadev_Temple,Gurumurthy Bhargava,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Temple visit....,"This temple located on Mohan road is about 500 Mtr from the Budheshwer crossing.One can easily find the main gate and park vehicle nearby.The temple opens from early morning to late evening and closes only around 1230 hrs for about an hour or so . Wednesday is usually crowded.According to the  legend Lord Ram paid obeisance to Lord Shiva  at this very place seeking mental peace on a  day that happened to be Wednesday, hence the name of the Temple is Budheshwer. People from all walks visit this place to seek blessing for various reason .As one enters there are plenty of shops either side selling flower;coconut and other puja items for an amount ranging around Rs 51/-.One can leave shoes in one of these shops .Milk is usually not offered .One can get a small utensil from the shops fill it with water and add coconut water obtained by breaking the coconut ;which  is done at a separate place before entering the main  temple. This is then offered  on the Shivaling located in the Sanctum sanctorum to  seek blessings. A must place for  Lord Shiva devotee."
