Chakra_Tirth_Temple,SjAwadh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,An ancient holy place !!,1. This place is almost an hour drive from Lucknow and located in district Sitapur.2. The distance is around 85 km and it is on road leading to left at N.H.24 at a place called Sidhauli on Lucknow- Delhi Highway.3. The place got mentions in ancient Hindu scriptures and is believed that Lord Brahma himself identified this place for sages to perform meditation and prayers in unabated way.4.The Chakra Tirth temple is established at that very place where wheel or Chakra of Lord Brahma stopped in search of ideal area.5. Here a holy pond or Chakra Tirth came into existence and depth of this pond is considered unfathomable and crossing of the inner circle is not allowed.6. Devotees come here to take dip in holy waters and to get rid of sins and after that worship in surrounding temples .7. The problem here is the presence of too many local priests who are not ready to spare anyone and think that only they can show way to please God.8.The maintenance of place is not good and as the place has so much religious significance this needs more attention.9. There are more temples near this place which should be visited like temple of Goddess Lalita Devi which is one of Shakti peeth  and other one is Hanuman temple where it is believed brother of Ravan named Ahiravan kept Ram and Laxman in captivity and Hanumanji freed them .10. Neemsar or Naimisharnya is a sacred place in Hindu mythology and visit to this place should be adhered in that way.
