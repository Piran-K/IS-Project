Chandrika_Devi_Temple,Somaseshu Gutala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,"My Visit to Chandrika Devi mandir, Lucknow.","This is a very ancient temple dating back to Ramayana period. The name of this temple is mentioned in Skanda Purana. This temple is seen on the banks of Gomati River in Kathvara village beside the National Highway No.24 between Lucknow and Sitapur. This temple is nearly 28 kms from Lucknow. We went there by taxi. The presiding deity is a form of Duiga or Chandi. The road is very smooth flanked by fields and greenery and small houses. The temple is seen on an elevated platform. A welcome arch is seen at the entrance of the temple. A row of shops greets the view of the pilgrims who have to go through a queue. A colorful bundle of votive pieces of pink cloth and a number of bells are seen hanging in the temple hall. In the inner sanctum a row of three small pindis symbolizing Chandi is seen. On the right side Nava Durgas in the form of pindis(Lingas) is seen. These idols are said to be installed by Sage Narada according to some legends. The present idols were installed by Thakur Beni Singh Chauhan, the landlord of Kathwara village nearly two hundred and fifty years ago.  According to legends Rajkumar Chandraketu, son of Lakshman, founded Lakshmnapuri (later called as Lucknow). Once he was travelling with Ashwamedha horse through a dense forest which appeared quite dark and dreadful. He prayed to Durga, who appeared there with bright moonlight and blessed him. He established a temple here. So the goddess is called Chandrika. In Dwapara Yuga Pandavas, during their exile period visited this place and Yudhistir performed a Yagna here. Ghatothkacha‚Äôs son, Barabareeka, on Krishna‚Äôs advice did penance here for three years to acquire mighty powers. Some Puranas say that Lord Chandra was freed from Daksha‚Äôs curse when he came and bathed in the holy pond. Yudhistir‚Äôs son, Sudhanwa worshipped the Goddess and hence this place is also called Sudhanwa Kund. In twelfth century this temple was destroyed by the army of Sayyad Salar Masud Gazi. Two hundred and fifty years ago villagers found the idol in the cavity of a neem tree. They informed the landlord of the village. He built a temple and a Vedi for performing Homas. The temple pond is called Mahisagar Theertha. A small bridge is seen across the pond with a beautiful statue of Lord Shiva in meditating posture. At the back of the temple there is a small shrine for Kala Bhairav.  In this temple special poojas are done during Amavasya (new Moon) and during Nava Rathri festival.  The temple timings are from 5.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 11.00 p.m.  Aarti is performed three times in this temple at 6.00 a.m. 1.00 p.m. at 7.00 p.m. You will find this temple in scenic surroundings surrounded on three sides by the Gomati River."
