Chattar_Manzil,Anuradha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Neglected heritage ,"A beautiful Awadhi style building used by the Nawab of Awadh as his residence. Adjoining this place is another kothi which was owned by a French general Martin Cloud, later purchased by the Nawab. It has excellent French architecture. Both the buildings are in sheer neglect. High time to start protecting our heritage before it goes ! "

Chattar_Manzil,Sarbari G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Friends,A building built for the Rajput Mother of a Muslim Nawab,"Chattar Manzil is so named because of the shape of its dome, which looks like an umbrella.  This was built by Nawab Gazi Uddin Haider but changed many hands thereafter.  Currently it is under the Indian Government Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and hence not open to general public and tourists."
