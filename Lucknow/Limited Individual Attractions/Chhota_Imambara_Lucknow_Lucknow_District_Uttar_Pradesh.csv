Chhota_Imambara,Akshay Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,A reduced image of Bara Imambara,This is located next to Bara imambara but the similarities end with the name only. From the outside the structure is good but Bara Imambara is worth the visit. 
Chhota_Imambara,Rohit B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Picture perfect!,"Much smaller in comparison to the Bara Imambara and less visited by tourists, this destination is probably just a picture spot, with very little to see around. The only interesting place inside to see is probably the Hammam spa."
Chhota_Imambara,flyingwish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Must Include with Bara Imambara,Most visitors skip the chotta imambara. They should not. I found it to be equally impressive as its big brother and it is located less than a Km away. A simple and cheap rickshaw ride can be done between the two monuments.

Chhota_Imambara,gpradeepshenoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Solo,Small good place to visit in Lucknow,"A walk of 15 -20 minutes from bara Imambara through roomi darwaza is required to reach chota Imambara. Or there are auto's/tongas available in front of bara Imambara which can be hired to reach chota Imambara.Entrance ticket for chota Imambara can be taken at bara Imambara (Rs 50 combined ticket for visiting bara Imambara, bowli,bhul bhulaya & picture gallery) or taken at chota Imambara (I think rs 20 is the cost of entrance ticket to chota Imambara if taken at chota Imambara).      Guide charges are fixed and displayed at entrance. I did not take guide here.       Chota Imambara complex has a hamam and mausoleum too.          One cannot enter inside the mausoleums here .  Footwear has to removed only when we want to enter Chota Imambara. Chota Imambara is beautiful. On the day I went photography even with mobile phone was not allowed inside chota Imambara because of Muharram.         A beautiful place not be be missed while in Lucknow."
Chhota_Imambara,JoyBose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,Beautiful architecture and a holy place as well as tourist place,"This imambara was built in early 1800s by the nephew of the Nawab who built the bada imambara. Entry is Rs 20 for Indians and hiring a guide costs Rs 200. It is worth hiring a guide to understand the intricacies of this building and its history and significance. This complex comprises the main building, the Taj mahal replica tomb of the nawab's daughter, the shahi hamam for baths and the ""jawab"" of identical building to the daughter's tomb. The main building has the shrines of the emperor and his mother. The main tomb is a holy building, of Shia muslim holy significance. It is of more significance during the muharram procession, when people of all religions can get the holy blessing. One must take off the shoes before entering the main imambara tomb. It costs Rs 2 per shoe to keep them. The shahi hamam is where the nawab used to bath, it had arrangements for both hot and cold bath, in Persian style of hamam. There is also near the entrance a fish structure denoting the emblem of the Lucknow nawabs. The architecture of the main buildings and white tomb and its jabab are most beautiful."

Chhota_Imambara,Somaseshu Gutala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"My Visit to Chota Imambara ( Imambara Hussainabad Mubarak), Lucknow","Just two kms away from Bada Imambara on the west side, Chota Imambara is seen which is admired for its artistic beauty as Palace of Lights. It is located on Husanabad Road in Daulatganj in Lucknow. This was built by Mohd.Ali Shah, the Nawab of Awadh in 1838 as a congregation hall for Shia Muslims to celebrate Muharram and other festivals. Azim-ullah-Khan, Superintendent of ordnance and Buildings, supervised the construction of this gold-plated building with many large and smaller domes with ribbed design. The Nawab in order to provide employment to workers during the severe drought period undertook the construction of this monument. The significance of the holy five is symbolized here by five main doorways. There are two halls and a platform (Shehnasheen) on which the Zarih(the replica of the protective grill that is kept over the grave of Imam Hussain at Karbala, Iraq) is seen. The main hall or Azhakhana is a large green and white bordered hall with a gilded dome decorated with chandeliers imported from Belgium, golden edged mirrors and crystal glass lamp stands. On the south of the main hall is the main platform with arches where the banners and flags of the small army of Imam Hussain are seen. A number of Tazias made of silver, ivory and sandalwood are kept on the main platform or Shahnasheen. There is also a big Tazia that is made of wax and tinsel paper kept in the main hall. The tombs of Nawab Mohd. Alishah and his mother are seen in the central hall. Their bodies are buried below the floor in the basement of the central hall. In the central hall the royal throne, the red crown of the king and the silver Mimbar or pulpit on which the orator is seated when he addresses audience are also seen. On the walls and pillars of the hall, Quran verses are written in Islamic calligraphy in the shape of a tiger, a horse and a bird, fixed in wooden frames. An antique Persian clock and a glass fish tank from Japan are other curious objects found in this spacious hall. The way to this Imambara is embellished with a flowing stream flowing through the center of the garden. Water for fountains and other water bodies is channelized from Gomti River. This building constructed in Indo-Islamic and Persian style has a Charbagh pattern—a single stream running through the center of the garden. There are two triple-arched gateways on the east and west as entrances. In between them is the main gate with a heavy door. . The three-storied main entrance gate is seen with a bronze fish fixed at the top of the arched gateway. This bronze fish works as a weather vane one finds the sacred five emblems mounted atop the main gate to signify the holy five members of Prophet Mohammad’s family. Opposite the main gate is Naubat Khana where large drums were beaten to announce the hours of the day. Two metal Grecian figures in bronze connected to spikes on the top of the gate act as lightning conductors. On the left side of the main building is seen a mosque with two minarets , a replica of Taj Mahal, where the tombs of Nawab’s daughter, Zinat Asiya, his son and her husband along with the tomb of Nawab’s consort are found. Non-Muslims are not allowed inside the mosque. On the other side a similar structure facing the mausoleum was built to maintain architectural symmetry and balance. This building was used as treasury. Outside the Imambara is a watchtower called Satkhanda or tower of seven stories. But only four stories were seen as the king passed away and the construction work was stopped. This tower was built between 1837 and 1842. On the model of Qutub Minar and the tower of Pisa this tower was constructed in Indo-Islamic style and was meant for lunar observation.Mohd.Ali Shah and his queen Malka Afaq Jahan deposited 26 lakhs with East India Company to form Hussianabad Endowment Trust to look after the religious buildings they had built and for observance of Muharrum and other connected functions. To the left of the main gate, Shahi Imam (Royal bath) with a complicated system of drainage is seen which supplies hot water to the gigantic bath tub. This building has been renovated in later times. Tickets purchased at Bada Imambara gives one access to Chota Imambara and Picture Gallery. Alexis Soltykoff, the Russian prince, who visited this place in 1841, described this monument as the “Kremlin of India.”Really as someone said, this monument is “ small in name, but big in wonder.” There are many worth seeing monuments nearby such as Jama Masjid, Clock Tower and Rumi Dawaja. The opening hours of this Imambara are from 8.00 a.m. to 6.30 p.m."
Chhota_Imambara,ShikshaC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Beautiful Architecture…,"Chota Imambra is a religious place and thus women are required to cover their heads inside. You get scarfs at the entry in case you do not have something to cover your head. The complex has a worship area, replicas of Taj Mahal and a shahi imam (royal bath) within the complex. You can take a guide who will give you details about the outer complex. There is another guide inside the worship area. "

Chhota_Imambara,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Imambara Hussainabad Mubarak,"It's called the Chota Imambara popularly. But, its actual name is Imambara Hussainabad Mubarak. The first thing you'll notice is the goldfish at the entrance. It's actually an anemometer. One of the earliest ones in India I guess.Also, the golden statue at the entrance holds a chain that is connected to a spire. This works as earthing. You can visit the Shahi Hamam (royal bath) where you can see stained glass windows, an elaborate hot water system & a jacuzzi kind of setup.The Tomb of Princess Zinat Asiya is supposed to be a replica of the Taj Mahal. We, however, didn't see the likeness. Photography inside the Imambara hall is prohibited. But, the inside is worth seeing - chandeliers & crystal glass lamp-stands!P.S. Women are required to cover their heads here."

Chhota_Imambara,SunnyandBuster,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Smaller but more interesting,"I found the Chhota Imambara more interesting than the Bara Imambara. It was built by Muhammad Ali Shah in 1837 as his own mausoleum. As you enter the grounds there is a long reflecting pool and small replicas of the Taj Mahal on either side. Inside the structure you’ll find an astounding array of chandeliers from all over the world. There are framed portions of ancient scripture, items from Mecca, photos, accoutrements and more. The variety of items and artifacts is more extensive than at the Bara Imambara. "

Numerous auto rickshaws are there to ferry one around if one chooses to.Enter through the gates and the dazzling Chota Imambara sits like a jewel amidst well maintained manicured gardens.Guides are available at the gates and for a token fee they make the tour inside rather interesting.Recounting stories attached with the various monuments inside as well as their significance.Starting with the Shahi Hamam on the left and its historical significance we are told that fresh water from the Gomti river gets piped here. Make your way past the Tank with the clear waters in the middle. On the right stands a mosque,a treasury building and a replica of the TajMahal (a mausoleum of the princess, daughter of the then Nawab of Avadh)At the end of the garden stands the Chota Imambara in all its beauty, an architectural marvel.

Chhota_Imambara,notacanada,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Serenity,"The mosque is small compared with Bara Imambara but its atmosphere of serenity and holiness makes up what it lacks in size. The imam was welcoming. Close to the entrance the Chhota Imambara’s hammam, a tranquil space with lovely blue-coloured walls, elegant tiles and stained glass windows could easily be overlooked, and almost disappears in the greenery surrounding it."

Chhota_Imambara,keith h,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Fairytale Like.,"I was more entranced by The Chota Imambara than The Bara Imambara. The two are not so far apart, easily walkable & one passes through The Rumi Dawarza en route.    I read that expert's think that recent restoration has spoilt the original plasterwork. On this point I have no knowledge but I can say that I was entranced by the place. The Imambara is fronted by a long pool in which it's reflection is cast. A stunning mass of flowers to your left are simply glorious.  The outside of The Imambara was just in the final stages of being repainted in dazzling white with a covering of Quranic calligraphy picked out in black. The interior is richly decorated with Belgian glass chandelier's & tazia's.  A pair of white painted mosque's flank the pool.    The whole spctacle is entrancing. My 500r ticket obtained at The Bara Imambara covered the entrance fee here."

Chhota_Imambara,Anuradha Manjul,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Explore Lucknow – Chota (small) Imambada or Hussainabad Imamabara,"When a tourist, a history lover thinks of various destinations in India, does the name Lucknow ring a bell? One may have heard of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh for various political reasons, but Lucknow as a tourist destination or secret haven for history lovers is a rarity. A city which played an important role in India’s first war of independence; the revolt of 1857 (for freeing India from the clutches of Colonial Rule), a city which has traditionally been known for its rich cultural heritage, a city which was known for its Adab (good manners) and Tehzeeb (good breeding, politeness). Capital of erstwhile Awadh or Oudh, Lucknow sure deserves a bigger chunk in the tourist map of India and more space in the heart of history lovers.It is unfortunate that the Tourism department and the government is not keen on focussing in this area. The city has everything which can make it an ideal tourist spot – good connectivity with all the major cities in India and the world (due to the presence Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport), hotels for all ranges - from luxury to budget, you name it and the city has it, major international hotel chains like Taj group, Marriottt, Radisson, Hilton etc. are present here, ample transportation options in the city, excellent shopping opportunity, food joints dishing out some mouth-watering local cuisine and yes a rich cultural and historical heritage. What else you can ask for?In this series we would talk about some the interesting, must visit destinations in Lucknow. Have just half a day to spend in Lucknow, don’t miss out on Bada Imambada, Chota Imambada, La Martiniere boys and the British Residency. We would start our exploring with Chota Imambada or Hussainabad Imamabara. Imambada is a building used by Shia Muslims, the practitioners of Shia Islam (2nd largest branch of Islam) for the purpose of Azadari – azadari, the practices/rituals related to mourning and lamentation commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (Husayn ibn Ali) grandson of Prophet Mohammed in the battle of Karbala, which takes place in the period of Muharram. Nawab was a title given by the Mughal emperors to semi-autonomous Muslim rules of princely states. The Nawabs of Awadh (Oudh) were Shia Muslims and belonged to a dynasty of Persian origin from Nishapur, Iran. Saadat Khan, Burhan-ul-Mulk (Mohammad Amin) was a Persian nobleman who was appointed the governor of Awadh (Oudh) in 1722 AD. His court was in Faizabad near Lucknow. The weakening of Mugal Empire in Delhi gave him an advantage in carving out the state of Awadh (around 1724 AD) with its capital both at Faizabad and Lucknow.Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah (1837-1842) built the Hussainabad Imamabara (1838), which is popularly known as Chota (small) Imambada. It is located in the Heritage Zone of Lucknow; after the Bada (big) Imambada (Asafi Imambada), cross the majestic Rumi Darwaaza (gate), on the same road after almost ½ a kilometre on the left. There are many Imambadas in Lucknow, each Imambada in Lucknow has different architectural style. This holds true for Hussainabad Imambada also. True to its name Chota Imambada is not large in size. After Satkhanda, there is a 3 storeyed gate (made of brick, painted in white), the boundary of the Imambada start just after that, but not recognisable now as there are many commercial establishments. There is a sign installed by the Tourism department which announces that one has arrived at Chota Imambada – there is a small grilled enclosure which leads to a non-descript looking entrance. There is an entry charge for this monument. One can either use the combined entry ticket (purchased at Bada Imambada) or pay an entry charge for Rs. 20.00. The females need to cover their heads while inside this monument. Head scarves are available on rent at the entry.On entering through this gate (which is 3 storeyed) the first thing which is visible is a small arched gateway (not in use), on top of which is a bronze fish (with open fins- making it look like a flying fish). This is an anemometer (a scientific instrument used for measuring wind speed). The use of fish figure could be because the emblem of Nawabs of Awadh (Oudh) was two fishes (mahi muratib – the order of the fish). The second unique thing which one can see are two life size female figurines (European influence is clearly visible here) on either sides holding chains which are connected to spikes at the top of the gate one had entered. This is another scientific device – this is a lightening conductor device and the female figurines are serving as earthing equipment.The non-descript gateway through which one had entered, from this side is an architectural marvel, 3 storeyed; painted in white, an example of a mix of Islamic and European architectural style. The top most level reminded me of many Gothic churches I have seen. Once inside one can see the beauty of the gateway. Decorated with Islamic calligraphy and symbols in black this is just not a gateway – it’s the Naubat Khana.The Chota Imambada has many different structures in the complex. There is a small waterbody in the complex which starts right after the gateway with Fish shaped anemometer and ends just before the platform of Azakhana (the main congregation hall). This water body in a way divides the complex into right part and left part. There are small iron bridges to cross over (now not in use).A structural balance has been created on both sides. The first building on the right is a small mosque, again painted in white. It is built on a high platform, again decorated with Islamic Calligraphy and symbols.One look at the next building and one can easily realise the love or impact Taj Mahal had on the Nawab and the architects. It’s an attempted miniature replica of Taj Mahal again painted in white (no this building is not made in marble, but of Lakhori bricks, plastered and painted in white). There are 4 graves in this building – that of Princess Zinat Asiya, daughter of Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah or as many would call him the 3rd king of Oudh (Awadh), Nawab’s son, son-in-law and one lady from royal family.Just opposite to this building on right there is a building on left which is popularly known as ‘Jawaab’ or answer or reply. It’s an attempted mirror image of the building on the right – thus in a way reply to the building on the right. This building served as the Treasury.Then one can see the Duldul Khana (stable for Duldul). Duldul is a spotless white (it has been referred as glowing by many writers – but we didn’t see that glow) horse which is a living replica of Zuljanah – the faithful mount of Imam Hussain Ali (grandson of prophet Mohammad). This is linked to the martyrdom of Imam Hussain in the battlefield of Karbala, the main theme of mourning rituals of Moharram. The horse in Lucknow remains mainly in isolation and is brought out in public during Moharram celebrations. This horse in Lucknow unlike other areas is especially raised for this purpose, its upkeep is paid by Hussianabad & Allied Trust (HAT) which was set up in 1838 by the Nawab himself. The horse has and would never be mounted. (P.S. – the horse is replaced on its death, there is no progeny).The next structure which lies right next to Azakhana is the kitchen area, we could see logs and logs of wood. The inside looks like a simple old style kitchen area with good drainage area.The Azakhana or the main congregation hall is the most beautiful building. It’s located on a raised platform and one has to climb stairs to reach the courtyard. Entry with shoes is not allowed – there are shoe stands on the left side and one has to pay a fee of Rs. 2.00 (current rate) for the services. The single level structure has gold plated dome. The exterior of this building is beautifully decorated in Islamic Calligraphy which is painted exquisitely in white on a black background. This is one of the most unique feature of this building. The Azakhana is divided into two halls and a Shehnasheen (a platform where Zarih, a replica of Zarih of Imam Hussian, is kept).   The interior of the building is in shades of green bordered with white. Once inside the hall area one is transformed into a magical land – with numerous exotic chandeliers which had been brought from Belgium (way back in the time of Nawab), mirrors (brought all the way from Europe) and crystal glass lamp stands. It’s because of these the imambada has also been called as Palace of Lights by various European writers. The Imambada also served as a mausoleum for the Nawab and his mother who are buried side by side inside the Azakhana.There are many antiquities which one can find inside the Azakhana; the royal throne of Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah, his crown (similarities with European crowns), a Parisian clock, a fish tank which had travelled all the way from Europe, Quran verses written in Islamic calligraphy in the shape of tiger, horse, bird etc. and many other such artefacts. Other than these one can find numerous Tazias (a representation of tombs of Imam Hussain and Hasan, grandsons of Prophet Mohammed, used in Moharram processions), made up of ivory, silver, sandalwood, wax etc. each a beautiful work of exquisite craftsmanship.One would find many people inside the Azakhana who would be willing to act as guides, they would say that they would require no fee for that, one may pay whatever one feels good. It’s entirely up to an individual to decide if one wants to go ahead with these self-styled guides or not. We refused and post our refusal were told that we couldn’t do photography inside the Azakhana (though there is no official notification for the same). On being questioned on this, they replied if you have any issues you can call up the office. We informed that we had taken photographs earlier also, they told that earlier it was allowed, now it is not. (Again there is no official intimation for the same).The Hussainabad Imambara or the Chota Imambada is under Hussianabad & Allied Trust (HAT). Unlike the Bada Imambada, where the restoration, repair etc. is under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), HAT manages the affairs here. This is has resulted in improper restoration. There are numerous solar lights installed (by various individuals with ugly looking boards announcing their names), but the installations and the wires etc. are done in such a way that they have marred the beauty of the monument. This monument is worth a visit for many things; to understand the historical importance of an era where the East India Company was gaining its control over India, to understand the impact of European architecture & traditions over the royalty in Awadh/Oudh, to understand the impact of religion over period architecture, importance of proper restoration to save heritage etc. Few things to understand: please don’t expect this monument to be similar to the Mughal monuments, it’s neither comparable in architecture finery nor comparable in its grandeur. But one needs to admire the craftsmanship - the monument is built using locally available Lakhori bricks (Lakhori bricks were kiln baked, only 19 mm thick and normally about 10 cm x 15 cm. These bricks because of their small size were extensively used for creating finer details on the wall and column surfaces). Religious activities still happen in the complex – this complex plays an important role during the month of Moharram, so one needs to respect the religious sentiments."
Chhota_Imambara,Gene R J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,A Shia Muslim congregation hall became a mausoleum complex.,"We visited here with combination site ticket ($7 for non-Indian), walking 1 km up Husainabad Rd from the more famous and older Bara Imambara. This Chhota congregation hall was built in 1838 and converted to a mausoleum when the ruling Nawab died in 1842. The tomb of his daughter was added to the side of the reflection pool on her death, then a treasury added to the other side for balance. This very beautiful complex, which includes a huge gateway entrance, is best viewed at the top of the steps of the main hall.  From this landing, 5 portals lead into the entry hall which proceed into the elaborate ""Palace of Lights Hall"".  Here chandeliers overlook the tomb, as well as 5 raised chapels, 2 featuring models of the Taj Mahal. This complex is in good condition being built 47 years after the Bara. From here we took an $3 Uber for 4 km southeast to The British Residency."

Chhota_Imambara,Dalbir_S_Virdi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Class Apart in comparison to Bada Imambada,"Not very far from Bada Imambada is located Chhota Imambada. Unlike Bada Imambada, here you need to deal with two sets of Guides. One who would tell you about history of Chhota Imambada and the ""Shahi Hamam"" (Royal Bath) inside the same campus and another set of attendants inside the Imambadas. For some reason, the first set of Guides are not allowed inside Chhota Imambada. You actually don't require a guide inside the Imambada because its comparatively a very small structure. Its beautifully decorated inside with Chandeliers from all over the European countries. There are few Graves inside and these belong to the Nawab's family members. The Shahi Hamam is quite an attractive place but poorly kept. Just an advise - start your journey from Bada Imambada and buy composite Tickets for all attractions that includes Chhota Imambada and Museum as well. Its only Rs. 50/- per person. An extra Rs. 5/- is charged for Still Cameras."

This Imambara consist of two halls and a Shehnasheen (a platform where the Zarih of Imam Husain is kept.) Zarih is the replica of that protective grill or structure which is kept on the grave of Imam Husain at Karbala, Iraq. The large green and white bordered hall of Azakhana is richly decorated with chandeliers and a good number of crystal glass lamp-stands. In fact, it was for this profuse decoration that the Imambara was referred by European visitors and writers as The Palace of Lights.
