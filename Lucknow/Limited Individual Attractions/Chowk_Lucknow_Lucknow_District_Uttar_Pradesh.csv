Chowk,Srinidhi Rao,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Old city charms and perils,Heard that it was a good place for shopping as well as street food. True that the shops are cheaper than those is Hazratgang and not so fancy. You will need to search for good bargains in the lanes. Do not take a car there. Go to the closest area and hire an electric tuk tuk.  The oldest Tunday Kebab outlet is there which is in a narrow lane full of motorbikes going to and fro. Quite an adventure to reach that place.

Chowk,Stuti Das,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,A foodies paradise- must visit for Makkhan Malai and Poori sabzi,"When in Lucknow, do what the nawabs would do. Hop on a rickshaw or a tonga (if you can get one from the rumi darwaza gate) and explore the old city. Do make a trip in the morning if you want to gorge on the best dessert ever made- Makhhan Malai. Available near the Chowk Chauraha (very close to KGMC), you will see a row of stalls selling this delectable dessert. Prices start at Rs 60 for 100 gm and do drop in at Gaya Prasad Makkhan Malai stall (near Paramapara sweet shop). Packing is also available in case you want to savour it at home. Also you can gorge on to some sumptuous poori and sabzi from sevak ram ki dukan (over 100 years old shop). Ask for directions from proprietor at Gaya Prasad stall. While at Sevak Ram you can also treat yourself to Black Carrot ka halwa (600 rupees kg) and it is out of this world. Also available are samosas and jalebis and khasta kachori."

Chowk,Daniel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Makkhan Malai is to die for,"I visited chowk very early in the morning for Makkhan Malai and had it outside the Premji's sweet shop. Although I spent around Rs. 350 for travel, once I tasted the Makkhan Malai I felt it was completely worth it. At the end of the day, its just milk churned up to a foam with nuts, saffron but we can never manage it at home, so I had 3 of them. We did not shop around so I cannot comment on that."
