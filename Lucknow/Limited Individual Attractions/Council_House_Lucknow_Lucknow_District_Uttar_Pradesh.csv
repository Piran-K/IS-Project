Singapore_Mall,Kartik M,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 • Solo,This place sucks,"Worst ever mall of Lucknow. Such is the quality of management that they do not even bother to run AC in peak summers. I am not at all shocked why brands like westside, pantaloons and CCD left this dead place. Do not even consider to call it a mall."
