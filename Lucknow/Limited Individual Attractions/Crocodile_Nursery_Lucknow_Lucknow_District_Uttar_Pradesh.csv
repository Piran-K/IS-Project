Crocodile_Nursery,Amit M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Close to nature,Crocodile Nursery in is Kukrail reserve and if time permits one should visit to see the Crocodiles in Kurail. Since childhood I have loved to see the crocodile and it still impress me to visit these places.
Crocodile_Nursery,Yaatendra Mamgain,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,Kukrail lungs of Lucknow,This is an amazing 1500 hectare of reserve forest amongst a thickly populated township. It is an asset to Lucknow but the presence of roads that facilitate shortcuts to locals must be stopped. The upkeep around the crocodile park is nice and well maintained. But a lot of other old infrastructure is in ruins. The government must take it seriously and turn this on it a thick neem saal and teak forest. It's nice to be walking in this forest. The current forest becomes barren during the patjhar but must be glorious after monsoons.

Crocodile_Nursery,authorneelesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,they come in all shapes and sizes,A must see as it is rare to see so many crocodiles and alligators in all possible shapes and sizes in one place. The walk inside is also pleasant and the lawns well maintained.

Crocodile_Nursery,NitinDhyani,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Business,Average place,Crocodile Nursery is an average place until unless you love to see crocks. World famous crock breed is found here and some one who loves wild life can visit and can take some good pictures. 
Crocodile_Nursery,Arpit141,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,Nice place to visit if you are a crocodile lover,"Very good place I like it, because there are very limited place in India for Crocodiles and here people of this place takes care of them. If you are a Crocodile lover then go here and you can see many types of Crocodile here."

Crocodile_Nursery,manoj k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Business,Heaven of Crocs,perfect place for Crocodile lovers. one plan picnic  over there. you can see the plenty of crocs there. good place to visit in leisure time   
Crocodile_Nursery,Nipurn B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Couples,Could have been a better place!!,The place is located within city limits rather in between city.As you enter the area you get the fresh feel of air since it's all forest around.You need to cross a toll and then give a parking fees for car/scooter.No ticket needs to be purchased.You need to walk long pathway to reach the actual nursery area where you will find crocodiles.There is a mother pond also which has some big crocodiles but it's little risky since there are no security arrangements no guards.If any mishap happens you may be at danger.The fence for the big pond is also broken you can actually go inside the big crocodiles pond at your own risk though!! Advice for travelers from other cities/country - localities don't go there since mostly love birds are involved there into obscene acts.Park is huge for playing and relaxing.You may not be able to see a croco there but surely you will spot on love birds involved in obscene activities.PS- no pun intended.!!
Crocodile_Nursery,Molay A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,excellent place for outing,kukrail crocodile nursery is located in kukrail forest reserve a little away from city. though there is no entry fee but you need to pay toll of Rs 50 to access the park.its one of a kind of experience. here you get to see the alligators from hatching to growing stage.they have a very good no of alliagators & few crocodile in these reserve.good for outing
Crocodile_Nursery,ApurbaRoy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,outing,"A picnic spot, as it is named locally also, is a good place  for  family outing  and  leaning  about crocodile and its siblings ( alike cultivation)"
Crocodile_Nursery,Kushal N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014,Oasis for the replites,"Well placed and quite well maintained nursery.  It is an oasis ""well almost"" in the city periphery.  A wonderful place to hangout and see the crocodiles and tortoise.  Though the management is forced to keep some enclosures out of bound for the visitors; it is a worth visiting place."
Crocodile_Nursery,anuj729,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Indeed a Crocodile Park but fading Glory.,Past thirty years I am watching this beautiful place dying due to lack of funds and neither of the state governments paying any attention to maintain a place which could be a must visit for every visitor.There is a guest house but not available for general people. Huge lawns are there were localities go for picnics during holidays.A small forest is also around.In winters if you have an extra time and have small kids then you can try this place otherwise in summers it will be painful to visit the place as the cars are stopped half a kilometre before the entry gate of the park.
Crocodile_Nursery,guddu1954,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,find a better place to spend time,I had visited the place long back only to hope that with years passing by there would be some improvements.My latest visit was equally disappointing.
Crocodile_Nursery,BanishSharma,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2013 • Solo,Are you kidding??,"A Crorodile Nursery, you gotta be kidding? This place is nothing but a tiny forest with all dirt/waste. Please visit this place only if this is the last place to visit on the earth or you don't value your time (rather want to insult urs). Can't write more about it."
Crocodile_Nursery,TravelerForLife_Ro,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Friends,kukrail - skip this if u value your time,This place is all hype. The crocs are mostly babies. The place is not at all maintained. Seems like the forgotten section of some zoo.Most of the folks we saw here were locals coming to have a picnic.Definitely would not recommend!
