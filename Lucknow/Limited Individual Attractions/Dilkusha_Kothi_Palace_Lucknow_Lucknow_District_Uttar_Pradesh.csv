Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,ashok_shrikhande,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Dilkusha Palace,"The Kothi and its adjoining magnificent garden were created by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. It is almost an exact replica of an English country house called Seaton Delavel in Northumberland, England, built in 1721.It was initially intended as a hunting lodge for the nawabs although, it was later used as a summer resort too. The building had patterned walls and unusually no inner courtyard.It faced major impact during the first war of independence and hence lies in a less than perfect state with just a few towers and walls standing."

Surrounded by a carpet of green n some well maintained colourful foliage this rubbled structure is a mosaic of the past n the present. Worth visiting as it's only short drive from the city centre."

Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Pallavi S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,Good for a picnic with family,The ruins of the building are surrounded by pretty lawns that are perfect for a picnic. The ruin itself is interesting. You can see what an impressive building it must have been before it was turned to rubble. 
Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Chelsea E,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,Pristine Gardening Amidst Nawabi Ruins,"I visited Dilkusha Kothi and was expecting to be able to wander around inside ruins as is often the case with ruins in India. There is no doubt that the Dilkusha Kothi is in ruins, however, due to barred doors there is no way to go inside, and one may only look inside from said barred doors. However if there were a way to go inside it might not make much of a difference as there's not a whole lot to the structures themselves. I found it interesting that there was a British person's grave next to one of the two kothis. If you wish to pay homage to the era of Wajid Ali Shah you will find helpful informational telling about how the properties were used as summer homes for the Nawab and his family, and that at one time the grounds nearby were also used for military trainings, which the British apparently did not like. Worth seeing if you are interested in the history. The premises is pristinely well-kept and has an open grassy space for picnicking as well as some nice shade trees."
Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Ankur B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016,Escape place from hustle and bustle of Lucknow city,"Dikusha is a complete makeover from what it was 20 years ago. As a child I used to pass this place and never dared to enter as it looked barren. Go to this place now, it has beautiful lawns, the building is repaired and painted. For history lovers, which I am not, it gives you the feel of Nawabi culture. If you are looking to find a quiet place to escape from the crowd, plan a visit to this place."
Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Amitava_dg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,Nice one but at a desolate place,Not much remains of once a palace of Nawabs. But the ruins and the solitude provides a traveller much welcomed respite from touts and crowds of major sites.
Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Siva M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Business,An incomplete History Still captures your imagination- Worth a Visit,"This is not for you if you do not have good imagination or if you do not like history. This campus is hidden behind the CM's residence and is a very peaceful place as very few people some here. The construction of the Palace was stopped due to the orders from the Queen, but the shear layout of the walls of the side palace tells you the grandeur of the planners. The yard is impeccable. One has to imagine how the emperor Shah Alam would have thought of this place. One distinct aspect of this place is there is no evidence of any strategic plan by the emperor in case there is an attack by an enemy unlike what you often see in other Mughal palaces."
Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Aman A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,A Palace at some time but now in ruins,"This place is located in the cantonment area of Lucknow. This building which once used to be a palace now lies in ruins but still a very nice and peaceful place to visit.As the place is in cantonment area and that also in the outer cantonment area, it hardly has much of visitors and you might also find vacant streets at this place. Travelling after sunset to this place is highly not recommended."

The Dilkusha kothi, now in ruins, was a European - style building made in 1800 for the then Nawab of Awadh .3. At that time , this was a semi -forest at the banks of river Gomti in the outskirts of the city of Lucknow . The Nawab used this place as a hunting ground and for family leisure .4. During the The First War of Independence in 1857 , a considerable damage occurred to this building as at that very time the British had occupied the building.5.

Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,JAGDISH RAVAL,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Solo,A HISTORICAL PLACE,"Dilkusha Kothi  is a historical Place. It was Built in the year 1800. This monument was once a hunting lodge as well as a summer retreat of the rulers. The building was designed in the European Baroque style. The huge pillars on the front, grand steps leading to those pillars are examples of this style of architecture. The Archaeological Survey of India has taken up steps to preserve this place and today, the park around this monument is a favourite place for visitors, mostly during winter for the glorious sunshine.

Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Chetna1973,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,Well maintained and serene,"Dilkhusha is close to La Martinere College and can be clubbed with a visit to the school.Though in ruins, it is well maintained, set in manicured lawns, in a quiet serene location. Just right to stroll into, sit and read a book, spend a little time reminiscing or just be by yourself and your thoughts.It is not a very large enclosure and can be visited in a short span if sitting around is not an option."

Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,bishwaksen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Family,Nice out of the way place,"This is a complex which lies a bit away from the more famous attraction of the city. The complex contains two big manor houses nestled amongst a lot of trees. Since its not very popular, you will be able to explore in peace. The Dilkusha Kothi was modelled on an English manor house and you can still see the underground chambers used by the maids, the towers on 4 sides, the fireplaces etc. At places, you can also see the original decoration. It won't take more than 30-45 minutes to see everything, but there is not point in going if you don't like historical buildings/ruins. The ASI has recently started renovating it. The caretaker of the place is a nice friendly man. He opened all the locked gates and guided us into the interiors of the houses, chatted with me about the place and pointed out all the interesting sights. "
Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Family,A piece of history amidst soothing greenery,"Dilkusha Kothi was a palace built in the English baroque style in the quiet Cantonment area of Lucknow , India.All that remains today of the magnificent structure are  a few towers and external walls. All the roofs are gone. The house was profusely shelled when Lucknow was sieged by rebel Indian soldiers of the British East India Company during the 1857 uprising. This damaged the structure permanently.The marks of shelling are clearly visible on its walls even now.But you can still see the lush green lawns which once surrounded the Kothi. The house was constructed around 1800 by the British resident Major Gore Ouseley, a friend of the ruler of Awadh, Nawab Sadat Ali Khan. It was initially intended as a hunting lodge for the Nawabs. It was later used as a summer resort too. There is also another smaller building on the premises. This was built by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah for military exercises which he had to abandon because the British rulers objected to it.The remains of the building, the lawns and surrounding gardens have been currently restored by the Archaeological Survey of India(ASI). There are no guides available. But the signage provided by ASI has sufficient details. After leisurely walk exploring the place, we settled down to a nice little picnic in its gardens. There are a very few garbage bins. So we carried back our trash till we found one. Ideal place to enjoy  lush greens while remembering an important era of India’s history."
