Dream_World_Amusement_Park,Heather B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Fun holiday day,Happy to say that Dream world looks like  its on its way to becoming a great day for the family once again. There are a few rides still closed however the staff and cleanliness  of the park more than makesup for it.The park was looking tiered  however it appears that a lot if work behind the scenes  has been done and a lot of face lifts for the rides have been achieved.  The water park included  within the park also has great staff and is a whole lot of fun.Worth the day out.
