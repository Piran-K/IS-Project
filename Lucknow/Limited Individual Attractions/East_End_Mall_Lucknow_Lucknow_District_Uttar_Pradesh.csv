This mall also boasts of Vodafone store in addition to most of the branded stores. Wave cinemas is an another attraction.Food court on the top floor is relatively small but okay.McDonald and Pizza Hut outlet  at the ground floor makes for the food court. Parking facilities are good.Overall a nice mall to hang around.
