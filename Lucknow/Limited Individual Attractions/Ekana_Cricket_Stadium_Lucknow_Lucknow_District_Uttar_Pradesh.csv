Ekana_Cricket_Stadium,Shashak G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 â€¢ Friends,Very poor management ,"No proper mangement, people were already sitting on our seats when we reached. When we told them very reluctantly they leave. My seat was corner to the stairs and on stairs there were so many people standing even if full seats are occupied. There were many more people than actual seats and this seems disgusting. People were fightings for seats all around and there were no people from management to resolve these issues."
