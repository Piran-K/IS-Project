Fun_Republic_Mall,kishangupta_21,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Usual shopping mall and enternitement center,Mall is getting old and it is not being properly maintained. Washroom are broken. For clothes shopping there are many shops. Overall experience was just ok.Most annoying thing for food cafeteria where you have to get mall credit for ordering any food. In today's time when everyone has card and mobile for payment I don't understand why they need this.If you coming via own car ready to spend 15 min to 30 min just for entering in parking or leaving from parking on weekends and public holidays.
