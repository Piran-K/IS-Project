Sugandhco,Krishnaraj I,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Sublime and deeply gratifying olfactory experience,"Sugandhco is ideally one of India's oldest-living traditional perfumeries upholding the world's pioneering perfumery tradition. Truly admirable is their versatility that spans all the 3 major perfumery traditions of the world-Indian, Arabian and French.Sugandhco's Arabesque scents in particular form a magnificent selection of tightly permutated formulations that spring surprises at every turn and bring a smile to the fragrance aficionado's face. 'Oud Badastur' with its animalic, musky, woody oud tonality  took me back to the Khaleej-the Gulf States with their quaint old alleyways, the Bedoiun serenades and the old dhows sailing gently across Dubai Creek.While the warming and energetic 'Hina' and 'Musk Amber' resurrect the Nawabs of old, oud innovations like 'Mukhallat' , 'Hasrat e Oudh' and 'Jashn e Oudh' to name a few, make magic with musk, pour passion into patchouli and awe me with amber.A refreshing dab of 'Yaquet' or for instance, 'Nafasat' on the back of your hand would rejuvinate you with not just the amazing sillage of enchanting notes but even the longevity on skin or on fabric. PS-Do not miss the drydowns of any of these scents! There is invariably, always a little surprise awaiting you there! A certain note that emerges out of the blue as you exclaim 'wah! kya baat hai'!Mr.Vishwas Vijayvergiya, the knowledgeable and friendly upholder of this renowned tradition enlightened me about each of his masterpieces in thorough detail."
