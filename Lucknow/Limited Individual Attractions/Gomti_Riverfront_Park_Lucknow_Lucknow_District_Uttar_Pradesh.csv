Gomti_Riverfront_Park,krishna292,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,An Example of  Mismanagement after Development of a Good Riverfront garden,"We visited this well known new tourist attraction of Lucknow, Gomti Riverfront after checking in the hotel Garden Inn on 19th March. We had earlier visited Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad and expected this newly developed riverfront to be at least comparable with that if not better, but were very much disappointed after seeing dirty and stinking water of the river and several vendors selling snacks etc. in the garden. The garden appears to be a simple case of neglect and I feel that vendors should not be allowed in side but can be provided temporary cabins to sell items outside on the road near parking area. Of course, some vendors were seen outside also but proper management was missing. The up keep of garden is also not good and water of the river was badly stinking with lots of mosquitoes all around. It could be a good place for a morning walk (when mosquitoes might not trouble the walkers), but certainly not good for picnics or evening stroll in the Riverfront park. I was also surprised to find that people inside the park were not following Covid 19 precautions. Some checks  are necessary."
Gomti_Riverfront_Park,Khilesh C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2020,The idea of riverfront is nice but the river is smelly,"River front is decently made. It has cute looking chatris. Due to the barrage downstream, there is plenty of water, but there seems to be no flow in the water. Also, there is a lot of bad odour, perhaps due to drains opening in the river. We also thought it could be the untreated water being used for irrigating the greens in the park. But any which way, the foul smell was discouraging. "
Gomti_Riverfront_Park,Ajay Kacker,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Beautiful place for morning walks,"Visited the place twice for morning walk as I was staying in a nearby hotel.Place is huge and clean as a whistle.Located in close proximity of the Ambedkar park / monument, the place is an ideal place to visit with friends and family.Jogging track is separate from the walking track. Well manicured lawns with flowers and shrubs add to the scenic beauty of the place. The river itself needs to be cleaned as it appeared to be full of water hyacinth.Will definitely come again possibly at night time on next visit."
Gomti_Riverfront_Park,mohitrastogi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Nice riverfront,"Gomti river flows in the middle of Lucknow. The Gomti River front is nearer to Gomti Nagar Area of Lucknow. The river front is having serene look, with a few lucknow architecture type domes to sit below. There are pathways, grasslands, benches all along the river front. There needs to more development like kids playing area, entertainment type of shows, eateries, public facilities and public transport and moreover a cleaner Gomti River."
