Husainabad_Clock_Tower,SomnathKhaskel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,The tower was built to indicate the arrival of the first Lieutenant Governor,"The Clock Tower construction was originally started in 1840 by Nawab Nasir-ud-Din Haider, but when the Nawab died the construction stopped at 4th storey. The rest of the construction was later renewed and the tower was completed in 1887. The architectural style and the material used to build the Husainabad Clock Tower, is an example of the excellence and finesse of the British architecture. The tower was built to indicate the arrival of the first Lieutenant Governor of United Province of Awadh, Sir George Cooper. The 221 feet tall clock tower is built of gunmetal by the Husainabad Endowment Trust. The material to build the clock tower was especially imported from Luigate Hill, London."
