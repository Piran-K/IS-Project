Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Rohit B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Nawabi portrait collection,"The picture gallery hosts a dozen paintings of all the Nawabs of Lucknow in a small single hall. Visit the place if you care to see them in their royal attire, framed in large size canvas work."
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,silva s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,Small quiet place,"The portraits of nababs are kept here. The paintings are beautiful. The lustrous silk dresses, the bespoke jewelries or even the shadow of the zafri is painted by master painters. Some pics are kind of 3D. Definitely a glorious past of Indian art history. "

Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Tanvi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Gallery is small,There's a small visiting fee about RS 20 for Indians and high rates for foreigners . It's small gallery one can visit here if they are interested in art and history .
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Nawabs' Portraits,"The Picture Gallery houses portraits of the erstwhile nawabs of Awadh. The portraits were quite fine, with intricate details. The caretaker also pointed out to us a few amazing bits here & there. Like how the nawab's shoes seem to move!Our minds were also blown off by the view that the Gallery offered. The Clock Tower to the left, Chhota Imambara straight ahead, & the Satkhanda to the right.Photography is prohibited. The Husainabad Picture Gallery also doesn't seem to be frequented by tourists. We'd the place almost to ourselves."
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,durham05,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Small gallery,Small gallery with some portraits of the rulers of Lucknow. Guide thrust himself onto me but all he did when he took me round was to read off the captions on the bottom of the photos. Rushed me by some of the more interesting historic photographs of Lucknow and then told me the 50 rupees I offered was too small! Not impressed.
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,melb0urnemuzza,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,Did not go,Admission price asked was 500 rupees even though the board stated 200 which is what I expected.I turned around!
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,FATBOY,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,HUSAINABAD PICTURE GALLERY,"This picture gallery shows big oil painting of Nawabs of Awadhi. The entry fee for Indian/foreigners is ₹20/₹200.The work on these paintings is actually quite good. It you want the staff to give you summary of the history of the house of Nawabs then you have to pay more. There is a big water tank (Baoli) in front of the building. This gallery is near Rumi Darwaza, Lucknow.History seekers can have a awesome time here.Note: Taking pictures is strictly prohibited here.Timing: 0800 hrs to 1700hrs"
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Krupabn,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Nice pictures but bad maintenance ,"The gallery houses 10 - 12 life size pictures of Nawabs which is 3D and optical illusions created in painting are amazing. There are no details mentioned anywhere so forced to hire guide who are overly priced for such a small tour. It's not a gallery just a room of pictures.. Outside view is worst.. You can see filth everywhere, very badly needs some maintenance. "
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Praveen Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,10 - 12 painting,This picture gallery contains around 10 to 12 huge 3D paintings. Observing the 3D effect of these paintings is really good once must definitely visit. You will find paintings of various Nawabs of Lucknow here. This can be covered with in 20 mins .
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Ajeet N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Nice paitings,"A collection of 9 to 10 life-size paintings commissioned by the nawabs and drawn by European painters.Each painting has a nawab and the building that he created, in the background. Gives a lesson in history."
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Indraneel,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Interesting - Could have been better,"Hussainabad Picture Gallery was my last stop during my Lucknow visit. This place is next to Rumi Darwaza and the Clock Tower. The gallery is housed in a beautiful building made by the third Nawad of Awadh and has some rare life-size portraits of the various Nawabs of Awadh painted by British artists and one Indian Painter Mr. D K Singh. The portraits are really interesting and has elements of optical illusion in them.This place is ticketed and the cost is included in the combo ticket available in Bada Imambada.Pro:- The building housing the gallery is beautiful. Watch out for- Iron pillars in the upper story pavilion facing the lake - used first time in Nawabi building- Bowling alley or Gendghar build by Mohammad Ali Shah for the Britishers- Rare Pictures; believed to be made on elephant skin and the colors used were prepared from diamonds and other precious stonesCons:- Picture Gallery is a misnomer as it is just a large hall with pictures & paintings on all the four walls.- The paintings and the pictures have no detailing. Forced to take guide at high cost.- Photography is strictly prohibited - reason best known only to the administrators- Unprofessional maintenance,Viewing time : 20 mins"
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,592abck,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Not many pictures,I am an art lover but I was disappointed due to very less pictures. I am not sure why they don't increase them.
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Teja,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,It's just ok,"Some of the paintings of the nawabs of Lucknow are quite well done. But otherwise it's just a gallery of items associated with them, without any particular guidance on which ones are significant, etc. Also, you can't take any pictures inside, so by now I've forgotten pretty much everything. "
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,saurabh k,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,"Guides are irritating, they force you to take them to see picture gallery. ","You will see 3d photo of mughals and other kings, nice place to visit if you are interested in the the history.But the thing that irritate me is that agent are present on the gate of this gallery and they recommand you to go with them to see picture gallery.

Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,knightrider02,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Amazing paintigs,"Picture gallery have some amazing paintings. Paintings have some kind of 3D effect. E.g. Nawab's shoe direction will change as you walk past the picture. One of the photo, one will feel that Nawab is looking at them and person standing at other side will feel that Nawab is looking at them. Guide will walk you through all the photos, history and amazing facts."

Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Alok N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,BEST ART GALLERY UNFORTUNATELY POORLY DESIGNED,One of the best Art Gallery but poorly designed ( lighting and space ) and not promoted properly. Located between Bara and Chota Imambara it is easily accessible but not many tourists go there. The Paintings are just ' fantastic' but you need to have a guide to give the history and explain the intricacies of each to really understand and appreciate them. Photography NOT ALLOWED.
Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,kalpajeetbhattachary,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Couples,Art lover will never be disappointed,"Hussainabad Picture Gallery of Lucknow is situated near the Chhota Imambara and the Gallery Building is visible from the main road. The Pictures here are amazingly maintained and one can not tell whether they are so old. It can be compared to any good art gallery and an art lover will never be disappointed. Must visit if one can appreciate paintings. Some paintings are said to have been made on elephant skin. Also, the so called `famed' paintings which seem to look straight to the viewer from almost all angles (it is an optical illusion, with the subject looking straight ahead), are here."
