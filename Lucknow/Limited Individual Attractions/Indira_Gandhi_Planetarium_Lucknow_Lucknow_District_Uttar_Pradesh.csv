Indira_Gandhi_Planetarium,Shivanshu74,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Friends,Worth the Experience,Have never seen such a time 3-D presentation of our universe.

Indira_Gandhi_Planetarium,Satish G,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,not as expected,building is nice and beautiful....in shape of planet saturn.....has a small museum...ticket price is also reasonable....after entering inside the main auditorium..i was shocked to see broken chairs..one person nearly hurt himself while sitting....the show started in english but in the middle sound went mute and it started in hindi...after a while again it started in english....there was no notice board to tell the visitors what show was going on and in which language.....the show was kind of boring because it only focussed on moon and some famous stellar groups and our solar system.....slide show was not up to mark but yes i will say it will take your brain in a countryside where you are watching the wonderful dark sky with no pollution or bright light.there was no canteen or vehicle stand when i visited.

Indira_Gandhi_Planetarium,Anuradha Manjul,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Family,This place is can be a better maintained and made more interesting,"This is one of the few places in Lucknow for everyone with scientific bend of mind. Would be a good opportunity for kids to get the feel of planets and other astronomical delights. One major setback - staff has a laid back attitude, not willing to help out or no opportunity for a explanations etc. in the display area. Worth one time visit for sure."
