Janeshwar_Mishra_Park,Manasvi K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,Spectacular Morning Walk Experience,"Went there for morning walk with family. Loved the experience. There is enough greenery to keep you fascinated and engaged while keeping the smog at bay. You can go there for walks, runs or bicycling. You can even rent the bikes if you want. We went early morning which was great because we didn’t have to pay the tickets and it was not very crowded. Most people there were with families for morning walks as well. It is well maintained with some food options inside the venue as well. I’d love to go there again on my next trip to Lucknow. No tickets before 8 am I believe! And a walk here can be a great start to your day especially before it gets too hot."

It was a great place to spend the evening. I entered and saw a beautiful river with fountains where I stood for a relaxing time. Light music buzzing on the speakers made the whole experience even more enriching. Greenery galore. Could see a lot of benches as well where I could spot families as well as couples. There was actually something for every age group here. Swings for kids, boating for the grown ups! Absolutely loved my experience!"
