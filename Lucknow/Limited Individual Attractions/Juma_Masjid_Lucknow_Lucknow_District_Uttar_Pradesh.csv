Juma_Masjid,SomnathKhaskel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,A must see in Lucknow,Non-muslims are not allowed to enter inside the mosque but allowed on the base.

You are not allowed here”  !!!! When we said that we know the rule and not entering the mosque – he was not happy but left he place……….. so may be I is a tricky place but we liked the architecture !!! its wonderful !
