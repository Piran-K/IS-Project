Kaiserbagh_Palace,Shonali79,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017,Palace of the last Nawab of Awadh,"Its said even the ruins of a palace tell about its grandeur during its heydays!This huge palace or rather haveli, used to be the abode of the last Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah. Now, in a ramshackle condition due to negligence of the authorities concerned. It still bears memories of the bygone times in its intricate Persian architecture. I wonder why this palace has not been maintained well despite its heritage value. This goes for so many other places of historical significance.I don't mind paying an appropriate entry fee if it goes into maintaining the property, which forms an integral part of Lucknow's history."
