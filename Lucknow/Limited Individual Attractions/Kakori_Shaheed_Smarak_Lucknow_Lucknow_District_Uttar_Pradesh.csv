Kakori_Shaheed_Smarak,TheWorldNut,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2021,The famous Kakori Kand.,"Kakori Shaheed Smarak, built in memory of the braves and immortals of the famous Kakori Kand which took place on August 9, 1925. The memorial stands one kilometer from Kakori railway station, where Ashfaqullah Khan, Chandrasekhar Azad, and Ramprasad Bismil stopped the train moving towards Lucknow carrying government treasury. The place is a great picnic spot and a good day activity with family on a fair weather. I was kinda surprised to not find this iconic place on TA and hence glad to get it listed and write the first review :). Hope this place gets more and more attention and uplift through TA. Cheers."
