Kothi_Roshan_ud_Daula,RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Good place for History buffs.,"I was travelling with a friend of mine, from Kaiserbagh to Aminabad and crossed an old structure, with a signboard saying ""Kothi Roshan-ud Daula"".  We stopped here and went around this building, which houses the office of Archaeology Department of Govt of Uttar Pradesh. We were told by the staff available there that renovation of this historical structure is going on.  Will surely visit during day time on my next visit."
