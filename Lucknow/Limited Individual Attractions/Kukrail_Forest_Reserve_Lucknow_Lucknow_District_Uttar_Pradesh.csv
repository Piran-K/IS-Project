Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,ajaypritu56,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Friends,Good place to see medicinal plants and crocodile hatchery.,I visited many times with my family to see different kinds of medicinal plants which are very useful for our life. My children are eager to see different sizes of crocodiles (from 10 days to 1 or 2 years). Big crocodiles are living in separate and big ponds. Good place to enjoy 3-4 hours with family and friends.
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Manish Pande,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,for alligator lovers,"a nice place covered with  small patch of forest in the concrete modern city, where you can see alligators and crocodiles from close quarters"
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Pradeep Ambat,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,A day in the forest reserve ,Situated in d outskirts of lucknow we visited the Kukrail forest reserve on 30 April. The day was overcast making it an ideal day for outdoor visits. Nothing much to see except for the baby Gharials and Crocodiles seen at a distance. But if u want to spend a peacefull time with small kids this reserve forest is good. A little bit more effort in maintainance will improve its desirability a long way.
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,TheWorldNut,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Utterly disappointing,Most of the cages are empty and there is hardly anything to see. We just kept roaming through largely unkept premises only to see the baby alligators. Make better use of your time and go to the zoo instead.
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Anika S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Worth seeing the gharial breeding and crocodiles,"Situated about 9 km from Lucknow ,this is a place worth visiting for families with kids.Timing 8 am to 5 pm.The walk from parking till the breeding centre is also full of various flora and fauna.One can see the various stages of the life cycle of a gharial( including the newly born,the hatchlings,yearlings and adults) a member of the crocodilian family. There is a section for rescued gharials which are brought in from various villages or other locations.The gharials are bred and freed in the rivers after they grow big.There were about 500 gharials and 11 crocodiles when we went.There is a museum also but it was under renovation in January.It's a good family picnic spot as well."
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Priyanka C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,grossly mismanaged,"The three stars are for the baby alligators which are bred here and you can see them just on the periphery of the park. Don't waste your time going inside. The whole park is falling apart. No amenities, no maintenance of the rusted cages or the fences. Overgrown weeds and grass. Avoid !!!"
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Anupam S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Nature in natural form,"This is the place which you should visit when you are not in a hurry. Lots of vegetation. Entrance is like you are entering in a jungle. Though it is a crocodile breeding centre but also known as picnic spot. Most of the time it is crowded with families or school kids. It's also favourite place for loving couples. But apart of these hassles you can find a peaceful place for you where you can have interaction with nature. I've few such great memories in my records. For a tourist it is just a crocodile breeding centre, for kis & families a picnic spot, for loving couples a meeting place and for nature lovers a natural place. For others it will seen as not maintained place but for nature lovers it is a place where few spots is available where nature is kept as it is and not much disturbed."
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,PALLAVI S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Business,nature lover,"If you have good taste for nature love this is the right place for you, its a crocodile reproduction center, you can have a close understanding of the reproduction system of this animal."
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Aishihm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,A great place to hang out especially with kids.,It is one of the best places to hang out at the same time have a good learning curve for the young ones. To me a must visit a place where the kids can learn a lot while the elders can hang out and breath easy out from the busy life of a cosmopolitan.

Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,authorneelesh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,so many of them.,"A gharial and crocodile breeding center, You can see them in all shapes and sizes , from the just born lizard like babies to the huge and menacing full grown ones.It is also a very pleasant walk from the parking to the breeding center.The tree shaded walk gives the feel of being in a forest.Lawns are well maintained and used as picnic spots by locals. There is a canteen inside but did not look too inviting and hence we did not sample it. The loos are clean . A really worth going place."
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,pinaki50,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Friends,More of a crocodile reserve,On the outskirts of the city ( actually with the spreading populace this place is now almost touching a colony called Shivpuri) is located this large expanse of greenery & it's natural beauty n solitude soothes the nerves after the boisterous city clamour. The authorities here are doing commendable work in the conservation of the smallish indian crocodile called ghariyals. This place is also a popular picnic spot. Worth a visit if time permits.
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Samiur_Rehman,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Theme Park with a good concept but need finish,"The theme of the crocodile park is very good and informative and the size of park is quite large and having a good vegetation cover.Lot of renovation activities were going on because of which the park looked incomplete and missing some key facilities.Area where breeding of alligators is done,was quite interesting,with all sizes of alligators around.Missed to see crocodiles as they are confined to a small pond at a lower elevation.Area where turtles are kept is also not developed properly and some of the holding ponds were empty.This could be a good place for a must visit once all construction/renovation activities are completed."
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Durgesh S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Lungs of Lucknow,Full of greenery. Lots of birds. If you will come here you can feel the fresh and cold air anytime. Morning access is preferable. 
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Vidharva,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016,Nothing much to see,"Its just a park good for kids and picnic , there are not much crocs there as you might expect. Definitely worth a visit if you are planning a long stay. Avoid if you are planning a short stay as it is not worth it. The place is well maintained in patches and not all of the place is well maintained. A visit like 3pm - 5pm should be better avoid during afternoon as it is pretty hot."

Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,shyams174,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,poorly maintained as picnic spot,"it seems that Kukrail picinic spot is most neglected area, very poorly maintained, as par as visitors are considered. no basic amenities  in the park, except to have a look at crocodiles, the situation is horrible in park. My advice for not to go with family, if want to time pass with friends it's ok"
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,khadds,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Family,good only for showing crocodiles to kids,"A big let down. Average type of picnic spot for school children. Good for love birds, but dont think much privacy is available. Like most govt properties its soul less. Only good thing is baby alligators/ crocodiles which you can show to your children. Disappointing visit. Avoidable ."

Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Varun S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,A rare jaw of an attraction,"Kukrail is one of its kind attraction with those motionless yet deadly creatures housed in a cage for the guests to see. It has a huge spread ideal for a picnic with lush green lawns, play area and a jungle feel to it. The huge pool of alligators with their open jaws and unflinching eyes are a rare treat to watch. The place has a nice peaceful ambience and kids can enjoy running around for hours. There are a few turtles also to watch. Though the place could have been better maintained, I would still rate it as a good picnic spot."
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Satish T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,CROCODILE SANCTUARY CUM PICNIC PLACE IN THE NATURAL WILDERNESS,"Nestled in the dense forest, this crocodile and ghariayal sanctuary cum picnic spot, takes you off from the buzz of the city. Just 10 Kms from the Charbagh Railway station, near Khurram nagar and you find yourself in the lush green natural jungle off from the concrete jungle. OPENING TIME AND FEES –It opens from morning  7 Am to  6 PM ,parking fees for two wheeler is 10 and Rs 20 for 4 wheelers This place is appreciated by all types of peoples and best suited for those loving loneliness in ambiance of nature. Particularly young couples and love birds like it most.  This crocodile sanctuary was established in the year 1975 under UP Govt’s  scheme of extinct forest animal project. This is written on the sign board shown just before the Entrance gate .It was basically a crocodiles rehabilitation and breeding centre which was later on converted into a picnic spot,  It is maintained by the forest department.   Named Kukrail ,because it is situated in the Kukrail forest and on the bank of Kukrail river.                                               After entering inside the sanctuary, first thing to be noticed is statue of a big crocodile opening its mouth with a big fish in its jaw as seen from the side. Peoples and children stand inside its jaw and take group snaps .Back side of the crocodile looks like a rounded entrance.                                                                                                                   Infant, unprotected recently hatched crocodiles and tortoises are brought from nearby rivers and kept here till they become adult enough to protect themselves. Then grown up and extra ones are released in the nearby big rivers. At one place you’ll see thick steel wired cages, in which different sizes of crocodiles are kept and transferred into other when they become bigger. It was a feast for the eyes, to watch baby crocodiles creeping in the cage and basking in the sun, in groups. Going ahead we saw a natural pond with crocodiles in it. Ahead you will see a small divided ponds complex, where you can watch tortoises and crocodiles. There is an area for children, having swings and rides. Besides you can watch different types of birds, deer’s , sāmbhar’s and some other animals. I saw one cafeteria also, serving snacks and tea. Walking inside this sanctuary was a very pleasant, mind refreshing and rejuvenating experience. Satish Tripathi Gorakhpur . Sctri48@gmail.com"
Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Prosico,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016,A Good Place For Going For A Picnic,"Hi, I went there yesterday and experienced one of the best places in whole of the Lucknow, but not i cleanness and security as there are some monkeys there which can attack or snatch food. When i went at the entrance there was a statue of a crocodile with a fish in his mouth, the statue was like hollow you can enter it take selfies. After that if you go to the right you will see very cute babies of crocodiles and gharial and if you go forward you will see three big crocodiles with a giant turtle in a cage like structure below the ground level and in a forest type environment and when you go more forward there will be some cages and there at the last cage will be a rare Gharial. But at the path and the park there is no cleanness. There are swings also for kids. You can enjoy on a holiday but i would better advice Janeshwar Mishra Park.Thanks."

Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Satish G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Friends,good but needs improvement,it is situated at the far north side of city and if you have your own vehicle then its better.the place is worth a visit if you love the peaceful environment amongst trees with birds chirping around you.the place is well maintained although at some part of the year the management looks careless because i saw long grass in the playground with garbage.....this place is famous as a picnic place hence named picnic spot.....but its actually crocodile rehabilitation centre to conserve crocodile population against poaching in the past....canteen is below average.toilet untidy.but the best part is that it has no entry fee.it is few kilometeres far from running main road so its better to have own vehicle or reserved vehicle.

Just outside of the city on the banks of Kukrail this forest reserve plays a host to  some good quantity of aligators and crocodiles. The place is controleed by Forest Dept.Nice and ample open space for kids to play and have a picnic. The only fallback is u find Love Birds every where just spoiling the family atmosphere. Else a good place to visit.

Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Aloy M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Can be Developed Better!,"A good Forest Reserve which has not been maintained; or should we say used more as a Park for entertainment. has a big, nicely maintained lawn with play area and Restaurant. It can be developed into a proper forest reserve with inclusion of animals. Primarily being used as a Ghariyal Breeding center, it has a lot of potential to be developed into a real Forest Reserve. The approach road is good. Were disappointed with the resident Fauna!"
