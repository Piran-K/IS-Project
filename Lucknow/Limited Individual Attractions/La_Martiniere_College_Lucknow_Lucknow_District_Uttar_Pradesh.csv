La_Martiniere_College,Tom B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Family History,We made a trip to the college where my partners Grandfather boarded as a young boy before coming to England 75 years ago.  The burser and the headteacher spent hours with us talking us through what it would have been like at the school then and the history of the area which was fascinating.  I Apologise for not remembering the names of the two gentlemen - I wish I could but my memory is clearly much inferior to both of them.  The headteach my god remembered my partners extended family from that long ago that remained in the area.  He pointed us to their exact old home which is no longer a home but still amazing to experience and see.To top if off they then found pictures that we had never seen of my partners Grandfather when he was at the school and some of his sporting records which was again amazing.I can't thank you enough for the time you gave us.  It was a special day and a special trip for us so much appreciated.

As I walked throughout the house, one of the cleaners opened the door to the trophy room living me aghast at the sight of several taxidermied tigers. As I walked around the grounds, resident students were milling around."

The last Nawab(ruler) of Awadh , Wahid Ali Shah was one of the most intriguing character who has become a subject of myths and lore. His reign saw the pinnacle of opulence and ended in a tragic downfall and doom. In a town full of buildings of the Nawabi era and later British residency period , This complex stands out conspicuously to tell a different tale. The building in this complex is an amalgamation of different genres of European Architecture representing Claude Martin’s dual and enigmatic character. Claude Martin bequeathed the estate to a Trust which now runs an elitist college here. A quiet oasis struggling to keep the chaotic growth of the city at bay."

Meant to be the house of Major-General Claude Martin, this house records the aesthetic side of India's colonial past. It is worth spending some time in. If you are looking for more touristy places, then you can safely give it a miss."
La_Martiniere_College,Kaustav B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Amazing Architecture ,Visited the place after reading the reviews and we are really thankful for that. An amazing place with an amazing European architecture. The place now houses the La Martin college and this would rank as one of the best (if not the best) college campuses in India. The main building is a gigantic structure with figures of Lion and Angels adorning the roof. The main building is called the “Constantia” and is also a part of  Lucknow history. It was sad that there was no guide to tell us details about the place. This place is a must visit and a welcome change in sight after watching all the Mughal Architectures.
La_Martiniere_College,Rohit RC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,A very well maintained and beautiful building and campus,"This is one of the most beautiful buildings in India!The motto of La Martiniere is ‘Labore et constantia’ ""By Labour and Constancy"". The La Martiniere College was established in 1845, founded in accordance with the Will of Major General Claude Martin. Born in Lyon, France, in 1735, the Founder died in Lucknow on 13 September, 1800. Muzaffar Ali, the noted Bollywood film producer, director of Anjuman, Gaman, Umrao jaan and many others studied at this school. Coming from Lyon, Claude Martin must have acquired an eye for imposing architecture from his childhood days in his beautiful home town. His architectural skills were much in demand at Lucknow and his nearness to Nawab Asaf-ud-daula gave him a unique opportunity to participate in the making of modern Lucknow. Some of the buildings of Lucknow which have Martin's distinctive touch are: Farhad Baksh, Asafi Kothi, Bibiapur, Barowen and of course the Constantia."

A fitting use of the money he accrued, probably at the expense of others. Very accommodating staff, as we were allowed into the chapel, library and other interesting parts of the complex."

We had a good wander around and were amazed at the size of the campus and how nice it was.  The main old building seems to have a unique eclectic character all of its own.  Lots of voices have been heard in the  corridors here.  YMMV

This school for both boys and girls has been serving as a top most learning centre in Lucknow, contributing their bit in field of knowledge in the city. "
La_Martiniere_College,Meg_Redding,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,"Upper Class India, Oh So Colonial","Visiting the college is an eye opener to how the rich educate their children in India. Not sure if the college is now for the poor or the rich. Probably for the poor emulating the rich. Horse riding was included.  Smells of urine in some places. But it was an amazing visit with views of architecture, history, culture. The chapel is beautiful and very special. Met a young student studying in the chapel.  We were there on a Sunday and he sat next to the Emblem Table, studying. He understood some English so we chatted for a little.  Beautiful rooms around and wonderful grounds. Worth a visit because of the history.  Took pictures of the brass bell and the historical arches, and chapel, and beautiful cross. Loved it and stays in memory ...."
