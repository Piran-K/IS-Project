Lucknow,Ambarish2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Couples,Wow Awadh,"History and culture mixed together.I am not writing this review to tell you about Lucknow.I would like to say just 2 things:1. Don't just restrict yourself to the Imambaras and the Parks. Take a stroll through Quaiserbagh area and visit the tombs, gates, Baradari and other monuments.2. Don't restrict yourself to just Tundey Kababi and Dastarkhwan. Check out the local places for Awadhi cuisines. Also try the Basket chat and Nimish (available only in Autumn/Winter)"

Lucknow,Abinash M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Family,"Lucknow Tour Hotel, Places to visit, foods and How to Travel","I visited Lucknow on 16-10-2021, COVID 19 has changed everything but COVID 19 restrictions are low in Lucknow, Mask is important but not mandatory here. No Airport Restriction about double vaccine or RT CPR report is required but still take all precautions.We were staying in Hotel Nexus near Gurudwara Charbaag, hotel and staffs all are good in rating I will provide 4 out of 5 stars .Now comes about local sightseeing must visit points are:- 1. British Recidency (DSLR Allow but no video recording)2. Bara Imambara(DSLR not allow but Mobile photography is allowed)3. Chota Imambara4. Rumi Darwaza5. Bouli 6. Picture gallery(DSLR and Mobile allow but no photography)7. B.R. Ambedkar Memorial Park(DSLR not allow only Mobile photography)8. Janeshwar Mishra Park (optional)These places are mandatory and extra places you can choose by yourself.First when to purchase tickets in Bara Imambara it includes from 2nd point to 6th point in single ticket. In Bara Imambara you will need a local guide to help you in Bhul Bhulaiya we were three in number so it cost 125 for all which include Bara Imambara but we paid 150 for all which include Bara Imambara, Chota Imambara, Bouli so I will suggest you to take guide for full or else you have to pay extra to enter Bouli In B.R. Ambedkar Park Rs. 15.00 for entry the place is beautiful and good for relaxing If you wish to purchase Chikon Items there is a local factory of government which provides best quality Chikon in low rates 2 days are enough to visit all places. Where to eat:- You can eat food near Mohan hotel Maharaja but food quality is avg. I will prefer to eat from your hotel price maybe higher but the quality will be good or if you like a south indian food please take a visit to Selvam's.Now how to visit these place and how to reach the hotel:- If you really book Hotel Nexus, from Airport it will take 30min and from Railway Station, it will take 12 mins a taxi will take 250-320 for Airport and auto will take 40 from station.And how to visit these places you can book you own ride but I will suggest a Panjabi Guy Amarjeet Singh he Drives an Auto Rickshaw but this guy is very good in manner and trustable he set the rate at very reasonable price and I really appreciate that his Contact Number is 7860509907 if you ar 3 to 4 in number try him you won't regret.On 18-10-2021 we return back."
