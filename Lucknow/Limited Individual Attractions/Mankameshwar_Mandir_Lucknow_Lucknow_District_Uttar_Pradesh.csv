Mankameshwar_Mandir,Somaseshu Gutala,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"My Visit to Mankameshwar Temple, Lucknow","In Lucknow most of the temples are small with simple construction without much sculptures and carvings. Most of them were re-constructed by Mahants with the co-operation of philanthropists and devotees. This temple though small has wonderful frescoes carved on friezes on four sides of the temple tower. We find the carvings of Durga, Kalabhairav and Hanuman emerging out of the mouth of the demoness Surasa. This temple is located between Hasanganj and Daliganj area in the heart of the city on the left bank of the Gomati River. This temple is managed by Mahant Devagya Puri (Arunima Singh), the first woman Mahant in Lucknow. According to legends King Lakshman came here after leaving Sita in exile and worshipped Lord Shiva to get mental peace. Later a temple with twent-three golden urns was built by King Navdhanu after conquering his enemy. In twelfth century this temple was destroyed and plundered by Yemeni invaders. Five hundred years ago Naga sadhus re-built this temple. "
