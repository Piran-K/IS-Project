Musa_Bagh,Anuradha Manjul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,"Explore Lucknow – Musa Bagh, the Lost Gem, its role in the history of Lucknow and the history of Independent India","Had never thought that cataloguing self-clicked photographs of one of the popular tourist points in Lucknow would lead to finding a treasure trove or as many would say Pandora’s box.A name which tumbled out was Musa Bagh. Don’t know but it had some unknown attraction; the next thing we knew was that on a sunny Saturday morning we were driving led by Google Aunty to find it. The location was on the IIM Road (from the trisection Bithauli Khurd crossing on Sitapur Road), one needs to cross the river Gomti and then take a left past the Garbage Landfill (yes the authorities in Lucknow have made the city garbage landfill right on the bank of the water source of the city River Gomti). One needs to drive for around a kilometre; and as Google says – the destination would be on your right.Some construction work is happening on the 2 lane one way road and we had to drive on the wrong side. There are no boards to inform where Musa Bagh is, though as per the Archaeological Survey of India, this is a nationally protected monument.   We could see traces of some old building, and seeing that it was it made of the Lakhori bricks (a speciality brick of the region from the time gone by), assumed that it was Musa Bagh. Yes, google confirmed that it was Musa Bagh. There was no sign board informing about the same, just a blue board proclaiming that it was a protected monument.Just before the entrance on the left there was garbage dumped (glass pieces), there were storage structures for cow dung cakes and there were two bulls (definitely of the villagers) sitting (properly tethered). Right at the entrance there were two males sitting and observing us.Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, 4th Nawab Wazir of Awadh (Oudh) has chosen this site and had a garden made here. Nawab Saadat-Ali-Khan (5th Nawab) built the garden complex. It was designed by the French General Claude Martin (yes a French serving in British East India Company, who had designed many buildings in Lucknow), who lies buried in Constantia or what today is known as La Martiniere Boys School (another one of his designs). The design was on the lines of an English Manor. The garden complex is on a raised mount, close to the river Gomti. Earlier the river was closer, and now it has moved slightly farther (changed its course). Around it are lush green fertile farms (they were there even when the garden complex was constructed) which thanks to unplanned development would soon turn into concrete jungle or barren land, if nothing is done.The garden complex was completed between 1803-1804 CE; far away from the main city, to serve as a country retreat. There is story about the name of the complex – many people believe that Musa Bagh was a corruption (as we say in Hindi – Apbransh) of Monsieur Garden (Frenchman’s garden) as they believe that Musa (meaning Moses in English) has no place in Islam (the Nawabs were followers of Shia sect of Islam – having their roots in Iran). This is incorrect. Musa Bagh could have been named in the memory or honour of Hazrat Musa, who is a revered prophet in Islam. Musa or Hazrat Musa is mentioned in Quraan (the holy book of Islam), he is revered by the Muslims the same way he is revered in Judaism. Yes Hazrat Musa and Moses are same. One can find mention of Hazrat Musa across Quarn – e.g. Surah Al-Baqara, 51, Surah Al-Baqara, 67, Surah Al-Maida, 22, Surah Al-Araf, 116, Surah Yunus, 81.Another name by which this garden complex has been referred by old European chroniclers is Baroween which could have been the anglicised version of berūn (an urdu word meaning outside or pertaining to the suburbs or country); the complex for sure would have been referred by this name as it was outside the main city.This complex was once the entertainment ground of the Nawab; the wild beast fights organised by him were famous among the Europeans and the natives; it is said the smaller animals like antelopes were trained to fight here.The structure today is in ruins. At the entrance there are stairs in a shape of semi- circle, broken at many places. The structure is without roof. The walls are made out of Lakhori bricks and had been plastered. The building would in its hay days would have had many floors, the level on which we were standing and a level above (because of the presence of pillared walls on the higher level). Some restoration work has been done by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) more than a decade ago.  We could see beautiful Roman style pillars on the top level, having beautiful stucco work. At centre there is a large hall (no roof), which is surrounded by a large wide gallery like area which earlier were rooms. At the corners of the hall, there are two cylindrical chamber with dome like structures having winding staircases reaching the upper level. The staircases are in bad shape and it’s advisable not to risk climbing them as it might damage them further. The domes have oval shaped windows (now just gaping oval holes). It is said that the Nawab used to watch the fights from these oval windows. There is small open well like structure (no water only plants and garbage) in this hall. According to historians this was part of Claude Martin’s architectural skills – using such sunken structures to cool the surrounding rooms, idea is to use the natural elements to cope with the heat. Nothing much remains in terms of the interiors except the floral vine patterns on the walls here and there, remnant of some faded patterns (probably some Frescos) on the walls.Musa Bagh played an important role in the revolt of 1857 (related to Awadh region), India’s first war of independence against the British or as the British call it the Sepoy Mutiny. It was here that the revolt in Awadh region started in 1857. Musa Bagh was occupied by 7th regiment of Oudh Irregular Infantry (British army) which had majority of native Indian soldiers. Adjutant of the regiment was Lt. Mecham of Madras army. On 30th April 1857, the soldiers refused to use the cartridges fearing that these were new beef & cow lard laden cartridges (the cover of cartridges was supposedly made out of lard from Beef and Pig which had to be chewed off). Lt. Mecham was able to pacify the soldiers informing that these were the same cartridges which they had used last fortnight. The soldiers proceeded with their practice. But Lt. Mecham was met with the same resistance next day, the soldiers were adamant and didn’t relent. By the 3rd of May 1857, the soldiers had decided to kill the Europeans in the regiment. Somehow this was avoided, the soldiers or the sepoys returned to their lines but refused to surrender their arms. They were paraded and subdued in complying.Sir Henry Lawrence, the chief commissioner of Oudh didn’t take the mutiny lightly. He marched to Musa Bagh (from the main city) with a force consisting of 32 foot European Battery, 32 regular native regiment infantry and 1 cavalry. The 7th regiment was rounded up and asked to lay down their arms, under force and fear they complied. The next day their leaders were captured who informed Sir Lawrence of the plans of General Uprising. They were hanged in-front of the regiment.The mutiny though curbed for the moments had left some sparks which in the coming months led to major events in the region and Lucknow. The scene of action moved from Musa Bagh to other places in the city and it was not until 1858 when it returned back.Interestingly it was at Musa Bagh where the insurrection ended in the year 1858 (almost a year later) in March. Begum Hazrat Mahal (the queen or the wife of Nawab Wazid Ali Shah) and his son Birjis Qadr along with many revolutionaries (according to records around 7000-9000 in numbers) made Musa Bagh as their headquarters in their resistance against the British army after being driven out from Kaiser Bagh Palace. The revolt was coming to an end in Oudh with British army gaining over and recapturing many areas in Lucknow. Sir Colin Campbell, Commander-in-Chief of British Army in India, ordered the commissioner of Oudh, Lt. General James Outram to capture Musa Bagh. On March 19, 1858, Outram marched towards Musa Bagh with 2 squadrons of the 9th Lancers, 1 company Royal Artillery, 1 company native sappers, Middleton’s Field Battery, 2 18-pounders, 2 8-inch howitzers, 4 S-inch mortars (all under Captain Carleton, R.A), 3 companies of 20th Regiment, 7 companies of 23rd Regiment, the 79th Highlanders, and the 2nd Punjab Infantry. He was supported by Hope Grant’s guns and musketry fire from the opposite side of the river.The complex was badly damaged by the British Army. The rebels either fled or were killed. The Queen and her son fled to Terai area and later to Nepal. Other important revolutionary leader Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah also fled (it was much later he was recaptured and hanged). The revolutionaries or rebels who were caught were hanged – Musa Bagh became the mass hanging area. So in a way the circle was complete – the revolt ended from where it had started.Once a thriving place, a classic piece of Indo-European architecture, is today in complete ruins. Thanks to the neglect by the authorities and complete disregard of its historic importance by the locals. The complex is being used by villagers and locals in the vicinity as open defecation area– we had to step carefully as there was human feaces  all around. We could also see broken syringes lying around – probably this place has become a favourite haunt for drug addicts. A gentleman walked in and started following us while we were exploring, on questioning him who he was he informed that he was the caretaker appointed by the ASI. On further probing he showed his helplessness in doing anything to stop open defecation in the complex.This place has lot of heritage value, has a beautiful architectural history. It needs immediate attention and awareness of its plight. If nothing is done soon, this hidden gem would soon be lost in the rubbles of time; and like many other places only pictures would remain to tell its story.Definitely worth a visit, not once but many times."
