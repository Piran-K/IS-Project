Mystery_Rooms,moniyash01,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,A mind blowing experience,"What a experience it was in the Mystery rooms the challenges , tasks , surprises and the MYSTERIES we faced were awesome. I went for the 2nd time me and my friends enjoyed the experience 2 times and we are very lucky that we got to know about this place and visited there and enjoyed the experience.

Mystery_Rooms,RishadMurtaza,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Mystery Rooms....  Adventure worth imbibing,Mystery Rooms. It's an adventure worth imbibing. You may visit them with family or friends at any time of the day or year. Even if you had been an ardent fan of Sherlock Holmes you would still need all your intellect and imagination to succeed in the journey.  There are clues concealed with supreme acumen and hints drop by.  A knowledge of law and love for books would come handy.  So pull up your skills and take the challenge.  The more people are in the group the more one would enjoy. So all the best and have an enjoyable and mesmerizing experience

Mystery_Rooms,shagunagarwal12,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Over expensive,Experience was good but it was overpriced .Not worth spending 4000 for a game with 5 friends. Although I played 2 games back to back so I enjoyed the game but yes it was overpriced.Price should be of a kind that everyone can enjoy the game .And I think it was just because of overprice i found d place completely vaccant.It was just 5 of us who played.Rest is companys choice

Mystery_Rooms,GodDevil_14,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Strange but interesting,It was a good experience as far as the story and theme goes as well as the hints but the only issue that I face while solving the mystery was that the hints provided were not matching with the place where those hints were to be utilised. It was more like a guess game for the first room as most of the things were solved on the basis of instincts.
Mystery_Rooms,Skelly2202,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Great place to have fun,"This is one of the most fun places in Lucknow, the experiences are very challenging and immersive. I hope they add more experiences in Lucknow"

Mystery_Rooms,atul g,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Family visit to mystery room,"I visited mystery room on 5.4.2022 with my kids and wife. The place was deserted but staff was behaving as if they are very busy and over booked. The room was small, dark and lacked any adventure. I will not recommend it as it is a costly affair @800 rs per adult."
Mystery_Rooms,spardhachess,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022,Excellent Puzzles,Mind shuffling games. More such centres should be added in Lucknow. I have done all 5 themes and want to explore more.

Mystery_Rooms,Meander40032954841,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Family fun time,It was nicely managed. The team was monitoring through out the one hour. The puzzles were interesting and required observation and deduction. All the members of the team enjoyed. Children enjoyed the most. Even our 1 yr old member got into the mood and enjoyed by trying to use keys to open the locks which were ample. We tried the The Hurt locker. Surely will be trying others soon.
Mystery_Rooms,saurabhmh2021,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Mystery Room Lucknow,"A good innovative concept, however highly overpriced. Also the in-room safety was a concern as one of our group members fell in the deep pit, luckily was not injured seriously.We were smartly charged extra on account of some invisible taxes, not mentioned on the tickets, however upon raising the issue it was returned, Be cautious and pay only the amount mentioned on the tickets."
Mystery_Rooms,Priyankameetugupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Scary games,Wonderful experience amazing games.The whole setup and the entire activities was too good.you can more fun with family & friends
Mystery_Rooms,ps2959,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Worth one time visit,It's interesting and enjoyable for the first visit but they should include offers and better rewards and decrease the charge. Also share the pictures taken by them. 
Mystery_Rooms,ojaswanikumar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,staff was very rude and indifferent üòê and price is too high,the mystery room good but the staff/cashier there was very rude and indifferent and kept downplaying us and when i was checking whether my locker is locked or not he gave us a snarky remark as if i as a customer am not even allowed check the locker WHICH CONSISTS MY STUFF overall a very annoying guy but the game master and the person that came afterwards was very nice and 800 rupees is too much gor only 1 hour experience  
Mystery_Rooms,Mishthy A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Amazing Experience üí´,"It was overall an amazing experience and probably the first time I ever did this even though I didn't escape it was pretty cool to try. Although I would like you to improve one thing that the TV's in the room should like always show the clues, we were getting a bit confused while looking at the tv, otherwise everything was cool. "

Mystery_Rooms,pl_321789,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Mysteryrooms@Lko,The themes need to be rethinked and renamed in accordance to the experience being provided and not just to attract people. The staff need not be inherently rude and should be helpful and guiding. Also the time allotted and ticket pricing for mystery room should be synchronous to the level of the room. Waiting area for the room was good but ambience should be bettered.
Mystery_Rooms,Vibhu24,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021 ‚Ä¢ Family,Our experience.,"Experience was good.We really enjoyed. The only thing we didn't like is the price, as it was highly expensive.

Mystery_Rooms,sonalsingh22350,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021,Wonderful Experience,"If you are looking forward to spend a fun and interesting weekend with your friends, visit this place. Mystery rooms offer you good variety of options to chose and test your skills on different levels. "
Mystery_Rooms,escanor389,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2021,game chosen was abduction,dont play abduction if you have epilepsy or are in any way affected by flickering of lights secondly the clues are not at all helpfull anyone opting for abduction my advice is its just a waste of your time and money go for jailbreak or that bomb diffuse or any other but not abduction as the clues are not at all relative in any way possible btw our same friend group has solved almost every game in their catalogue but abduction is a broken one from their end only

Even the staff members were very friendly and polite. I just loved this place and especially the mystery room games that made us work together to sum up the clues and hints and move forward to next steps. The games were totally brainstorming fun activities that made us think about the situation and solve them together. Me and my best friends really had a great time together. And I suggest you all to just give this place some time so that you can experience the same too.‚úåüèª‚úåüèª"
Mystery_Rooms,vrantikashukla,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021,The cabin in the woods,The experience was good but i just have one suggestion it‚Äôs good the way you people design the game but i guess you can make the game more interesting by creating more real life experience that is try to play with psychology of the players rather than the difficulty level of solving the codes it would be more exciting and more of fun
