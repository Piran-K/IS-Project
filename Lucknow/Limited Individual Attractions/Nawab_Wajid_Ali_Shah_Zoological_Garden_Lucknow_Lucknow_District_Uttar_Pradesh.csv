With the installation of public toilets and a few eateries one can take a break from doing the rounds for a cup of tea or coffee. The state museum is also a treat, though some galleries need to be revamped. The Egyptian mummy is a star attraction in this museum.The tigers, lions, hippos and crocodiles seemed to be in good shape. But be sure to wear good, sturdy walking shoes to do the rounds of this zoo. Pathways have been tiled now so walking is easy. Plan for a three hour visit. And of course Hazratganj and its restaurants are just a ten minute walk from Banarasi Bagh. So happy walking and happy eating in the heart of Lucknow!"

Nawab_Wajid_Ali_Shah_Zoological_Garden,Samanvya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Couples,Neat and clean- but..,"Very neat very clean, but limited animals. The reptile section is especially disappointing as it has 100s of snakes and pythons but all of them of same variety. The biggest problems are the guests who will keep on teasing and irritating the animals just for fun. Do visit once- you get opportunity to see a few animals and birds really close. "

Nawab_Wajid_Ali_Shah_Zoological_Garden,KISHORE S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,"Noisy visitors, silent wild life.","The Zoo is situated in the heart of city, next to Hazratganj. If you are traveling by car, go to the gate near Police headquarter of Lucknow. Ample parking in available. The fee at INR 60 is rather high for a big group. Try not to go on a public holiday, as you are likely to face huge noisy crowd. Too many eating places within the premises make it more of a picnic spot than a real Zoo. However, the toy train is good for kids. Ask at the gate if the museum is open."

Nawab_Wajid_Ali_Shah_Zoological_Garden,mishra712,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Refreshing outing,"Lucknow zoo has a big advantage compared to a lot of other newer zoos in different cities - its location. It is located right next to Hazratganj and now houses probably as many specimen as it would have ever did. A few sections were a disappointment as still not fully functional (e.g., nocturnal section). There is ample amount of attraction for young children in terms of open spaces/lawns and play grounds (with swings, slides, merry go rounds etc) and also the mini zoo train. It's a perfect outing on a sunny winter!"
