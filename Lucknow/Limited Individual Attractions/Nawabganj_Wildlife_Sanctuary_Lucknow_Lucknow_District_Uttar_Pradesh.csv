Nawabganj_Wildlife_Sanctuary,shobha agarwal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Good for picnic purpose,This place is good for picnic purpose but from wildlife point of view this does not seems to be a good choice. Even after spending half day could not spot some unique species.
Nawabganj_Wildlife_Sanctuary,Shrikant S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,More of a picnic spot than nature sanctuary,"We went on a sunday afternoon. It came as no surprise that the place was managed poorly with officious forest officials giving tickets and asking for IDs and mobile phone numbers. Why a mobile phone number is required is beyond me!Inside the park, there were large groups of young students who had come for afternoon picnic, and with no interest in birds. So they were making ruckus, and disturbing the natural fauna. Interestingly, unlike other bird sanctuary which I have visited, there were no official guides who could spot and identify birds. It is up to the traveller to explore the pathways fully, and take pot luck at bird watching. I think that the best time would be to go there in the morning - 8ish, and spend the morning there. This would ensure that there are less picnickers and more nature lovers around.Also, the fee for taking a still camera is INR500 and gate ticket is INR 30. Swapping these rates around would also ensure that less number of picnickers enter the park, which would help in the overall maintenance and preservation. I guess that is the call the Forest Department will have to take."
Nawabganj_Wildlife_Sanctuary,supriyo g,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Picnic spot,"Went there on a chilly December morning. Only change noticed is the nice walkway bordering, maybe, one side of the lake. Though no migratory birds were visible, could be due to the freezing conditions, the lake was in rather poor condition and full of weeds. Also one has to face the menace of the monkeys if not careful of their food items.Inspite of all this a large number of people had turned up both from Lucknow and Kanpur.There's a restaurant and a children's park , so one can enjoy with family.Entry fees is ₹ 30/- per head."

Nawabganj_Wildlife_Sanctuary,Arpit141,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,Great experience,"One of the major wildlife sanctuaries attractions of Uttar Pradesh, Nawabganj Birds Sanctuary is a great weekend trip from Kanpur and Lucknow.

Nawabganj_Wildlife_Sanctuary,NitinV81,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,Enjoy winter afternoon and bonfire at night,Situated 40 kms away from Lucknow on Kanpur highway this quite and less visited place can be visited after the monsoons to enjoy the lush greenry or during fading winters to enjoy the different varieties of birds that nest here during this season. One can plan after their lunch and can spend the night here and leave early morning next day. Decent rooms are available with restaurant facility. Bonfire can be lit on request.  Families with young children will have good fun in the park situated inside (though very few swings are there). Elder ones can enjoy their stroll around the lake. A deer park is also situated inside.

Nawabganj_Wildlife_Sanctuary,Satheesh Babu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Solo,a leisure place,"I had been to this place during the  last week of November  with a lot of expectations, but unfortunately there was only a small pocket of water with a few birds in that. Only pleasant thing was the  relaxed walk around the lake which definitely will take a very long time if we need to move to all places ( I had to cut short at many places due to no birds or a simply dryland there). A walk into the woody cover gave a sight of a few more birds hid in the trees.  It is better if we ask the office people or anybody who had been there before going there as it will be these people who will be able to tell us the avian visitor crowd."
Nawabganj_Wildlife_Sanctuary,anuj729,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,Once a golden tourist spot now mismanaged.,If you are travelling to kanpur via Lucknow then it is situated on the midway mark approx 40 kms from both the cities.I won't recommend the place if your sole purpose is to visit it.There is a motel having 20 rooms to stay overnight and a nice Cafeteria premises ideal for bird watching during winters.The water body is mostly dry all around the year.Although government has huge plans and budget to facelift the place but still awaiting the grant.Thirty years back when it was newly opened there was full water body a dear park and migratory birds all around with a wide variety of flaura and fauna but all lost.Hope to revive it soon.Best to avoid it. If going to kanpur then only halt for a cup of tea.
Nawabganj_Wildlife_Sanctuary,guddu1954,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,migratory birds for bird watchers,The sanctuary is on Lucknow -Kanpur highway .During winter months you can see birds migrating from Siberia .The place is very poorly maintained.Lot more is needed.
