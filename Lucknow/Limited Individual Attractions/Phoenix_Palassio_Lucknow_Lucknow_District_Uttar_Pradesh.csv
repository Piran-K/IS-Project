Phoenix_Palassio,Arvind Misra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Best shopping destination,"One of the best place in Lucknow to shop. Middle class to premium segment.. wide range of products available here. Thank you Pallasio for introducing Gant, Superdry, GAS, AX, The White Crow and The Collective in Lucknow. Food court is noisy but ok to sit and eat. The Big Grill and Manbhavan are best dine in option inside the Mall. Wide range of Jewellery segment also available here. So overall it’s one stop shopping place just come with ur time and money and surely u will get what u want. Overall best shopping destination in Lucknow till date."
Phoenix_Palassio,Ashish P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,NO Social Distancing inside the INOX Theatres in the Palassio Mall! UNACCEPTABLE,DATE: 07.11.2021The Mall looks Grand like a palace! All good from outside but the INOX Theatres inside are NOT AT ALL ADHERING to the Social Distancing norms! NO social distancing observed while ALLOCATING SEATs and people coughing inside the Theatre!Highly UNACCEPTABLE and UNETHICAL!I wont go there again!
Phoenix_Palassio,Arpit Bajpai,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 • Business,Pathetic staff,"the mall staff is terribly rude, plus one of the staff coughing. When I said that I am going to complain he said do whatever you want. Pathetic "
