Regional_Science_City,Ashish Gupta,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Friends,Good Place to learn about science with fun,It was Sunday and we planned to visit Planetarium but one person suggested to visit this centre and we went here. From the entrance you will find numerous equipment placed to tell you and feel the science behind each equipments. It was fun to use all equipments and at last there was this show which presents technology of working of Aircraft Carriers.

Regional_Science_City,Sameer D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Nice experiments; Good experience; 3D show is for kids only,Nice optical and mechanical experiments. My 12 year old son enjoyed it a lot. I khad fun with him. Overall it was a very good experience. 3D show is for kids only - nowadays 3D movies are a commonplace. Scimax show was good. But they could have used the theatre for something better (compared with my trip to Boston Science Museum long time ago). The real fun is the experiments - spend more time there.The canteen is below average. They should better hand it over to a good food chain. 
Regional_Science_City,Inspired_by_Xperiences,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Good place to visit for kids,"This place displays some of the science experiments that students read in their books but most never get a chance to see them as a working model or even try it themselves. This place holds a special place in my memories. As kids, we used to love going to the science centre and enjoy all the experiments and tools at display. I visited this place after a long time to relive my childhood memories and also introduce my 6 years old daughter to the same. While this place still holds the same charm as it used to a couple a decades back, many of the installation are in bad state or not working. One added attraction is the kids area which houses a small play area for smaller kids. Overall felt good going back and my daughter enjoyed the trip too, but would have definitely loved if things were in a better state. With all the technology and plethora of information that today's generation has access to on tips of a finger, this place may seem dated..but still holds the attention of all its visitors. A must visit for all kids. "
