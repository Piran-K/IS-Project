Rumi_Darwaza,MoushumiBhattacharya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Designed as inverted Naulakha Haar!,"Rumi Gate is made in the design of a Naulakha haar, inverted. Also designed like the Lucknow famous Chikankari embroidery work. Very close to Bara Imambara, it has a beautiful setting to see the city passing by the gate. From one end, you can see the four stories of the architect whereas from the other end, it is the only one piece. A true marvel."

It had one main arch and two side arches, meant for passage of elephants and horses during the Nawab rulers."
