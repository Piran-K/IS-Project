Satkhanda,SVAYAMBHU C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Satkhanda Dec 2022,"We marvelled at the iconic watch tower, the Satkhanda, which was supposed to be 7 stories but ended up being 4 because of the untimely death of the nabab. The tallest clock tower of the country was also nearby. "
Satkhanda,Rohit B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Incomplete tower,"This iconic tower has an octagonal base, arched windows & Islamic design details. Conceived as a 7 storied structure, it could only be completed till the 4th level, as the Nawab's family saw a few deaths during the construction and this was conceived as bringing ill omen to the family. A nice picture spot though."
Satkhanda,Avirup Guha Roy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Tower of Seven Storeys,"Commissioned by Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah, this was actually intended to be a 7 Storeyed Watch-tower.... unfortunately, due to the untimely death of the Nawab, the construction of this tower got stalled and did not go beyond 4 levels.... the structure incorporates subtleties of Greek designing whilst the arches depict Mughal & French craftsmanship.... the unique architectural feature of this 68 ft tower is that every successive level has been built in the decreasing order of height & breadth of it's base floor"
Satkhanda,pilgrim_gsa,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Landmark,The place is located  near clock tower and visible also from Rumi Darwaza  but is in decay  and cannot be missed from the areas around .
Satkhanda,ShikshaC,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,An eye catching monument.…,The Satkhanda is located just near the Clock tower and cannot be missed if you are visiting the tower or Rumi Darwaza. This is an incomplete structure as its construction was stopped after the death of the Nawab’s daughter for whom he was building this place. 
Satkhanda,Let's Go Sightseeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Watchtower from the 1800s,"The Satkhanda was a watchtower built in the 1800s. The iconic tower has an octagonal base, arched windows & Islamic design details. It is located next to the Husainabad Clock Tower; so, if you're in the area, you can't miss it.A reminder of Lucknow's Avadhi & colonial past."

Satkhanda,FATBOY,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,SATKHANDA- Indian leaning Tower of peesa,"Satkhanda is a watchtower near Bara Imambara and Rumi Darwaza, Lucknow. Though it name means Seven Floors but it only has four red-brick floors. It's construction was undone due to the sudden demise of Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah. This vintage watchtower reminds you of French architecture. In all nice place to visit for history seekers."

Satkhanda,GingerBeer1979,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Much more interesting than you might at first think.,"This tank is much more interesting than you might at first think... defiantly accept (after the usual haggling) the services of a guide... he will show you the darker parts of the semi defensive structure, which you might not find on your own (especially without a torch!) A tour will take about 20 minutes."

Satkhanda,Manish B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Condition is deteriorating day by day,"This building was the dream project of the Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah, but the building was never took its shape as planned. Was originally planned to build 7 story building to see the moon but due to death of the nawab the project is closed. The building is very important piece of indian history but its getting worse day bay day."
Satkhanda,Sajeed K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,Nice Building,"Satkhanda, built in 1842 by Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah, is a decaying 67 meter red-brick watchtower, located just opposite to the Hussainabad Imambara. It is a splendor of medieval architecture and is visited by a number of tourists from all over the world.The tower shows a blend of French and Italian style structural designs. It was constructed during the time of Nawab Muhamad Ali Shah, but his untimely demise in 1840 blocked its construction. Though the towering structure is named as Satkhanda, which means seven stories, it holds only four stories. Famed as the tallest tower in India, Satkhanda, is believed to be built in the 1880s in memory of Sir George Couper, a reform-minded Governor of UP."
Satkhanda,guddu1954,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Family,old glory restored, This used to be a seven storeyed structure but now only four storeys are there.Till few years back it was in a very bad condition but now after extensive restoration old glory has come back.
Satkhanda,uutsav,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Friends,Looks like leaning Tower of Pisa from far,"This tower is near to Husainabad Clock Tower and the Bada Imambada. It was supposed to have 7 stories but only has 4 completed ones. According to Wiki, it was build during 1837-1842 during the time of Muhammad Ali Shah, but was left incompleted after Shah's untimely demise.Since the tower is next to the road, it won't take more than a few minutes even if one plans to halt for a while."
