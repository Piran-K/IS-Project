The large dome of the Imambara is unlike the other domes which have a slender neck like drum at the base and are onion shaped.The imambara is surrounded by large beautiful park and is quite near to Botanical garden and Hazratganj.

I even did pre wedding photo shoot for a client here. The view if offers, the mosque, the Bhool bhulaaiya are a must watch .You are now asked to cover your head with a scarf (which are available there for free) and remove your shoes to enter the mosque area .Definitely recommended to visit it!!"

Shah_Najaf_Imambara,Siddhartha Biswas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Historical Site,"This is perhaps one of the lesser visited places (at least by tourists) in Lucknow, but it is definitely worth a visit. It does not have the grandeur of the Asifi Mosque but it is as significant in the history of India as any other monument. The history of the Imambara is easily available, what made the place even more special is the local lore that said this was one of the headquarters of the Sepoys during the mutiny of 1857. It has brilliant architecture and is worth looking into."

But even after seeing these exceptional ones, one may consider visiting shah nazaf imambara. My advice would be to couple your trip to saharaganj mall with this imambara for this is located just at the edge of saharaganj mall. This is a good place to sit and relax with peace."

Shah_Najaf_Imambara,scarfman,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,A couryards huge mosque with beautiful,This mausoleum complex in the centre of Lucknow is a pilgrimage destination for many locals visiting the tomb of a former ruler. Entry is through a narrow archway into a beautiful large courtyard filled with flowers and a central lawn. Further on is the mausoleum  itself (shoes and socks off) which contains a labyrinth of small passageways as well as the tomb itself.. Outside and adjacent is the mosque which is unfortunately off-limits to non-Muslims. If you're tombed-out people-watching here is great.

It's a pleasant and interesting out if the way place, but a good choice to follow an early morning visit to the Botanical Gardens up the road as you can walk here in 10 mi Utes from the gardens."

Shah_Najaf_Imambara,zaighamraza,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,A Historical Place to Visit,It was 2nd October and my marriage function was held at this place. The lawns of Shah Najaf Imambara are best place to host a marriage ceremony and is situated in the heart of city near Hazratganj. I'd suggest to visit this place for architecture and historical purpose but never host a party there because thieves visit there in parties and steal your belongings as my jewellery of around 5 lacks was stolen from the function by thieves in my marriage function from this place.

Constructed on the bank of the river Gomati, this architectural marvel is designed in the shape of a dome. The central dome is decorated with passages on its sides and on the birthday of Hazrat Ali. You can avoid this Place to visit.Do Visit Bara and chhota Imambara."

Shah_Najaf_Imambara,Chetna1973,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Friends,A must for the religious,"The huge collection of tazias and the chandeliers inside the Shah Najaf Imambara is impressive but the building is not maintained very well, and has also lost its location advantage with the Gomti having shifted its course. Right at the end of the Shah Najaf Road near Hazratganj, it is a imambara that can easily be visited."
Shah_Najaf_Imambara,Dipeeta D Mukherjee,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,One of the best Imambaras I've visited,"Shahi Imambara and Dr. Ambedkar Park are the two locations in Lucknow that I'll never forget. Both are great, the former being very old and supposedly with a rich heritage. We loved getting lost in the dark steps in Bhulbhulaiya, as also the roof-top views and the pond downstairs. It is advisable to get an official guide from inside the premises, who'll explain everything and most of them are nice."
Shah_Najaf_Imambara,hardikmaharaja,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Business,Good peep into the history,We visited this place during our half day free time in Lucknow. The Shah Najaf Imambara is good for peep into the history and if you are interested in same. Do visit it once when in Lucknow.

Shah_Najaf_Imambara,Pallavi S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,Escapr from the Mall across,If you want to escape from the urban bustle then across from Sahara Ganj Mall is the Shahnajaf Imambara. It is a replica of Hazrat Ali's tomb in Najaf in Iran and this is why it is called Shahnajaf. It is a beautiful domed building and has memorabilia and photographs from the days of the nawabs. It is a tranquil and beautiful building.

Shah_Najaf_Imambara,Yorkie1970,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Solo,Lovely building in a quiet space,The location is quiet and dignified but the highlight is the crazy number of chandeliers hanging in the main Imambara space... rather like a surreal lighting showroom for psychedelic chandeliers.
Shah_Najaf_Imambara,ThyUrbanMonk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 • Friends,A Place to introspect from your own perception,"You will like the architecture,but depends upon the way you look upon the monuments.It Includes :i) Asafi Imambaraii)Rumi Darwaza on the roadsideiii)Bhool Bhulayiya ( labyrinth )iv)Jama Masjidv)Bauli Building( security surveillance )Loving the old walls and serene architecture,you will meet the nawab's grave in Imambara with old photographs hung on the wall.State Govt. is not taking much care to maintain to inner structures or it may be the responsibility of the private boards but don't think much of it,just look at the walls,roam around.Quickly catch up to the labyrinth to play and find around each other,maybe you'll get hide and seek thing to do too.Guides are available there,I will recommend to have guide for first time only.The roof is must to go,do go there and sit calmly.On returning,do visit the bauli and drink coconut water outside while moving towards parking."

Shah_Najaf_Imambara,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Family,A beautiful tribute,"Shah Najaf Imambara may not be as grand as the other two Imambaras in Lucknow – the Asafi or Bara Imambara and the Hussainabad or Chota Imambara, nevertheless it transports you to a world which reflects the eclectic past of Lucknow. Fewer tourists being aware of the place, it is an island of serenity just next to the typical trappings of the modern world – chaotic traffic and a  huge mall.In 1816, the Nawab of Awadh Ghazi-ud-Din Haider built Shah Najaf Imambara at a place called Paltan Ghat on the banks of river Gomti, as a token of his devotion to Caliph Hazrat Ali, the husband of Fatima, the favourite daughter of Prophet Mohammed. The white domed structure is said to be a replica of Hazrat Ali’s mausoleum at the city of Najaf in modern Iraq. The rear of the Imambara which faces the river.Shah Najaf Imambara is also called Karbala, because within its main hall lie the mortal remains of its builder, Ghazi-ud-Din Haider, who wished to be buried here. It also contains the graves of his wives, Mubarak Mahal (a European), Sarfaraz Mahal and Mumtaz Mahal . Ghazi-ud-din Haider’s silver tomb is flanked by the tombs of his wives on either side and the golden tomb is that of Mubarak Mahal.The hall is beautifully decorated with chandeliers and a lot of memorabilia relating to the Nawabi era. You can also see the ‘ tazia’s - intricate designs of wood, bamboo and silver paper, which are carried during the celebrations of Muharam. Enjoy a leisurely stroll in its passages which offer a great view of the Gomti river. There are no designated guides unlike Bara Imambara. One of the caretakers showed us around. He informed  us that the Shah Najaf Imambara presents a spectacular view when it is decorated and illuminated on important occasions. A nice place to enjoy some moments of tranquility."
Shah_Najaf_Imambara,Juhi A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2012 • Business,Walking distance from Hotel Arif Castles,It’s at a walking distance from the hotel.It is a lovely heritage monument & dedicated to Hazrat Ali’s S.A.W.  It has its own history & a religious importance.
