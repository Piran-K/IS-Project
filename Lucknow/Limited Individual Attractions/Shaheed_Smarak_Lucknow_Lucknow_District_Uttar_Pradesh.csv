Shaheed_Smarak,YatriForever,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,Nice Stupa in memory of Matyrs,"This is a tall, well built stupa Memorial to salute those who laid thier lives for the freedom of the nation. Since we were staying in Riverbank Colony, it was easy to walk up here. The upkeep of the park is not at its best and the Gomti was dirty, some sort of dredging was going on. If you happen to be in this area of Lucknow or visiting the Planetarium, its worth a quick visit here. This is not exactly a tourist attraction. "
