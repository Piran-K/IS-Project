Sikandar_Bagh,baburammarch25,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Signifies the great landmark of India's first war of Independence.,"This great historical landmark is not as much maintained as it should be, give the great historical significance that it stands for. The garden area is well maintained. However, work can be done to restore glory of the architecture."
Sikandar_Bagh,Aarav K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Sikandar Bagh,"This is a historical place. Not well maintained. If you are a history lover, you should definitely check it once. There is nothing special for everyone else."
Sikandar_Bagh,Rajani B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Park within Botanical Research Institute,"This is a park within the National Botanical Institute which was built in the year 1800. The park was named after the queen of Wajid Ali Shah , who was the last ruler of Awadh.  The historical importance of this place is that it was the site of India's first war of Independence.  The garden is a beautiful and well maintained one."

Sikandar_Bagh,ameoba88,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2013 • Solo,Should not be an option of TripAdvisor,"Seriously, no joke. The only reason this is up here on TripAdvisor is because it's a protected site by the Architectural Society of India. Wouldn't take you even 5 minutes to visit - and you'd hardly be adding any value in those 5 minutes either.It is a smallish park basically - with a few benches around. A good place to sit and have a conversation perhaps, but it's located at a major intersection so pretty noisy. There is a largish arched doorway - inside of which construction is stored. There's a small masjid which you can't enter unless you're a muslim - not stand out from an architectural PoV anyways. Annd that's about it."
Sikandar_Bagh,KGB777,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2013 • Solo,A small garden with a renovated gateway,Worth a quick stop to soak up the atmosphere of old Lucknow. Some peace and tranquillity near a major intersection.
