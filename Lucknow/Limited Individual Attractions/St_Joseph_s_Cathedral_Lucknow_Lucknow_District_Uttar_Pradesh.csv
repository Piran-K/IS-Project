I visited this place with my family. The environment was so good that we wanted to stay a little bit more listening to the lovely christmas carols that the young people were singing. So many people were visiting the place but there were no pushing or hustle. Hats off to the people of Lucknow, and thanks to the police and administration for organizing such an event with so many people without any chaos. "

St_Joseph_s_Cathedral,sunitmathur1203,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Brilliant during Christmas,"One of the most beautiful churches in Northern India is the St Josephs Cathedral Lucknow.  Dominating the scene in Hazratganj one is struck by the spectacular architecture of this Church. The upper part of this magnificent building is in the shape of a crescent supported by a broad structure, and rising from this crescent is a tall column with a giant cross on top. The statue of Jesus Christ with open arms, which stands atop the entrance to the prayer hall on the first floor, that we reach through the broad stairway is very awe-inspiring and reverential. The original building was constructed by Rev Fr William Gleeson and consecrated in 1862 by Bishop Anastus Hartmann. St Joseph’s  Cathedral was put up by an international organization to replace the earlier church that stood here for 99 years till 1970. The prayer hall of St. Joseph Cathedral is very spacious with pews on either side for you to say prayers in silence and pay obeisance to the Almighty with due reverence and devotion. The walls of the prayer hall are covered with the paintings representing the events from the life of Jesus Christ. A must visit place, especially during Easter and Christmas."
