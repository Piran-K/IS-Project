State_Museum,JoyBose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Solo,Definitely worth seeing to get an idea of history of india,"It is located inside lucknow zoo and needs a separate entry ticket apart from zoo ticket. It has 3 floors. Remember to see all the galleries, some are at the end of narrow corridors and can be easily missed. It's filed with many hidden gems even though it's maintenance can be improved. It has buddha gallery, jain art gallery, coins, natural history section, war museum section, egypt section etc. Wpuld highly recommend it to see. The bronzes are pretty good and so is the egypt section. "
State_Museum,pilgrim_gsa,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Awful- Don't Waste your time and money,The most foolish thing is location of the Museum right inside the Lucknow Zoo ...which means one has to buy a zoo entry ticket ( as I was forced to buy before being allowed to walk in towards the museum ) and then one buys again an entry ticket to the museum -it can only happen in India where  history and archaeological museum is located inside a zoo !The displays are tardy employees hired for life to spend their life there watching on their mobiles movies think of visitors as disturbance ..many exhibits  removed what are there are not dusted >Indian bureaucracy ripping tax payers money by holidaying here .Just Avoid This Place .
State_Museum,Saif Khan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Awesome ,It's really good museum I really Love it too much and  Egyptian gallery is good over all I say that I have a great feeling when I visited there I say to all of u should watch
State_Museum,Joe,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Disgraceful museum,"This is the worst museum I've ever visited. Dilapidated, dirty and dull. The display cases look as though they were banged together 50 years ago and haven't by touched since. The staff were disinterested or unhelpful, and spoke little English if any. I felt unwelcome, and the place had the atmosphere of a funeral parlour. The only good thing was that the entrance fee was only 50 rupees (though we had to pay 80 to enter the zoo within which the museum stands. Don't waste your time. It's a disgrace."
State_Museum,"DGK, UK",1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,"Very poor, old and dirty place","Regrettably after visiting the excellent folklore museum in Pune, this one in Lucknow is not recommended to visit. The very few artefacts are poorly displayed, explanations in English are mostly absent, dust, rubbish and dirty toilets make it unworthy of a visit. We had to wait in the cold for the Museum to open at 10.30 and none of the staff could communicate with us in English and confusion prevailed. You have to enter first the Zoo and pay a ticket of 80 Rupees per person and then at the Museum foreigners pay an additional ticket of 50 rupee each. What a waste of time! Best to be avoided.   "
State_Museum,durham05,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Mummy is the best ,This museum is located within the zoo so costs in total 130 rupees to get in. Enjoyed seeing the mummy but most of the Egyptian exhibits are modern copies. Other galleries are good and quite a lot to see. Good value.
State_Museum,Gene R J,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,An interesting but tired collection better suited for locals.,"We took an Uber from our La Place Sarovar Hotel 1.7 km to the Lucknow Zoo. After paying 60 Inr each, we followed the colored zoo signs 1 km east to this museum.  The ticket office opened at 10:40 AM where we paid 50 Inr each before walking to the main hall built in 1963. The 1st floor Egyptian Room with its glass cased 1000 BC Mummy was the best exhibit. Then we climbed 3 1/2 sets of stairs to view the other rooms dedicated to archaeological antiquities, Buddha's dioramas, guns and swords, ancient coinage, Buddhist Thankas, 18th-19th C paintings, and natural animals.  Most of the displays show their age with difficult lighting, lack of English descriptions/dates, and overall a semi clean facility.  But it was Tuesday morning and the litter was being swept down the stairwells and the red spittle was being removed from the corners. For a brighter sight, we took an Uber  3 km east to La Martiniere College to see the beautiful ""Constantia"" Palace, noted as the best preserved colonial (1790's) building in Lucknow."
State_Museum,ashok_shrikhande,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,State Museum,"The State Museum is a four-story building established in 1863 in Lucknow. It is one of the oldest and largest multipurpose museum located in the state of Uttar Pradesh.Initially, it only had a collection of Awadh arts and contemporary Awadh objects. But later on, the collection was expanded to many antiquities exhumed from nearby places. Many of them are particularly from the place where the Lord Buddha grew up. The museum today has a variety of bronzes, sculptures, paintings, etc. The sculptural masterpieces displayed in the museum date back to the 3rd century AD. The centre of the attraction of this museum isEgyptian mummy and a wooden sarcophagus. The museum exhibits hundreds of antiquities including numismatics, paintings, art and archaeology, manuscripts, and anthropology.The design and construction of the museum offer visitors the visual accounts of the freedom struggle of 1857. The museum has been divided into two parts- ground floor and basement parts. There is a huge double columned portico at the southern direction of the entrance of ground floor. The museum has also added a new gallery to the basement.It exhibits a range of artworks recovered during the excavation of the south part of Residency."
State_Museum,Aarav K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Solo,State Museum,State museum is in banarsibagh. This is very old museum. There are many such historical things in this museum that are worth seeing. Good place for history lovers.
State_Museum,P. V. Arul,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Solo,"State museum, lucknow","The collections are good. But the upkeep is not up to the mark. Compared to several other museums in India, this is not a very impressive one."
State_Museum,bukc,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,Nice museum. Heritage value,"The State Museum, located within the Zoo, is a well kep museum. It has artifacts from the Mauyan Shunga and Kushana era (3 Century BCE onwards).But the newly created Egyptian gallery around the mummy of 13 year old girl and the casing is unique to this museum and surely worth a visit.This museum should have a guided tour programme like they have at the National Museum Delhi."
State_Museum,sumantra_travel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016,"State Museum, 20 Sep'15","20 September, 2015.The State Museum is a hidden gem in the city of Lucknow,curiously enough, co-located with the Lucknow Zoo, and locatedright inside the complex. The museum is old, but extremely neatand clean, and well-maintained. We had a short visit to the placeon Sunday, 20 September, 2015. The place is spread over quite afew floors, and has a large number of exhibits of India's historyand culture, to natural history. The historical artifacts rangefrom Harappan era seals, to famous statues and statuettes(especially of the Buddhist era), and also, historicalphotographs of Lucknow! Junior found the Natural History sectionquite exciting, with stuffed animals in very realistic settings.Another curiosity is a Tu-124V aircraft parked right outside themuseum, a VIP transport aircraft, which is preserved there.This has quite a lot of attraction for aviation buffs, since this isone of the two Tu-124V planes of the Indian Air Force, and one of the veryfew actually built in the former Soviet Union."
State_Museum,Shubham Gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Its awesome place for art lover,here you can see art of ancient india as this is museum . but it a great place of history lovers and i love this place
State_Museum,Arpit141,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,Nice experience,"The Lucknow State Museum takes the guests to the trip of history and lets the history freaks lost in the primordial times. This museum is extremely impressive with its etchings, decorative arts, woodworks, housing sculptures, paintings, bronze statues from the ancient epoch."
State_Museum,pensioner090,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Some fantastic pieces in this large collection,"You do have to pay to see the zoo in order to get to the Museum, but that's OK as the zoo is not too bad! The museum is huge, but you can move through it quickly and stop when you find some special items to spend time appreciating. There are some terrific stone carvings in the collection and a range of other artefacts which give a good introduction to Uttar Pradesh archaeology."
State_Museum,chetan1586,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,Glimpse of History,State museum is a good place for history lovers. There are a lot of figures & collections of Hindu & Buddhist artifacts.The only issue is that you have to first enter the zoo & then only you can visit the state museum by paying the entry prices again for it
State_Museum,sandy c,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Solo,Pay twice to kill a little time.,"Yes- first you must pay to get into the zoo, then again to enter the museum.  If you're a foreigner you'll pay higher prices both times.Anyhow, this dusty old building has a half-interesting collection.  Not much info and looking at the state of things here, that ain't going to change.Lot's of Buddhist and Hindu stuff here, but you'd really have to be an enthusiast to know what's what.  For some reason the applied arts section consists of knives and machine guns.There is a really dumbed down history of the Buddha diorama, I guess directed at kids.Most of the building seems abandoned.  You could kill a little time here, but don't expect enlightenment."
State_Museum,Durgesh K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 • Family,A are collection of artifacts from around the world.,A well established and well preserved collection of artifacts are here for display.It doesn't only put forth the history of Awadh or UP or North India but it showcase a wide verity of knowledgeable pieces of history for the visitors. The entrance is through the Lucknow zoo. One can take one's 4 wheeler inside with proper permissions and on conditions that it will be parked in State Museum Campus. The compound also houses a Crafts Museum. The state museum is decently maintained (in fact it is more or less similar to other Archaeological museums across the country). The place has three floors open to public and houses items from various eras in Indian history including Indus Valley civilisation. It also has a special section on the state of Awadh. One interesting attraction here is an Egyptian Mummy - though not in so well lit area.
State_Museum,Anuradha Manjul,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2014 • Family,A good place to visit to get a hang of history of not only Awadh but also India,"As an ardent lover of Indian history, iconology and architecture, this place is always is my first preference.

State_Museum,wanderlust_AGH,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2013 • Solo,Worst museum I've ever visited,"Came here on the recomendation of a local, I have seen better exhibitions in school halls...have to walk through the zoo to get here, that in itself is depressing enough if you have any ounce of humanity in you; dont bother visiting eithe of these."
