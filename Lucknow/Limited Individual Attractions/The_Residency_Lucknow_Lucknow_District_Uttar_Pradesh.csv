The_Residency,SagarVS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Must do,"This place is a delight for photographers. Amazing buildings all over and they are all well maintained and clean. Surely worth visiting, but I suggest you take a guide with you to understand the significance of the monuments here and the history and stories behind it."
The_Residency,SVAYAMBHU C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,The Residency,"The Residency was a revelation. Very well maintained by ASI, the buildings which still wore the bullet wounds and mortar shell shots, took us back to the mutiny that took place almost 170 years back."
The_Residency,Akshay Sharma,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,The dilapidated residence of British forces,This is a place where British officers and soldiers used to stay during the pre-independence era. The place is well maintained. There is an entry ticket. One needs a guide to understand the ruins.
The_Residency,Rohit B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Very colonial,"During the siege of 1857, the British Residency was used for a vast number of Britishers to reside. The structure built much earlier by the Nawab of Lucknow has remained in its ruined form ever since. A good visiting place for the history lovers!"
The_Residency,Siddharth S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Steeped in History,Gives goosebumps to imagine what the British soldiers & their families must have felt during their 5 month siege in 1857. Great place for children to experience the horrors of conflicts (even with much less sophisticated  weapons of old world)
The_Residency,SuprabhatC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Heritage at its best,"Well maintained. Although the sound and light show was not available. We sent a great time in the evening reliving the mutiny during the British period. Public transport options can be more for easier access to the place, specially in the evening. "
The_Residency,Avirup Guha Roy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Ruins of a Bloody Tale,"The imposing 3 storeyed building was meant for the British residents in the city leading to the name given to the compound.... during the Mutiny of 1857, families of a lot of British Officers had taken refuge in the underground rooms located in the southern part of the building.... you can easily spot the cannon-ball and bullet marks sprayed across the walls bearing evidence of the intense confrontation"
The_Residency,Atasi P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Nice history,Really well maintained. One could get the sense of history of the place. The grounds are really great top stroll and see the ruins.
The_Residency,silva s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Great place to visit,It's like revisiting history. The place is ruins of the grand past of India. There is a small museum too. We had a great time here. One caution is that you have to walk a lot. I had senior citizens in my team and no wheel chair service was available.
The_Residency,BISWABRATA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021 • Family,British Residency,Good Place to see. Well maintain the area. Historical must see place in Lucknow. Mobile photography only allowed here.
The_Residency,gpradeepshenoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Solo,Good historical place,Residency is located near Kaiserbagh bus stand in Lucknow. You can reach Kaiserbagh bus stand from wherever your in Lucknow through bus or share auto's or using combination metro and share auto's. From Kaiserbagh bus stand residency is about 15-20 minutes walk.      It's a historical place connected with 1857 mutiny. The area is well maintained and entrance charges here is Rs 20. There is also a small museum inside residency where we can enter showing the ticket of Residency. Guides are not available at this place and in front of every building/monument within the Residency there is a brief description written about that particular building/monument.     This place has Greenery and good kept lawns but in afternoon because of heat it will be tiring to visit this place as it involves a lot of walk.        Before entering Residency ensure you have sufficient drinking water stock with you . A good place to visit in Lucknow.
The_Residency,John Muriango,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Solo,Amazing.,"Really fascinated with the history behind this place. After the end of the last Nawab of Lucknow rulers, the British formally established their reign, however, some remnants laid siege to the new British lords and it was here that the British fled for refuge."
The_Residency,AnupamSharan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,1857 Mutiny History forgotten by many,"This is the starting point of 1857 Mutiny. A fact not many are aware, and was an eye opener. A must visit place when visiting Lucknow. Take a guide to understand and appreciate the historic facts"
The_Residency,DrKlair,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Relive India's first war of independence.,Must visit. This complex houses the ruins of residency as they were after the first war of independence in 1857. Take a good guide .You can spend a whole day here if you are a history lover.
The_Residency,Jamesbondo7,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 • Family,Nice,It's very beautiful side to visit.  It very huge so you have to walk a lot . Its pity there is no guide service to explain this beautiful and historic side . 
The_Residency,JoyBose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,"A heritage building built by British, famous for the 1857 War","This complex is managed by the Archeological Survey of India. Tickets are Rs 20 for Indians. One has to scan the QR code and pay online during Covid. It consists of a number of buildings. The main building has a museum commemorating the 1857 war, explaining the history with paintings, weapons etc. Other buildings include begum kothi, where a british wife of the nawab used to live, along with a mosque. Another one is the banquet hall. Another important building is the doctor's house. Most the the buildings were shelled during the 1857 war and so are ruined. The complex also contains a cemetery for British soldiers, and memorial for those killed in 1857. Its quite clean and well maintained. Would recommend to anyone interested in the history of Lucknow and British India. "
The_Residency,R1chardN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A most for historians,"Lucknow is a gem for history enthusiasts.  The town holds a very special place in the rise and eventual fall of British rule.  It is the scene of the 1857 mutiny where about 3000 people took refuge in the Residency.  The battle and siege continued for about 5 months and only about 1000 marched out at the time of surrender.The British Residency is a must see and a guide is a must to get the most from this incredible site.  The grounds inside the gated walls are immense and the buildings grand and infrastructure advanced.  The ruins still depict the great halls, living quarters, administration blocks and other buildings.  Some of the walls are riddled with holes from cannon shot and others bear the scars of fire damage.  The battles must have been ferocious but, prior to the siege, it was a grand existence and not difficult to see why the Europeans enjoyed their time and were reluctant to return home.Do visit the museum which has a scale model of the site and some historic exhibits.  Unfortunately it was partly closed on the day we visited.  It was a little sad to see this once great structure in this ruined state but it is not difficult to imagine how severe the fighting must have been.  This a must see historic site."
The_Residency,Tom B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A piece of history,A facinating place.  It's just ruins but there is so much to learn from here.  The history is incredible and facinating.  It's very clean - a few stray dogs but this is part and parcel of India generally.  It's well worth a couple of hours having a walk around.
The_Residency,MPJ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Lucknow as of now,"Fairly well maintained. Beautiful site worth a visit any day. To do justice to Lucknow visit, it will need 6 days at least."

The_Residency,Vivek K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,British Residency,Visited remains of buildings of British Residency. Good efforts to preserve the structures right from revolt of Indian soilders against Britishers in 1857. There are signs of bullets on the walls.

The_Residency,WorldTraveler,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Worth a visit ,Best attraction in Lucknow but that’s no huge compliment. If you like war or history then it is very interesting and tells a great story. Could be better maintained.

The_Residency,Sarbajit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Where every brick tells a story,After the Bada Imaambara this is the place one should not miss if you are interested in a piece of history. The ruins of old british quaters are spread across a large area. Also a good place to experiment some architectural photography competitions.
The_Residency,Chandra P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Worth visiting ,The ruins of the residency are well worth seeing to see the difference in lifestyle of the British rulers to the average citizen.  It is in stark contrast to the average person who lives here.  The site is being upgraded but is wonderful shape.  All of the writings are in both English and Hindi.  You can take the place in on your own pace in a few hours.

The_Residency,rogerl044,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,History preserved,I especially wanted to see this to understand the situation during the siege. It is worth knowing the history of the battle before going as I found the guide content to just explain what the building were. Only half of the original property is available for inspection as the army uses the rest but the holes made by the cannon shot and musket fire is very visible and reading the grave markers brings alive the daily life of the resident during the bombardment.Definitely worth seeing.
The_Residency,rajeev_poet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Business,History teaches,"Visiting this place is entering in the past. Our freedom fighters of 1857 eliminated the foriegn rule and ruined the british authourity success fully. The hindu and the muslims fought together and won. A must visit place, very well curated ."
The_Residency,Dibyendu87,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Residency still carrying wounds,One of the best place to visit in Lucknow.

The residence is still bearing the wounds of the shells and bullets till date. Its an ASI monument. Ticket price is Rs 25
The_Residency,Sparkling soul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Historical visit,It's good. Really good. Has a lot of things to see and also a museum. Gives a good glimpse of the British phase of India and Civil Engineering of that time.Has a nominal entry fee of maybe ₹20.Not a good place to visit alone. Go with friends or family.

The_Residency,nilesh_nagar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Must see for historians,Good architecture and structure to see. Historic place since long. Symbol of british occupation in India. It’s must see for anyone visiting Lucknow. It’s part of heritage & culture of Lucknow too.

The_Residency,taotzu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Friends,Good for history buffs,Architecturally it's a nice place to see but we didn't enjoy here since it carries the memories of one of the darkest chapter of Indian history.

The_Residency,durham05,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Lots of important Anglo Indian history ,Enjoyed my time here exploring the ruins. Site is well maintained and its very though provoking to see the battle scarred walls and to visit the cemetery where those who died in the 1857 siege were buried. Museum itself is very poor. Gardens are lush and green. A must for all visitors to Lucknow.
The_Residency,apul_goel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Residency: glimpse to British living in mid-1880s,"Situated on the banks of river Gomti, in center of Lucknow, the Residency, occupies an important position in history. In ruins today, it stands as silent witness to the brutal attack on the British during the 1857 uprising. It provides a glimpse to the living style of the British during those days. It is located close to other important landmarks of the city of that era."

The_Residency,notacanada,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Ghosts of nawabs and mutiny,"The British Residency, rather haunting if not haunted, was the living quarters of the East India Company at the courts of the Nawabs. The buildings were destroyed during the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. What is left of the buildings is still rather imposing. At times while in the ruins, pandemonium of shy, green parakeets flew away as soon as they perceived my presence."
The_Residency,Prahlad S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Amazing Historical Building,It was great visiting the Residency. If you are interested in history of India's independence you must visit.
The_Residency,SUDHANSHU1955,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,A great monument,A wonderful collection of monuments from British legacy ...Has a fascinating history .A must on the list of visitors to Lucknow. Needs two hours to see properly with the museum itself needing half an hour ....A delight for photo enthusiasts
The_Residency,PaulJanet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Eloquent evidence of a troubled time,This large complex of buildings now mostly stark ruins bears eloquent witness to the Indian Uprising of 1857 when the area was under prolonged siege and bombardment. The buildings are surrounded by well-maintained gardens.
The_Residency,RGM,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Seeped in History,Excellent for history buffs. Each ruin in the residency has a story to tell. Too hot in the summer months

The_Residency,Dave P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Fantastic,"This place is wonderful! We went on a Saturday and it was not at all busy, just a few families taking a stroll. You can really feel the history and also see it in the bullet and cannonball holes. The museum was great too, there's a documentary shown daily in Hindi/English, not sure of the times, if you're lucky to be there at the right time. The gardens were clean and very well kept. The staff were friendly and very helpful indeed. Great and thanks!"
The_Residency,GoPlaces65661648539,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,A Palatial Beauty,"This residency is a fine example of British leadership, splendor and exploitative culture. Also, it depicts the excellence of architectural, engineering and construction skills of the Nawabs.  "
The_Residency,GaddisGadabout,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,A peaceful place ... today,"Despite the brutal legacy of the Mutiny (or The First War of Indian Independence), the people of Lucknow have respectfully maintained the old British residency, still marked with cannon and bullet holes. It's a quiet green space today. There's a small graveyard, the ruins of the garrison church, and a modest museum that includes a diorama of the cantonment circa 1857. It helps to come with some prior knowledge of the history of that struggle or with a guide because there aren't too many information points."
The_Residency,BlrTravR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,In ruins but recommended,"The place which must have been vibrant during its day, is in ruins after the rebellion. Good place to visit to understand the history."

Life under the East India Company and the British rule and how a handful of soldiers created a Mutiny is a must see."
The_Residency,Sharil I,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Black History Reminder,There are many reminders that history has left us with which haunt us till date with things that really cut a sorry figure for Humanity. While this monument reminds of the revolt simultaneously it shares with us the horrors of war also. But all in all a place to get peace and understand what is the benefit of peace.
The_Residency,Niraj K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Great Place,Another historical building in Lucknow that one should see while visiting Lucknow.Though now in ruins but once it was the official residence of British Governor General. The historical 1987 Freedom Strugle also started from here.

The_Residency,kppmumbai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Definitely worth a visit when in Lucknow,The remains of the British residency have been preserved very well. The place is symbolic of the first war of independence in 1857 and some of the stories there relive the event. The small museum to is worth the visit  I feel one should allocate atleast around 1 hour at a non sunny time.
The_Residency,Faiz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Historical place.,"Culture & history always speaks, you can feel it by visiting The British Residency in Lucknow.It has mostly the ruins of the great Indian Rebellion of 1857.It is a very unique photogenic heritage place.It has been declared a protected monument by The Archaeological Survey of India.It is very nice to see buildings without roof because they ruined during 1857."
The_Residency,Dornick,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Excellent.   Unmissable. Number 1 on a list of sights to visit in Lucknow.,"It’s correct name is The Residency, not the British Residency. No one who visits Lucknow should fail to visit this place. It’s the site of the 1857 First War of Independence  when Indians and British clashed in bloody conflict resulting in horrific fatalities on both sides. Buildings were shattered and left as they were after the combat  providing a poignant memory of the battle. Although the site is sizeable, well maintained pathways render it easily walkable. There’s so much to see, so much to absorb and think about. The green spaces are well maintained, staff are pleasant and efficient. A sad period in history lingers on long in the memory. A small museum is attached with very interesting exhibits and displays that echo the conflict. One could spend a whole day here in pensive thought.  Lucknow City Corporation ( or whichever body is responsible for the site ) should be congratulated on a job well done."
The_Residency,SteveByfleet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,How did this defend the Residency for so long,"The seiege of Lucknow lasted for about 5 months, but how on earth did the fairly small British contingent survive for so long against so many enemy? Following year, the british regained this area, but it didn't last, rightly so!!"
The_Residency,keith h,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Evocative Ruins Surrounded by Extensive Lawns & Shaded by Massive Old Trees.," The Residency was my number 1 reason for visiting Lucknow. This particular period of history has long interested me so I was very pleased to arrive at the gates on a sparkling, sunny, warm morning.   I was quite surprised to note the size of the site but thrilled to see how well it is all kept & despite the death & destruction that took place there, how peaceful & beautiful it is now with massive trees & flowering shrubs studding the lawns & towering over the ruins.   The British had been allowed a residency here in the Kingdom of Oudh but when they finally annexed Oudh on the pretext of maladministration it became one of the factors that provoked the mutiny/ uprising of 1857.   The Residency became a sanctuary for the British as Mutineers overran the city & they held out ( with large losses on either side ) for 5 months. The Banquetting Hall  became a hospital. Sir Henry Lawrence was in charge of the British Garrison but was fatally wounded early on. After 3 months re inforcements arrived, led by General Havelock, easing conditions but it was a couple of months later that Sir Colin Campbell with his Sikh's & Highlander's broke the siege.  You can still see the bullet & cannon shot damage to the walls. A small museum houses a model of The Residency site & some lithographs."

Though there was a notice outside mentioning timings of the film show, but the staff inside were very hesitant in screening it....only when we insisted and called the Museum Manager, did they agree to screen the film"
The_Residency,Ellenjarvie,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Brutish residency,A must see to learn about the British in Lucknow to see where and how they lived and what took place there. Allow a lot of time for this visit and go with a tour guide one who can tell you the history 
The_Residency,Cantfind,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,An absolute must when visiting Lucknow,This monument to the people who fought and died here is remarkable.

The_Residency,Rosalynde J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Moving monument of a bygone time. ,The residency is well maintained within beautiful grounds it must have been quite something in its heyday. The mutiny or first war of independence is a sad reminder of different times.Well worth a visit and the little museum and cemetery are not to be missed.  
The_Residency,ImageWrighter,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Time Warp- Photographer's delight,"Very well maintained ruins; a photographer 's delight, specially if one is into historical architecture. With a nominal entry fee, this place is worth spending an hour or two. Apart from residential quarters and army barracks, it also houses a mazaar and a temple, sprawling lawns. The museum is closed on Fridays, but it's a small one and nothing you would miss."
The_Residency,John M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Interesting historical site ,Staying in Lucknow so decided to visit this place.  Its consists mainly of large buildings in ruins.

The_Residency,Ajeet N,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Trip down the memory lane,"This is the place where the mutiny of 1857 started.

The_Residency,Arjun S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,A slice of history,"Revisited the Residency, which is maintained in a neat and clean condition, so was pleasantly surprised by that.  In the small museum, there is a useful diorama depicting the layout of the Residency before the siege."

The_Residency,Sandip Bosu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,History written on the bricks of each building,"When I visited the Residency I could feel that the bricks and plaster of each building were taking to us. They whispered the events of 1857 and on one hand I felt proud for the first freedom fighters of India who tasted freedom for 86 days, and felt the pain of so much bloodshed on the other. I spend about 3 hours in the place and would have loved to spend more."

The_Residency,Betula103,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Important historically,"Lucknow appeared not to attract as many tourists and many other places in India although it is the capital and largest city of the state of Uttar Pradesh being an important administrative centre.  It is a major Islamic area but was once once a major headquarters for the British, hence this large British Residency complex, some of which is in ruins following the 1857 Siege of Lucknow. A church has completely gone. The gardens and lawns are well maintained and there is a small museum within the grounds plus a cemetery.."

The_Residency,Rahul117,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,"Must visit place in Lucknow, British Redidency",A beautiful place for monument lovers amidst the hustle and bustle of city life of Lucknow. You can find a good dose for your eyes as well as for camera. Try it on week days when number of visiters are less. You can communacte with the walls of British era. The museum inside The Residency narrates the entire story of 1857.
The_Residency,felicityjg1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,A must do,"poignant and excellent.  Beware of some guides who might give a biased view of what occurred during the Indian Mutiny - Fortunately, we were well aware of the history and also that the British didn't come out squeaky clean at the end - but the Residency has been well preserved and was definitely a highlight of our trip."

The_Residency,Karl V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Well worth the visit,"Once a symbol of oppression, the Residency now stands, with an Indian flag, as a sobering reminder of the struggle for independence that was hard fought and of the ultimate sacrifice paid by so many. The walls, both inside and out, of the remains bare the scars of cannon and rifle shot from the harrowing siege of 1857."
The_Residency,CAPT. Nagaraj Subbarao,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Brilliant,"The British Residency is the place where the British made their last stand in 1857, with the rebelling Indian sepoys baying for their blood. It's history that can be seen!"
The_Residency,indrajit1405,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Haunting,its quite a huge place and one can see and admire the beauty of this place and the life of the nawabs and later the Englishmen who stayed there and the Indian soldiers who captured it later. The place is beautiful but quite haunting
