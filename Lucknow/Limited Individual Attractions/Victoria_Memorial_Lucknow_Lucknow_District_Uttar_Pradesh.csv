Victoria_Memorial,K72,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,small,Small monument in a lovely manicured park. It's a lovely restful place to sit and relax. The monument is quite lovely and doesn't take long to view. Much smaller scale and design compared to the Kolkata monument but nice all the same.

Victoria_Memorial,AsisBandyopadhyay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,Victoria Memorial in Lucknow!,"Usually Victoria Memorial is an icon of Kolkata. But in the Begum Hazrat Mahal Oark in Lucknow, there is a small structure in white which is name Victoria Memorial. It is not a huge structure and does not have any Hall. But the white structure in the green surroundings looks attractive and the stone work is quite good.  "

Victoria_Memorial,MANISH S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,A park for special one,"Situated near Parivartan chauraha, Begum Hazrat Mahal Park is a beautiful park with lush greenery and nice ambiance. Not very suitable for outdoor sports but quite good for spending some time with friends and not family. Young couples can be seen in every corner making it somewhat awkward for others. Great place for photography and to relax and chill. "

Victoria_Memorial,1361103,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,Imagine when the Queen Victoria Monoment was there,"During 1960- 70, it was the only best park with the monument of Queen Victoria in spotless white marble, and a very attractive park where all the leading political leaders used to delivered their speeches from  respected Atalji, Jagmohan Lalji and others. I think the best place to play cricket matches and it was  difficult to count how many matches are going on, but everybody loves to visit this park, which  was later known as Begum Hazrat Mehal park , very well maintained, best place for morning walk."
Victoria_Memorial,SANDEEP24886,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,"Victorial Memorial - lost in history, finally getting it's due.","Over the years, this memorial has gone through a lot of transition. I remember this place was once used for Ramleela and burning Ravan/Meghnath/Kumbhkaran during Dushhera festival. Then after few years, it witnessed the organizing of Lucknow Mahotsav for few years consecutively. For the past 5-6 years, it has been transformed into a well-maintained park managed by Lucknow Development Authority. The memorial has finally got its due since the memorial dates back to the Fight for Independence of this free India. Not many are aware of the significance that this memorial has, as it has seen the ruthless times of pre-1947 struggle."
