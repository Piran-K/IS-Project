It is an impressive building indeed, obviously built in British times.  It's not easy to get in here, people.  I managed to do so because my political science student daughter's friend's father is the assistant of a politician who has a seat here.  A few girls in the class wanted to go in, to see how a legislative assembly works and an adult was needed to accompany them.  So I went in.  OMG, the security was something else.  You had to take off all jewellery, rings and earrings, What was particularly worrisome was that the security people didn't take their eyes off you for a second.  An innocent whisper to your companion as you sat next to her in the visitors' gallery is hushed immediately. Let's face it, I had to do it sometime, I don't know Hindi.  It's quite thrilling seeing the local political   personalities of whom one reads in the newspapers  giving their speeches right in front of you, even if you don't know Hindi well. Oh and BTW, do NOT raise your hand to scratch your ear, you will get glared and prodded by the security women in the gallery.  It's just not worth it. Oh, well, I guess it's necessary. The building is beautiful and well preserved and for me, a politically aware long-term resident of Lucknow, well worth seeing.  The trouble is, I don't think tourists would enjoy it very much, those policewomen tend to look at you as if to say 'one false move and you're going to the dungeon in chains'. I mean, who needs that on holiday? But as a photo opportunity, the Vidhan Sabha is gorgeous. Do do try to get outside and get a picture and leave the political shenanigans where they belong - inside the building.  It will save you having to retrieve your handbag and jewellery later.      "

The Vidhan Sabha was no exception. Brilliantly illuminated. But we got only a few seconds to shoot our pic. The road in front was crowded, lots of fast-food vendors were selling paani-puris and other snacks, my wife got down for a plate of paani-puri and immediately she had to rush back to the car as an old policeman arrived at site and barked at all cars parked in front of the will-lit building to take away their car as it is a no-parking area. The question remains : If it is such a high-security, no-parking spot even in evening, when harmless, law-abiding revellers in holiday-mood with family are out for some enjoyment on a holiday, why in the first place so many street-side vendors are allowed to sell their products just in front of the high-security citadel?? Or as they say ""It happens only in India?"""
Vidhan_Sabha_Bhawan_Council_House,Dr Narottam L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2012 • Family,"U.P Seat of Governance the ""Magestic “Vidhan Sabha"" We love it","As a residents and natives of Uttar  Pradesh  (U.P.);  let me tell in a clear voice  and aloud to one and all that we, the natives of this state are proud of our domicile in this state and our seat of Governance the “VidhanSabha”.   Some pseudo-progressive people refer us  as backward and avoid  marrying  a  boy  from  UP ,saying they are not progressive ,  take pan and tobacco etc and do not speak    (read  good ) English .Let me add it is no disrespect to any body and  every body is entitled to personal opinions . Most of such people were born and brought up in this (backward) state but had to migrate to so called developed states because of compulsions of their service or because of any other similar reasons.  I have no problems with them. It is also true that U.P is mini India which has absorbed migrants from all over India who follow their tradition and culture and we are proud of our heterogeneous culture . Seat of U.P .Government the “Vidhansabha” building is majestic and    beautiful structure with no  parallel.Tricolour at the top of  central dome adds to its grandeur    .  The state symbol in form of two fishes in an emblem is engraved at top- front of building which gives  majestic look  to the  building .Front lawn is lush green and well maintained .The space opposite and across the road has a unique semicircular design difficult to describe. Right and left wings spread on both side of main Vidhansabha building looks like two wings of a very big birds spread and  ready to take off to fly. These wings are called UP state secretariat and houses offices of UP secretary level officers and Ministers.           The Vidhansabha is located at main road leading from city to Main railway stations (Lucknow NR & NER) and to Air port .Every visitor to Lucknow has to pass through the road in front of it and   can not escape looking at and admiring this beautiful building .Its decoration on republic day is a great attraction for locals. Be it Independence Day or Republic Day; main flag hosting is done in front of this building. The presiding dignity takes salute of parade of these functions in front of Vidhansabha . It is not only symbolic seat of Government but place of Pride for U. P walas              Entry in this complex in restricted by pass system for official  business only"
