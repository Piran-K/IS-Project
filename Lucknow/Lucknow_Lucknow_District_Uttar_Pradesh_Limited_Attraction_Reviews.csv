The main structure has a big  hall which has no support in the middle stretch . the alleys in one part are so formed that a person may loose his way , this is known as Bhulbhulaiya literally meaning confusing. There is a waterbody too and it is believed that if you loose your way you may get trapped in the waterbody .The Imambara was built by Nawad Asifudaulah to feed his subjects by engaging them in construction at the time of a severe famine."

Bara_Imambara,SVAYAMBHU C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Bara Imambara Dec 2022,Our Savaari cab took us next to Bara Imambara complex. We had about an hour of sunlight left and the sound decision that we took was to complete Bara Imambara and not do the others and try to come back to it. Bara Imambara was quite something with its large halls without any pillars. Our private guide was knowledgeable and gave us the right context. The Bhulbhulaiya or The Labarynth is one of the most intricate man-made creations I have seen. We walked through pitch dark corridors and reached junction points made up of four roads of which only one was right. There were different groups in the maze and we were able to come out only because we had the services of a guide. The bawli or step well was awe inspiring and hats off to the engenuity of the builders of that era.
Bara_Imambara,Akshay Sharma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,An iconic place of Lucknow,"This is one of the prime historical areas of Lucknow and one has to see it to believe it.

Bara_Imambara,gpradeepshenoy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Solo,Good place,"Staying in Charbagh area of Lucknow , took a share auto from Charbagh to parivartan chowk(Rs 15 per person) and from parivartan chowk took another share auto to teeli wali masjid(Rs 10 per person).From teeli wali masjid bara Imambara is about 10-15 minutes walk. I am not sure if we get share autos to bara Imambara from parivartan chowk.          Combined entrance ticket for Bhool bhulaya (Labyrinth), bowli,chota Imambara, picture gallery with entrance ticket for bara Imambara costs Rs 50 per person.          Guide charges for bara Imambara, bhul bhulaya and bowli costs Rs 150 for 1-2 persons. But one guide will have 10 - 15 people in one group by combining many group of tourists which is not correct. The administration of bara Imambara must look into this. Guides are mandatory for couples who want to visit bhul bhulaya.          Footwear has to removed before entering Bara Imambara and the same must be deposited at footwear keeping centre which is at right side of entrance to Bara Imambara by paying Rs 2 per persons footwear. Imambara is impressive and beautiful. Bhul bhulaya is also good but the tourists must act responsibly as they have scribbled in walls of bhul bhulaya. Bowli area must be maintained more neatly.        There ia a mosque too called Asifi masjid in Courtyard of bara Imambara but tourists are not allowed inside this mosque.          Do carry sufficient drinking water with you when visiting this place especially in afternoon. Try to visit this place in morning before it gets too hot.       Just outside of bara Imambara we can take auto/tongas to go to chota Imambara, roomi darwaza, ghanta ghar & picture gallery. Roomi darwaza, ghanta ghar & picture gallery is on the way to chota Imambara from bara Imambara. One can also walk from bara Imambara to chota Imambara seeing roomi darwaza,ghanta ghar & picture gallery."

Bara_Imambara,AnupamSharan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Bhool Bhulaiya is a misnomer,"The Bhool Bhulaiya inside Bara Imam Bara was actually not built to be a labyrinth.

Bara_Imambara,JoyBose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,"The must see attraction in Luckno, complex contains baoli, mosque, labrynth and main building","This was built by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah in the 17th century to save people from a famine. It is a religious building as well as a touristic building. The complex consists of an outer gate, inner countyard, inner gate and buildings. The main building is a sacred building in Shia islam, so one has to take off shoes and deposit them.  In the first floor, one can clap from one side fo the building and it will echo on the other side. Bhul bulaiya labrynth is part of the complex, a place with narrow openings where one can get lost easily. It is better to take a guide. Asaf Ali mosque is amazingly beautiful. The baoli was built for the city's water supply from river Gomti, the guide can explain how it works and take you to the lower levels. Entry combined ticket is Rs 50 for Indians and 300 for foreigners. Guide costs Rs 100, more for bigger groups. It is closed during namaz time on Fridays. "

Bara_Imambara,R1chardN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Impressive architecture,"The Bara Imambara is an impressive building.  Even more so as it was built to create work for about 20,000 people during the great famine in the late 1700's'.  An imambara is a tomb for a Muslim holy man.  Although we did not see visitors being given scarves or similar clothes you should dress appropriately for this religious site. Inside the entrance gate is a large formal garden leading to the main building.  The gardens are attractive and well maintained.  The architecture of the main building is beautiful.  There are three storeys that house many grand rooms but we did not go inside..There is a step well that we did not go to as we had previously visited Abhaneri (the home of one of the steepest step wells in India).  To the right of the main building is the Asifi Masjid where only Muslims are allowed.Our visit was part of a city highlights tour with our guide.  It is a fascinating building and well worth taking the time to visit."
Bara_Imambara,Somaseshu Gutala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"MY VISIT TO BADA IMAMBARA (ASAFI IMAMBARA), LUCKNOW","Lucknow was ruled by AwadhNawabs for nearly sixteen decades. Here we still find the glorious tradition and heritage of Nawabs in the form of great mansions, palaces, mosques and gardens. BadaImambara is the star attraction and most popular historic monument in Lucknow. Every day nearly three thousand people visit this beautiful mansion with spacious courtyards, carvings and massive arches. The word Imambara means the residence of Imam or a Muslim priest who leads prayers in a mosque. So it is a prayer hall where religious congregations are held through the month of Muharram and on other important occasions by Shia Muslims. In cities like Cairo, Aleppo and Baghdad this type of prayer hall is seen as an annexe to the main Mosque.  In 1722 the Mughal emperor Muhummad Shah made Mohd. Amin Masawi or Sadat Ali Khan I as Governor of Awadh. Sadat was the grandson of a rich trader from Khorasan in Iran who migrated to India. Thus the rule of AwadhNawabs (a native Governor appointed by Mughal emperors) began. In 1775 the fourth NawabAsaf-ud-Daula ascended the throne. He shifted the capital from Faizabad to Lucknow. During his rule there was a severe famine almost for one decade. To provide employment to starving people Asaf-ud-Daula undertook the construction of this Imambara which was started in 1784 and completed in 1798. Nearly twenty thousand people were employed to complete this huge mansion. The Nawab spent nearly one crore rupees for this construction. Every year he spent four to five lakhs to beautify and maintain this building. He selected an architect from Delhi, Kifayitullah, who used his talent and skills to construct this building in ornamental Mughal style. The western entrance called “Roomi Gate or Turkish Gate” is the west-facing 59 feet high entrance gate with three arches done with lavish decorations.  The  arches have the royal insignia of dual fish carved on them. It was built in ancient Awadhi style and resembles the gateway at Istanbule, Turkey, once the capital of the Roman Byzantine Empire. The word “Roomi” is the changed version of the word “Rome”. On the top of the three-storied Darwaja, a small octagonal place called “Chattri or Umbrella” is seen looking over both sides of the gate. A staircase leads up to it. This place was used for vigilance or for ligting up the gate. Four minarets are seen at four corners.  The 67-foot tall Husainabad clock tower adjacent to Roomi gate was constructed by Nawab Nasir-ud-Din Haider in 1881 to mark the arrival of Sir George Couper, the first Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces of Awadh. The eastern entrance gate was destroyed by the British in 1858 when this building was converted to a military fort.The roof of Imambara was made from rice husk and the roof has been put together with interlocking bricks without any beam or girder. No wood or metal has been used in this building. This is a unique building with arched entrances without having any pillars for support. Unlike the Mughals who used red stone, the Nawabs of Lucknow used limestone which is delicate and can be carved with designs of creepers, various flowers and intricate designs. This building has three halls—China hall with decorative domes, Persian hall with the graves of Nawab’s family and Tazias (replicas of the tombs) of Imam Hussain and Hasan who sacrificed their lives at Karbala in 680 A.D. and the Kharbooza Hall the domed ceiling of which is shaped like a watermelon.  The Persian Hall is the most spacious hall measuring 170x55x15 feet without any supporting columns. In the center of large vaulted Persian hall the graves of Asf-Ud-Daula, his wife and the architect, Khifayoitullah are seen. Just above the central hall one can see eight chambers with different heights permitting the space above to be re-constructed as a labyrinth or maze (called BhulBhulaiya) with interconnected one thousand passage ways through 489 identical doorways. This maze supports the weight of the building. Our guide told us that the royal ladies used to come through secret underground passage to attend the prayers conducted in the central hall. People say that there are many secret passages leading to Gomti River and even up to Agra and Allahabad. It would be better to enter the maze with the help of a guide as there is a risk of losing one’s way in the labyrinth with so many passages and doors.  On the left side of this building there is a step well of Pre-Nawabi Era with five stories called ‘ShahiBaoli” built in Indo-Islamic style. It is a water reservoir used for supplying water to people. This reservoir is connected to Gomti River. Only the topmost two stories of the step well are seen and the three stories are under water. On the right side of the building there is Asifi Masjid where only Muslims are permitted. This monument is open from 6.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. One should go in decent dress to visit this sacred religious place. The entry fee is rs.50/- per person and Rs.500/- for NRIs. It would be better to take the help of a guide. We bought a ticket from U.P. Tourism office at 400/- per person. They will provide the vehicle along with the guide. We need not pay the entrance and parking fee. Of course only historic monuments are included in the schedule and not temples or parks. This monument is really a worth seeing construction with many unique features and is a typical specimen of the Indo-Mughal architecture."
Bara_Imambara,Tom B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,It's okay - didn't think it was amazing.,This is obviously a very important piece of Lucknow history but as a tourist it wasn't amazing to go around.  I must add that we had a tour guide for the first part which I believe everyone probably gets - he was amazing and by far the best part of the experience.  
Bara_Imambara,Sarika,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,Amusing visit,"I went to Imambara with my family. It was truly amazing to explore it. The guide we hired explained us stories and beliefs behind the architecture and artefacts present in the Imambara. It had a hallway where one can hear whisperings so loud and clear regardless of the long distance present in between the source of sound and the listener. The labyrinth present was cool to explore and without a guide one can surely get lost. It also had a stepping well and one can see the person's reflection in the well, who is standing outside of the gate from inside. Overall its a nice place to explore on a fine day. Also the monument is aesthetically pleasing as the architecture is remarkable."

When we decided to leave the guide came up and started showing us the labyrinth and the history and it became really interesting and felt safe. I normally dont use guides but in this case I really recommend to understand the history of the place and to get out of the labyrinth!"

You will need to take a guide here - the good thing is the guide prices are fixed, however, each section has a different guide and price. We enjoyed the architecture of the Baoli well. In the Labyrinth(Bhool-Bhulaiya), do take the guide as it is well worth it. They will also leave you to find your way out (don't worry, they will be around ;) ). It's a good experience overall and gets completed in around 1 hour."

Bara_Imambara,chikpick,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Good to visit once...,"Dress decently and modestly. On entering it gives a very grand view but not so well maintained. Taking a guide is a chaos. Also a much hyped ""bhul bhulaiyya"" is so much overcrowded that one loses the feel of it. Avoid fridays as it is quite crowded. "
Bara_Imambara,Hemant M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Imposing presence,"The bada imambara is well worth a visit, it has an imposing presence and gives a great feeling of its historical significance. Very conveniently located it can be visited very easily.Avoid the Bhool Bhulaiyan, it was a very bad experience. The entire bhoolbhulaiyan is really narrow and claustrophbic but the worst part is it stinks of sweat and grime and make it impossible to stay there but once youre in youre trapped till the guide takes you out.

May be I was unlucky to get a terrible guide. But the tour was very short compared to what I had see all those years ago. In fact lot of details I remembered, I had to ask the guide and he did not know off. he finally told us that government has shortened the tours.

Today, when Lucknow has transformed drastically and there are hordes of departmental store and shopping malls ...the charm of Ganj pulls me still. I find excuses to visit it.

Guides are not available at this place and in front of every building/monument within the Residency there is a brief description written about that particular building/monument.

The_Residency,R1chardN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A most for historians,"Lucknow is a gem for history enthusiasts.  The town holds a very special place in the rise and eventual fall of British rule.  It is the scene of the 1857 mutiny where about 3000 people took refuge in the Residency.  The battle and siege continued for about 5 months and only about 1000 marched out at the time of surrender.The British Residency is a must see and a guide is a must to get the most from this incredible site.  The grounds inside the gated walls are immense and the buildings grand and infrastructure advanced.  The ruins still depict the great halls, living quarters, administration blocks and other buildings.  Some of the walls are riddled with holes from cannon shot and others bear the scars of fire damage.  The battles must have been ferocious but, prior to the siege, it was a grand existence and not difficult to see why the Europeans enjoyed their time and were reluctant to return home.Do visit the museum which has a scale model of the site and some historic exhibits.  Unfortunately it was partly closed on the day we visited.  It was a little sad to see this once great structure in this ruined state but it is not difficult to imagine how severe the fighting must have been.  This a must see historic site."

Only half of the original property is available for inspection as the army uses the rest but the holes made by the cannon shot and musket fire is very visible and reading the grave markers brings alive the daily life of the resident during the bombardment.Definitely worth seeing.

At times while in the ruins, pandemonium of shy, green parakeets flew away as soon as they perceived my presence."

It's a quiet green space today. There's a small graveyard, the ruins of the garrison church, and a modest museum that includes a diorama of the cantonment circa 1857. It helps to come with some prior knowledge of the history of that struggle or with a guide because there aren't too many information points."

The_Residency,Dornick,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Excellent.   Unmissable. Number 1 on a list of sights to visit in Lucknow.,"It’s correct name is The Residency, not the British Residency. No one who visits Lucknow should fail to visit this place. It’s the site of the 1857 First War of Independence  when Indians and British clashed in bloody conflict resulting in horrific fatalities on both sides. Buildings were shattered and left as they were after the combat  providing a poignant memory of the battle. Although the site is sizeable, well maintained pathways render it easily walkable. There’s so much to see, so much to absorb and think about. The green spaces are well maintained, staff are pleasant and efficient. A sad period in history lingers on long in the memory. A small museum is attached with very interesting exhibits and displays that echo the conflict. One could spend a whole day here in pensive thought.  Lucknow City Corporation ( or whichever body is responsible for the site ) should be congratulated on a job well done."
The_Residency,SteveByfleet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,How did this defend the Residency for so long,"The seiege of Lucknow lasted for about 5 months, but how on earth did the fairly small British contingent survive for so long against so many enemy? Following year, the british regained this area, but it didn't last, rightly so!!"
The_Residency,keith h,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Evocative Ruins Surrounded by Extensive Lawns & Shaded by Massive Old Trees.," The Residency was my number 1 reason for visiting Lucknow. This particular period of history has long interested me so I was very pleased to arrive at the gates on a sparkling, sunny, warm morning.   I was quite surprised to note the size of the site but thrilled to see how well it is all kept & despite the death & destruction that took place there, how peaceful & beautiful it is now with massive trees & flowering shrubs studding the lawns & towering over the ruins.   The British had been allowed a residency here in the Kingdom of Oudh but when they finally annexed Oudh on the pretext of maladministration it became one of the factors that provoked the mutiny/ uprising of 1857.   The Residency became a sanctuary for the British as Mutineers overran the city & they held out ( with large losses on either side ) for 5 months. The Banquetting Hall  became a hospital. Sir Henry Lawrence was in charge of the British Garrison but was fatally wounded early on. After 3 months re inforcements arrived, led by General Havelock, easing conditions but it was a couple of months later that Sir Colin Campbell with his Sikh's & Highlander's broke the siege.  You can still see the bullet & cannon shot damage to the walls. A small museum houses a model of The Residency site & some lithographs."

I Apologise for not remembering the names of the two gentlemen - I wish I could but my memory is clearly much inferior to both of them.  The headteach my god remembered my partners extended family from that long ago that remained in the area.  He pointed us to their exact old home which is no longer a home but still amazing to experience and see.To top if off they then found pictures that we had never seen of my partners Grandfather when he was at the school and some of his sporting records which was again amazing.I can't thank you enough for the time you gave us.

His reign saw the pinnacle of opulence and ended in a tragic downfall and doom. In a town full of buildings of the Nawabi era and later British residency period , This complex stands out conspicuously to tell a different tale.

Muzaffar Ali, the noted Bollywood film producer, director of Anjuman, Gaman, Umrao jaan and many others studied at this school. Coming from Lyon, Claude Martin must have acquired an eye for imposing architecture from his childhood days in his beautiful home town. His architectural skills were much in demand at Lucknow and his nearness to Nawab Asaf-ud-daula gave him a unique opportunity to participate in the making of modern Lucknow. Some of the buildings of Lucknow which have Martin's distinctive touch are: Farhad Baksh, Asafi Kothi, Bibiapur, Barowen and of course the Constantia."

Chandrika_Devi_Temple,Somaseshu Gutala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,"My Visit to Chandrika Devi mandir, Lucknow.","This is a very ancient temple dating back to Ramayana period. The name of this temple is mentioned in Skanda Purana. This temple is seen on the banks of Gomati River in Kathvara village beside the National Highway No.24 between Lucknow and Sitapur. This temple is nearly 28 kms from Lucknow. We went there by taxi. The presiding deity is a form of Duiga or Chandi. The road is very smooth flanked by fields and greenery and small houses. The temple is seen on an elevated platform. A welcome arch is seen at the entrance of the temple. A row of shops greets the view of the pilgrims who have to go through a queue. A colorful bundle of votive pieces of pink cloth and a number of bells are seen hanging in the temple hall. In the inner sanctum a row of three small pindis symbolizing Chandi is seen. On the right side Nava Durgas in the form of pindis(Lingas) is seen. These idols are said to be installed by Sage Narada according to some legends. The present idols were installed by Thakur Beni Singh Chauhan, the landlord of Kathwara village nearly two hundred and fifty years ago.  According to legends Rajkumar Chandraketu, son of Lakshman, founded Lakshmnapuri (later called as Lucknow). Once he was travelling with Ashwamedha horse through a dense forest which appeared quite dark and dreadful. He prayed to Durga, who appeared there with bright moonlight and blessed him. He established a temple here. So the goddess is called Chandrika. In Dwapara Yuga Pandavas, during their exile period visited this place and Yudhistir performed a Yagna here. Ghatothkacha’s son, Barabareeka, on Krishna’s advice did penance here for three years to acquire mighty powers. Some Puranas say that Lord Chandra was freed from Daksha’s curse when he came and bathed in the holy pond. Yudhistir’s son, Sudhanwa worshipped the Goddess and hence this place is also called Sudhanwa Kund. In twelfth century this temple was destroyed by the army of Sayyad Salar Masud Gazi. Two hundred and fifty years ago villagers found the idol in the cavity of a neem tree. They informed the landlord of the village. He built a temple and a Vedi for performing Homas. The temple pond is called Mahisagar Theertha. A small bridge is seen across the pond with a beautiful statue of Lord Shiva in meditating posture. At the back of the temple there is a small shrine for Kala Bhairav.  In this temple special poojas are done during Amavasya (new Moon) and during Nava Rathri festival.  The temple timings are from 5.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 11.00 p.m.  Aarti is performed three times in this temple at 6.00 a.m. 1.00 p.m. at 7.00 p.m. You will find this temple in scenic surroundings surrounded on three sides by the Gomati River."

Oldies can opt to go by the toy train inside the zoo (less noisy and nice though it wont stop anywhere for you to see the animals from nearby)Note: Don,t miss the real mummy of a 13 year old girl that is kept in the lucknow museum inside the zoo (Rs.5 ticket). There are only 6-7 places in India were mummies are kept including lucknow."

The real attraction is the recently opened information centre. Must see before it is spoiled. Quite informative. The park has entry fee of 60 for adults.

There is a toy train for kids and for senior citizens there is golf cart buggy.

One lonely giraffe typified what we saw.There were many local children there when we visited as it was ""Children's Day"", and the school parties were out in force - perhaps on a quieter day it might have been better, but somehow I doubt it.

If you are traveling by car, go to the gate near Police headquarter of Lucknow. Ample parking in available. The fee at INR 60 is rather high for a big group. Try not to go on a public holiday, as you are likely to face huge noisy crowd. Too many eating places within the premises make it more of a picnic spot than a real Zoo. However, the toy train is good for kids. Ask at the gate if the museum is open."

It is located right next to Hazratganj and now houses probably as many specimen as it would have ever did. A few sections were a disappointment as still not fully functional (e.g., nocturnal section). There is ample amount of attraction for young children in terms of open spaces/lawns and play grounds (with swings, slides, merry go rounds etc) and also the mini zoo train.

Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,krishna292,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,No Park only a Memorial with Stone Statues,"After checking out from Hotel Hilton we planned to visit Dr Ambedkar Memorial Park  before taking our flight for Delhi as we had heard a lot about it being one of the modern tourist attractions. The memorial has been made in the memory of Dr. B R Ambedkar,  one of the most popular social reformer and famous lawyer who drafted Indian Constitution after independence. That is why many people visit it and we also wanted to visit it. The credit for the construction of the memorial goes to the top leader of a political party of downtrodden and backward masses who had come to power in the State of UP. During our earlier trips to Lucknow about 45 years back, we had seen various well known historical monuments like Chota Imambada, Bara Imambada, Residency etc. and so we did not want to go there. However, after reaching the memorial we were disappointed to see its vast Lay out of stony statues. It is not a park and to go around the whole area of the Memorial during a a warm day (even in the month of March) is very tiresome, particularly for senior citizens. The time of our visit was around 11 AM and because of stony structures every where, without any shelters, we felt very uncomfortable. There is no greenery or shelter in this so called park for visitors to have some respite. The memorial occupies a large area with stony statues of elephants and icons of some leaders also. There are several stoops and structures with inscriptions. There are a large number of elephant statues and even these elephants have been made on the top of towers spread throughout the park., because elephant is the symbol of that political party. Whosoever had designed this Memorial should have taken care to plant trees and shelters from rains or sun. As such, this place should only be visited in evenings or on cloudy days. Because of shortage of time we did not go inside the halls and galleries exhibiting items in the memory of political leaders and social reformers of India."

Thing to note is either visit this memorial in morning or evening that too till 4 PM, because in afternoon you would not find any trees or greenery here and it will be too hot. Ideally this is a memorial and not a park. But it is good place, a must visit if you are in Lucknow. Time to visit 11 - 4 PM, visit on a not so hot day and keep around 2 hours for this memorial."

The pat to the stupa is decorated with rows of elephants. There are statues and sculptures of dalit icons including Kanshi Ram, Mayawati and Ambedkar, Jyotiba Phule, Sahuji maharaj, along with a summary of their life and contributions. There are also scenes from the Buddha's life inside the main building. It is a good place to learn about the dalit struggle, injustice of caste system and social equality in India.

Ambedkar_Memorial_Park,Somaseshu Gutala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"My Visit to Ambedkar Memorial Park, Lucknow","Lucknow has a rich cultural heritage with many historic monuments, gardens and famous parks. Everywhere one can see greenery with shady trees and spacious parks. nearly there are one hundred parks such as Gautam Buddha park, Dr.Ram Manohar Lohia Park, Janeshwar Mishra Park, Swarna Jayanti Smriti Vihar Park, Chandrasekhar Azad Park etc.  The Nawabs of Awadh beautified this city with many gardens, palaces and mosques. During my short stay there I had an opportunity of visiting the Ambedkar Memorial Park, a public park and memorial in Gomti Nagar. Ms. Mayavati, the former Chief Minister and leader of B.S.P. established this park with many monuments and pillars to represent the democratic ideals of social reformers and noble persons who worked for the upliftment of Dalit people. The foundation stone for this memorial park was laid in 1995. It was called Dr.Bhimrao Udyan. Construction and development work continued up to 2002 and the park was re-named as Dr.Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial. In 2007 it was further renovated and developed. On April 14, 2008 the park was opened to the public. Finally in 2012 the park was re-named as Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial. Red sandstone from Rajasthan was used for this megalithic construction. Nearly seven billion rupees were spent to build this lofty monument which has become the pride and glorious symbol of this city. Unlike other parks, here one does not find much greenery and gigantic trees. So we don’t find any shelter if it suddenly rains. It would be better if the authorities have set up some shelters for visitors to protect themselves from intense heat of summer and rainy showers. You will see a very spacious land of 107 acres with a broad stretch of road flanked by sixty-two stone elephants on either side at the main entrance. This spot is called “Pratibimb Sthal”. Priority is given to statues of elephants as the elephant is the election symbol of Mayavati’s Bahujan Samaj Party and also of  Ambedkar’s Republican Party. Nearly three thousand elephant figures are seen in this grand construction.  In the center of the park there is a massive musical fountain. It stands as a symbol of Dalit empowerment and dignity. On the left side of the park one can see a huge building called Ambedkar Sthupa located on a mound. Inside the Sthupa one can see a big bronze statue of Ambedkar seated in a chair. At the base of the statue a message in Hindi is engraved which means “My struggle of life is my only message.” Many statues are seen depicting the life of Ambedkar. In Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Sangrahalay spread over 2.5 acres, one can see a monument with two domes. Under one building one can see the statues of eminent social reformers like Jyothi Rao Phule, Shri Narayana Guru, Dr.Ambedkar, Kanshi Ramji and Rajarshi Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj . In the second building the marble statues of Gautam Buddha, Sant Kabir Das, Sant Ravi Das, Guru Ghasi Das and Sri Birsa Munda are seen. This monument is an objective representation of equality, humanity and social justice. In Drashya Sthal one can see an eighty- foot tall pyramid structure with water flowing from its top. From here one can have a panoramic view of the whole park with its monuments and pillars spread around. In Dr.Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Gallery spread over four acres one can see many bronze murals. It would better serve the purpose of spreading the ideals and message of Ambedkar and other leaders if a gift shop is set up there where one can buy books, photos and souvenirs that contain the teachings and messages of these noble personalities. This park is open from 11.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. on all days except on Monday. This park was under the supervision of the Lucknow Development Authority."

We find the carvings of Durga, Kalabhairav and Hanuman emerging out of the mouth of the demoness Surasa. This temple is located between Hasanganj and Daliganj area in the heart of the city on the left bank of the Gomati River. This temple is managed by Mahant Devagya Puri (Arunima Singh), the first woman Mahant in Lucknow. According to legends King Lakshman came here after leaving Sita in exile and worshipped Lord Shiva to get mental peace. Later a temple with twent-three golden urns was built by King Navdhanu after conquering his enemy. In twelfth century this temple was destroyed and plundered by Yemeni invaders. Five hundred years ago Naga sadhus re-built this temple. "

Chhota_Imambara,JoyBose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020,Beautiful architecture and a holy place as well as tourist place,"This imambara was built in early 1800s by the nephew of the Nawab who built the bada imambara. Entry is Rs 20 for Indians and hiring a guide costs Rs 200. It is worth hiring a guide to understand the intricacies of this building and its history and significance. This complex comprises the main building, the Taj mahal replica tomb of the nawab's daughter, the shahi hamam for baths and the ""jawab"" of identical building to the daughter's tomb. The main building has the shrines of the emperor and his mother. The main tomb is a holy building, of Shia muslim holy significance. It is of more significance during the muharram procession, when people of all religions can get the holy blessing. One must take off the shoes before entering the main imambara tomb. It costs Rs 2 per shoe to keep them. The shahi hamam is where the nawab used to bath, it had arrangements for both hot and cold bath, in Persian style of hamam. There is also near the entrance a fish structure denoting the emblem of the Lucknow nawabs. The architecture of the main buildings and white tomb and its jabab are most beautiful."

Chhota_Imambara,Somaseshu Gutala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"My Visit to Chota Imambara ( Imambara Hussainabad Mubarak), Lucknow","Just two kms away from Bada Imambara on the west side, Chota Imambara is seen which is admired for its artistic beauty as Palace of Lights. It is located on Husanabad Road in Daulatganj in Lucknow. This was built by Mohd.Ali Shah, the Nawab of Awadh in 1838 as a congregation hall for Shia Muslims to celebrate Muharram and other festivals. Azim-ullah-Khan, Superintendent of ordnance and Buildings, supervised the construction of this gold-plated building with many large and smaller domes with ribbed design. The Nawab in order to provide employment to workers during the severe drought period undertook the construction of this monument. The significance of the holy five is symbolized here by five main doorways. There are two halls and a platform (Shehnasheen) on which the Zarih(the replica of the protective grill that is kept over the grave of Imam Hussain at Karbala, Iraq) is seen. The main hall or Azhakhana is a large green and white bordered hall with a gilded dome decorated with chandeliers imported from Belgium, golden edged mirrors and crystal glass lamp stands. On the south of the main hall is the main platform with arches where the banners and flags of the small army of Imam Hussain are seen. A number of Tazias made of silver, ivory and sandalwood are kept on the main platform or Shahnasheen. There is also a big Tazia that is made of wax and tinsel paper kept in the main hall. The tombs of Nawab Mohd. Alishah and his mother are seen in the central hall. Their bodies are buried below the floor in the basement of the central hall. In the central hall the royal throne, the red crown of the king and the silver Mimbar or pulpit on which the orator is seated when he addresses audience are also seen. On the walls and pillars of the hall, Quran verses are written in Islamic calligraphy in the shape of a tiger, a horse and a bird, fixed in wooden frames. An antique Persian clock and a glass fish tank from Japan are other curious objects found in this spacious hall. The way to this Imambara is embellished with a flowing stream flowing through the center of the garden. Water for fountains and other water bodies is channelized from Gomti River. This building constructed in Indo-Islamic and Persian style has a Charbagh pattern—a single stream running through the center of the garden. There are two triple-arched gateways on the east and west as entrances. In between them is the main gate with a heavy door. . The three-storied main entrance gate is seen with a bronze fish fixed at the top of the arched gateway. This bronze fish works as a weather vane one finds the sacred five emblems mounted atop the main gate to signify the holy five members of Prophet Mohammad’s family. Opposite the main gate is Naubat Khana where large drums were beaten to announce the hours of the day. Two metal Grecian figures in bronze connected to spikes on the top of the gate act as lightning conductors. On the left side of the main building is seen a mosque with two minarets , a replica of Taj Mahal, where the tombs of Nawab’s daughter, Zinat Asiya, his son and her husband along with the tomb of Nawab’s consort are found. Non-Muslims are not allowed inside the mosque. On the other side a similar structure facing the mausoleum was built to maintain architectural symmetry and balance. This building was used as treasury. Outside the Imambara is a watchtower called Satkhanda or tower of seven stories. But only four stories were seen as the king passed away and the construction work was stopped. This tower was built between 1837 and 1842. On the model of Qutub Minar and the tower of Pisa this tower was constructed in Indo-Islamic style and was meant for lunar observation.Mohd.Ali Shah and his queen Malka Afaq Jahan deposited 26 lakhs with East India Company to form Hussianabad Endowment Trust to look after the religious buildings they had built and for observance of Muharrum and other connected functions. To the left of the main gate, Shahi Imam (Royal bath) with a complicated system of drainage is seen which supplies hot water to the gigantic bath tub. This building has been renovated in later times. Tickets purchased at Bada Imambara gives one access to Chota Imambara and Picture Gallery. Alexis Soltykoff, the Russian prince, who visited this place in 1841, described this monument as the “Kremlin of India.”Really as someone said, this monument is “ small in name, but big in wonder.” There are many worth seeing monuments nearby such as Jama Masjid, Clock Tower and Rumi Dawaja. The opening hours of this Imambara are from 8.00 a.m. to 6.30 p.m."

One of the earliest ones in India I guess.Also, the golden statue at the entrance holds a chain that is connected to a spire. This works as earthing. You can visit the Shahi Hamam (royal bath) where you can see stained glass windows, an elaborate hot water system & a jacuzzi kind of setup.The Tomb of Princess Zinat Asiya is supposed to be a replica of the Taj Mahal.

On this point I have no knowledge but I can say that I was entranced by the place. The Imambara is fronted by a long pool in which it's reflection is cast. A stunning mass of flowers to your left are simply glorious.  The outside of The Imambara was just in the final stages of being repainted in dazzling white with a covering of Quranic calligraphy picked out in black. The interior is richly decorated with Belgian glass chandelier's & tazia's.  A pair of white painted mosque's flank the pool.    The whole spctacle is entrancing. My 500r ticket obtained at The Bara Imambara covered the entrance fee here."

Chhota_Imambara,Rosalynde J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Chandeliers to die for!,This is an active religious building and ladies are expected to cover their heads so take a shawl. If you like chandeliers there are some fine examples in here. The architecture is stunning and the place is beautifully looked after too. Well worth a visit. 
Chhota_Imambara,srg45,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Very Good architecture!,Just had a quick glimpse of this structure. Very beautiful and worth a visit ! It is close to the Bara Imambara so one can do it together . Made in white marble it is very different but good.

Chhota_Imambara,Ajeet N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,"Petit, but beautiful",This is much better preserved than its larger namesake. The courtyard has waterworks with a bridge. There are tajmahalesque structures on either side. The earthing for the main gate on either side is through beautiful metallic golden ladies. The main building has Islamic calligraphy on its walls.

Chhota_Imambara,Anuradha Manjul,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Explore Lucknow – Chota (small) Imambada or Hussainabad Imamabara,"When a tourist, a history lover thinks of various destinations in India, does the name Lucknow ring a bell? One may have heard of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh for various political reasons, but Lucknow as a tourist destination or secret haven for history lovers is a rarity. A city which played an important role in India’s first war of independence; the revolt of 1857 (for freeing India from the clutches of Colonial Rule), a city which has traditionally been known for its rich cultural heritage, a city which was known for its Adab (good manners) and Tehzeeb (good breeding, politeness). Capital of erstwhile Awadh or Oudh, Lucknow sure deserves a bigger chunk in the tourist map of India and more space in the heart of history lovers.It is unfortunate that the Tourism department and the government is not keen on focussing in this area. The city has everything which can make it an ideal tourist spot – good connectivity with all the major cities in India and the world (due to the presence Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport), hotels for all ranges - from luxury to budget, you name it and the city has it, major international hotel chains like Taj group, Marriottt, Radisson, Hilton etc. are present here, ample transportation options in the city, excellent shopping opportunity, food joints dishing out some mouth-watering local cuisine and yes a rich cultural and historical heritage. What else you can ask for?In this series we would talk about some the interesting, must visit destinations in Lucknow. Have just half a day to spend in Lucknow, don’t miss out on Bada Imambada, Chota Imambada, La Martiniere boys and the British Residency. We would start our exploring with Chota Imambada or Hussainabad Imamabara. Imambada is a building used by Shia Muslims, the practitioners of Shia Islam (2nd largest branch of Islam) for the purpose of Azadari – azadari, the practices/rituals related to mourning and lamentation commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (Husayn ibn Ali) grandson of Prophet Mohammed in the battle of Karbala, which takes place in the period of Muharram. Nawab was a title given by the Mughal emperors to semi-autonomous Muslim rules of princely states. The Nawabs of Awadh (Oudh) were Shia Muslims and belonged to a dynasty of Persian origin from Nishapur, Iran. Saadat Khan, Burhan-ul-Mulk (Mohammad Amin) was a Persian nobleman who was appointed the governor of Awadh (Oudh) in 1722 AD. His court was in Faizabad near Lucknow. The weakening of Mugal Empire in Delhi gave him an advantage in carving out the state of Awadh (around 1724 AD) with its capital both at Faizabad and Lucknow.Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah (1837-1842) built the Hussainabad Imamabara (1838), which is popularly known as Chota (small) Imambada. It is located in the Heritage Zone of Lucknow; after the Bada (big) Imambada (Asafi Imambada), cross the majestic Rumi Darwaaza (gate), on the same road after almost ½ a kilometre on the left. There are many Imambadas in Lucknow, each Imambada in Lucknow has different architectural style. This holds true for Hussainabad Imambada also. True to its name Chota Imambada is not large in size. After Satkhanda, there is a 3 storeyed gate (made of brick, painted in white), the boundary of the Imambada start just after that, but not recognisable now as there are many commercial establishments. There is a sign installed by the Tourism department which announces that one has arrived at Chota Imambada – there is a small grilled enclosure which leads to a non-descript looking entrance. There is an entry charge for this monument. One can either use the combined entry ticket (purchased at Bada Imambada) or pay an entry charge for Rs. 20.00. The females need to cover their heads while inside this monument. Head scarves are available on rent at the entry.On entering through this gate (which is 3 storeyed) the first thing which is visible is a small arched gateway (not in use), on top of which is a bronze fish (with open fins- making it look like a flying fish). This is an anemometer (a scientific instrument used for measuring wind speed). The use of fish figure could be because the emblem of Nawabs of Awadh (Oudh) was two fishes (mahi muratib – the order of the fish). The second unique thing which one can see are two life size female figurines (European influence is clearly visible here) on either sides holding chains which are connected to spikes at the top of the gate one had entered. This is another scientific device – this is a lightening conductor device and the female figurines are serving as earthing equipment.The non-descript gateway through which one had entered, from this side is an architectural marvel, 3 storeyed; painted in white, an example of a mix of Islamic and European architectural style. The top most level reminded me of many Gothic churches I have seen. Once inside one can see the beauty of the gateway. Decorated with Islamic calligraphy and symbols in black this is just not a gateway – it’s the Naubat Khana.The Chota Imambada has many different structures in the complex. There is a small waterbody in the complex which starts right after the gateway with Fish shaped anemometer and ends just before the platform of Azakhana (the main congregation hall). This water body in a way divides the complex into right part and left part. There are small iron bridges to cross over (now not in use).A structural balance has been created on both sides. The first building on the right is a small mosque, again painted in white. It is built on a high platform, again decorated with Islamic Calligraphy and symbols.One look at the next building and one can easily realise the love or impact Taj Mahal had on the Nawab and the architects. It’s an attempted miniature replica of Taj Mahal again painted in white (no this building is not made in marble, but of Lakhori bricks, plastered and painted in white). There are 4 graves in this building – that of Princess Zinat Asiya, daughter of Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah or as many would call him the 3rd king of Oudh (Awadh), Nawab’s son, son-in-law and one lady from royal family.Just opposite to this building on right there is a building on left which is popularly known as ‘Jawaab’ or answer or reply. It’s an attempted mirror image of the building on the right – thus in a way reply to the building on the right. This building served as the Treasury.Then one can see the Duldul Khana (stable for Duldul). Duldul is a spotless white (it has been referred as glowing by many writers – but we didn’t see that glow) horse which is a living replica of Zuljanah – the faithful mount of Imam Hussain Ali (grandson of prophet Mohammad). This is linked to the martyrdom of Imam Hussain in the battlefield of Karbala, the main theme of mourning rituals of Moharram. The horse in Lucknow remains mainly in isolation and is brought out in public during Moharram celebrations. This horse in Lucknow unlike other areas is especially raised for this purpose, its upkeep is paid by Hussianabad & Allied Trust (HAT) which was set up in 1838 by the Nawab himself. The horse has and would never be mounted. (P.S. – the horse is replaced on its death, there is no progeny).The next structure which lies right next to Azakhana is the kitchen area, we could see logs and logs of wood. The inside looks like a simple old style kitchen area with good drainage area.The Azakhana or the main congregation hall is the most beautiful building. It’s located on a raised platform and one has to climb stairs to reach the courtyard. Entry with shoes is not allowed – there are shoe stands on the left side and one has to pay a fee of Rs. 2.00 (current rate) for the services. The single level structure has gold plated dome. The exterior of this building is beautifully decorated in Islamic Calligraphy which is painted exquisitely in white on a black background. This is one of the most unique feature of this building. The Azakhana is divided into two halls and a Shehnasheen (a platform where Zarih, a replica of Zarih of Imam Hussian, is kept).   The interior of the building is in shades of green bordered with white. Once inside the hall area one is transformed into a magical land – with numerous exotic chandeliers which had been brought from Belgium (way back in the time of Nawab), mirrors (brought all the way from Europe) and crystal glass lamp stands. It’s because of these the imambada has also been called as Palace of Lights by various European writers. The Imambada also served as a mausoleum for the Nawab and his mother who are buried side by side inside the Azakhana.There are many antiquities which one can find inside the Azakhana; the royal throne of Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah, his crown (similarities with European crowns), a Parisian clock, a fish tank which had travelled all the way from Europe, Quran verses written in Islamic calligraphy in the shape of tiger, horse, bird etc. and many other such artefacts. Other than these one can find numerous Tazias (a representation of tombs of Imam Hussain and Hasan, grandsons of Prophet Mohammed, used in Moharram processions), made up of ivory, silver, sandalwood, wax etc. each a beautiful work of exquisite craftsmanship.One would find many people inside the Azakhana who would be willing to act as guides, they would say that they would require no fee for that, one may pay whatever one feels good. It’s entirely up to an individual to decide if one wants to go ahead with these self-styled guides or not. We refused and post our refusal were told that we couldn’t do photography inside the Azakhana (though there is no official notification for the same). On being questioned on this, they replied if you have any issues you can call up the office. We informed that we had taken photographs earlier also, they told that earlier it was allowed, now it is not. (Again there is no official intimation for the same).The Hussainabad Imambara or the Chota Imambada is under Hussianabad & Allied Trust (HAT). Unlike the Bada Imambada, where the restoration, repair etc. is under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), HAT manages the affairs here. This is has resulted in improper restoration. There are numerous solar lights installed (by various individuals with ugly looking boards announcing their names), but the installations and the wires etc. are done in such a way that they have marred the beauty of the monument. This monument is worth a visit for many things; to understand the historical importance of an era where the East India Company was gaining its control over India, to understand the impact of European architecture & traditions over the royalty in Awadh/Oudh, to understand the impact of religion over period architecture, importance of proper restoration to save heritage etc. Few things to understand: please don’t expect this monument to be similar to the Mughal monuments, it’s neither comparable in architecture finery nor comparable in its grandeur. But one needs to admire the craftsmanship - the monument is built using locally available Lakhori bricks (Lakhori bricks were kiln baked, only 19 mm thick and normally about 10 cm x 15 cm. These bricks because of their small size were extensively used for creating finer details on the wall and column surfaces). Religious activities still happen in the complex – this complex plays an important role during the month of Moharram, so one needs to respect the religious sentiments."
Chhota_Imambara,Gene R J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,A Shia Muslim congregation hall became a mausoleum complex.,"We visited here with combination site ticket ($7 for non-Indian), walking 1 km up Husainabad Rd from the more famous and older Bara Imambara. This Chhota congregation hall was built in 1838 and converted to a mausoleum when the ruling Nawab died in 1842. The tomb of his daughter was added to the side of the reflection pool on her death, then a treasury added to the other side for balance. This very beautiful complex, which includes a huge gateway entrance, is best viewed at the top of the steps of the main hall.  From this landing, 5 portals lead into the entry hall which proceed into the elaborate ""Palace of Lights Hall"".  Here chandeliers overlook the tomb, as well as 5 raised chapels, 2 featuring models of the Taj Mahal. This complex is in good condition being built 47 years after the Bara. From here we took an $3 Uber for 4 km southeast to The British Residency."

Chhota_Imambara,Dalbir_S_Virdi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Class Apart in comparison to Bada Imambada,"Not very far from Bada Imambada is located Chhota Imambada. Unlike Bada Imambada, here you need to deal with two sets of Guides. One who would tell you about history of Chhota Imambada and the ""Shahi Hamam"" (Royal Bath) inside the same campus and another set of attendants inside the Imambadas. For some reason, the first set of Guides are not allowed inside Chhota Imambada. You actually don't require a guide inside the Imambada because its comparatively a very small structure. Its beautifully decorated inside with Chandeliers from all over the European countries. There are few Graves inside and these belong to the Nawab's family members. The Shahi Hamam is quite an attractive place but poorly kept. Just an advise - start your journey from Bada Imambada and buy composite Tickets for all attractions that includes Chhota Imambada and Museum as well. Its only Rs. 50/- per person. An extra Rs. 5/- is charged for Still Cameras."

The large green and white bordered hall of Azakhana is richly decorated with chandeliers and a good number of crystal glass lamp-stands.

We had earlier visited Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad and expected this newly developed riverfront to be at least comparable with that if not better, but were very much disappointed after seeing dirty and stinking water of the river and several vendors selling snacks etc. in the garden. The garden appears to be a simple case of neglect and I feel that vendors should not be allowed in side but can be provided temporary cabins to sell items outside on the road near parking area. Of course, some vendors were seen outside also but proper management was missing. The up keep of garden is also not good and water of the river was badly stinking with lots of mosquitoes all around. It could be a good place for a morning walk (when mosquitoes might not trouble the walkers), but certainly not good for picnics or evening stroll in the Riverfront park. I was also surprised to find that people inside the park were not following Covid 19 precautions. Some checks  are necessary."

Due to the barrage downstream, there is plenty of water, but there seems to be no flow in the water. Also, there is a lot of bad odour, perhaps due to drains opening in the river. We also thought it could be the untreated water being used for irrigating the greens in the park. But any which way, the foul smell was discouraging. "

And believe me, we got every thing, right from the smallest item like pooja items to utensils to clothes. The only thing with Aminabad is that it is very very crowdy and conjusted  but dont get panicky with the crowd, it is same as you find in the crowford market of Mumbai or Bara Bazar/Satya narayan park area of Kolkata. One more interesting thing I observed is typical names of the shops and markets. I saw one Gadbad jhala market; which means every thing mess or wrong. But the market is very beautiful and systematic. We loved and enjoyed shopping at Aminabad. If you are planning to go to Lucknow, you must visit and shop at this market."

She also bought sandals for Rs. 150 and slips for Rs. 2504. 4x heavy bangles for Rs. 80And the list goes on. Some tips for shopping in Aminabad market.1. Plan to visit at around 13:00. Grab lunch at Tunday Kababi or similar and start the shopping.2. Make sure you carry a small backpack so that you can dump all the small items into it which makes carrying easy.3. Prakash Kulfi is a must. If you are lucky you will find some carts selling Makhan Malai.4. Bargain hard, you will know when someone will not reduce the price further but do you best as you can never be sure.5. It is best to buy items such as sarees, dress etc which need a thorough inspection during the day. Make sure you check for damages spots tears etc. We almost bought two sarees only to realize just before we paid that there were many spots.6. Market starts winding up at around 20:00 but some stalls will remain till 21:007. On your way from Naka towards the market, you will find some sweet shops which are awesome and very easy on the pocket if you wish to carry sweets back home.Hope this helps."

Aminabad,MariaK638ET,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Great Shopping Trip,"Aminabad is the most popular shopping area of Lucknow. For traditional clothing and items like bangles and costume jewellery, it's hard to beat. It has winding, twisting alleyways and shops within shops. It's really exciting to shop there. But there's only one problem. To get the best out of this traditional shopping area of Lucknow, you have to have good, old-fashioned haggling skills. And I don't! But....my friend and adopted sister-in-law Babita does. So when Aine,a friend from my native Ireland, was here recently, we called up Babita and beseeched her to help us out. She brought us on an incredible journey. Thanks to her, I got several armfuls of lovely bangles. My Aine did too. She also picked up some nice ethnic items, i.e, shawls and the like, for friends back in Ireland. Again, thanks to Babita. Like I said, Aminabad is great for a visit. But there are a few things you have to sort out before you go. Firstly, you should decide what you need to buy before you go there. Secondly, you should bring someone with you who knows how to bargain. Satisfaction guaranteed!"

The distance is around 85 km and it is on road leading to left at N.H.24 at a place called Sidhauli on Lucknow- Delhi Highway.3. The place got mentions in ancient Hindu scriptures and is believed that Lord Brahma himself identified this place for sages to perform meditation and prayers in unabated way.4.The Chakra Tirth temple is established at that very place where wheel or Chakra of Lord Brahma stopped in search of ideal area.5. Here a holy pond or Chakra Tirth came into existence and depth of this pond is considered unfathomable and crossing of the inner circle is not allowed.6. Devotees come here to take dip in holy waters and to get rid of sins and after that worship in surrounding temples .7. The problem here is the presence of too many local priests who are not ready to spare anyone and think that only they can show way to please God.8.The maintenance of place is not good and as the place has so much religious significance this needs more attention.9. There are more temples near this place which should be visited like temple of Goddess Lalita Devi which is one of Shakti peeth  and other one is Hanuman temple where it is believed brother of Ravan named Ahiravan kept Ram and Laxman in captivity and Hanumanji freed them .10. Neemsar or Naimisharnya is a sacred place in Hindu mythology and visit to this place should be adhered in that way.

My husband had a masala mushroom which was yummy. Spicy crispy! Finally we ordered kulfifaluda. Our bad luck that the kulfi was more salty then sweet.

St_Joseph_s_Cathedral,sunitmathur1203,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Brilliant during Christmas,"One of the most beautiful churches in Northern India is the St Josephs Cathedral Lucknow.  Dominating the scene in Hazratganj one is struck by the spectacular architecture of this Church. The upper part of this magnificent building is in the shape of a crescent supported by a broad structure, and rising from this crescent is a tall column with a giant cross on top. The statue of Jesus Christ with open arms, which stands atop the entrance to the prayer hall on the first floor, that we reach through the broad stairway is very awe-inspiring and reverential. The original building was constructed by Rev Fr William Gleeson and consecrated in 1862 by Bishop Anastus Hartmann.

It is an impressive building indeed, obviously built in British times.  It's not easy to get in here, people.  I managed to do so because my political science student daughter's friend's father is the assistant of a politician who has a seat here.  A few girls in the class wanted to go in, to see how a legislative assembly works and an adult was needed to accompany them.  So I went in.  OMG, the security was something else.  You had to take off all jewellery, rings and earrings, What was particularly worrisome was that the security people didn't take their eyes off you for a second.  An innocent whisper to your companion as you sat next to her in the visitors' gallery is hushed immediately. Let's face it, I had to do it sometime, I don't know Hindi.  It's quite thrilling seeing the local political   personalities of whom one reads in the newspapers  giving their speeches right in front of you, even if you don't know Hindi well. Oh and BTW, do NOT raise your hand to scratch your ear, you will get glared and prodded by the security women in the gallery.  It's just not worth it. Oh, well, I guess it's necessary. The building is beautiful and well preserved and for me, a politically aware long-term resident of Lucknow, well worth seeing.  The trouble is, I don't think tourists would enjoy it very much, those policewomen tend to look at you as if to say 'one false move and you're going to the dungeon in chains'. I mean, who needs that on holiday? But as a photo opportunity, the Vidhan Sabha is gorgeous. Do do try to get outside and get a picture and leave the political shenanigans where they belong - inside the building.  It will save you having to retrieve your handbag and jewellery later.      "

The Vidhan Sabha was no exception. Brilliantly illuminated. But we got only a few seconds to shoot our pic. The road in front was crowded, lots of fast-food vendors were selling paani-puris and other snacks, my wife got down for a plate of paani-puri and immediately she had to rush back to the car as an old policeman arrived at site and barked at all cars parked in front of the will-lit building to take away their car as it is a no-parking area. The question remains : If it is such a high-security, no-parking spot even in evening, when harmless, law-abiding revellers in holiday-mood with family are out for some enjoyment on a holiday, why in the first place so many street-side vendors are allowed to sell their products just in front of the high-security citadel??

Most of such people were born and brought up in this (backward) state but had to migrate to so called developed states because of compulsions of their service or because of any other similar reasons.  I have no problems with them. It is also true that U.P is mini India which has absorbed migrants from all over India who follow their tradition and culture and we are proud of our heterogeneous culture . Seat of U.P .Government the “Vidhansabha” building is majestic and    beautiful structure with no  parallel.Tricolour at the top of  central dome adds to its grandeur    .  The state symbol in form of two fishes in an emblem is engraved at top- front of building which gives  majestic look  to the  building .Front lawn is lush green and well maintained .The space opposite and across the road has a unique semicircular design difficult to describe.

It does not have the grandeur of the Asifi Mosque but it is as significant in the history of India as any other monument.

Shah_Najaf_Imambara,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Family,A beautiful tribute,"Shah Najaf Imambara may not be as grand as the other two Imambaras in Lucknow – the Asafi or Bara Imambara and the Hussainabad or Chota Imambara, nevertheless it transports you to a world which reflects the eclectic past of Lucknow. Fewer tourists being aware of the place, it is an island of serenity just next to the typical trappings of the modern world – chaotic traffic and a  huge mall.In 1816, the Nawab of Awadh Ghazi-ud-Din Haider built Shah Najaf Imambara at a place called Paltan Ghat on the banks of river Gomti, as a token of his devotion to Caliph Hazrat Ali, the husband of Fatima, the favourite daughter of Prophet Mohammed. The white domed structure is said to be a replica of Hazrat Ali’s mausoleum at the city of Najaf in modern Iraq. The rear of the Imambara which faces the river.Shah Najaf Imambara is also called Karbala, because within its main hall lie the mortal remains of its builder, Ghazi-ud-Din Haider, who wished to be buried here. It also contains the graves of his wives, Mubarak Mahal (a European), Sarfaraz Mahal and Mumtaz Mahal . Ghazi-ud-din Haider’s silver tomb is flanked by the tombs of his wives on either side and the golden tomb is that of Mubarak Mahal.The hall is beautifully decorated with chandeliers and a lot of memorabilia relating to the Nawabi era. You can also see the ‘ tazia’s - intricate designs of wood, bamboo and silver paper, which are carried during the celebrations of Muharam. Enjoy a leisurely stroll in its passages which offer a great view of the Gomti river. There are no designated guides unlike Bara Imambara. One of the caretakers showed us around. He informed  us that the Shah Najaf Imambara presents a spectacular view when it is decorated and illuminated on important occasions. A nice place to enjoy some moments of tranquility."

Lucknow_University,Durgesh K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,..::Lucknow University::.. The Proud of Awadh,"The idea of starting a University at Lucknow was first mooted by Raja Sir Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan, Khan Bahadur, K.C.I.E. of Mahmudabad, who contributed an article to the columns of ""The Pioneer'' urging the foundation of a University at Lucknow. A little later Sir Harcourt Butler, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the United Provinces, and his well-known interest in all matters under his jurisdiction, specially in matters educational, gave fresh life and vigour to the proposal. The first step to bring the University into being was taken when a General Committee of educationists and persons interested in university education appointed for the purpose, met in conference at Government House, Lucknow, on November, 10, 1919. At this meeting Sir Harcourt Butler, who was in the chair, outlined the proposed scheme for the new university.A discussion followed, and it was resolved that Lucknow University should be a Unitary, Teaching, and Residential University of the kind recommended by the Calcutta University Mission, 1919, and should consist of Faculties of Arts, including Oriental Studies, Science, Medicine, Law, etc. A number of other resolutions was also passed and six sub-committees were formed, five of them to consider questions connected with the University and one to consider the arrangements for providing Intermediate Education. These sub-committees met during the months of November and December, 1919, and January, 1920; and the reports of their meetings were laid before a second Conference of the General Committee at Lucknow on January 26, 1920; their proceedings were considered and discussed, and the reports of five of the sub-committees were, subject to certain amendments, confirmed. The question of incorporation of the Medical College in the University, however, was for the time being left open for expression of opinion. At the close of the Conference donations of one lakh each from the Raja of Mahmudabad and Jahangirabad were announced.The resolutions of the first Conference together with the recommendations of the sub-committees as confirmed at the second Conference were laid before a meeting of the Allahabad University on March 12, 1920, and it was decided to appoint a sub-committee to consider them and report to the Senate. The report of the sub-committee was considered at an extraordinary meeting of the Senate on August 7, 1920, at which the Chancellor presided, and the scheme was generally approved. In the meantime the difficulty of incorporating the Medical College in the University had been removed. During the month of April 1920, Mr. C.F. de la Fosse, the then Director of Public Instruction, United Provinces, drew up a Draft Bill for the establishment of the Lucknow University which was introduced in the Legislative Council on August 12, 1920. It was then referred to a Select Committee which suggested a number of amendments, the most important being the liberalising of the constitution of the various University bodies and the inclusion of a Faculty of Commerce; this Bill, in an amended form, was passed by the Council on October 8, 1920. The Lucknow University Act, No. V of 1920, received the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor on November 1, and of the Governor-General on November 25, 1920.The Court of the University was constituted in March, 1921, and the first meeting of the Court was held on March 21, 1921, at which the Chancellor presided. The other University authorities such as the Executive Council, the Academic Council, and Faculties came into existence in August and September, 1921. Other Committees and Boards, both statutory and otherwise, were constituted in course of time. On July 17, 1921, the University undertook teaching -- both formal and informal. Teaching in the Faculties of Arts, Science, Commerce, and Law was being done in the Canning College and teaching in the Faculty of Medicine in the King George's Medical College and Hospital. The Canning College was handed over to the University on July 1, 1922, although previous to this date the buildings, equipment, staff, etc., belonging to the Canning College had been ungrudgingly placed at the disposal of the University for the purposes of teaching and residence. The King George's Medical College and the King George's Hospital were transferred by the Government to the University on the March 1, 1921. The following three Colleges provided the nucleus for the establishment of the University: The King George's Medical College. (Now Known as King George's Medical University)The Canning College.The Isabella Thoburn College.This was a rich inheritance for the new-born University in 1920, both materially and intellectually, and it brought with it also the richest of all heritages ""a fine tradition of some fifty-five years in the case of the Canning College and some nine years in the case of the King George's Medical College."" To this the generous taluqdars of Oudh added an endowment of nearly thirty lakhs. The support from Sir Harcourt Butler's Government was strong and hearty. Since then the Government of the United Provinces has annually contributed a substantial share towards the maintenance of the University."

The building had patterned walls and unusually no inner courtyard.It faced major impact during the first war of independence and hence lies in a less than perfect state with just a few towers and walls standing."

Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Chelsea E,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,Pristine Gardening Amidst Nawabi Ruins,"I visited Dilkusha Kothi and was expecting to be able to wander around inside ruins as is often the case with ruins in India. There is no doubt that the Dilkusha Kothi is in ruins, however, due to barred doors there is no way to go inside, and one may only look inside from said barred doors. However if there were a way to go inside it might not make much of a difference as there's not a whole lot to the structures themselves. I found it interesting that there was a British person's grave next to one of the two kothis. If you wish to pay homage to the era of Wajid Ali Shah you will find helpful informational telling about how the properties were used as summer homes for the Nawab and his family, and that at one time the grounds nearby were also used for military trainings, which the British apparently did not like. Worth seeing if you are interested in the history. The premises is pristinely well-kept and has an open grassy space for picnicking as well as some nice shade trees."

This campus is hidden behind the CM's residence and is a very peaceful place as very few people some here. The construction of the Palace was stopped due to the orders from the Queen, but the shear layout of the walls of the side palace tells you the grandeur of the planners. The yard is impeccable. One has to imagine how the emperor Shah Alam would have thought of this place. One distinct aspect of this place is there is no evidence of any strategic plan by the emperor in case there is an attack by an enemy unlike what you often see in other Mughal palaces."

The Dilkusha Kothi was modelled on an English manor house and you can still see the underground chambers used by the maids, the towers on 4 sides, the fireplaces etc. At places, you can also see the original decoration. It won't take more than 30-45 minutes to see everything, but there is not point in going if you don't like historical buildings/ruins. The ASI has recently started renovating it.

Dilkusha_Kothi_Palace,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2012 • Family,A piece of history amidst soothing greenery,"Dilkusha Kothi was a palace built in the English baroque style in the quiet Cantonment area of Lucknow , India.All that remains today of the magnificent structure are  a few towers and external walls. All the roofs are gone. The house was profusely shelled when Lucknow was sieged by rebel Indian soldiers of the British East India Company during the 1857 uprising. This damaged the structure permanently.The marks of shelling are clearly visible on its walls even now.But you can still see the lush green lawns which once surrounded the Kothi. The house was constructed around 1800 by the British resident Major Gore Ouseley, a friend of the ruler of Awadh, Nawab Sadat Ali Khan. It was initially intended as a hunting lodge for the Nawabs. It was later used as a summer resort too. There is also another smaller building on the premises. This was built by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah for military exercises which he had to abandon because the British rulers objected to it.The remains of the building, the lawns and surrounding gardens have been currently restored by the Archaeological Survey of India(ASI). There are no guides available. But the signage provided by ASI has sufficient details. After leisurely walk exploring the place, we settled down to a nice little picnic in its gardens. There are a very few garbage bins. So we carried back our trash till we found one. Ideal place to enjoy  lush greens while remembering an important era of India’s history."

Botanical_Gardens,pensioner090,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Outstanding research institute with lovely gardens open to public,"We found the Botanical Gardens by accident. They are not on any tour routes. They are open only from 6.30 - 9.00 am each morning and are well worth the visit if you like gardens and if you want to see real residents of Lucknow out for their  morning exercise...power walking, jogging and just enjoying the gardens. It was a splendid way to begin our day and the gardens are lovely.This is a research institute, not a public garden so they are not open during the hours when scientists are working in the gardens and premises.The gardens are only a 10 minute easy walk down a straight road from the end of Shahnajaf Road where it intersects with Rana Pratap Marg. The lovely Shah Najaf Imambara complex is located at this intersection. When you finish walking around the gardens, walk up the road to the Shah Najaf Imambara and spend a delightful hour there."

The day was overcast making it an ideal day for outdoor visits. Nothing much to see except for the baby Gharials and Crocodiles seen at a distance.

There is a section for rescued gharials which are brought in from various villages or other locations.The gharials are bred and freed in the rivers after they grow big.There were about 500 gharials and 11 crocodiles when we went.There is a museum also but it was under renovation in January.It's a good family picnic spot as well."

It's also favourite place for loving couples. But apart of these hassles you can find a peaceful place for you where you can have interaction with nature. I've few such great memories in my records. For a tourist it is just a crocodile breeding centre, for kis & families a picnic spot, for loving couples a meeting place and for nature lovers a natural place. For others it will seen as not maintained place but for nature lovers it is a place where few spots is available where nature is kept as it is and not much disturbed."

Kukrail_Forest_Reserve,Satish T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,CROCODILE SANCTUARY CUM PICNIC PLACE IN THE NATURAL WILDERNESS,"Nestled in the dense forest, this crocodile and ghariayal sanctuary cum picnic spot, takes you off from the buzz of the city. Just 10 Kms from the Charbagh Railway station, near Khurram nagar and you find yourself in the lush green natural jungle off from the concrete jungle. OPENING TIME AND FEES –It opens from morning  7 Am to  6 PM ,parking fees for two wheeler is 10 and Rs 20 for 4 wheelers This place is appreciated by all types of peoples and best suited for those loving loneliness in ambiance of nature. Particularly young couples and love birds like it most.  This crocodile sanctuary was established in the year 1975 under UP Govt’s  scheme of extinct forest animal project. This is written on the sign board shown just before the Entrance gate .It was basically a crocodiles rehabilitation and breeding centre which was later on converted into a picnic spot,  It is maintained by the forest department.   Named Kukrail ,because it is situated in the Kukrail forest and on the bank of Kukrail river.                                               After entering inside the sanctuary, first thing to be noticed is statue of a big crocodile opening its mouth with a big fish in its jaw as seen from the side. Peoples and children stand inside its jaw and take group snaps .Back side of the crocodile looks like a rounded entrance.                                                                                                                   Infant, unprotected recently hatched crocodiles and tortoises are brought from nearby rivers and kept here till they become adult enough to protect themselves. Then grown up and extra ones are released in the nearby big rivers. At one place you’ll see thick steel wired cages, in which different sizes of crocodiles are kept and transferred into other when they become bigger. It was a feast for the eyes, to watch baby crocodiles creeping in the cage and basking in the sun, in groups. Going ahead we saw a natural pond with crocodiles in it. Ahead you will see a small divided ponds complex, where you can watch tortoises and crocodiles. There is an area for children, having swings and rides. Besides you can watch different types of birds, deer’s , sāmbhar’s and some other animals. I saw one cafeteria also, serving snacks and tea. Walking inside this sanctuary was a very pleasant, mind refreshing and rejuvenating experience. Satish Tripathi Gorakhpur . Sctri48@gmail.com"

When i went at the entrance there was a statue of a crocodile with a fish in his mouth, the statue was like hollow you can enter it take selfies. After that if you go to the right you will see very cute babies of crocodiles and gharial and if you go forward you will see three big crocodiles with a giant turtle in a cage like structure below the ground level and in a forest type environment and when you go more forward there will be some cages and there at the last cage will be a rare Gharial. But at the path and the park there is no cleanness. There are swings also for kids. You can enjoy on a holiday but i would better advice Janeshwar Mishra Park.Thanks."

The small, but extremely well-maintainedmuseum does not allow visitors to take cameras, or mobile phonesinside the premises: the above items have to be left behind inlockers, located conveniently outside the pathway to the maingate. The museum is located centrally inside one of the mainbuildings in the British Residency. There are cannons outside theentrance. The museum chronicles the events in the First War ofIndian Independence, of 1857, in historical documents,photographs, lithographs, paintings, and arms and ammunition ofthe era. A number of historical maps also trace the chronologicalorder in which the events of the uprising happened, over the area.The museum includes a model of the Residency itself, in one ofthe rooms. One of the rooms has a bas relief of Ms. SusannaPalmer, who had died due to a cannon ball hitting the room: thepoint of impact of the shell in the building can still be seen."

Anandi_Water_Park,Mukesh Srivastava,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Expensive and poorly maintained resort,"I visited anandi water park today.The turn for the resort is not marked prominently. If you are coming from BBD side,  u have to take a turn immediately after crossing the canal,  cross it again and take left turn,  the road is almost a service road adjacent to the canals and has different coloured flag all along till the resort. For a weekday the entry was for 700 rs for adults. Lunch was an addon for 150 rs, which we didn't opt for. The guy at the reception offered us private changing rooms for additional amount which we declined, a decision we regretted. The entry amount included one small cold drink,  a small cup of ice cream and one snack with choice between pav bhaji and noodles. The management dies not allow outside Food and your bag is checked. Food offered was of average quality. The pool and the slides are good and continuous DJ plays on quite loudly,  we enjoyed this part. The sour point were the changing rooms which were actually filthy,  cubicle doors were broken,  in ladies room people had thrown used sanitary pads,  so it was a real bad experience. The do provide costumes on payment both for men and women but people in the shirts baniyans and other dresses were also visible. Coming to pool and slides they have a good assortment but all if them do not function simultaneously.  I was there from 12 to 330 and the wave pool was not operative. Some youngsters with life guard t shirts are present.  But they were actually doing crowd management next to slides and blowing whistles.  The sitting area of the restaurant  was again dirty and unkempt.  Though tired we moved away from there quite fast. Go there if you are only in for pool and slides. Also the parking is not free. They do provide a small locker in the men's changing room. It can accomadate a small back pack. "

Anandi_Water_Park,maddash-traveler,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,"Bad design, under staffed but good value ","This place is okay for adults or teenagers but is less than optimum for young kids. Why? Because the designers crammed dozens of rides in a small area. To reduce footprint, they eliminated the long flat landing Lane and instead made the landing zone for every slide deeper by ~1 feet. That makes it unsafe for smaller kids below 4 years. There is one life guard for every set of slides but on a busy day they can't literally catch all the small kids. My day was spent in catching my son as opposed to letting my 4 year old son enjoy on his own. The upkeep especially of the changing areas is a bit lacking in hygiene and could do with better standards. It's very 90s.The tube slides have tubes which are massively under inflated. The place is good value because the ticket includes clothes, lockers and a round of food. That leads to some mess since people keep going in and out of the water into the garden to eat and the water gets a bit muddied. There's a lazy river but there is no directional flow not tubes on which you can sit. Defeats the whole purpose. Lastly, the wave pool operates with limited frequency and at that time other rides are switched off. The waves are nice but the pool is gender segregated. My wife and mother in law enjoyed separately from us!I paid 1.5x the price in Gurgaon for Oysters but it is totally worth it! "

Anandi_Water_Park,harshnegi,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Family,A decent effort led down steeply by lack commitment to keep any standards,"With few options for kids around Lucknow (I mean monuments of historical importance is not an equivalent alternative), a water park is a logical options. The dept of the water is apt for kids, even my 2 years old can be comfortable, but it is dirty.There is no demaraction of area for children and dont think there is anyone to enforce it. The condition of change room not for discussion, but it is also dirty. They charge full tickets for kids more than 120 cms , measured on a board standing at the entrance (Rs 600) . They also force you to buy meal coupons to eat from inside.The Paw-Bhajji , Chowmein and some other option they give along with ice-cream (not sure which brand) and a small drink (200mL coke). We took Pav-Bajji and Chowmein and did not eat, wasted it(it tasted weird) (like others did before us).(A little effort could do into prepare the dish and can save some food wastage). Tips to have good time would be visit on working days, carry some food, your own towel, locker space given is really small so carry a polybag to keep your sandals/slippers, which is also a tip for foot wear."

Though its way too economical and budget friendly but no one love to take risks for price factor.

It is a splendor of medieval architecture and is visited by a number of tourists from all over the world.The tower shows a blend of French and Italian style structural designs. It was constructed during the time of Nawab Muhamad Ali Shah, but his untimely demise in 1840 blocked its construction. Though the towering structure is named as Satkhanda, which means seven stories, it holds only four stories. Famed as the tallest tower in India, Satkhanda, is believed to be built in the 1880s in memory of Sir George Couper, a reform-minded Governor of UP."

No Airport Restriction about double vaccine or RT CPR report is required but still take all precautions.We were staying in Hotel Nexus near Gurudwara Charbaag, hotel and staffs all are good in rating I will provide 4 out of 5 stars .Now comes about local sightseeing must visit points are:- 1.

Picture gallery(DSLR and Mobile allow but no photography)7. B.R. Ambedkar Memorial Park(DSLR not allow only Mobile photography)8. Janeshwar Mishra Park (optional)These places are mandatory and extra places you can choose by yourself.First when to purchase tickets in Bara Imambara it includes from 2nd point to 6th point in single ticket. In Bara Imambara you will need a local guide to help you in Bhul Bhulaiya we were three in number so it cost 125 for all which include Bara Imambara but we paid 150 for all which include Bara Imambara, Chota Imambara, Bouli so I will suggest you to take guide for full or else you have to pay extra to enter Bouli In B.R. Ambedkar Park Rs. 15.00 for entry the place is beautiful and good for relaxing If you wish to purchase Chikon Items there is a local factory of government which provides best quality Chikon in low rates 2 days are enough to visit all places. Where to eat:- You can eat food near Mohan hotel Maharaja but food quality is avg. I will prefer to eat from your hotel price maybe higher but the quality will be good or if you like a south indian food please take a visit to Selvam's.Now how to visit these place and how to reach the hotel:- If you really book Hotel Nexus, from Airport it will take 30min and from Railway Station, it will take 12 mins a taxi will take 250-320 for Airport and auto will take 40 from station.And how to visit these places you can book you own ride but I will suggest a Panjabi Guy Amarjeet Singh he Drives an Auto Rickshaw but this guy is very good in manner and trustable he set the rate at very reasonable price and I really appreciate that his Contact Number is 7860509907 if you ar 3 to 4 in number try him you won't regret.On 18-10-2021 we return back."

Hussainabad_Picture_Gallery,Indraneel,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Interesting - Could have been better,"Hussainabad Picture Gallery was my last stop during my Lucknow visit. This place is next to Rumi Darwaza and the Clock Tower. The gallery is housed in a beautiful building made by the third Nawad of Awadh and has some rare life-size portraits of the various Nawabs of Awadh painted by British artists and one Indian Painter Mr. D K Singh. The portraits are really interesting and has elements of optical illusion in them.This place is ticketed and the cost is included in the combo ticket available in Bada Imambada.Pro:- The building housing the gallery is beautiful. Watch out for- Iron pillars in the upper story pavilion facing the lake - used first time in Nawabi building- Bowling alley or Gendghar build by Mohammad Ali Shah for the Britishers- Rare Pictures; believed to be made on elephant skin and the colors used were prepared from diamonds and other precious stonesCons:- Picture Gallery is a misnomer as it is just a large hall with pictures & paintings on all the four walls.- The paintings and the pictures have no detailing. Forced to take guide at high cost.- Photography is strictly prohibited - reason best known only to the administrators- Unprofessional maintenance,Viewing time : 20 mins"

Musa_Bagh,Anuradha Manjul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,"Explore Lucknow – Musa Bagh, the Lost Gem, its role in the history of Lucknow and the history of Independent India","Had never thought that cataloguing self-clicked photographs of one of the popular tourist points in Lucknow would lead to finding a treasure trove or as many would say Pandora’s box.A name which tumbled out was Musa Bagh. Don’t know but it had some unknown attraction; the next thing we knew was that on a sunny Saturday morning we were driving led by Google Aunty to find it. The location was on the IIM Road (from the trisection Bithauli Khurd crossing on Sitapur Road), one needs to cross the river Gomti and then take a left past the Garbage Landfill (yes the authorities in Lucknow have made the city garbage landfill right on the bank of the water source of the city River Gomti). One needs to drive for around a kilometre; and as Google says – the destination would be on your right.Some construction work is happening on the 2 lane one way road and we had to drive on the wrong side. There are no boards to inform where Musa Bagh is, though as per the Archaeological Survey of India, this is a nationally protected monument.   We could see traces of some old building, and seeing that it was it made of the Lakhori bricks (a speciality brick of the region from the time gone by), assumed that it was Musa Bagh. Yes, google confirmed that it was Musa Bagh. There was no sign board informing about the same, just a blue board proclaiming that it was a protected monument.Just before the entrance on the left there was garbage dumped (glass pieces), there were storage structures for cow dung cakes and there were two bulls (definitely of the villagers) sitting (properly tethered). Right at the entrance there were two males sitting and observing us.Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, 4th Nawab Wazir of Awadh (Oudh) has chosen this site and had a garden made here. Nawab Saadat-Ali-Khan (5th Nawab) built the garden complex. It was designed by the French General Claude Martin (yes a French serving in British East India Company, who had designed many buildings in Lucknow), who lies buried in Constantia or what today is known as La Martiniere Boys School (another one of his designs). The design was on the lines of an English Manor. The garden complex is on a raised mount, close to the river Gomti. Earlier the river was closer, and now it has moved slightly farther (changed its course). Around it are lush green fertile farms (they were there even when the garden complex was constructed) which thanks to unplanned development would soon turn into concrete jungle or barren land, if nothing is done.The garden complex was completed between 1803-1804 CE; far away from the main city, to serve as a country retreat. There is story about the name of the complex – many people believe that Musa Bagh was a corruption (as we say in Hindi – Apbransh) of Monsieur Garden (Frenchman’s garden) as they believe that Musa (meaning Moses in English) has no place in Islam (the Nawabs were followers of Shia sect of Islam – having their roots in Iran). This is incorrect. Musa Bagh could have been named in the memory or honour of Hazrat Musa, who is a revered prophet in Islam. Musa or Hazrat Musa is mentioned in Quraan (the holy book of Islam), he is revered by the Muslims the same way he is revered in Judaism. Yes Hazrat Musa and Moses are same. One can find mention of Hazrat Musa across Quarn – e.g. Surah Al-Baqara, 51, Surah Al-Baqara, 67, Surah Al-Maida, 22, Surah Al-Araf, 116, Surah Yunus, 81.Another name by which this garden complex has been referred by old European chroniclers is Baroween which could have been the anglicised version of berūn (an urdu word meaning outside or pertaining to the suburbs or country); the complex for sure would have been referred by this name as it was outside the main city.This complex was once the entertainment ground of the Nawab; the wild beast fights organised by him were famous among the Europeans and the natives; it is said the smaller animals like antelopes were trained to fight here.The structure today is in ruins. At the entrance there are stairs in a shape of semi- circle, broken at many places. The structure is without roof. The walls are made out of Lakhori bricks and had been plastered. The building would in its hay days would have had many floors, the level on which we were standing and a level above (because of the presence of pillared walls on the higher level). Some restoration work has been done by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) more than a decade ago.  We could see beautiful Roman style pillars on the top level, having beautiful stucco work. At centre there is a large hall (no roof), which is surrounded by a large wide gallery like area which earlier were rooms. At the corners of the hall, there are two cylindrical chamber with dome like structures having winding staircases reaching the upper level. The staircases are in bad shape and it’s advisable not to risk climbing them as it might damage them further. The domes have oval shaped windows (now just gaping oval holes). It is said that the Nawab used to watch the fights from these oval windows. There is small open well like structure (no water only plants and garbage) in this hall. According to historians this was part of Claude Martin’s architectural skills – using such sunken structures to cool the surrounding rooms, idea is to use the natural elements to cope with the heat. Nothing much remains in terms of the interiors except the floral vine patterns on the walls here and there, remnant of some faded patterns (probably some Frescos) on the walls.Musa Bagh played an important role in the revolt of 1857 (related to Awadh region), India’s first war of independence against the British or as the British call it the Sepoy Mutiny. It was here that the revolt in Awadh region started in 1857. Musa Bagh was occupied by 7th regiment of Oudh Irregular Infantry (British army) which had majority of native Indian soldiers. Adjutant of the regiment was Lt. Mecham of Madras army. On 30th April 1857, the soldiers refused to use the cartridges fearing that these were new beef & cow lard laden cartridges (the cover of cartridges was supposedly made out of lard from Beef and Pig which had to be chewed off). Lt. Mecham was able to pacify the soldiers informing that these were the same cartridges which they had used last fortnight. The soldiers proceeded with their practice. But Lt. Mecham was met with the same resistance next day, the soldiers were adamant and didn’t relent. By the 3rd of May 1857, the soldiers had decided to kill the Europeans in the regiment. Somehow this was avoided, the soldiers or the sepoys returned to their lines but refused to surrender their arms. They were paraded and subdued in complying.Sir Henry Lawrence, the chief commissioner of Oudh didn’t take the mutiny lightly. He marched to Musa Bagh (from the main city) with a force consisting of 32 foot European Battery, 32 regular native regiment infantry and 1 cavalry. The 7th regiment was rounded up and asked to lay down their arms, under force and fear they complied. The next day their leaders were captured who informed Sir Lawrence of the plans of General Uprising. They were hanged in-front of the regiment.The mutiny though curbed for the moments had left some sparks which in the coming months led to major events in the region and Lucknow. The scene of action moved from Musa Bagh to other places in the city and it was not until 1858 when it returned back.Interestingly it was at Musa Bagh where the insurrection ended in the year 1858 (almost a year later) in March. Begum Hazrat Mahal (the queen or the wife of Nawab Wazid Ali Shah) and his son Birjis Qadr along with many revolutionaries (according to records around 7000-9000 in numbers) made Musa Bagh as their headquarters in their resistance against the British army after being driven out from Kaiser Bagh Palace. The revolt was coming to an end in Oudh with British army gaining over and recapturing many areas in Lucknow. Sir Colin Campbell, Commander-in-Chief of British Army in India, ordered the commissioner of Oudh, Lt. General James Outram to capture Musa Bagh. On March 19, 1858, Outram marched towards Musa Bagh with 2 squadrons of the 9th Lancers, 1 company Royal Artillery, 1 company native sappers, Middleton’s Field Battery, 2 18-pounders, 2 8-inch howitzers, 4 S-inch mortars (all under Captain Carleton, R.A), 3 companies of 20th Regiment, 7 companies of 23rd Regiment, the 79th Highlanders, and the 2nd Punjab Infantry. He was supported by Hope Grant’s guns and musketry fire from the opposite side of the river.The complex was badly damaged by the British Army. The rebels either fled or were killed. The Queen and her son fled to Terai area and later to Nepal. Other important revolutionary leader Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah also fled (it was much later he was recaptured and hanged). The revolutionaries or rebels who were caught were hanged – Musa Bagh became the mass hanging area. So in a way the circle was complete – the revolt ended from where it had started.Once a thriving place, a classic piece of Indo-European architecture, is today in complete ruins. Thanks to the neglect by the authorities and complete disregard of its historic importance by the locals. The complex is being used by villagers and locals in the vicinity as open defecation area– we had to step carefully as there was human feaces  all around. We could also see broken syringes lying around – probably this place has become a favourite haunt for drug addicts. A gentleman walked in and started following us while we were exploring, on questioning him who he was he informed that he was the caretaker appointed by the ASI. On further probing he showed his helplessness in doing anything to stop open defecation in the complex.This place has lot of heritage value, has a beautiful architectural history. It needs immediate attention and awareness of its plight. If nothing is done soon, this hidden gem would soon be lost in the rubbles of time; and like many other places only pictures would remain to tell its story.Definitely worth a visit, not once but many times."

Nawabganj_Wildlife_Sanctuary,Shrikant S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,More of a picnic spot than nature sanctuary,"We went on a sunday afternoon. It came as no surprise that the place was managed poorly with officious forest officials giving tickets and asking for IDs and mobile phone numbers. Why a mobile phone number is required is beyond me!Inside the park, there were large groups of young students who had come for afternoon picnic, and with no interest in birds. So they were making ruckus, and disturbing the natural fauna. Interestingly, unlike other bird sanctuary which I have visited, there were no official guides who could spot and identify birds. It is up to the traveller to explore the pathways fully, and take pot luck at bird watching. I think that the best time would be to go there in the morning - 8ish, and spend the morning there. This would ensure that there are less picnickers and more nature lovers around.Also, the fee for taking a still camera is INR500 and gate ticket is INR 30. Swapping these rates around would also ensure that less number of picnickers enter the park, which would help in the overall maintenance and preservation. I guess that is the call the Forest Department will have to take."

Only change noticed is the nice walkway bordering, maybe, one side of the lake. Though no migratory birds were visible, could be due to the freezing conditions, the lake was in rather poor condition and full of weeds. Also one has to face the menace of the monkeys if not careful of their food items.Inspite of all this a large number of people had turned up both from Lucknow and Kanpur.There's a restaurant and a children's park , so one can enjoy with family.Entry fees is ₹ 30/- per head."

Only pleasant thing was the  relaxed walk around the lake which definitely will take a very long time if we need to move to all places ( I had to cut short at many places due to no birds or a simply dryland there). A walk into the woody cover gave a sight of a few more birds hid in the trees.  It is better if we ask the office people or anybody who had been there before going there as it will be these people who will be able to tell us the avian visitor crowd."

Advice for travelers from other cities/country - localities don't go there since mostly love birds are involved there into obscene acts.Park is huge for playing and relaxing.You may not be able to see a croco there but surely you will spot on love birds involved in obscene activities.PS- no pun intended.!!

After paying 60 Inr each, we followed the colored zoo signs 1 km east to this museum.  The ticket office opened at 10:40 AM where we paid 50 Inr each before walking to the main hall built in 1963. The 1st floor Egyptian Room with its glass cased 1000 BC Mummy was the best exhibit. Then we climbed 3 1/2 sets of stairs to view the other rooms dedicated to archaeological antiquities, Buddha's dioramas, guns and swords, ancient coinage, Buddhist Thankas, 18th-19th C paintings, and natural animals.  Most of the displays show their age with difficult lighting, lack of English descriptions/dates, and overall a semi clean facility.  But it was Tuesday morning and the litter was being swept down the stairwells and the red spittle was being removed from the corners. For a brighter sight, we took an Uber  3 km east to La Martiniere College to see the beautiful ""Constantia"" Palace, noted as the best preserved colonial (1790's) building in Lucknow."

It is one of the oldest and largest multipurpose museum located in the state of Uttar Pradesh.Initially, it only had a collection of Awadh arts and contemporary Awadh objects. But later on, the collection was expanded to many antiquities exhumed from nearby places. Many of them are particularly from the place where the Lord Buddha grew up.

The museum is old, but extremely neatand clean, and well-maintained. We had a short visit to the placeon Sunday, 20 September, 2015. The place is spread over quite afew floors, and has a large number of exhibits of India's historyand culture, to natural history. The historical artifacts rangefrom Harappan era seals, to famous statues and statuettes(especially of the Buddhist era), and also, historicalphotographs of Lucknow! Junior found the Natural History sectionquite exciting, with stuffed animals in very realistic settings.Another curiosity is a Tu-124V aircraft parked right outside themuseum, a VIP transport aircraft, which is preserved there.This has quite a lot of attraction for aviation buffs, since this isone of the two Tu-124V planes of the Indian Air Force, and one of the veryfew actually built in the former Soviet Union."

State_Museum,sandy c,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Solo,Pay twice to kill a little time.,"Yes- first you must pay to get into the zoo, then again to enter the museum.  If you're a foreigner you'll pay higher prices both times.Anyhow, this dusty old building has a half-interesting collection.  Not much info and looking at the state of things here, that ain't going to change.Lot's of Buddhist and Hindu stuff here, but you'd really have to be an enthusiast to know what's what.  For some reason the applied arts section consists of knives and machine guns.There is a really dumbed down history of the Buddha diorama, I guess directed at kids.Most of the building seems abandoned.  You could kill a little time here, but don't expect enlightenment."

Regional_Science_City,Inspired_by_Xperiences,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Good place to visit for kids,"This place displays some of the science experiments that students read in their books but most never get a chance to see them as a working model or even try it themselves. This place holds a special place in my memories. As kids, we used to love going to the science centre and enjoy all the experiments and tools at display. I visited this place after a long time to relive my childhood memories and also introduce my 6 years old daughter to the same. While this place still holds the same charm as it used to a couple a decades back, many of the installation are in bad state or not working. One added attraction is the kids area which houses a small play area for smaller kids. Overall felt good going back and my daughter enjoyed the trip too, but would have definitely loved if things were in a better state. With all the technology and plethora of information that today's generation has access to on tips of a finger, this place may seem dated..but still holds the attention of all its visitors. A must visit for all kids. "

A good place to sit and have a conversation perhaps, but it's located at a major intersection so pretty noisy. There is a largish arched doorway - inside of which construction is stored.

You may visit them with family or friends at any time of the day or year. Even if you had been an ardent fan of Sherlock Holmes you would still need all your intellect and imagination to succeed in the journey.  There are clues concealed with supreme acumen and hints drop by.  A knowledge of law and love for books would come handy.  So pull up your skills and take the challenge.  The more people are in the group the more one would enjoy. So all the best and have an enjoyable and mesmerizing experience

Mystery_Rooms,shagunagarwal12,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Over expensive,Experience was good but it was overpriced .Not worth spending 4000 for a game with 5 friends. Although I played 2 games back to back so I enjoyed the game but yes it was overpriced.Price should be of a kind that everyone can enjoy the game .And I think it was just because of overprice i found d place completely vaccant.It was just 5 of us who played.Rest is companys choice

Mystery_Rooms,GodDevil_14,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Strange but interesting,It was a good experience as far as the story and theme goes as well as the hints but the only issue that I face while solving the mystery was that the hints provided were not matching with the place where those hints were to be utilised. It was more like a guess game for the first room as most of the things were solved on the basis of instincts.

Mystery_Rooms,pl_321789,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021 • Family,Mysteryrooms@Lko,The themes need to be rethinked and renamed in accordance to the experience being provided and not just to attract people. The staff need not be inherently rude and should be helpful and guiding. Also the time allotted and ticket pricing for mystery room should be synchronous to the level of the room. Waiting area for the room was good but ambience should be bettered.

The games were totally brainstorming fun activities that made us think about the situation and solve them together. Me and my best friends really had a great time together. And I suggest you all to just give this place some time so that you can experience the same too.✌🏻✌🏻"
Mystery_Rooms,vrantikashukla,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021,The cabin in the woods,The experience was good but i just have one suggestion it’s good the way you people design the game but i guess you can make the game more interesting by creating more real life experience that is try to play with psychology of the players rather than the difficulty level of solving the codes it would be more exciting and more of fun

The memorial stands one kilometer from Kakori railway station, where Ashfaqullah Khan, Chandrasekhar Azad, and Ramprasad Bismil stopped the train moving towards Lucknow carrying government treasury. The place is a great picnic spot and a good day activity with family on a fair weather. I was kinda surprised to not find this iconic place on TA and hence glad to get it listed and write the first review :). Hope this place gets more and more attention and uplift through TA. Cheers."

Place is too big and many people are unaware about this location. The day we went some school trip was also there probably promotion for future......Since so many slides are there I feel it was difficult for them to manage as many of the slides didn't have water supple so could not be used. Some of the places tiles were broken. All in all I didn't enjoy the water park much. This place also has an amusement park which starts from 1600. This was good. There was a puppet show and rajasthani folk dance and swings were amazing wrt all ages.We had taken up rooms and rooms were decent but seems no one uses them. Food that was served during the lunch, the buffet, was below average. Dinner we ordered separately and that was also not that good. Snacks were tooooo oily.But yes one can plan for a day trip and that is enough for this place. Night time leaving the premises is risky as it's about 2 to 3 kms to reach the highway and you have to pass through the local village. So if you are alone dont think of departing in night."

'Oud Badastur' with its animalic, musky, woody oud tonality  took me back to the Khaleej-the Gulf States with their quaint old alleyways, the Bedoiun serenades and the old dhows sailing gently across Dubai Creek.While the warming and energetic 'Hina' and 'Musk Amber' resurrect the Nawabs of old, oud innovations like 'Mukhallat' , 'Hasrat e Oudh' and 'Jashn e Oudh' to name a few, make magic with musk, pour passion into patchouli and awe me with amber.A refreshing dab of 'Yaquet' or for instance, 'Nafasat' on the back of your hand would rejuvinate you with not just the amazing sillage of enchanting notes but even the longevity on skin or on fabric. PS-Do not miss the drydowns of any of these scents! There is invariably, always a little surprise awaiting you there! A certain note that emerges out of the blue as you exclaim 'wah! kya baat hai'!Mr.Vishwas Vijayvergiya, the knowledgeable and friendly upholder of this renowned tradition enlightened me about each of his masterpieces in thorough detail."
