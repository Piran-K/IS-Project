Aarey_Colony,Rohan C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Amazing Aarey,"Beautiful forest in Suburbs of Mumbai extending from Central Suburbs (Powai) till Western Suburbs (Goregaon). Nice place for a nature trail, morning jog, cool drive or a simple walk. Aarey with wide diversity of birds, mammals, reptiles including Leopards along with flora & Fauna never fails to mesmerise anyone who just passes through it.Worth a visit. You will fall in love with this place."
Aarey_Colony,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Green lung of Mumbai, but lacking in facilities","The Aarey Colony in Mumbai has been in the news recently, owing to some land within this colony being acquired by the government to build a shed for the Mumbai Metro. I decided to pay a visit to the place to see it, just in time maybe!The colony is undoubtedly a very green area, rich in various kinds of flora. Most residents here are tribes, who live in small colonies and carry on with their lives as before. A couple of roads pass through the colony, but seeing the greenery and the rural setting here, one can easily forget that they are in the midst of one of the most densely populated cities in the world!The colony has a small lake for boating, called as Chhota Kashmir and has some good views of nearby hills too. That said, facilities for visitors are very few and not well-maintained. A public park at one end of the colony wasn't in good shape and the same could be said about the mini-amusement park at the lake's entrance. There were no restrooms and it seems to be a victim of apathy from the powers that be.It is important that the colony is spruced up and people get the chance to enjoy the natural environment and fresh air, without any discomfort. One can spend around 2 hours here."
Aarey_Colony,VijayDubai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Greenest Place in Mumbai,"Aarey Colony is the greenest place in Mumbai. One will really get thrilled with lush green surroundings, clean air and peaceful environment here. During the rainy season this place becomes even more beautiful. I have visited this place with my friends one or tow times. There is a good restaurant at the top, which serves mouthwatering food. Government should preserve Aarey Colony should declare it forest land, so that the beautiful Eco-system of this place can be maintained. "
Aarey_Colony,ashwin k,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,"Was better before, not nothing much",This place was nice at one time where people would come for their picnic. However now this place has become boring and dirty.

Aarey_Colony,sijick,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Business,Nature losing to modernisation,"I grew up near Marol, which is close to Aarey Colony. We used to visit the Picnic spot, still existing now as well. It was one of the few big parks; but now there are other options with BMC taking care of many parks in Mumbai. Aarey colony is going to house the metro shed, and is losing some greenery. The roads have been maintained well thanks to the government, but narrow, because of there is traffic queueing in busy times. There is greenery all around here, one feels very nice to drive. Film city is closeby."
Aarey_Colony,prannnn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Lush Green part of Mumbai,"This is a prominent place in Mumbai well known for its lush green ambiance, diversity in terms of plant species, flora and fauna and very popular among the locals as this is home for lots of cattle's which are used for mass milk production. unfortunately, over the last few years illegal encroachments and buildings have started making inroads into this vast green space causing the space to shrink and also affect the diverse vegetation which you would find it difficult to see in a city like Mumbai. Fortunately, there are a few like minded folks who are trying their best to restrain this kind of illegal encroachment. As far the place is concerned, the best place to visit would be during morning hours and one has to pay a nominal fees entry. there is one road which goes along the colony which connects the central part of Mumbai to the western part. inside the colony, you can get a glimpse of parks, lakes and milk colonies with a good ambiance of peace, serene and clam atmosphere. in fact the air within the surrounding is much more cleaner and fresher when you compare to the heavily polluted and crowded city. Hopefully, the authorities including BMC would be able to maintain this clean part of the city for future. in case you happen to be in Mumbai and want to get out of the traffic/pollution then this would be the best place to pay a visit with your family and friends. in fact if you happen to go from central to western Mumbai this would be one of the routes that you will have to take ( you might have to pay toll amount)."
Aarey_Colony,Gautam Pendharkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Green Lung of Mumbai,"The greenest part of Mumbai, which should be conserved for future generations and also for the survival of Mumbai.

Aarey_Colony,Pinkesh J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Business,"Greenest patch of Mumbai, yet most ignored","Aarey colony is rightfully called the lungs of Mumbai. it's lush green due to the fact that most part of it is declared as forest area, which means there can be restricted construction activities in this area.

Aarey_Colony,DheemantShetty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Lungs of Mumbai,"Being born and raised in Mumbai, I have been a visitor to Aarey colony for over 35 years now. This expansive, untouched forest land, bang in the middle of this bustling city, is a getaway for many, even for a few minutes. You can instantly feel like you are in a hill-station. As soon as you enter Aarey, the temperature drops quite a bit, Air is cleaner and makes you feel fresh. You can just drive inside absorbing the peace and calm or sit down for some snacks at the two eateries inside. You can visit the Chota Kashmir Garden or enjoy boating at the lake inside. At the Powai exit of Aarey colony you can enjoy having the fresh and delicious Aarey lassi. They even sell pure ghee there at very reasonable prices."
Aarey_Colony,Shivli,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Friends,A walk in the Forest!!,"Born and brought up in Mumbai, but still did not even know of the Aarey forest, bang in the middle of the city. Such a wonderful way to spend my Sunday. Breaking out of my comfort zone. Yes, its an investment of about 7-8 hours if you stay in the south of Mumbai, but you come back feeling charged.I got to know about the 'Aarey Forest Festival' (please look them up on facebook) organised by WWH (We Will Help charitable foundation) and decided to spend my Sunday with them. We were about a 100 of us gathered at the Picnic Spot at 10am. We trecked our way through the forest to see an ancient temple, the small scale farming done by the Warli tribes that inhabit the forest and also ended the trek with a lunch cooked by them. (Please do check on the option of lunch being included, as apparently they have a different event every week)  It was a wonderful experience. Also bought produce straight out of their farms including some artifacts made by them.Would definitely recommend this for nature lovers, for parents and kids to bond, for awareness of what Mumbai has to offer."

Do not take the main road but get onto the road going to New Zealand Hostel and go walking or on a cycle. There are cow sheds on the way and you dont feel as if you are still in Mumbai. Nice place away from the maddening crowd of the city. You also have the option of boating near Observation post garden (thats on the main road connecting Goregaon and Powai or Marol).
Aarey_Colony,Sudhanshu Shekhar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Our near by attraction,Aarey Colony is one of the extended part of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park.

Aarey_Colony,Rajeev_Vri,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,Aarey: The green spot in Mumbai,"Mumbai is lucky to have Aarey colony a green patch in the busy city. Aarey milk colony is in area surrounded between Marol, Goregaon and Powai and Vihar lakes. Aarey is home to film city. Aarey is a milk distribution company which sells milk under brand name Aarey. This big green patch is owned by them.When in Aarey you will feel you are not in Mumbai. Suddenly as if one is transported to a lovely country side. With exception to lake city towers you will feel surrounded by nature. There are many important film studios in this area. The cluster of film city is a major tourist attraction. Visit Aarey for film city. I have stayed in Marol in past. Then I use to have long weekend morning walks in this area. Aarey is ideal for day picnic. Don't rely on public transport to reach here. There are few bus options. With you own vehicle one can explore this city forest better.Don't stay in evening when it gets darker. It could be risky."
Aarey_Colony,chi00012,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Garbage all over the place in aarey,"I am a resident of mumbai.went to Aarey milk colony.there is nothing else but dirt every. There is a huge garden called aarey picnic point. But nothing can be worst and dirty place than that , and the government talks about swatch bharat . The aarey lake which could be converted as a beautiful tourist attraction again is dirty with poor quality boats. I think there is an urgent requirement for narendra Modiji's government to look into the matter and convert aarey colony as the paradise for Mumbaikars ."
Aarey_Colony,Alok S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Solo,One of the very few open spaces left in the city,"This is large open space forest area luckily untouched much by the   mankind so far.

Overall a must visit once with children."
Aarey_Colony,Avinash,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Green lungs of the city,"Along with Sanjay Gandhi national park, this place can be considered as the green lungs of the city.

There is a road passing through Aarey colony that connects Goregaon with Powai.There is Chhota Kashmir lake that has boating facility, a few rides for kids and some Street food stalls. It has got sufficient parking space near by."
Aarey_Colony,RAMESH K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016,Nature's paradise in the heart of Mumbai's western suburbs,"A walk in the Aarey Colony gives you the feeling of trekking in the woods. At day break a visit to Aarey Colony is an exhilarating experience. As we approach another day and at dawn the sky turns a translucent shade of grey, the chirping of the birds and the melodious call of the cuckoo in summer months lift the spirits. The eastern sky is slowly lit up and the sun rises from behind the clouds to give you that feeling of heavenly bliss! At this time of the year the Gulmohar trees are in full bloom in Aarey Colony. They are also called as flame of the forest and look glorious & majestic. The trees laden with crimson / red flowers put up a spectacular show and a walk through an avenue of Gulmohar trees is a feast for the eyes !!"
Aarey_Colony,musafir_nonstop,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Couples,Greenery...,This is probably the only place in mumbai where you will find so much of greenery on both the sides.. It is the shortest route if one wants to go to powai from western express highway.. But people try to avoid this route after evening hours as it is not properly maintained.. Although its good for picnics but needs maintainence..
Aarey_Colony,savio_pinto12,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Solo,Aarey colony ,"The Aarey colony can also be considered as a jogging track. Aarey Colony route can be challenging to run because of the steep climb and the fact that it includes longer stretches for distance runs along the greenery. However, this place has almost no traffic, almost zero pollution and disturbance in the mornings, giving you the feeling of running amidst nature.It is advisable to  go with someone who is familiar with the route, as there are chances of getting lost, with no sign boards anywhereThe rustic and lush green environment here is sure to keep you coming back again and again"

Aarey_Colony,Sachin0408,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,The Good The Bad & The Ugly,Aarey Colony is perhaps the only landmark int he concrete jungle of Mumbai where you see greenery on both sides of the road. This is often known as the reserved forest area and some even say that its connected to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park at Borivili. The good thing about this place is its greenery. Al around. Wildlife encountered every now and then and its unspoiled charm during day time. The bad thing about Aarey colony is the fact that the BMC has turned its blind eye to its maintenance and every second day you hear of corporates lobbying to ravage it down and construct something else or the other. The ugliest part is that the elected government has done nothing to maintain the lung of the city and ignores it on any given day.

Aarey_Colony,Mayuresh K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Friends,Real jungle amidst concrete jungle,"Any newcomer to Mumbai will not believe that there is a real jungle in Mumbai which still has wildlife in it. Aarey colony is one such place which is like a oasis. Though the jungle is getting encroached upon day-by-day as we speak, its still one of the most calming places in Mumbai. Some kids gardens & lakes are a part which are frequented by tourists & regulars. However, if you know the forest officer or some local, a walk / drive into the interiors is a killer.Beware of leopards as they are found in plenty over here & a few of them have become man-eaters over the period. Venturing out during night times is avoidable"

Trees on both sides and the fresh air just makes you feel relaxed and refreshing. You do have restaurants in this area and it is very famous for film shootings.Visiting during monsoon is the best however you could also visit during any day/time however it is best to visit during afternoons since there is heavy vehicular traffic during morning/evenings.

Aarey_Colony,mohitagarwl,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,Drive through the Nature,"Aarey Colony is full of trees and is a part of the forest area infact. A drive through Aarey Colony makes one feel very good. Trees on both sides of the road and dense forest makes driving a pleasure. During the rains one can see water coming on road and also some small waterfalls can be seen from the road itselfAlso there are some haunted stories about this place, so avoid it at late night :)"
