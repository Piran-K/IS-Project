We were 4 people, but negotiated with a auto driver to take all 4 of us in a single auto. he charged only 100 rs which is quite reasonable as per the distance. But varsova jetty to aksa beach, all area belongs to fishing village, so it stinks. So if you can not take the smell of dried fish, you should take a ac cab and drop at right front of the beach."

Juhu Beach (Juhu, Vile Parle West)3. Aksa Beach (Malad West)4. Gorai Beach (Borivali West)If you want a quieter, unspoiled beach, which is easily accessible by road, away from all traffic and the cacophony of the city of Mumbai, visit Aksa Beach.Since it has a strategic Indian Navy station nearby, it is saved from turning into a concrete jungle.But do not venture deep into this beach as it has very complex cross-currents which makes it very, very risky for swimmers.Do not stay till late on the beach. Preferably leave as the sun sets.Do not miss genuine piping-hot Vada-Pav and Kaanda Bhaji (onion pakodas) at the cart of Shilpa Tai and Mukesh Bhau (Shilpa Patil/Mukesh Patil). Call them on +91 970 222 9645.Advice for all non-Mumbaikars. Do not behave like in Goa at any of the Mumbai beaches. The Mumbai Police and the lifeguards are quite strict with those creating nuisance. So avoid carrying liquor and unabashed 'bird-watching'. It will not be tolerated by the Mumbaikars, cops, hawkers and the locals."

Aksa_Beach,Sai C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,The cleanest beach of Mumbai,Aksa Beach is one of the most underrated beaches in Mumbai due its location far away from the sub-urbs. It is is a long journey from Goregaon railway station an auto or a Uber would be preferable. The beach is one of the cleanest beaches in Mumbai and less crowded one. I along with my friends played cricket there. The rocks and the waves are picturesque and a must see. You must definitely try the Ice-gola there.
Aksa_Beach,Abir B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,near yet away from the concrete jungle,"As you move out of Malad , the concrete jungle suddenly gives way to vastness and serene environment .. the honking of cars are transformed to the chirping of birds and hissing sound of the wind and finally the sound of waves as they hit the Aksa beach ... a much better value for money than the crowded , populated and noisy Juhu beach.. the beach is clean , so are the waters... is surely has to be in the Mumbai tourist map..."
Aksa_Beach,SunilW,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Extremely dirty beach,It was a horrific visit we had to this beach. The sea was constantly throwing out plastic wastes which was a terrible sight. This beach surely needs immediate attention by authorities
Aksa_Beach,ravi_j_shah,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Cleaner and quieter (compared to other Mumbai beaches),"A clean and quiet beach compared to most other Mumbai beaches. A small one too.It's inside from the main Mumbai localities. Getting there is not really a problem, but if you choose to leave from there in rush hours, cabs, autos may be limited.Very limited food options compared to Juhu/Girgaon beach."

Good to take a walk or just sit down and enjoy the mesmerising view of the sunset . Less crowded as compared to Juhu beach . Cleanliness of the beach should be improved by the authorities . 
Aksa_Beach,ashwin k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Friends,Nice for playing,If you wish to play cricket or football with your group without much interruption then this place would be one of it. But do take your eating stuff with you as not many options are available there
