Ambreshwar_Shiva_Temple,BantakalDotCom,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Day Trip in Mumbai 11th-century Hindu temple,"Built-in 1060 AD temple also called as Ambreshwar Shiva Temple, and known locally as Puratana Shivalaya.Temple is beautifully carved in stone. Unusually, garbhagriha ( innermost sanctum) is below ground, reached by around 20 steps down which makes this temple unique.If you are in Mumbai and if you like ancient temples, stone artwork, this place is must visit. Just take any train from  Mumbai CST or from Dadar to Ambernath. From Ambernath Eastside, you can walk straight 2.3km to the temple or there are sharing tuk-tuk to temple. You can ask any local as ""Shiv Mandir"". On Monday early in the morning and evening, it will be bit crowded. Other days almost empty. Once in a year, on Shivaratri festival, it will be super crowded! There is no entry fee."

Amazing, beautiful small temple will take your breath away ! We drove through dusty, bumpy high traffic road and suddenly we could see this place, so beautiful even from far away !  I have been planning  to visit this place for the last 10-12 years but some how Could not come ! At last I was fortunate to see this gem ! This temple was built in 10th century ! Beautifully carved in stone, looked like stone had blackish brown/red tinge ! Some stories about this temple that it was built by Pandavas overnight when they are in exile ! The temple was not completely finished before they had to move ! The main sanctum was few steps below the ground  where there is a Shivling ! This is one of the only still functional ancient temples still has daily Pooja’s and rituals are done ! This gem is worth many trips !, I would love to visit this place again ! Hope this place is preserved for our future generations to see !  The premises of the temple is kept very clean !"

Ambreshwar_Shiva_Temple,RachanaR18,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Ancient Shiva temple located in Ambernath,"Generally a very scenic and peaceful temple, this is a nice place for religious people as well as architecture lovers. There is a small stream that flows along side the temple too, making it more beautiful especially during rains. Try to avoid important festivals like Shravan Somvar or Shivratri for visit, otherwise it can be very crowded."
Ambreshwar_Shiva_Temple,yogesh k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Solo,"Hemadpanti Style Shiv mandir, Ambarnath","Ambarnath is place where I was born and brought up. From childhood I visited this place many time with my friends / family.  Temple is only 2 KM away from Ambarnath (East) Railway Station.The name ""AMBARNATH"" is because of this Ambreshwar temple only. Temple Famous for Richly carved and decorated out of a single black stone, the intricate carvings are inspired from Hemadpanti style of architecture. The ancient Ambreshwar Shiva Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, the construction of which dates back to 1060 AD in the 10th century, located by the bank of Vadavan river surrounded by a fenced wall. There are two popular beliefs of the local peoples here. One belief suggests that the temple was constructed by the Pandava brothers of the epic Mahabharata for taking a night refuge during their period of vanvaas.  They could not complete the structure which is reflected even today in the missing roof directly above the main sanctum area (Gabhara) of the temple. There is another belief that this temple was constructed by Shilahara king, Chittaraja and later rebuilt by his son, Mummuni.After entering the temple, need to get down a few steps in the main room called Gabhara to have glimpse of the Lord Shiva. There is one Shivalinga at the centre of Gabhara.The best thing I like about this temple is its never crowded, and not commercialized yet. People get enough time for darshan and get blessings from Bholenath. Only at Maha Shivratri temple is overcrowded. There is Big Fair on Maha Shivratri. On this day more than 4-5 lakh people visit the temple to seek blessings from lord Shiva. Maha shivratri Fair continues for 3-4 days starting 2 days prior and extending to 1 day after shivratri as well. Temple is additionally crowded on all Mondays of Shravan, Month of Hindu Calendar. Definitely worth a visit and easily accessible by train from Mumbai. Visit this temple if you ever been to Ambarnath.Getting There and Distance: How to reach Ambarnath By road, its a one and half hour drive. Temple is located about 2 km from Ambarnath Railway Station (East). From Mumbai, It is better to go to Ambarnath (which is on the central line) by train and then take an auto-rickshaw (share rickshaws which go to Ulhasnagar @10 rupees)."

Ambreshwar_Shiva_Temple,Gopal Lahiri,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Couples,Beautiful stone curved temple,"This beautiful Shiva temple was built in 1060 AD. The stone-curving on the wall is awesome and the architecture is superb. Close to the Ambarnath station, the temple is well connected from Mumbai. We went there recently and even it was a very hot day, we still enjoyed the ambiance of the temple. After entering the temple, we down a few steps to have glimpse of the Lord Shiva. The main room was well maintained. We were told that food was given to the poor people everyday by the temple authorities based on donations. This is a really laudable effort. It is always crowded during Shiva Ratri festival. Overall, a rich experience and a must visit for the temple and art lovers."

Ambreshwar_Shiva_Temple,Santosh-N-Thorat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Family,Shiv Mandir of Ambarnath - Worth a Visit.,"Ambarnath is my native place. So, its obvious that I will write positive about this temple. The name ""AMBARNATH"" is because of this Ambreshwar temple only. Ambreshwar Shiv mandir is over 1000 years old.    From childhood I always love to visit this temple with my family. Temple is only 2 KM away from Ambarnath Railway Station. This temple is ""HEMADPANTI"" that means build with interlocking of stones. People say the Shiv ling inside is ""SWAYAMBHU"" that means self-manifested. People believe that temple was built by Pandavas in just a night. Whereas on some sites its mentioned that shilahara King Chhittaraja constructed it and his son Mummuni rebuilt it. The temple is on the bank of Vadavan (Waldhuni) river.      The best thing I like about this temple is its never crowded. People get enough time for darshan and get blessings from Bholenath. Only at Maha Shivratri temple is overcrowded. There is Big Fair on Maha Shivratri. On this day more than 4-5 lakh people visit the temple to seek blessings from Devon ke Dev Mahadev. Temple is additionally crowded on all Mondays of Shravan[Month of Hindu Calender] month. Visit this temple if you ever been to Ambarnath."
Ambreshwar_Shiva_Temple,ovcsridhar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Family,"Nice temple with very intricate carvings, in desperate need for maintenance","This 11th century Shiva temple has some exquisite stone carvings, the theme is mostly dance and art. You can spend lot of time admiring the intricate carvings and sculptures. Definitely worth a visit and easily accessible by train from Mumbai. By road, its a one and half hour drive. The only worrying thing about this place is that it is in a sheer state of neglect (this despite the fact that ASI has identified this as a protected monument) Several structures have suffered serious damage. Would love to get together with like minded people for some serious efforts to preserve this place."
Ambreshwar_Shiva_Temple,Shailesh L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Great ancient temple,"I've been visiting this temple for past 20 years and I always got a feeling of a non-commercialized ancient temple. Not much rush even on a Monday at the Shiva temple, which was great and gave us ample time for Darshan. The temple surrounding is clean and now they have additional security for the shoes and keeping away beggars. The only thing I would have liked was little bit more cleanliness inside the temple."
