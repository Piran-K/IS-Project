Andheri_Market,sijick,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Good prices for street market,You can get excellent products at great prices. Some illegal shop vendors don't allow bargaining - take it or leave it attitude. But street vendors will let you bargain. After you are tired you will get good food as well from some good dosa stalls. Avoid junk food.
