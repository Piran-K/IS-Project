Babulnath_Temple,Anand K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A vibrant Shiva mandir atop a hill..,"Its perched atop a mini hillock. In the past, you would have to climb up a flight of stairs, which of course adds to the experience. Now, they have an elevator, which takes you to the top in less than a minute for less than a rupee. We reached there in the middle of the afternoon on an otherwise warm day. But the temple was super cool, literally. Could be because of the elevation, or the structure, or most likely the divinity. The shiva linga itself is grand. And you can just spend time inside the temple without anyone bothering you. Can enjoy a personal space inside a usually crowded temple. DOnt miss the story of Sri Sundernath baba. I used to believe that the Gods had forsaken the city. So nice to hear of a siddha visiting the place specifically for the temple.... a cute story...The precints are  clean, well maintained - even the restrooms. Can easily spend a couple of hours here..."

Babulnath_Temple,Nilma S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Solo,Shiva Temple,"There is a Shiv linga at this Hindu Temple. The temple is situated at a height and is accesible by a flight of many steps or an elevator. On Monday it is very crowded and several pilgrims visit it. There is a Nandi facing the Shiv linga. Anyone is allowed to perform the pooja- religious rites and any devotee is permitted inside the main temple.. A view of the surrounding area is possible. Offerings of milk, water, flowers and bilva leaves is a norm. There are small temples around of Ganesha, Hanuman. The staircase for access on foot is rather broken and unkept so it maybe advisable to use the elevator."

Babulnath_Temple,Elderly Traveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,A must see ,"This lovely temple is a “must see” especially on a Monday.  You can walk up 50 steps or take an elevator.  Shoes have to be removed and, as there are lots of wet offerings (eg milk) on a Monday, socks can be a nuisance.  Photography is not allowed in the temple.  Make sure someone explains to you what the worshippers are doing!"

Babulnath_Temple,oorja203,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Family,"One of the older temples in Mumbai, but well maintained","I had visited Babulnath during the month of Shravan.  The temple was crowded with devotees who had come to seek the Lord's blessings.  Devotees have to climb stairs to reach the GID.  However, if you are not comfortable with the idea of climbing stairs, you have the option of taking the elevator.  But the charges are very minimal - one rupee per person and it allows you to take the elevator both for going upstairs as well as coming downstairs.  The temple has amazing vibes and you are surrounded by peace and calm in the premises.  A must visit place for every ardent devotee of Lord Shiva."
Babulnath_Temple,vedant,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017 • Solo,Har har mahadev.,"One of the best shiva temples in mumbai, very peacefull , around 300 stairs and auspiciuos temple. Lift also available, but the stairs feels more fun. If you plan to go on shiv ratri, spare around 3 hours for darhsan as its too crowded."

Babulnath_Temple,ManishChiranewal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Couples,Great Darshan,"The temple is on a hillock. It will be difficult for people on wheel chairs. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva.The best part of this temple is that you have a lift to go to the temple at the top. A big relief for heavy people like me. The liftman charges a token amount of Re 1 per person and the lift can be used for coming down also.While the temple is well maintained, the approach to the temple is not very pleasing.Inside the temple, you can offer Jal to the shiv ling. They have provision for the same and provide you with Lotas also.You can sit in the temple for sometime.Pandas are not pushy. Overall a good darshan."
