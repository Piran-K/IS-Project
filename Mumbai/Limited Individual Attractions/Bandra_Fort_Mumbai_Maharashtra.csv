Bandra_Fort,Acineto,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,History and Gardens,"Banrda fort can be hard to get to, but I managed to get an uber there and back from Colaba.The area is relatively clean and very nice to walk around. There is a garden which mingles with the remnants of the fort. There is also an access point to the beach area on the rocks. The area near the fort is quite open, and there are people using the area to play. It also has a really nice view of the ocean and the Sealink bridge.The area is free to enter but is gated, and it does close for the night. There is a path that goes under the Sealink, but it seems to still be under construction as it ends as you reach the bridge.The area is nice for photos or just sitting around for a while, especially in the garden area."

Bandra_Fort,prannnn,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Old fort but needs loosing its shine,"This place is located very close to bandstand or Bandra worli sea link and very prominent among the locals. As far as accessing the place is concerned, one can reach here by private as well as public transportation.The nearest railway station (Bandra) is located very close by and there are plenty of options in terms of auto/ bus etc.The fort is built during british era which is based on old style architecture but as far as sightseeing is concerned, the fort isn't that iconic place anymore as the spot is also very small and extremely crowded especially during evening hours. With so many tall buildings and sky scrapers in this part of the city, unfortunately, the fort might be loosing its significance.on the positive side, if you have a passion for photography, then this would be a good place to be especially for taking picturesque photos of Bandra Worli sea link and the twilight along the Arabian ocean.The fort is a public place accessing to the general public for free and the timing starts from morning 7 a.m to 6:30 pm in evening. Hence, if you happen to be in the city, then i would recommend this spot along with a pleasant stroll along Bandstand pavements."

Bandra_Fort,MNLeisureTraveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Busy fort for teens on an Indian holiday,"Although this is also known as Castella de Aguada, Mumbaikars know this as Bandra Fort.  Having to Mumbai many times over the years, I have never visited this place until we wanted to see the Sea-Link.Me and three teen-girls from the US visited on Aug 15 and the place was teeming with other teens and many young lovers.  The dilapidated location is right among the sea and rocks with the Mumbai skyline on one side and the Sea Link crossing majestically.Our biggest problem was with selfie-taking teens who were pretending to take their pictures while clicking pics of the American kids.  We had to stop and look at their phones and even deleting pics from trash, what would otherwise have been a nice sight-seeing trip.  Beyond that, the big houses across from the fort, followed by the drive across the Sea-Link was nice.There are lot of food-stalls at the entrance and there is no entrance fees."

Bandra_Fort,Siddhesh Garg,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Portuguese Ruins Lost in Bombay's Chaos,"Who needs a Portuguese time travel machine when you can re-live her history in 2018! A watchtower ruin built in 1640, the architectural ruin gives a macroscopic view of Arabian Sea and Bay of Mahim. Historically a place that gave easy access to fresh water, Bandra Fort held strategic importance for cruising ships even after the Marathas took control from Portuguese in 17th century. There are not many forts to survive invasions of multiple kingdoms as much as Bandra Fort which witnessed the British Raj after the First Anglo-Maratha War.As much as the rich history takes you to some era, the present siutation is anything but a ruin. Demolished by the 1993 serial blasts, you can find the built garden dotted with love-birds everywhere. An amphitheatre is added to give more character to the urban wreck and you can catch plays, fashion shows occasionally. The tourist attraction, Bandra's pride at one point is now reduced to a love-making attraction. There is nothing to soak in except the humility which the mammoth Sea Link offers you- harmony against the urban chaos. Save for the occassional soft drink sellers, there is not much to absorb and much to exclaim- Oh Bombay!Best time to explore (not much to do honestly) is during sunset. The Bombay sun can be scorching so afternoons are not a good time to visit. I would suggest to give this tourist attraction a low priority unless you are a die-hard history buff or photo fanatic. - SID"

Bandra_Fort,Tapan ROY SARKAR,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,Poorly maintained,This fort is nothing but at a wall and a staircase. It has probably lost its old world charm because of renovations. It is poorly maintained and stinking. Nothing much to do there. The beach is rocky and dirty. However you will get an excellent view of the Bandra-worli sea link.

Sit on the edge of bandra fort and enjoy the horizon, the infinity view where sea and sky meets. This whole thing calms you down and you feel freshed. On the other side watch the famous ""Bandra-Worli Sea Link"". A good infrastructure to watch for. Its good for couples too. Good place to be romantic."

Bandra_Fort,Nitin A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Couples,The most Romantic destination in Mumbai,"Let me share with you all the best place of Mumbai and yes, it is indeed the best place you can in Mumbai. Best time to visit the place in September. You can only imagine the romantic scenes like this when it's raining (light showers), time is around 6 when there is a sunset and you are sitting there on the rocks holding your partner's hand in your hands and trust me, you can spend hours sitting there and admiring the scene. You get to see small boats far in the sea. Suggestion, if you want to go on a romantic date with your partner, Bandstand Bandra is a place that you can't miss. "

Its clean, great ambience, sea side and bandra worli link is visible. Its good but PDA is much more than expected. Ignore and enjoy the location. Icing on the cake is Rekha (Basera), Shahrukh (Mannat), Salman (Galaxy) house nearby."

Bandra_Fort,Shah_Ankit26,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,More like lover's point than Historical place,"Bandra fort is at the dead end of Bandra. It is old Portugese fort but now ruins are left. But it gives beautiful view of the sea. The place is developed by Bandra Resident Assosiation. They also maintained garden next to fort. However garden has become more like lover's point. You will find many couple in compromising situation even in day's time, making strict no for family with young children."
