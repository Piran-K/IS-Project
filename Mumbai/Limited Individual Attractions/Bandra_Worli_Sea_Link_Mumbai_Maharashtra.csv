Bandra_Worli_Sea_Link,Asad Khan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 â€¢ Family,Fantastic but Expensive,A much-needed bridge that reduces the travel time between Bandra and Worli significantly while giving the megacity a revamped look to show-off and be proud of. The driving experience on the bridge always feels good and luckily it has been maintained unlike the rest of the city. The unfortunate thing is that it charges travellers toll even when the citizens have paid ample of road tax and because the toll charge is expensive and continues to increase a lot of people don't access the bridge and so doesn't fulfil the objective of its construction.

Bandra_Worli_Sea_Link,Sagar M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 â€¢ Couples,Smooth and scenic. Expensive though.,"State of the art bridge with smooth, well marked roads and vehicles observing lane discipline. Drastically reduces time to go from Worli to Bandra. In effect, does the job it was meant to do.The views are scenic, but be careful if you are driving. Don't get distracted. Speeding is not common so its relatively safe. Prices are steep though. Monthly pass is surprisingly more expensive than monthly sum of daily toll. However, high prices keep out traffic and what you get is a fast, smooth, safe and scenic drive. Pro Tip: One fine evening, take your date along, roll down the windows and enjoy the short drive with some great music. Keep your eyes on the road though. The views are for your partner only."

Bandra_Worli_Sea_Link,RKJ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Wonderful experience with great views in Morning or evening time,"The name of Bandra-Worli sea link is Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link and it is a cable bridge that connects Bandra in the west of Mumbai to Worli to the south. Apart from saving the travel time of citizens, it is a perfect example of the brilliant engineering. Here, drive can be taken to experience the beautiful skyline and the majestic sea flowing underneath. Best times are morning or evening, keeping open the window of car. It is easy to reach the link from either side of it. Bandra serves as the nearest bus depot ( 2kms ) and Bandra Railways Station being the nearest railway station (5 km) to the link. From here get any bus, taxi or auto to reach your destination."
