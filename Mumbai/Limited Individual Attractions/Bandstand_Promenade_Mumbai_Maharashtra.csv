Bandstand_Promenade,Sanjiiv Srivastava,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Evening walk at bandstand,"A well cared promenade current being worked upon. Slightly more than a kilometer in length is good place for an outing or a walk. Crowed when it's high tide as people can't wander into the sea to sit by the stones. At times the couples sitting by the stones beyond the promenade are not pleasing to the eye. It's a safe place thru out the day to late at night. People mostly come to enjoy sitting or walking by the sea and equally popular with people who come to exercise and walk the length. Ample place to park, at the Bandra Fort end you have Hotel Taj Landsend and some joints serving snacks, food and tea/coffee/juice. You can at that end walk up to Mount Mary Church. At one end of the promenade you have Salman Khan and at the other Sharukh Khan staying, lots of fan crowd outside there residences.

The Bandstand or the Bandstand Promenade also known as Bandra Bandstand is a 1.2 kilometer long walkway along the sea on the western coast of Mumbai, India. It is claimed to be a popular hangout spot, jogging track and a park. Since we were there at 2am late in the night after our visit to a disc, there was hardly any soul around. And to top it, there were Mumbai police inspectors chasing visitors as it seems illegal to stay at Bandstand at this hour of day. We were there for about an hour and there was a gush of wind blowing from the Arabian Sea. I had hardly ever seen such strong winds on a sea coast. It was great spot to savour the nature. While the overall management of the place left much to be desired, with incomplete works broken chairs and many unfinished agenda, visit Bandstand for the film stars and the wind from the sea and the unfulfilled promises of the city."

My daughter was gaga about seeing the house of Shah Rukh Khan named 'Mannat' which is close by to the Bandstand. It was a rainy afternoon and the sea was rough. The place looked pretty gloomy and dark, as the sky had darkened with rain bearing clouds. As we parked the car the rain gods poured sending the few people on the Promenade rushing for shelter. In a while the complete Promenade was bereft of people and it was just the rough sea, the rain and us. What a sight! Wow cannot think of anything so beautiful in Mumbai. As the rain stopped we stepped out and went for a stroll along the walkway. Bliss!!!! Cannot believe there is such bliss in Mumbai."

Bandstand_Promenade,daipayanc2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Famous Bandstand,Another best place for hang out but not for day time. Anyone can enjoy sea side walk and Bandra Fort (close by 7pm). People gather mainly to view Sharukh's house but it is a famous lover spot you can also view Galaxy Apartment(Salman's house). If you are lucky enough maybe you can see one of them in road also (as per local auto and taxi driver) but I don't know anyone who see them in road.It is similar to Nariman Point but main difference is mostly couples(married and unmarried) are visit here. Mount Merry church is walking distance from here.Mumbai skyline also visible from Bandra Fort but due to sea link it was not visible properly. People mostly come here to relax and passing time with friends and family.
