Banganga,Mahesh Kulkarni,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,"Banganga Tank at Walkeshwar, Mumbai.","Banganga, Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill, Mumbai.Today was Tripurari Purnima Deepotsav. Many organisations including MTDC had organised this function as an event to make the spot popular to attract tourism.Bhagwan Laxman pierced his arrow and Ganga Mai appeared from earth is the folklore of the place and people around worship the place, though few throw their washed waste water in the tank with carelessness.Tripurari Purnima Deepotsav must be propagated on a larger scale and timing must be maintained irrespective of the innumerable VIPs reach on time or not."
Banganga,Sachin K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,Legendary ,"Banganga is located in Walkeshwar in South Mumbai. It is easily accessible by public transportation. There is a legendary history to this tank of water, which dates way back to Ramayana times. The city of Mumbai can certainly do cleaning of the water and restoration of the surrounding area to attract tourists and to make it a major tourist attraction. Would certainly very highly recommend visiting the same to any traveler who is interested in ancient Indian history. "

The entire place is surrounded by temples of various gods like Hanumana,venkatesha.

Banganga,Padmini15,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Believe it or not!,"It is said that on his way to Lanka to rescue Sita, once Ram was very thirsty. When he asked his brother Lakshman for water the latter took out an arrow (ban) and water emerged after it pierced the ground.The water here is sweet even though it's only a few meters from the sea.It is believed that a subterranean tributary of the Ganges flows here and so the water isn't brackish and hence the name  Banganga. It is a must visit place."
Banganga,NissimKrispin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Banganga Tank,"Sometimes you must have some quiet in this chaotic city.A magical retreat you find in the Legend Palace Jain Temple. The temple was originally built more than a thousand years ago for the god of the sand, but the structure that stands there today is from 1715. Beneath the temple is the interesting water tank “Banganga Tank” were believers bathing in, pilgrims who believe that the water broke out from the earth after Rama fired an arrow into the earth from his legendary bow. The reservoir is impressive. The silence is wonderful. We sat for a long time at the foot steps that surrounded the reservoir on all sides, and we could not stop being impressed by the calm, the silent and by the ritual of the bathers."

Surrounding the tank there are many beautiful ancient temples & the small village houses with people living in them. There is mythology to the development of this water in this tank. Famous temple is here Kashi  Math. We were fortunate to visit this temple & join in during prayer & also have temple lunch with the other devotees. Definitely worth visiting."

I’ve been living in Mumbai for last 15 yrs but never had the oppty to go here before. But K was curious n eager to visit after Kate n William from the royal English family visited this place in the recent past. The place is very nice n tranquil. You won’t get a place to park the car nearby, have to walk for about 10 mins from the place you can park your car. The water in the tank is not so clean but you’ll find people swimming in it. Feels like you’ve come to some remote village in India, doesn’t feel this is part of Mumbai. "

Although I am not proficient on the process, the somber feeling was there from loved and respected ones. It is a short trip to visit the tank, but one that was filled with respect as we were able to view the honoring of a respected individual. The tank is located within a neighborhood, with some shops on the outskirt. "
Banganga,Bimal0401,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Miracle on the hill. ,Very old and beautiful tank in south Mumbai's Walkeshwar area. The place is well known  for rituals after death in Hindus. The tank is very huge and with full of water . The tank required cleanliness. The nearby vicinity also requires attention as regards to cleanliness. The local authority should keep close eye on beautification and cleanliness to maintain such a beautiful heritage side. There is need to deploy round the clock security guards . 
Banganga,Dipankar D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Superb cultural Value!,"I, along with my friend, who is also an ardent amateur photographer visited Banganga Tank, which is often called the mini ""Banaras of Mumbai"". This fresh water tank, along with the neighboring Walkeshwar temple, was built in 1127 AD by Lakshman Prabhu, a Goud Saraswat Brahmin in the court of Silhara dynasty of Thane. The site holds immense mythological significance among the Hindus. It is believed that when Lord Rama was on his way to Lanka, he paused at this spot to pray to Lord Shiva to help him find his Wife Sita, who had been kidnapped by king Ravana. To do so, he created a Shiva Linga from sand, which came to be known as Valuka Ishwar (meaning an idol made of sand in Sanskrit), thus, lending the temple its name. When Rama, thirsty and tired, asked his brother Lakshman for a drink of water, he shot an arrow into the ground, which resulted in a spurt of freshwater. It was believed that this water came from a tributary of Ganga and the spot was hence named Banganga (Baan means an arrow in Hindi).Centuries since it was first built, Banganga and its vicinity – with its unique sights, sounds and aromas still takes us back to a simpler, quitter time and remains a great spot to escape the city’s usual cacophony. As you make your way down, one of the many narrow alleys branching out from the main road and leading to the tank, you are surrounded by a motley crew of temples and old houses bathed in vibrant hues of red, yellow, orange, pink and other colors. You will also see the local area kids bathing in the tank."

Banganga,knoesenm,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,Respect the locals,This watertank is very important to the locals. One should therefore show respects as many people come here to wash in the water that they believe has a source directly from the Ganges. Not many tourists come here so it is hardly crowded. Priests sometimes perform prayers here with people who have lost loved ones. On your way here you will find some locals selling fresh fruit and vegetables. Makes for beautiful photos.

Banganga,LSSmiami,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,An Eye Opening Experience!,"Firstly, I suggest going with a guide that can explain what you are seeing.  It is not to be missed!  Banganga is a city within a city... a city made of makeshift housing from tents to tarps to cardboard.  But within this microcosm , there are stores and groceries, a barber, etc.  You will see generations of people living here in life's simplest terms.  Yes, it is dirty and perhaps unappealing but so very interesting.  We were a group of four with a private guide.  I would not feel comfortable walking alone although I must say everyone we saw smiled at us and gave me no reason for concern.  This was one of the high points of our  visit to Mumbai."
Banganga,GeorgeThePorge,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,Odd and charming pocket of ancient Hinduism in modern Mumbai,"It is indeed rundown and dirty, but that is because it is a block of the poorer traditional India, stall and little sidestreets hemmed in on all sides by skyscrapers- a fascinating juxtaposition of old and new and often (though not when I went) with large rituals at sunset. I loved it."
Banganga,Jaap G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,"Magical, mysthical","I love this place. It's very small, but so serene. Through alleys you leave the busy city of Mumbai behind you, and you arrive at this quiet place called the Banganga tank. It's great for some peace of mind, and to escape the city for an hour or so."
Banganga,Kushal K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Visually un-appealing but good insight into Mumbai's history,"There's nothing visually appealing about this tank. If you're in Mumbai for a few days, skip it. However, if you have time have time and a good guide, try and pay a visit. ""Khaki"" does some very interesting walking tours in the area. They'll show you architectural traces of Mumbai's colonial past in some of the most ugly looking building around the tank which is fascinating which you'd never notice on your own. They also show you a some interesting graveyards and stuff here with some historical significance. There's also a couple of temples and a good view of the sea from here (through a very smelly lane)Also, Coldplay's ""Hymn to the weekend"" was also shot here in case that interests you."

Banganga,Aartichand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016,A holy stop,Located in the middle of the concrete jungle of south mumbai this is an old holy destination for followers of Lord Rama. The pond is popular for a religious dip and the steps iconic. Often foreign dignitaries are taken on a tour of this destination. But maintenance is low and the place quite dirty.
Banganga,rashmi r,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,""" A visit to Mumbai is not complete without visiting banganga""",The steps surrounding the pond remind us of the ghats of varanasi or haridwar . You can start from one end and go in parikrama visting each building or house as you go. Almost each building has a small temple in it. The wooden carvings on doors and pillars in some of the temples are truly unique. I heard that some years back some musical and cultural events were held here but were later discontinued. Such places of heritage are treasures which if not preserved and kept clean will slowly decay and this will be a national loss.
Banganga,AKTHAKUR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,TAKE BATH IN THIS HOLY POND BANGANGA CREATED BY LORD RAMA,"This pond banganga is located in south of mumbai accessible by road. If you are taking a taxi it will go straight to the pond.Or else you can take a taxi from grant road station west side or bus from the station west side to the walkeshwar bus depot and walk for around 5 minutes to the pond. This pond was created with an arrow of lord rama when he was feeling thirsty on his way to Sri Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from the demon Ravana.Lord Rama took an arrow and pierced it on the land and prayed to Mother Ganga and this pond was formed. The source of water is Ganges. Banganga means arrow and ganges river. Opposite to the Pond is the ancient shiva temple and many small temples built ages back.The shiva linga inside the shiva temple was also created by Lord Rama from sand. You can watch fish,ducks in the pond and you can take bath and offer holy water to lord shiva. There are few shops near the pond and you can also take help of priest poojary to perform pooja for your ancestors or to ward off your sins.that is the belief. the priest poojary in the shiva temple performs pooja.the temple trust manages the pond and the temples.Worth definitely a visit during daytime."

Banganga,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Heritage Choked with Urbanisation,"The  Walkeshwar temple complex with the Banganga tank in its focal point is a living example of heritage choked by rampant urbanization. Here the paradox of traditional life coexisting with unbridled modern encroachment is all too vivid. Near the edge of the Arabian Sea at the southern tip of Malabar Hill, Mumbai, several small, crumbling, stone-turreted temples and flower-garlanded shrines surround a rectangular pool of holy water in an area of looming modern-day skyscrapers and traditional tiled structures. The tank is believed to have existed from the time of Ramayana. Ritual bathers who come here believe the mossy waters of the tank have healing powers and originated from a natural spring. As the legend goes, Rama rested here while on a mission to rescue his beloved Sita from the demon king's abode in Lanka. Overcome with fatigue and thirst, Rama asked his brother Lakshmana to bring him some water. Lakshmana instantly shot an arrow into the ground, and water gushed forth creating a tributary of the Ganges, which flows over a thousand miles away, hence its name, Banganga, the Ganga created on a baan .  Its waters are considered just as sacred as those of the great river itself. The development of the tank and the main temple took place during the 12th century under the rule of the Silahara dynasty.The complex was rebuilt in the 18th century after a Portuguese invasion destroyed it. In the shadow of one of present-day Mumbai's most prosperous neighborhoods, Banganga continues to function as an out-of-time devotional hub, its tolling bells and mantra-chanting pujaris drawing devotees to worship the divine. It is not a part of the usual tourist circuit and it is truly difficult to believe such a place exists in the tony Malabar Hill area of Mumbai.Was fortunate to visit this place as a part of a heritage walk.Also note that December is the time for open-air concerts held at the Banganga Festival."
Banganga,ColdCorona,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,Little Oasis Hidden among the Mumbai Streets,"This is an out of the way gem location in Malabar Hill area of Mumbai not far from the Walkeshwar Temple or Baan Ganga Temple dedicated to the Hindu god, Shiva.  The Banganga Tank was built in the 1127 AD, by Lakshman Prabhu, a minister in the court of Silhara dynasty kings of Thane, rebuilt in 1715 AD as part of the Baan Ganga Temple complex and is being renovated again to day (February 2016) at least the steps portion.The water in the 'Tank' is fresh water and this large open space a mist the jam packed Mumbai city backdrop is a nice oasis and frequented by locals.  Nice place to take a break from the Mumbai chaos and just relax and enjoy the peaceful surroundings.  You may even see kids swimming or at least enjoying a competitive game of cricket."
Banganga,Coasties99,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,An interesting area to explore,We would never have found this place if it wasn't for the knowledge of a local taxi driver. He dropped us on the street above and we walked down some winding lanes and staircases through a residential area with temples dotted between houses. The tank itself is green with algae and surrounded by rubbish but the whole area is so interesting and quite peaceful. We bought fruit from a local stall and wandered around for a while. Definitely worth a look.

There was no drinking water available as the place is surrounded by sea on three sides. Laxman shot an arrow (Baan in Hindi)  into the ground on instructions from Lord Ram and fresh water sprang out and hence the name ""Baan Ganga"". This is a world heritage site and needs to be maintained in proper condition. It is very unfortunate that the place is found kept tidy only during the annual music concert held on the banks."

Banganga,astroaadil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Couples,Ancient Tank next to the Sea.,The Banganga Tank is an old stepped tank with fresh water from a spring at the bottom very close to the Arabian Sea off the coast of Mumbai city. This tank is surrounded on all four sides by numerous temples of which the Walkeshwar temple is the most famous besides giving the area its name. There are a few deepstambhas (stone pillars with niches for oil lamps) near the tank which are lit up during festivals with small oil lamps. There is a small Dhobi Ghat (open air laundry) nearby too which is unique as they use old discarded fibreglass bath tubs instead of the regular concrete or stone pits for washing the clothes. One of the most serene places in the middle of the concrete jungle that is slowly overtaking the small houses in the area with huge sky scraper high rise buildings. The Maharashtra State Governor's bungalow and estate is very close to this site. There are ducks and geese swimming around in the tank and on certain days there are religious ceremonies conducted on the banks of the tank for the departed souls. An annual music festival with the stone steps as seats and a stage on one edge of the tank was once the pride of this place but no longer conducted due to noise pollution restrictions.
Banganga,keith h,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,Interesting & Photogenic.,"Most people will probably arrive here courtesy of a taxi ride or with a tour group so they will be getting unloaded at the right spot. I was  maybe foolish & walked from my hotel on Ballard Estate. It's quite a stretch but not a problem if you are reasonably fit.    Only thing I would say is that you should probably set out as early as possible in order to enjoy cooler conditions & also to maybe arrive before too many tour parties show up.   If you do walk , just walk straight along Marine Drive & swing left where Chowpatty Beach ends & continue along Walkeshwar road which climbs to Teen Batti & then levels off & slopes down. I must have missed the first opportunity to access the tank but seeing a blue sign on a wall to my right that announced Banganga Cross Path 2 I descended 2 flights of stone steps & arrived at the far end of the tank.     The history of the tank is on line & in guide books for all to access so I can say at present, although the tank may be fed by a freshwater Spring , the water contained in it is of a very rich dark green colour & has a certain amount of rubbish floating on it.    One man & a small boy were clearing some of this rubbish from around the edges.       The tank is rectangular in shape & shallow steps come down to it on all sides with various egresses from the surrounding streets & alleyways. The steps & tank support a fairly large & varied population of geese & ducks who seem to know a good thing when they see it as they are well fed by some locals.   Some shacks border on the upper steps with a few inhabitants & it appears some laundry work gets done in the tank.   One or two small groups of people were conducting little religious ceremonies on the steps & in one corner there was a small shrine under a peepal tree where 4 or 5 devotees were chanting.   There are some nice pillars painted white & red at points on the tank margins.        The whole vicinity is pretty much run down & contrasts with some obviously de luxe towers nearby.   Some sign of maybe better things to come was a small work party levering out some of the  terrace steps under the eye of a supervisor & new stones being delivered.  A few women & their children go in for begging & one approached me with her hand out saying "" money, money, money. Bakhsheesh "" which was refreshingly direct of her.   Despite all this I thoroughly recommend a visit here, it is atmospheric, interesting & photogenic & you can be sure the photos will make the whole area look cleaner than it really is."
Banganga,Richard_in_England,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,Could be so much better,I was quite disappointed with my trip to Banganga Tank.  It’s desperately in need of some care.  The area it is in is very run down and so is the tank.The once imposing pillars are now shabby and all traces of the lamps they held long gone.  The steps all the way round are littered with locals and their attendant possessions and refuse.The water seems to be used as a communal body and clothes washing facility. It’s a great shame as this could be a really good place to visit but it just felt very dodgy.  I didn’t stay long.My Tip: You can get a taxi back just up the steps at the end with the pillars.
Banganga,Dylan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,A different view,This ancient man made tank shows you a part of Bombay you may have not seen before.

It was rebuilt due to the generosity of Mumbai businessman and philanthropist, Rama Kamath. The main temple has been substantially reconstructed and many smaller temples have come up around the Banganga Tank. The Baan Ganga Tank is a very scenic place but very shabby.

Banganga,Sheetal9,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,HIstoric Place not taken care of properly,"Its a nice place, where you can see a lot of ducks and some birds too. It has steps on all four sides and is nice and peaceful on some days. Unfortunately it hasnt been kept well and is surrounded by slum families who dirty the place. The water too is green in color instead of blue. The source from where the water comes is blue and clear but the pond is extremely dirty. Its a shame coz alot of foreigners visit it often and it portrays a very bad picture of our country. I hope the authorities do something about it"
Banganga,Polished Mitra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Couples,Fresh and joyful,"The Banganga or Banganga 0Tank is known for having holly water as the River Ganges (Ganga). It has steps on all sides and you can see people bathing there and children playing. It is a refreshing scene in Mumbai, I must admit.It has been there for centuries (12 AD), from the time when, according to the legend, Lakshmana threw an arrow to the ground and water sprang as a subsidiary of the ""Ganga"".The legend also goes that the water remains clean and odorless like in the very first day – in fact, there was no odor to speak of and the water looked very clean to me. Truth seems to be, the tank is spring fed, hence its cleanness and lack of odor.There are several religious (Hindu) venues around and you might see one or two street barbers doing their métier.It’s a nice spot to visit, if you want to get away from the madness of Mumbai’s busy streets."
Banganga,MrsTL_S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015,Good walk to the tank,We stopped here on our tour and it was a very interesting site and a nice walk down through a local neighborhood.  If you are travelling on your own you would want to bring some information or read about the tank ahead of time as there are no signs or information posted. 
Banganga,Jay B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,Cultural Site Needing Facelift,"A very impoortant cultural site with a long history needs facelift.  This can be a grand tourist site only if the authorities and the people living in and around Banganga can come together swiftly and clean up the tank and streets, build good public toilets -- as a good tour around this area will take anywhere from 1-2 hours.Considering the cultural and historical importance of this place, I wanted to give 5 stars, but having seen the dilapitated condition in which it is today I had to discount it to average.Will definitely revisit Banganga if the conditions are made touristy."
Banganga,Lavesh G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014,If you can Ignore the litter... It can give you a feeling of calm...!!!,Its a huge pond with ancient values but its significance and charm is lost in the filth laying around.I would still suggest one to go there but in the afternoon time say 3 to 5 pm... its so much quite here in the afternoon with hardly people around it does not feel unsafe however as there are plenty residential establishments around.its also breezy that time of the day so one can find some inner calm out here spending around 10 minutes. 
Banganga,RAMESH K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Solo,Myths & legends of Mumbai,"India is a land of myths & legends and if they are to be believed then Banganga in Malabar Hills can be considered as the most sacred spot of Mumbai. According to folklore, Ram & Lakshman had visited this place near the sea shore during their search for abducted Sita. Ram was exhausted after a long trek and felt thirsty. He asked Lakshman to fetch water and as the only water available nearby was the salty sea water, Lakshman shot an arrow (ban) into the ground and river Ganga sprang out and hence the name ‘Ban-ganga’. Even though sea is only 100 metres away from this place, the water of this tank is sweet. There are many temples, old & new, around the tank, the most famous and ancient being the Walkeshwar & Rameshwar temples of Shiva. The story behind Walkeshwar temple is that Ram wanted to worship Shiva on the sea shore but could not find a Shiva Linga so he made a linga out of sand (walu in Marathi or balu in Hindi) and worshipped it. Hence the name‘Walukeshwar’.As per the historical records, Banganga tank was constructed in the 12th century as a reservoir of drinking water. It was destroyed  during the Portuguese occupation of Mumbai but was reconstructed sometime in the early 18th century. It is believed that the tank gets water from an underground spring! There was a time when there were around 20 large water tanks (talab/ pokhar in Hindi) in Mumbai that used to meet the water needs of the residents. Over time as the population increased and alternate sources of water (the lakes) were found, these tanks got filled up and there is no trace of them today except for the Banganga Tank and the Bandra Tank.As one enters the peaceful environs of Banganga after climbing down the Malabar Hill, one feels transported to the ghats of Varanasi or Rishikesh. There are steps (ghats) all around the rectangular water body. Many ancient idols of gods & goddesses lie strewn all around, open to the sky,almost in a state of neglect. At the entrance are two pillars which were used for lighting the earthen lamps. Under an ancient tree, the place where Lord Ram was believed to have come, his foot prints made in marble are still venerated. The entire place, including, the temples all around are managed by trusts run by Maharashtrian Gaud Saraswat Brahamins. Looking at the upkeep of most of the Hindu religious locations, it can be said that the place is relatively clean and well kept. A festival of classic musical is held around the holy tank every year during January in which India's leading artists perform. On a Sunday afternoon under an incessant drizzle and with an umbrella in one hand and camera in another I spent a very satisfying hour savouring the beauty & sanctity of this place. I returned with the resolve to come back again to enjoy the music festival in these mystic sacred surroundings!! This place would definitely rank high in my list of must visit spots of Mumbai. Enjoy the pics and get motivated to visit this place ! The temples remain closed between 12 noon to 4 p.m."
Banganga,ruby1953Mumbai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015,Neglected site,"A famous historic site in Mumbai, but hardly has any selling points or attraction quotient for local or international tourists. The locale is great, but badly maintained. No directions given for outside tourists to reach after Teen Batti. Cultural festivals have been stopped, so nothing to publicise and build up attention. Banganga seriously needs care, both from the local people, local municipal authorities as well as fresh focus from heritage experts"
Banganga,RavinSadh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,a beautiful escape,"you can escape all the hustle and bustle of this maddening city, by walking down the steps of banganga.. the only tourists who ever visit the place are foreigners.. so the place is filled with localites, swimming, playing cricket, feeding the ducks or the fishes or just lazing around the steps.. though not so well maintained you would be taken back.. 100 of years. i love this place.. there is an amazing sandwich stall near one of the exits, and some very yummy bhel stalls near another exit.. you should try these out.. a good escape.. kids would love feeding the ducks and the fishes.. the ducks by the way, love flour balls!! and  the fishes love , parle g biscuits!"
Banganga,atul_31,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,A nice place with historic and religious importance.,It is an ancient tank located at Walkeshwar and is a nice place to see. There are steps all around and also many small temples on all sides. The place is calm when not crowded. Hindu rituals are carried out on the ghats. It is also a place where Banganga festival is conducted every year. The place could be cleaner and better maintained though. There is a municipal car park in the basement of nearby 'Legend' building which saves the hassle of parking on the road.
Banganga,IndiTales,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Family,Visiting the roots of Mumbai City,"Banganga is an ancient pond located in Malabar hill area of Mumbai that still gives you a peep into the old world charm of the area.

Banganga,masaccio,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Pleasant enough detour,"If you're on a tour with your own driver or being driven then it's a pleasant enough place to stop. It may have been more interesting at a different time or day or when busier, but 3pm on a Sunday makes for a quiet place."
Banganga,Hooray H,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Couples,If you have nothing else,It's basically an ancient water fresh tank very close to the sea. Full of protected/blessed catfish. Worth it if you are in the Napansea road area & want a glimpse of how the super rich live so close to the poor fishing community.There is some religious & anecdotal interest too.Interesting geographically..
Banganga,ChrisBlanc,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Friends,a great place for a short visit,"Set in the middle of houses and tower blocks is, according to the local Hindus, the centre of the world.

Banganga,vidit09,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,"Spirituality, Peace, Calm","This is a spiritual and religious site in Walkeshwar surrounded by high rises. But the place is a sea of tranquility.  There is a sense of calmness here that I have not got anywhere else. Next to the Arabian Sea, the only noise a person gets is that of waves rolling on to the shore.A visit is a must."
Banganga,David G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Couples,Island of calm,"It seems incredible that this small island of peace is inside a plenty of life city as Mumbai. There are some old temples and a pond where local people take bath (I wouldn't suggest do the same :P) or play with kites at evening, and all this is surrounded of big buildings. Nice visit, I enjoyed it!"
Banganga,One_of_the_BOFs,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Couples,Tranquil historical spot,"A difficult place to find but well worth the effort for the tranquility. We were lucky as our son lives locally, but most good guides will know if you ask.  Yes the place is not that well maintained and not especially clean, but that is true of so much of the city. I found it restful and very spiritual.A good tip if you go on your own - get your driver to wait for you as you may struggle to find a cab for the return trip and it is not very costly."
Banganga,KAW76,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Couples,History ,"Place is not well maintained, would not take a bath in it even if paid. But an interesting place to visit when looking at the historic aspect of it. We enjoyed our short visit and think it should be a part of your Mumbaistay. "

Banganga,DavidG897,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 • Friends,Fortunate to stumble on an important religious ceremony,"Agree with previous review about lack of maintenance and would have left unimpressed if all that we had seen was the Tank and sparse ghats. However, we we very fortunate that we arrived during a once a year only ceremony for the devotees of people originating in Bihar but now living in or near Mumbai.It was reminiscent of Varanasi, without the cremations. There were perhaps two thousand onlookers as scores of people stood, immersed in the waters, participating in a ceremony holy to them.It was fascinating to witness, but the rating of Excellent is unlikely to be matched by others unless they too are lucky enough to see an event."
Banganga,amitac14,2.0 of 5 bubbles,,historical place ...but not maintained,It could be a very beautiful place but it seriously needs maintenance. The place has century old temple. It is one of its kind place in Mumbai and deserves to be preserved.
Banganga,Pooja S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,Visit this place for some me time :),"I know many staying here in Mumbai might have never visited this place. For most of the Mumbaikars this is a non-listed place, however I beg to differ. I agree that Banganga is not clean, nothing fancy about it but still it has it's own charm. The uncleanliness of this place is partly to b blamed to the apathy meted out to this place. I am not getting into the civil organisation of this place but yes I request the viewers of this post that once u r thr please don't litter and discourage ppl around u whom u find littering the place.My foreign visitors I would once again repeat this place is not fancy but plz come here with one sole intention n tht is to be with yourself. Sit on the steps of Banganga a little before sun set and enjoy the peace tht this place offers while feeding the fishes and ducks who r the residents of this very humble pool :)Hope u enjoy yourself :) "

Banganga,911bella,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Couples,Tranquil,Depends what you're looking for but tucked away amongst the affluent apartment buildings of Malabar Hill lies banganga tank. Yes it's a little run down and doesn't get hordes of visitors but it's a tranquil spot to spend a short while and demonstrates as well as anywhere in Mumbai how the old and modern coexist cheek to jowl.
Banganga,HomIrani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 • Solo,Tranquility amidst chaos,In Mumbai yet secluded is Banganga.  the fresh water pond  close to the Arabain Sea  has ducks and swans surrounded by numerous temples.The quaintness of the place needs to be felt.

Banganga,Michelle C,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2013 • Solo,iphone stolen in this sacred place,"I visited during July monsoon quite times, on a sunday afternoon. I found the tank very intriguing and spent some time walking and taking photographs. A friendly woman diverted the attention of two local dogs who didn't like the look of me.  As I was taking pictures of the children running and jumping in the water, they asked me to take specific shots of them individually doing tricks, which I did. After they had jumped in they ran next to me jostling around to see the screen, and only when nearly all the children had disappeared and I was preparing to leave did I realise the iphone had be taken from my handbag which had been across my body on my shoulder at all times. A sad beginning to my first few days in India. Watch out for children or anybody coming close to you."

Cant believe that the place that is older than the city by a few millennium and is so sacred to the Hindus is caught in time wrap and corruption.

I thought it was perfectly lovely. Quiet, away from the noise of the city, peaceful; you hardly feel like you are in Mumbai. You can sit on the steps and watch the duck and geese, or walk on the lanes that surround the pool which are filled with temples, old and new. From certain spots you can see out to the sea. I would encourage you to go there if you need a peaceful afternoon and want to get away from the chaos of the city."
Banganga,KChandra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Disappointed,"I have been living in Mumbai for more than 40 years and there are places in the city that I am yet to visit. A few weeks back, I decided to make up for it and prepared a list of such places. Banganga was one of them.I had read about the Banganga festival and seen some lovely photographs of the place. When I reached the place along with my wife, it was mid afternoon and the weather was rather hot. We walked down the steps and went around the tank. There are many temples and we visited some of them.The main impression I carried back was one of disappointment. The place is not clean and not well maintained. The tank is pretty large and looks impressive but the surroundings could do with better upkeep. It is not tourist friendly and lacks many amenities. Most people seem to be impressed with the old world atmosphere. While that is true, it would be very good if the place is better preserved as a tourist spot with some good facilities.I am not even sure if this is being promoted as a tourist attraction!Hope the municipality looks into this."

Banganga,astroaadil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,The Tank at Banganga,The Banganga Tank is a lovely place to visit and also see the many temples that surround it on all four sides. There are two sets of Deep Stambhas or Pillars of Light on the two corners. There is a small dhobi ghat (open air laundry) also nearby which has an unusual way for washing the clothes in old discarded fibre glass bath tubs. The famous Walkeshwar temple is on one of the banks of the tank.
