Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Peter P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"Out of the way, but worth the trip","The Bhau Daji Lad Museum is a gem of a place with fascinating exhibits on arts, crafts, and industry (the ground floor), as well as on the history of Mumbai (upstairs).  Restored in the past ten years to its original glory, the beautiful building itself is worth the visit.  There was a lovely, intelligent, highly informative, and friendly young guide offering a free tour.  You could seeping half an hour here, or you could spend four hours studying the profusion oof beautiful objects.Hint:  since this museum is not located in the heart of the city, you should arrange (that is, bargain like crazy), to hire a cab, ask the driver to wait for you, and then drive you back.  We were staying in Colaba and arranged hits for 700 rupees but gave him 900 for his good driving and service."

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,meena1981,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,nice museum,"The architecture of the museum is very fine.The museum has a Palladian exterior. The interior is a rare example of High Victorian design in India. The grand wrought iron palisades, staircase railings and arched supports, as well as the Corinthian capitals and columns which are the defining features of the building were imported from England. The richly coloured details, the intricate woodcarving, the Minton tiled floors, the etched glass and gold gilding make it a unique example of 19th century architecture in the country."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Simrit K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Friends,What an absolute delight!,"Beautiful art installations and a great, well- kept museum. The building itself is stunning and they've made several exclusive cubby holes for thematic art installations. The is a twin staircase going upto the first floor. You can catch old layouts of Mumbai, dredger miniatures and dozens of art style samples from across India. They have antique turnstiles from 19th century London. There are busts of lord elphinstone and queen Victoria in addition to that of bhau daji lal. The front yard of the gorgeous building has awesome fir and Christmas trees as well as a synchronized water fountain. There is ample parking and a zoo in the compound. The washroom facilities are something you can do without checking out though. "
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Cedric N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,A historic museum in Byculla that should be visited,"Have visited this museum a long back ago. This museum is located inside Victoria Garden complex in Byculla and is a main tourist attraction.This museum houses rear artifacts, marble statues of Prince Albert, David Sassoon etc. Its interior is adorned with chandeliers and is similar to the Magen David Synagogue. This museum is a mix of Victorian & Jewish architecture. On the outside, there are some damaged statues that belonged to the British era. Also, there is a small contemporary art museum at the rear of the museum. As the name suggests, this museum was named after Bhau Daji Lad who donated money for building the museum. Earlier, the old name was Victoria & Albert Museum during the British era. The entry fees are Rs. 10 per person for Indians and Rs. 100 per person for foreigners. Also, at the side of this museum is a basalt rock cut sculpture of an elephant from Elephanta Caves as well as British era arsenal.This museum is ideal for those who are interested in history as well as art. It is a must visit and should not be missed."

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Raymond W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Gorgeous Architecture,"There are some museums where the building is more of an attraction than the exhin its themselves. Arguably, this is one of them. It is housed in an exquisite Palladian-style building with elaborate Corinthian columns on the outside. However, the real treasure is the interior. It boasts beautiful wrought-iron balconies, coloured glass and elegant columns. It creates a perfect space in which to exhibit the handicrafts of 19th century India. Everything from damascened bowls to carved ivory is on display here, all of it showing the superb craftsmanship of which local artisans were capable. Fans of ceramics and traditional jewellery will enjoy this. But the highlight remains the building itself, donated by David Sassoon, the opium merchant. Also, don't miss the stone elephant from Elephanta Island which is located in an inconspicuous spot next to the museum."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Keval Kapuriya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Being Traveller,"•The most historic museum ever!! •The entry fee is too low as per the historic beauty that this place serves. •A lot of sculptures, paintings, models and charts are displayed in the museum. •Traditional approach of life has been displayed through the models here. •Informative, innovate and worth visiting.•photography allowed but videography not allowed ."

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Prema_C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Good museum - inside out,First time I visited this museum and was wondering why I never did so far though I lived in the same city. Entrance fee is negligible and it is very well maintained and illustrated. The exhibits are well spaced out and the building is a heritage building. A visit needs at least an hour or two to do justice. There was an exhibition hall which we didn’t visit. 
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,MANCHIMASTER,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,lad museum at zoo,this museum is situated in Victoria garden compound.  it is managed by private trust at present.  heritage building.  lots of artefacts and various models etc can be viewed. original statues of queen Victoria and kala ghoda also lying in the compound
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,TinaQ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,"Beautiful premises, the exhibits are a bit lacking","We visited the Mumbai City Museum on our way to the airport. It's located in a gorgeous building, there's a zoo and a park nearby and the statue of the elephant that gave The Elephanta Island its name is right at the entrance to the museum. The building is wonderful, but the exhibits themselves are a bit bland. There are some on mumbai city planning, different ethnic groups of India, some historic artefacts, but the whole second floor with its ethnographic section feels a bit haphazardly thrown together. The temporary exhibitions are small but interesting.I would say visit if you've already seen everything else, but I wouldn't say this is the museum you have to visit."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Janhavi B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Museum Review,A small but quaint museum. Ideal for people visiting India from abroad. It tells a viewer a lot about indian cultural and artefacts. Washroom and a small canteen facility is available. The museum is 5 minutes walk from Byculla East Railway station. Best time to visit is 11 am to 4 pm. In order to beat the rush hour traffic.
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Hungrymumbaiwale,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Bhau Daji Lad Museum,"This museum is right besides the jijamata udyaan in byculla. The museum and zoo has the same entrance. The ticket for the same is Rs. 20 per person for adult. This is one floor storage. There are many things in the musuem and it is really very nice watching all the things right from maps, old coins, god and goddess statue, old armary, books, many more statues and the res[pective information. The only suggestion for the management people is the have guide there may be free of cost or paid, that can save lots of time of the people visiting there."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,analytic10,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Worth visiting for Bombay history,Its a great museum with wonderful contents. However the whole taken together is not as per globally great museums. The big elephant stone outside has an interesting history
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,mohitlohani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,"House of curated articrafts, maps and displays","Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum was earlier The Victoria & Albert Museum and also designed similarly to the one in London.Situated 1 km from Chinchpokli Station, Byculla area, it is housed in the precincts of Veermata Jijabhai Bhonsle Udyan & Pranisangrah (earlier Victoria Gardens or Rani Baug).It has a fantastic collection of workers' artifacts from metals, wood, clay, gum, animal parts, and display models of their villages, old maps of bombay including the earliest one by David Davies 1626, figurines of peoples of all castes, sects, occupations and nationalities and indian gods.A large marble statue of King Albert and busts of Queen welcome you stoically. Outside the museum, lies the Elephant statue found on the Gharapuri Island nearby and after which the Portuguese named it as Elephanta Island.A shop and small eatery exists at the back with live functions on Sunday evenings by artists and bands."

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,cayenne75,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Neglected but still essential viewing,"This place has so much potential. Unfortunately it is poorly lit making it very difficult to see what's on display. There are few descriptors to educate people on what they're looking at and they could organize their exhibits better. You don't leave knowing anything more about the history of Bombay. Also, not a comfortable space to be in on a hot day. Having said that, you must go visit for the beautiful building itself and the gardens around it. The museum shop is also pretty decent. I walked away with a bag full of books on tribal art and some cool t-shirts. "
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,KrispyPlymouth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Too much for one day,"The front of this museum is beautiful with some great statues to see and photograph. We had a very short visit here, just under an hour. Not enough time to take in everything.We bought a camera permit so we could get pictures of some of the artefacts. There is a real variety of exhibits here, carvings, paintings, statues, plates, textiles.I would suggest you climb up the stairs to the top floors then work down as the temperature in the building rises as you climb higher. Better still make a couple of short visits and focus on one area so you don’t overheat."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Karthik,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Must see for its absolute beauty.,Very well maintained vintage museum. We really enjoyed this place. There is something for everyone. Don’t miss it particularly if you like to take architectural photos. 
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Lv2Travel,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,Museum of Indian art and artifacts,"This small museum is worth going to   If you’re looking to learn more about India’s heritage, about their Gods, and to see artifacts and art.  The facility is beautiful inside, and the items are displayed on multiple floors.  I had an outside guide as part of a larger tour, which might be nice, as I didn’t see headsets for this museum."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,barry p,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,"for history of bombay great, not so well laid out","for a view of the history of the 7 islands that became Bombay or some of the local culture it is useful. but this is not laid out super well, is very hot and you need someone to help you find the treasures amidst a lot of other material. "
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,manjusampat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Beautifully maintained,Wonderful exhibits that are really beautifully displayed and  well designed. The building is in a classic architectural style. Make sure you visit the zoo next door as well

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Steve Buckley,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Mumbai-focussed Museum.,"I went on a Full Day City Tour today which included a visit to the Bhau Daji Lad Museum which was conveniently located next to Mumbai Zoo which was our next port of call (see separate Review).The Museum is on two floors and is certainly one of the oldest in Museum. Whilst I found the various artefacts on the first floor interesting, it was the old maps of Mumbai and the heads of all the different people who make up Mumbai’s population that really caught my attention.Certainly more educational than expected and - as such - well worth a short visit."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Prateek Joshi,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Friends,Boring place in Byculla,"I find museum generally boring, but I still tried for this one and my reaction was still the same. There is nothing attracting here for me. However, please note that people who like to have knowledge about history, its a good place, also one of the oldest museum of Mumbai."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,PrajJ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Worth a visit!!,It’s a very nice museum to get a glimpse into the olden days of Mumbai. They charge a nominal fee of Rs.10 for adult ticket and Rs.5 for child ticket. Wonder if they could improvise on interior lighting to make the intricate and beautiful interiors more visible. The staff is courteous. There’s a cozy cafe where there are snacks like chips and biscuits available with some beverages. Their gift shop is also interesting. We attended the Children’s film festival held in collaboration with the Canadian Consulate. It was a houseful event where they screened 6-7 animated short films back-to-back for an hour. One film was information-based while others were fiction-based. Many of the films were hilarious and kids had fun watching them.
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,astroaadil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Oldest museum in Mumbai.,One of my favourite places to visit in Mumbai is the Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum erstwhile Victoria & Albert Museum which has been restored recently and won the UNESCO world heritage conservation award and is a must visit place for children and adults alike. It has a huge collection of old artefacts from the British times when many items were made for an exhibition that was taken to Britain. It has a very nice collection of maps and old books in it's library as well as a lot of the old British statues that were removed from their original positions in the city after the formation of the state of Maharashtra.

The top floor has very nice collection of small sculptures depicting various historical ,mythological events.exampledashavtars of lord vishnu.it is a cool place to visit and maybe small kids may get bored too soon. But for adults and young kids,it is worthwhile and educating.entry prices are very reasonable."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,127Fred,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Solo,A strange place lost in time; looking forward for the due revamp,"The tone is badly set when non-Indians have to pay 10 times more than Indian nationals for getting in. Apart from that, welcome.In this badly maintained place, time must have stopped sometime in the XIXth century. The entrance gate itself is worth getting into the list of artefacts.There are some clumsy tries to convince the visitors that India has a mastery of design, inspired from its former master the UK. We did not buy into this story, not more than we believe the English school of design be a marvel of the modern world.A lot in this place plays tribute to the former occupant, long gone. Some artefacts show Indian society and its distinctions. A place shows the different casts of India, with the untouchables... untouched. Unmentioned. Ignored.This was one more sign that the place needs a strategic overhaul, let alone a revamp. We are in 2018, not 1946.There is also a garden around the building, as badly kept as the rest.We visited as well a temporary exhibition 'beyond transnationalism'. The role of this exhibition is explained, at the entrance, by the curator, in hermetic language. It shows (our simplified version) paintings and other works from US-based Indian diaspora. The artists, we are told, 'travel through multiple narratives'. (---) the exhibition asks questions about new ways to articulate this new beyond'. Incidentally, 'transnationalism' could have been explained, for a start. Was this exhibition aimed at the public, or at some strange ill-communicating curator himself?"
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,shru622,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Amazing and informative,"The entry ticket is rs 10 per head. It has 2 floors which showcase the history of mumbai. There are alot of models of old bombay, old jewellery and other artifacts.Painting exhibition is also there."

You can take photographs but video recording is not allowed and you cannot use flash. Also, we cannot sell our images. It is located within the premises of Rani Baug Zoo and is 10 mins away from Byculla Railway Station. They have a cafe inside too. You cannot take any food or liquids inside. The highlight for me was the Elephant Statue."

Also has a museum cafe to for a snack. If you have the energy recommend a walk in the zoo next door not so much for the animals but for a breath of fresh air amidst an amazing collection of trees - few know that the zoo was intended to be a botanical garden"

It has some amazing collection related to the history of the city, especially 19th century maps. Though the museum has undergone restoration and refurbishment recently, it still needs to do more for becoming a world class museum. The exhibits can be enhanced by providing more info about it. The Museum looks like mishmash of historical artefacts and modern installations. The museum should be promoted more vigorously as hardly five percent of the visitors coming to the zoo visit the museum in the same complex."

The building is well maintained and has a beautiful staircase and chandelier worth the visit. The second floor however has very Uninteresting items on display. The building is beautiful  and is full paisa vasodilation. However I cannot understand this habit of the government of renaming monuments as the names are also a part of the history

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,KaviKavi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,"Nice place, if you have the time.","The Museum is in a lovely old colonial building with fine architecture and impressive interiors. It was built to house the traditional arts and crafts of India that were under stress due to the Industrial revolution. The pieces displayed are a nice representation of some of the arts and craft of India (which you can see in many antique shops, crafts stores, etc.). The only set of exhibits I was impressed by were the decorative pieces made of animal horns that reminded me of brown jade and I have not seen these anywhere before. The open space in the back was not very crowded and was a peaceful retreat from the madness of Bombay. The audio tour was not working though they have guided tours at a certain time of the day. This place is certainly not a must do, but a can do, if you have time and want an outing."

The collection of work is alright, but a must-visit just to take in the lovely architecture and space. They do at times have some great temporary exhibits, and there's a cute little shop at the back, with some interesting books and products. Would definitely rate it as one of the top 10 things to do in Mumbai."

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,shibani91,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,Hidden Museum of Mumbai,"Bhau Daji Lad Museum is my favourite get away place within the city itself. It was restored a few years ago and it's interiors are spectacular, the long arches to the marble statues in the centre and the gorgeous chandelier above the wooden staircase. Apart from it's architectural beauty the Museum, my most favoured are the artifacts which give you an insight into the origins of the city of Mumbai, most of them are present on the second floor. They comprise of maps to replicas of the ancient island city as well as figurines of the original tradesman and inhabitants of Bombay. As there is no air conditioning, although it's never too crowded and there are fans and sufficient ventilation, during the hot months between March to June, I'd suggest you make a visit to the museum in the morning or later in the afternoon.I highly recommend this Museum to any tourist visiting Mumbai as well as to the mumbaikars themselves."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Amitabh Gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Family,Brilliant little gem... must visit for mumbaikers,So what I like about this museum is that it's not a very serious one with relics from ancient time... things here are from the 1800-1900 era. That means especially for kids... it's easy to relate stories. What was Mumbai like... what villages looked like... different races and ethnic groups and easily relatable figurines...etc. But what took my breath away was the beauty of the building itself. The look inside is of a beautiful house... wall art... chandelier... staircase... it's just lovely. Must visit! 
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,ShruJ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Friends,A regular visitor for their art exhibits,"The museum mails lists of activities every month. Its full of events the month long. Mostly diversified as art exhibits, NSPA-national streets for performing artists and the museum itself.The museum is India's history around the British rule. A brief history of Bombay. Come in on a late Sunday afternoon, walk through the 2 floors. Then sit back and enjoy the NSPA with tea/ coffee. The entry of Rs. 10 covers the museum and the art exhibits."

What a wonderful piece of beautification. The interiors are just awesome.. !!Very nice ambiance and lighting.. So many fine details about Indian history, culture. Many wide areas are covered, where at many places there are miniature models are prepared and at some places real history evidences.Definitely worth a visit."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,HarikrishnanRS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Good musuem to depict the history of Mumbai,"Its a very good museum which depicts the history of Mumbai.The museum was spread over two floors including a magnificent Hall. We were welcomed by the great elephant of Elephanta Caves on the right side of the museum.Its give us insights over how brass, bell metal etc was created by ancient craftsmen in India and using these alloys equipment were created. It describes the ancient techniques of textile making, artistry and other craftsman ships. Its really worth visiting this palace.Other attractions include 1)	Byculla zoo , situated in the same compound2)	Exhibitions and souvenir in the backside of the museum.3)	A clock tower in the entrance of the 'Veer Mata Jijabai Bhonsle Udyan"

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,JazzApple,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,Good Museum,"We very much enjoyed our museum stop. It is small but has interesting content. We felt like the only tourists there - which was great. It's always positive to engage with local people learning/celebrating their history. I loved the miniatures and could have spent many hours enjoying the details. However, we had other sights to see - so spent 1.5 hours enjoying the space. The cafe was air conditioned and served cold drinks. There was no fresh food for purchase."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Womohoscho,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017,Beautiful and excellent ,"We loved this museum! The building is lovely renovated, worth a visit even without the exhibits. The exhibition gives a good insight in various arts and crafts and the different ethnic groups in Mumbai. Everything nicely presented. Due to technical problems the audio guides weren't available when we visited the museum. But the explanations were good enough to do without them. "
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,annarc6,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Nicely Renovated ,We were here several years ago and it seemed old and run down.  But it is now a wonderful place to visit with interesting exhibits and a nice gift shop.  You get a good taste of 19th century Bombay.  You learn the story of the origin and development during Ronan times to its importance through the ages.
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,darshbjain,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Kind of getting old,This museum is now getting old and they are not even getting new stuff to make the museum more popular but the zoo nearby is a great place.
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,a-travelin-foodie,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Beautiful restoration ,"Beautiful restoration of the building and the artifacts. Really loved the miniatures! Wish there were some good online photos of those, as mine came out blurry and that's what I wanted to show off to others.  Worthy of a visit and the tiny financial support of the ticket. Watch the video of the restoration (we saw inside the cafe) and of the historical photos of Mumbai (2nd floor of museum). A number of the displays have a laminated card with explanation if the artifacts...take a look at these, too. Grounds are a bit dreary, but some interesting statues.  Really, quite a treat.  "
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,preetibh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Interesting piece of Mumbai History,"This museum definitely qualifies as one of the hidden gems of Mumbai, because quite a few Mumbaikars themselves dont know about the place. This place got renovated between 2000-2009 and in my opinion deserves to be visited if you want to know about Mumbai's history. Did you know that this place is the third oldest museum in India? Right after Kolkata and Chennai Museum or that its history is linked indirectly to America's civil war.. because the donors of the museum were large cotton traders who got monopoly on the cotton trade because during the civil war the supply from America to Europe completely stopped. There are also old Mumbai maps displayed on the first floor of the museum.These are gems of history which i got while attending the free museum tour which happens every saturday and sunday. The Museum has also got very active in terms of organising events/ activities for kids and youngsters. So try and check out the museum calendar on its website/ facebook events before coming here.(which are very nominally charged) For instance I got my son here during the museum's treasure hunt  activity which he really enjoyed.  You will need 1-2 hours to browse through the museum. I would recommend joining the  guided tour because that gives you perspective on the artefacts kept there.Museum has also a nice cafe and curio shopt at the back of the museum, also check out the iron made intricately carved fountain at the Museum's backyard.  Don't forget to check out the stones kept outside the museum which marked the end of the Mumbai geography at one point of time."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,TripMahajan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,A little gem in the heart of Mumbai,"We visited this lovely museum on Sunday at 10.45 AM. Tucked away in the middle of the Jijamata zoo gardens, it is an amazing place. The beautiful Victorian building with its superbly restored exterior and interiors are a credit to the painstaking research and hard work of its curatorial team. The colourful Minton tiles and the  exquisite ceiling takes one back to the skillful craftsmanship of that era. The ground floor is divided into functional and scientific crafts and the artistic, decorative display sections-  both unique and beautiful in their own way. The first floor is dedicated to the Mumbai city life museum and has clay figurines from diverse communities that made Mumbai their home over centuries. There are also models of Mumbai 's topographic maps and naval craftsmanship.We were fortunate to be shown around by Komal Chitnis from the senior curatorial team on the scheduled free tour (in English) starting at 11.30 AM on Saturdays and Sundays. Komal was an excellent and enthusiastic guide and so knowledgeable that she made our museum visit even more enjoyable. As we were the only two visitors on the tour, we were honoured to have a private guided tour. Thank you Komal.Nice open area behind museum for picnic. A cafe, shop and clean toilets available.Entry fees only Rs 10 for Indians (and Rs 5 for children). Excellent educational museum suitable for all ages.Highly recommended.  Do not miss.The main gates to the zoo gardens are closed for renovations hence the entrance is via Patanwala road. This needs better sign postings to help tourists to find the museum. Hopefully the main entrances should be open in the next few months.Very good website with all info. "
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Alex A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Truly brilliant experience,"Thoughtfully laid out, lovingly restored, housing a most impressive collection of Indian antiquities and history, Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum is a MUST visit attraction. Set in vast surrounding gardens (which unfortunately are in a sad state of neglect) this Palladian building with high Victorian interiors is a magnificent example of what can be achieved with hard work and focus.A wide variety of artefacts are displayed. Classical statues, models, old city and village scenes, so finely crafted and well displayed, compete for your attentionThe museum Plaza is a welcoming area with attractions of its own, such as book stores, storey selling, arts and crafts, etc"

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Vandana K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,Real treasure!,"Those of you who wish to see the cultural treasures of India must make it a point to visit this less known museum. I happened to go there not to see the museum but to visit the handicrafts exhibition being held on the premises. But was I glad I came there! It was a pleasure going through the well maintained museum with very interestingly displayed artifacts. All the arts and crafts of India through centuries are on show on the ground floor. The first floor has figurines showcasing Indian costumes, religions, armies, lifestyles and much more in a very attractive way. The place is specially meaningful for school kids for learning ancient Indian culture and traditions."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,abinashjee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,New life for the forgotten Museum,Very well maintained after a decade of renovations. Good presentation of artifacts and a free guided tour over weekend is a plus. Since it is in the Byculla Zoo compound so there is no excuse of not visiting. The museum is small and takes about an hour for a detailed tour. Although we didn't see but audio guide signs were there which can be used for an informed visit. Access wise also it is quite centrally located with many Best Buses stopping at the museum / zoo gate.

Please please visit this Museum and make sure you take the tour. It shows the wonderful arts and culture of india across the ages...... if for no other reason than to marvel at the beautiful building itself and at modern india that is respectful of the past and spending money restoring these old and precious sites ......🇮🇳🇮🇳👍😎 "

Good insight for kids to know Mumbai with its vintage history.

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,TheWorldDigested,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016,Excellent overview of Indian artisan crafts,"No one goes here, so you can wander around tranquilly (and that's in Mumbai!) in a lovely building. The array of Indian artisan craftsmanship is stunning. There are also good English descriptions provided. The figures of ethnic Indians upstairs at the first glance appear tacky, but are in fact quite interesting and well-done on closer inspection. Each face and dressing is rendered uniquely. "

The museum has a good collection of various artwork made from different materials, from metal to coconut."
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Harry D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,A wonderful Victorian museum ,"The museum is located inside the grounds of a slightly tired and crumbling zoo. To get to it you need to walk through the zoo, entering from the main gate halfway along the North side of the complex (on E.S Patanwala Marg road). There is no entry from the West gate, despite it being closest to the museum on Google maps. Whilst there is a fee to enter the zoo, you don't have to pay this if you’re just going for the museum, so just tell the guard and they'll let you through. Turn right at the first chance and keep walking, it'll appear eventually. It's 100R entry for foreigners, and well worth it if you like fine craftsmanship and a dose of nostalgia. The museum is something of time capsule from the Victorian era, with artifacts dotted around in wood and glass cases. It exhibits a superb range of handmade art, carvings and decorative products sourced from all over India in the late 1800’s. The building is in good condition having been recently restored. Out the back is a small museum shop and cafe. "
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Shailendra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,Nice museum,"Bhau Daji Lad museum is the oldest museums in Mumbai. The best part is the beautiful interiors of the museum.

Also on display is an armour weighing 19 Kg.A hidden gem worth exploring in Mumbai."

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,lovetotravel040182,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,A good place to kill an hour or 2 ,"The museum is set within the grounds of a zoo and a park, the park is very pleasant but the zoo leaves much to be desired, it's very tired and in my opinion the animals don't seem too well cared for (but I'm no specialist so could be wrong). But the zoo and park grounds are free to visitThe building that is the museum (originally named the Victoria and Albert) is a splendid building, but the artefacts it holds aren't necessarily the most interesting, there are a fair few nice items to look at, but I think way too much pottery type items. None the less if you have the time spare it is worth a view for the low entrance fee of 100 rupees "

This is close to Rani chi bag hence can be a best day outing. Tickets are reasonably priced. If you have visited some other historic museums in past then you will not like much as there is nothing unique. Bollywood section is one good section and the videos that they show about Mumbai history is good for knowledge. Overall once visit attraction.
