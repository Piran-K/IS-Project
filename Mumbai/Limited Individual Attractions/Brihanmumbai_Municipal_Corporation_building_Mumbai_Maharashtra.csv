Brihanmumbai_Municipal_Corporation_building,G V Naggenddra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Heritage Building,"At the junction of D.N. Road and Mahapalika Marg is the location of this towering heritage building built on what seems to be on the Gothic style of design. Going by its history, the construction started in the year 1884 and was completed in 1893. It houses the office of the BMC, the civic office that governs the maximum city; Mumbai.Visually looking splendid from the outside with its intricate designs, it cuts a sorry face from the inside which seems mainly because of the apathy shown in its non maintenance. It is presently undergoing exterior restoration work as is with some other prominent buildings in its vicinity. I hope someone will pay the much needed attention on the inside to rectify the faults.Installed at the entrance to the BMC is the impressive bronze statue of Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, a political leader and an activist, who was knighted by the British in India for his immense services provided to the city of Bombay (as it was known then) and who became the Municipal commissioner of Bombay Municipality in 1873 and its President in 1884, 1885, 1905 and 1911."

One of the lovely sites in south Mumbai. Curiosity took better of me and made me take a walk inside. Inside, Freshly painted and kept clean. Walked past the standing committee chairman's room and others with polished doors and clean glass. The broad wooden stairs and even spiral iron stair were eye catching.The exterior wall seemed pretty dirty. As there was scaffolding, maybe they would be planning a painting job. Hope so."

This building is amongst the tallest structures in Mumbai and was started in 1884 and completed in 1893. It is in a Venetian Gothic Revival style with an Indo-Sarcenic Dome.
