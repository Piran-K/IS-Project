Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Angela C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022,Gorgeous Museum,"Wonderful museum filled with gorgeous art and learned so much about the history of India. Really enjoyed the coin collection, but also enjoyed the architecture of the museum as well. Just a heads up - the building does not have air con in case you were looking for a respite from the Mumbai heat."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Bati P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Super museum,"I would give it one more star, but it allowed school groups. A field trip is only as good as a student learns from it. They were the worst bunch of kids and I had to ask to throw them out of the room as they were loud and obnoxious. The paintings and the display were absolutely amazing!"
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,mallikajamy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Family,A memorable day at the museum ,"Art has the power to transform to  illuminate, to educate, to inspire and motivate.A family day out at the Museum, my last visit was when I was in school and the same with my husband. Taking our kids to the museum made us feel like kids again, except we both were running in different directions with two kids. We started with the Children museum to build that excitement to ignite their interest in other sections later. Very well described as to which animal/bird is getting extinct, already extinct etc. I learned a lot in this part of the museum. Next was the main lobby and then upstairs. The paintings, old Mumbai pictures. Skipped a few with kids not interested. The textile section was worth the visit. It's a spiral step that takes you to the higher floor. Very well displayed and described. Then the coins and jewellery and a new addition the Indian independence struggle keeping in mind the Woman of India. My elder son enjoyed the Mummy section while i entertained the younger one in the museum shop. Very well managed with security taking care of art and kids getting lost. Infant rooms are available and very clean.The washroom was clean but it depends on the walk in for the day, it was stinking a bit.Overall it was a wonderful day and a memorable one."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Tushita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Take some time to explore history,"Formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum, it is one of the largest museums in India and is dedicated to showcasing the history of India, its art and culture. Its collection includes sculptures, paintings, manuscripts, and other artifacts from ancient India to the present day."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,rlcran,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,"Nice introduction to India, beautiful surroundings","We loved this museum!  The grounds and building are beautiful, same Indo-Sacracenic architectural design by George Wittet, it's celebrating it's centenary.  It has an overview of history of India and cultural customs, art, textiles and natural history.  A nice introduction to India that isn't overwhelming.  We spent four hours and saw everything."

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Tom G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,"Mumbai Heritage District Walking Tour, Impressive Museum","Our expert guide from Greaves Travel led us on a walking Tour through the Art Precinct of Mumbai’s British Heritage District. We visited Churchgate and Zero Point, site of St. Thomas Cathedral Church, at one corner of an ancient fort and where historically distances along all major roads were measured from. The Kala Ghoda (Black Horse) subdistrict is a crescent shaped sub-precinct that has developed into a prominent cultural center in Mumbai. The heritage structures are in Victorian Neo-Gothic, Indo Saracenic, Renaissance Revival and Edwardian Neo Classical styles.We enjoyed the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, formerly the Prince of Wales Museum. Considered one of the most significant museums in India, it is spread over three acres and includes more than 50,000 ancient artworks, sculptures and artifacts in its galleries. The museum is divided into three sections: art, archaeology and natural history. Browse through sculptures, bronzes, excavated artefacts from the Harappan sites, Indian miniature paintings, European paintings, porcelain and ivories from China and Japan. We enjoyed a small but impressive collection of the Progressive Artists Group, which flourished around Indian independence after World War II."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,SmitaB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Nice small museum,"Visiting the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum in Mumbai was a fun two-hour experience. It's not a big museum, not comparable to the MET (NY) or the V&A (London), not even the Indian Museum in Kolkata, all of which have way more Indian artefacts than this one does. But it was still an interesting experience and a good place to take children. And to hang out on a Sunday afternoon, which is what I did. The museum is open from 10 AM to 6 PM daily. Tickets cost INR 100 for Indian citizens, and an additional INR 100 If you want to take pictures even if it's through a phone camera. The museum has a main gallery and an extension gallery, the latter holding the more interesting exhibits, in my view. It can get hot and sweaty in the afternoon because most of the museums did not have AC. The best part about the museum is not so much the space itself but rather the events and exhibitions it frequently holds. So, be sure to subscribe to its Instagram and Twitter pages if you want to be culturally invigorated from time to time :)"

A large part of the building is undergoing renovations. So the visit to the museum should become even nicer post the work is finished. Worth the visit
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Sourav_KS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Informative and Time Worth Spent,"Earlier known as ""Prince of Wales Museum"", building itself is a heritage building.Good and unique artefacts on display and very informative particularly the Natural History section.A proper visit can consume 2-3 hours and the museum closes at 5.00 PM, so folks can plan accordingly.Recommended for all age groups.People are allowed to click photos for which they have to buy an additional ticket and they will give you a wrist band to display."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,KhanOmar67,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2021,Worthy of a visit,The place is vivid and has an old world charm to it. The heritage artefacts are well preserved and presents itself in full aura of the Indian past.Its a must visit when in Bombay.

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Jayan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Interesting place,"Even if you are not interested in history, you will be trapped here once entered. Well arranged museum displays a lot of ancient history items, stuffed animals, birds etc will steal your mind. The building itself is a wonderful creation. One day required to cover every parts in detail. A twenty minute video 'Mumbai experience' in Marathi and English can be watched by paying additional fee (Now Rs.50/head) at the entrance itself. For camera another Rs.50 to be paid. You have to keep your luggage except ladies hand bag in the entrance counter. A food stall available immediately inside the gate. Rates are moderate.  Wash room available near the entrance and inside the museum building also. Drinking water facility also provided."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,MWandAW,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,If History Museums rock your boat,"My wife and I walked to the Museum from our hotel, using the hotel map. It was a flat walk and easy to do, especially after we learnt how to cross roads in India. We happily paid the foreigners visitors entry fee at the ticket office, just to the left inside the main gate (near the shop and cafe) and received our passes. We did not take an Audio Guide, as we like to view what we are interested in. We also like to take all the time we need to view the exhibits and we didn't hurry. We enjoyed viewing the gardens outside the exhibition building, especially the statues. We didn't pay extra to take photos inside and put our cameras away. We started by climbing to the top floor and found that on each floor, there is a corridor to an annex where there are more things to see. It is way easier to start at the top and walk down.  The Art, Archaeology and Natural History exhibitions include some of the oldest artifacts that I have ever seen. Some pottery pieces over 4,000 years old. We loved the Japanese and Chinese artifacts in the glass cases and my wife really liked the sari and textile collections, in another section of the museum.  The museum isn't modern and doesn't have any of the full room audio visual displays of prehistoric animals wandering  through the undergrowth, like you see in other international venues. It does have however, have real exhibits, not make-believe ones.  We spent around two and a half hours in the museum and a further 30 minutes in the shop buying souvenirs of our visit, including a Hindu statue and some nicely packed Indian tea varieties. A visit to this Museum is highly recommended."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Brian T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Interesting to visit,"This really is a place to visit if it holds an interest for you.  Whilst it has some amazing artifacts and historical descriptions of the pieces it is well worth taking the audio guide, although at times it was not easy to follow.  We found the Chineses and Japanese rooms of particular interest but like all museums it is what suits your personal interest.  The museum was clean and well laid out with separate rooms dividing the exhibits.   We have one critism of our visit, the washrooms were inadequately supplied, at the time absolutely no running water for hand washing so make sure you carry sufficient hand sterilising gel."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Libby in Cincinnati,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Fine if you have time,They have a large collection of miniature paintings and some ancient Indian sculptures.You could see the majority of the collection in an hour or two at the most. We really didn't think this was a special museum.

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Alan T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Museum of India,I had a very short time but found much here to be helpful in better understanding the culture and history of India.  I would definitely return to spend more time and learn more.  I could have easily spent a day here.  In reality I only had about 2 hours.
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,2torontotraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Beautiful Museum,"I visited this museum as part of a shore excursion from my cruise ship.  This museum is just beautiful. The museum building embodies the pomp and height at which the British Raj was moving ahead with their ambitious plans, in building the great metropolis of Bombay. The building was started in 1905 and completed in 1915 and an addition was added in 2008.  The museum building is a Grade I Heritage Building. The outside of the building has a lovely garden with some interesting sculptures.  We were only given half an hour to see this museum which is not anywhere close to how much time you would need to enjoy the museum.  I ran through the building to get a sense of the museum.  There is a lot to see here with lots of sculptures, art and Natural History.  If I get another chance to go to Mumbai, I would definitely go back and have a longer look."

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Go for the sculpture and Miniature arts gallery,"This is one of the best museums in the country and therefore a must visit. Photography is allowed on payment of small fee. There are lockers where you can deposit your luggage. Audio guides are available. We visited the sculpture gallery and miniature art galleries. The sculpture gallery on ground floor has Buddhist sculptures and sculptures of Vishnu, Devi, Shiva from Hindu religion. The miniature art gallery on first floor has the best collection in country stretching right from the Pala period to the Mughals to Rajputana style. There is a nice museum shop where you can pick up souvenirs and books. There is also a good cafeteria on the premises"

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,ZenHealer7,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,What A Surprise!,"From Prince of Wales to Chatrapati Shivaji to The Museum. What a transformation. I was born and brought up in Bombay and remember visiting this dusty, poorly laid out, boring edifice from school. Had never stepped in since then. Until a friend was visiting from the USA and I decided to venture in there. From the moment you approach the modern, well organized and user friendly ticket office, you know there is something new and fresh in the air. This is followed by watching staff and security people actually working and smiling instead of just idling away. And then The Museum itself. Finally, India has a world class museum in its premier city. Eachh of the floors is well organized with well curated, displayed and explained pieces of Indian art and history, all in air conditioned comfort in a spanking new interior. What a pleasure."

Our 6 year old loved listening to the audio guide and clearly took lots in as she keeps telling people about how Ganesh got his elephant head. The children’s museum was great with lots of interaction and things for our 6 year old to do.

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Maribel,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,the interior and exhibits are bland,"I don't recommend a visit to the interior of this pricey museum. The audio guide is poor. the exhibits are pretty boring.The only interesting thing is the architecture of the exterior of the building and you can see that from the outside, so safe yourself some rupees and visit  the heart of the Mumbai's city instead"

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,TBSMKS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Average Museum,This museum built from 1911-1914 to commemorate a visit from The Prince of Wales. I loved the Buddha head near the entrance. The miniature painting gallery was especially interesting (the room contains paintings not miniatures). There is religious art as well as European art. The structure is dated and not as well maintained as it could be. It’s worth a visit but it’s not a fabulous museum.

The Chhatrapati Shivaji Vastu Sangrahalaya (Previously known as Prince of Wales Museum) is a wonderful Museum in Mumbai. It’s surely one of the must see places in Mumbai.Conceived in 1904 and formally opened to Public in 1922, it is a great place to know your own heritage and bring as many tourists to be acquainted with Indian culture.The Museum has three main sections namely art, archeology and natural history. The Museum is organised into multiple galleries which exhibit over 50,000 exhibits. There are items dating back to 3rd century bc. Sculptures, paintings, textiles, arms & weapons, Ceramics & porcelain etc are exquisite. The story they tell is unique. India is one of the most ancient and rich cultures in the world. Indians as well as foreigners should visit this Museum to appreciate the great heritage.."

Visitors always ask what to do in Mumbai and I am putting this museum on the list,it was a super fun rainy day spent visiting the erstwhile Prince of Wales museum. You can explore Indian/Chinese/Japanese and natural history here. But what we really loved was the beautiful building in indo-sarsenic style, the grounds and the little cafe that overlooks it! Lovely to just spend a rainy day."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Mihir Dedhia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,A Must Visit Museum of Mumbai,"CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ VASTU SANGRAHALAYA(Prince of Wales Museum)Formerly known as the Prince Wales Museum in Mumbai, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaja Vastu Sangrahalaya is a great place to learn art and history of India, and Maharashtra in general. This museum is located on the southern tip of Mumbai, which is known as the Crescent Site. The main aim of the museum is to create a sense of awareness towards the rich heritage of the nation, and educate the public about the same. Highlights📍30min documentary on the transformation of the 7 Islands of Bombay to current day Mumbai.📍Kids Museum📍50,000 artefacts comprising of Historical Art, Archaeology and Natural History📍 European paintings, Chinese and Japanese porcelain, ivory and jade artefacts.📍 The Maritime Heritage Gallery, which displays objects relating to navigation, is the ""first of its kind in India"".If you are planning a trip to this museum make sure you leave aside one whole day or at least 9 hrs. Its a very huge museum and skipping any part of the museum is not worthy."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Manish K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,A museum rich in history and architecture,"The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum, is the most well-known of all museums in Mumbai. Located within the Kala Ghoda circle, the museum is housed in a large building, with elements of the Mughal as well as the British era particularly noticeable in its architecture. The museum also has nice gardens and an external hall where a short film on the city of Mumbai is screened, which has a separate ticket.On arriving at the museum, one's bags are checked, following which entry is granted. If one wishes to click photographs inside, one needs to purchase a separate camera ticket, which must be shown on request. The museum itself is spread on 3 floors and covers the whole gamut of Indian and world history from the prehistoric era to current day.The most eye-catching galleries for me were the Indus Valley civilization gallery, the Natural History gallery, European Painting gallery and the Far East gallery. While the former effectively conveyed the magnificence of the great civilization, the Far East gallery had a rich collection of items from Japan, China and South-East Asia. The European painting Gallery boasted of some amazing pieces of art and portraits.The Natural History gallery was the best of the lot. The variety of flora and fauna depicted here was simply amazing. The movie on Mumbai too was short and engaging. The museum also has a small cafeteria. One can spend around 1.5-2 hours, if not more, to do justice to this place."

This museum is famous attraction in Mumbai. It is frequently visited by Indian as well as foreign tourists.This museum was built in Indo-Saracenic style of architecture by the British to commemorate the visit of the Prince of Wales. Hence, this museum was name after him. This museum houses various historic artifacts, portraits, sculptures etc. There was an ancient Egyptian mummy that was on display for a short time. Currently, it is not there anymore. Photography is not allowed inside, one has to pay for it. The entry fees are mentioned outside the museum. There is a security check near the door of the museum.

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,James T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Amazing museum with fascinating exhibits,"Visited this museum in Mumbai, formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum, which is dedicated to Indian history and art.  Reputed to be one of the best musems in India, I noted that it was not as large as similar museums in other countries but still had several very interesting exhibits.  The building itself is beautiful and everything seemed well managed.  Exhibit highlights included a large collection of ancient Buddhist sculptures from Gandhara (now in present-day Pakistan), a number of Buddhist and Hindu religious artifacts from Tibet and Nepal, some Mughal-era miniature paintings, and a whole room of armor and weapons from throughout Indian history.  Main exhibits can probably be seen in about 2 hours at a moderate pace.  Would definitely recommend this museum to anyone interested in history, art, or religion.  While foreign tourists pay more than locals to enter, the admissions is definitely worth it."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Sunil Anand,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Very Informative and vast museum,Great place to go with family and kids. They have a vast collection of historic works on display. Activities for children and a movie screening on the roots of Mumbai are the highlights. You can also have a quick bite at the in-campus restaurant. It would take almost 4+ hours for the complete tour. They also have a children's museum and the museum is very well kept.

Not comparable to museum in other countries but really decently managed. The halls with sculptures, rocks and especially the halls with the stuffed animals, birds and fish is the best of the lot. Also the children museum just for its astetics is a good place to visit.Overall you might not come out very impressed, but defenitely want to appreciate the efforts put in for developing and maintaining this museum.Defenitely worth one visit..........."

It brought us a very mixed kind of feelings.  It's more like a private museum.  Most of the things were donated by TATA family. Some artefacts were like ancient and some modern. Building is beautiful from outside in typical Indo-saracenic style. It's OK if someone wants to visit but if have lesser time, then better to visit Elephanta caves etc. "
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Simon L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,A quick visit on a private guided tour,Learned a fair amount by spending just about an hour in this relatively small (compared to London) museum. The TATA family influence pervades here and you quickly get the vibe of their influence on the development of the country. If you are expecting British standards of exhibitions you will be disappointed but if you have an interest in a taste of multiple artefacts in a relatively compact space then this is a good visit.

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Myrddin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,what a surprise,"we hummed and ar'ed about the 500 rupee fee and eventually went in - what a good decision.  It's a museum dedicated to.....well hard to define really.  There's a lot of sculpture, some of it going back to the 3rd century.  There's some fantastic fabrics.  Weaponry dating back to when Europeans were still lobbing stones.  Pottery and ceramics; and a rather embarrassing 1960's style natural history section.The cafe is limited but amazingly cheap.   (two ice creams and a ltr of water 90 rupee!)You'll need at least 3 hours if not 4, or 5 if you want to read everything.  "

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,TravelproA,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Dual pricing system towards tourists is a rip off and total nonsense,"Used to be known as Prince of Wales Museum of Western India, is a big and main museum in Mumbai. The museum itself is very nice and the building housing the museum is also magnificent. Only thing do not appreciate is it charges the foreign tourists ten times higher than the local!"
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Trish W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Lots of completely different items to view,"It was on our list of ""must see's"" and it did not disappoint.  Extremely well laid out.  One of our favourite rooms was the ""print room"".  Another room, if you have children, is the painting/portrait gallery, they have seats along with paper & pencils for children to use, we saw several children ""having a go"" at copying the portraits.  Lovely museum, add it to your itinerary."

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Steve,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Spend half a day,"Do not, do not, miss spending time here! Buy the audio tour in your native language, and use it as a guide through what would otherwise be an overwhelming amount of historical and artistic information. And don't rush through. Seriously: if you eat breakfast and arrive when it opens, you could well remain until tea--and especially if you also visit the museum store (where there's a range of gifts from reasonably priced to expensive--and where your purchases drive funds into the museum and the local economy)."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,Ethelberga H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Super Museum,"Thisis a wonderful Museum in a fantastic building built during the 1900's and it was originally called Prince Edward Museum. King Edward 7th visited it on one of his journeys to India. The museum displays the history of India and of its many regions, so is vast and on many floors but it does have lifts. 500 rupees per person for foreigners. You can get an audio guide so you can go about in a few hours and see the main exhibits, but really it is a few days of looking, to do it justice. We so enjoyed seeing the artistic and decorative workmanship on weapons, materials, and masks. There is a natural history section too. There is a garden with trees, and shrubs and lots of lwan around the building. The shop is fairly new at the gateway to the museum and has a good selection of books and trinkets for sale."

I spent around 2-3 hours here, not reading everything but using the audio guide. The outside of the building is beautiful (with some interesting Dr Seuss-esque looking trees!) and inside you’ll find a wonder of artefacts and history, not just of India but other counties such as China and Japan. If you’re inclined to continue browsing museums, you can cross the road and see also the Museum of Modern Art.There are cafes around as well to grab a coffee or Masala Chai in between. "

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya,sm1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,"Interesting artefacts, haphazardly organized",The building is very beautiful but it seemed poorly maintained in some places with visible cracks and peeling off paint inside. The sculpture gallery was very good. The krishna and Buddhist art section was interesting. The natural history gallery was also cool.Some other galleries (particularly China/Japan sections) were presented more like household displays of the Tata family china- it could have been better arranged. The audio guide in English sounded like it was created exclusively for non-Indian tourists. The museum shop didn't carry anything specific to the museum- it just had general handicrafts.
