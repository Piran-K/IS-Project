Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus,Sheethal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Beautiful Architecture,"The Terminus is a very old building that has managed to serve its purpose (of being a train station) ever since it was established. The left side of the building is where the main train station is (advisable to go in from 11-4 for much less crowd). On the right side of the building, there is a museum detailing the history of the terminus. Here, visitors can pay a small fee to enjoy guided tours of the entire building. The guide is very entertaining and passionate about the building and explained everything clearly. He pointe.d out many key but small details regarding the architecture of the building. Highly recommend going here :-)"

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus,niruDurbs,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Very impressive ,"Mumbai airport is really amazing. I’ve been visiting India annually from 1992 and I must say that Mumbai airport can compare with some of the best international airports. Facilities are modern, service is great, design and decor is stunning. The lounges are excellent. Visited the business class lounge and had from the wide spread of good food. I only wish that there would be more officials at immigration so the queues could move faster. Duty free is also impressive. I found an amazing food court when you exit the airport and lots of varieties to choose from at very affordable prices. Do take care while out and about in Mumbai city though because pick pocketing is getting rife."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus,Maria B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,wonderful architecture,There are trains leaving to and from this station to all over the country. Very busy place but take time to look up and appreciate the architecture of this train terminus from in and outside
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus,runaway bride,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,lovely architecture,"The only reason i give star that because their lovely architecture . It's formerly known as Victoria Terminus Station, in Mumbai, is an outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture. Talking about real condition , this is the busiest terminal in mumbai . It's very crowded and congested especially in weekend but they have nice facility for waiting room and washroom even not so clean but at least available."
Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus,Jaideelion,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Access, service and control","The terminus is very busy and also not very managed. Morning traffic to arrive the terminal is so bad that people have to get off about half a km off and pull their bags to the station and then to the platform. There are no directions to the platforms or an information screen to tell the travellers which train goes where. The only people who seem to know all are porters who start by asking 500 rupees for any platform. Then negotiation starts. The figure stipulated by the IR is 200 rupees. Imagine is a porter gets 5 customers a day. Thats 1000 rupees and about 30,000 rupees a month. That is a hell a lot of money for porterage for about five minutes a trip. There must be a payment back to IR officials. The system can be improved a lot but will not be done. At 6 am on 30th November 2019, there was only one xray machine working and no control as to whose bag was loaded. People were jumping over us to load their own bags first. Just imagine the chaos where 10000s of pax are getting late for their trains. The system can be stream lined by not allowing any vehicle inside the terminus and all drop off on the left side of the Road and vehicles to keep moving, but it will not happen.So advice to all travellers, arrive early not by your standards but by Indian standards, push yourself in front of bossy pax and most importantly, get a poter. Pay 200 rupees and just follow him. A well spent 200 rupees."
