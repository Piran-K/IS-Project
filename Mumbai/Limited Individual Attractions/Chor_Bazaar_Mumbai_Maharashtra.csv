Chor_Bazaar,SalimM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A bit of everything,"Mumbai's Chor Bazaar is the pride of the city in terms of shopping. Located in South Mumbai, Chor Bazaar literally translates to 'thieves market' and is home to many stolen goods. You will usually find shopaholics rummaging for goods at throwaway prices. From antiques to Victorian furniture and fashion to electronics, a wide array of goods available here is staggering. Most of the shop-owners are used to the whims and fancies of the shoppers; therefore, if you are good at bargaining, then this might be the place to be! Chor Bazaar is also one of the busiest places in this city. It was bedlam during our trip.Once in Chor Bazaar you will find yourself surrounded by Muslim architecture buildings and surrounding. Located on Mutton Street, the area is full of dilapidated buildings, crowded streets and crumbling shops, retaining a bit of the old world charm. Most of the lanes are crammed with vendors selling all sorts of goods at very fluid prices."
Chor_Bazaar,Balakrishnan I,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Worth a Visit,"For just a travel buff, a visit to this  would be worth it, as one can see all sort of Antique and other old items, coupled with a lot of goods which would have been pinched off somewhere. The best part is one can just roam around the place and venture into shops without buying anything. One needs to careful wiith his belongings (Specially Wallets and Mobiles)."

Chor_Bazaar,Jack S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,Nothing for tourists from what I experienced ,"Despite reading in guide books that this market was a great place for tourists looking to pick up souvenirs, I found that this was not the case. As my Uber driver told me, I discovered that the Chor Bazaar was largely for spare parts for cars and bikes etc. After a good deal of exploration, I concluded that there was nothing for me to see.  I could be, however, wrong on this information - but I coney my personal experience "
Chor_Bazaar,Ethelberga H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Very Busy Antique Market,"We visited here and came by taxi and the taxi driver told us to watch our pockets. This market has lots of stalls and shops and is famus for antiques. We saw lots of old furniture, metal statues of goddesses and guradians piled high as well as musical instruments, bells and all types of vases. How much is really antique we didn't know, but the prices wre very high so we bought nothing however the market was very very busy with stalls selling food and drinks.  Dress modestly as it is in the Muslim quarter of Mumbai.  Enjoyed the experience, but again rubbish about on corners of streets."
Chor_Bazaar,Harsh V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Good and technical place,Many people want to visit Chor bazaar of Mumbai because the phone price are less than market price and many interest are there to buy like apple watch I see in market price 1000 rupee it original cost is more than 5000 thousand so imagine the cost different of other things you will get every electronic item in this bazaar beware of pocket cutter in market keep your wallet in your hand or in front pocket not in back pocket the place is very interesting to visit must visit the place

Chor_Bazaar,Kerry553,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Treasures,This place has a few little shops that have great treasures.  It's not a tourist trap and we didnt go on a Friday so wasnt too busy. 
Chor_Bazaar,kdowell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,My kind of bazaar,"After touristy markets in Jaipur and the chaotic Chandni Chowk in Delhi, Chor Bazaar was a refreshing change.  It wasn't too crowded and since it isn't a tourist destination there aren't any hawkers or people pawing at you.  Not a single, ""it costs nothing to look"" was to be heard.  The market has alot of things you want with little of the things you don't.  For me that was antiques, sporting goods, vintage cameras, vintage posters.  My recommendation is to arm yourself with google and check the prices of things.  Haggle your way to bargain."
Chor_Bazaar,devinder s,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Collector  Paradise,Slot is associated with chit bazar. It's nice to spend some time on a Friday there  looking around for  vintage items and collectible. Look for bargains with  dealers.  If lucky you may find great  items of your own interest
Chor_Bazaar,Adventure201599,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Full on bargain hunting,"Step into Chor Bazaar ( Mutton St for retro/ antiques) - the number of small shops has unique and vintage Raj, brass and mid century collectibles , great tins, Air India, Bollywood posters. There is literally something for every collector that your not going to find elsewhere. Prices are cheaper than Australia and negotiable but traders understand the unique nature of their stock. In saying that I did find an old Seiko Pepsi Chronograph $500 AUD cheaper than online. Some traders are a bit reserved, but I had a great experience with Mustafa st Antique Paradise ( trustworthy and fair). The Bazaar is an intense sensory experience and make sure you know where your wallet is located. Hotel drivers don’t like the Bazaar as there is no commission for them. Take a punt - you’ll love it if your a genuine collector"
Chor_Bazaar,TylerFlorence28,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Definitely worth one hour visit,"If you look for a colorful market, crowded and bustling, full of old things and antiques, this is a place to pass one hour or so.We came here 2 times, bought several old watches and compasses, some cutlery.

(Not the people)Especially on Fridays Chor Bazaar is more chaotic because of Friday Bazaar"
Chor_Bazaar,Irshad Shaikh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Chor Bazar at 4am,"Chor bazar aka Thieves Market, situated near Grant Road station & the close to the famous brothel of Mumbai, Kamatipura aka Peela House. Generally its an open market just like any other however its known for the market which takes place every Friday morning from 4am till 6am. This day & hour, just carry cash & do windown shopping. You won't find what you have on mind but you'll definitely find something that's worth your yawn. The type of goods you can expect at this place depends on the time of the season. As of now (in December), there are winter jackets that you can use in Switzerland at dirt cheap price, some electronic items, shoes, etc. The price is really good only if you're good at bargaining. & its safe even at 4am. Though its night time, you'll have a hard time walking down the streets as just like you, there will be many others doing the same. "
Chor_Bazaar,Alanthebairn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Also knownas the Thief's Market,"Busy bustling street market where you can buy anything from a pin to an anchor and many many things in between.Not the place to pick up your holiday souvenirs.

Chor_Bazaar,F S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,A true place for Shopaholics!,"One of the oldest markets in Mumbai, Chor Bazaar (Thieves’ Market) has a fascinating history that dates back to over 150 years. Located in South Mumbai, Chor Bazaar is a place to find stolen goods, just as the name suggests. You will usually find shopaholics thronging here as the goods can be bought here at throwaway prices. From antiques to Victorian furniture and fashion to electronics, a wide array of goods are available in this fascinating market.Note: On Fridays the market remains closed."
Chor_Bazaar,Gem B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,Antiques and Treasures,"I really loved this market because it offered something different from the usual markets. Antiques, furniture and treasures, I could easily have spent a few days in there hunting for gems to take home. Go to Mini Market. This is a 4th generation family business and they had the best selection of small items. Another good thing about this market is you don’t get hassled by begging rings."
Chor_Bazaar,Zarilla,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Only if you are in the area,"Its a maze of narrow bustling streets lined with stalls. They are filled with what we have discarded in the west, and people spend hours taking them apart to salvage the components. More a demonstration of the cheapness of labour than anything else, the possibility of actually finding something attractive is small. Used cellphone batteries are far more common than anything that may have fallen off the back of a truck."
Chor_Bazaar,ManishMax,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,Antique lovers treasure,I had read many review's about this place. To my surprise its more decent than I thought. Small informal road side shops. The owners were a bit laid back.I found some real good antiques here and was done in 30 mins. All at a good bargain. It's a very safe place no issues at all.
Chor_Bazaar,Aman K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Everything cheap,"This is a market in Mumbai from which man's pocket can never be loose. It is cheaper than cheaper in Mumbai's biggest thief market. Clothing, electronic, household goods, daily necessities, etc., all get cheap. There is a good place to hang around, I came here and enjoyed it."
Chor_Bazaar,vinayak p,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Low price product,"Best time to go is in morning around 5 am only on friday. try to buy clothes and accessories and please avoid buying electronic, because its risky to buy there. or else its a best place to buy branded shoes, clothes, sports equipment. dont trust upon the rumor like don't take your bike or mobile because it will be stolen. its nothing like that, although its a crowded area so you must take of your belongings. don't pay higher price for the product, try to bargain at your best."
Chor_Bazaar,chakshu m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,The market that stands true to its name 'Chor Bazaar',"Chor Bazaar is one of the largest, bustling second hand markets in India. The english translation of name is ' Thieves Market' as almost anything and everything is sold here! It has fascinated me forever. It is located  near South Bombay’s crowded Bhendi Bazaar.  This is one of the most interesting places in Bombay. This market is stocked up  with antique and vintage second-hand goods. These are purchased as home decor or are hired by producers for shoots or by collectors..You will get all you want here, from spare tyres to vintage lamps to unique Bollywood posters. Be prepared to spend a lot of time sifting through the numerous things and start working on your bargaining skills.And even though there is plenty to buy here, I walked around these lanes pleasing my camera."
Chor_Bazaar,Clemence J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,"Fantastic, Crazy Place - but Buyer Beware!!","Chor Bazaar is an incredible place that is divided into many different areas - from car parts to fabulous brass novelties. Be prepared to bargain & it is very much buyer beware. Watch out for the Oriental Arts & Crafts store(s) - there is no guarantee of the authenticity of what they sell & DO NOT get things posted back to your home country by them as they do not insure for damage or offer any form of follow up in case of mishap. Aside from that, it is fun to hunt for a bargain & carry out something unique from one of the other stores ..."
Chor_Bazaar,AucklandWiz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Fun To Poke Around In With Good Local Photo Opportunities,"I had read about this bazaar prior to going to Mumbai with mixed reviewsWe hired a driver and car and this was just one of the stops that day. Parking is pretty difficult in this area so we made sure we had the drivers number so we could contact him if we lost him in the traffic. This proved to be a good idea as we did indeed have to call as there is more than one way in and out.Firstly the buildings in this area are pretty ramshackle. They look like a bomb has gone off. Apparently they have started to pull down some of the ancient buildings and we were told by a stall holder that they are going to pull down all the buildings to make way for new development.The day we were there is was very hot and the stores are in the open.The whole bazaar is really interesting. Lots of stalls selling all sorts. Lots of junk like a fan shop with old rusty fans and bits of fans in it, or the clock shop that has clocks that have been sitting exposed for some time and have corroded. Not great for tourists but interesting and I found myself asking myself ‘who would buy this stuff’ and ‘how would they make any money selling this stuff’ ?There are alleys of particular goods like the alley with all old car parts in it or one with old tools in it. There are also lots of stores with Indian statues, art, pictures, paintings, and decoration pieces. Now most of these proprietors will tell you that all these pieces are old. Some you can clearly see are old, pictures in old dusty frames and things that were clearly left over from the British days. But I would say most are reproductions.You are better to believe that most of the pieces are actually new and know they are good at making things look old. The thing is that while they are telling you how old things are, you are disbelieving in your own head which makes for a confusing shopping experience.I was looking at a piece in a store that I was told was old and that they had a bigger warehouse within the bazaar and to have a look. We didn’t think we could lose anything by looking and so walked to the warehouse. This place had 100s of pieces and we were told how old everything was and where they were from like off old temples etc. we knew they couldn’t be that old etc.- the law wouldn’t allow it. We decided to ignore the hype of age of the pieces etc. and decided if we saw something we wanted, we would decide what we thought a fair price if it was new without all this inflated history.In this warehouse I found a head that I fell in love with and offered a price I thought was fair. Once payment was made I had to hope that it would find itself to our country as I had him send it to me as it was too big and heavy.It has arrived as promised.We did take some photos of some items and later showed these to a very old reputable antique dealer in another part of the country and he verified our hunches- these things were not ancient artifacts as we were told. In actual fact this dealer had the same exact article and the prices were similar but the age was not.. they were not  as old as the man from Chor claimed- as I knew and thought.We were told that lots of hotels and drivers will say not too go to Chor as its too dangerous.We didn’t feel one ounce of danger. Yes it was dusty and we were sold to but as long as you are sensible as you should be any place you travel to or visit, this is a good place to wander, take in the sights, pet the goats, take photographs and watch the life of the market unfold. We didn’t get to see everything so not sure if the rest of the market holds anything else. It is a place to go for different souvenir type items but beware of the not so true sales spins, bargain hard and look around and compare goods and prices before purchasing anything.Just another worthwhile interesting experience."
Chor_Bazaar,TravellerMentor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,Shopping center!,"This place is a market where you will different electronic products used and unused ,Chinese products some of cheap  quality while some are good,you will all household ,electronic and other product over here."
Chor_Bazaar,Hooggenoeg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,Great place - if you know where to go!,"I visit Chor (thieves) bazaar every time I visit India, if only to see the antique glass and furniture.  There are a lot of fake furniture and glass-ware around, but in Mutton street you can find antique Osler and Baccarat glass and chandeliers, being sold by the Maharajas who do nor want to be seen to sell their family heirlooms.  I have bought lots of Osler from Kassim."

In this ""thief"" bazaar, you may find auto parts, furniture, clothes, a variegated realm of utensils, people skinning a little lamb, great food, plants, and so on.

Chor_Bazaar,Kanika Mohan Saxena,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Friends,Too much price for little value ,Have visited this place a few times but this time when I went there I found it very steep . The prices were way ahead than the product . There is a thin line of difference between antique and that which they make new and call antique . I took a few friends and went to look for furniture and knick knacks and I found the sellers also very unfriendly . Their approach was very callous and not welcoming . You can get better stuff in other places than the chor bazar . Nothing great to visit any more besides the 4 lanes of mutton street ... 
Chor_Bazaar,TravvelBug,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Business,Where everything comes to roost,"This use to be called "" Thieves Market"" because anything stole in Mumbai would usually end up here within 48 hours, must to the chagrin of the owner.  Now it is thrifting on steroids.  The market is separated by many sections, auto, interior, exterior, tools, clothing, vintage..all second hand.  The great thing is for vintage hunters, this is a bargain waiting to happen, if you love to barter and bargain, this is your place to be.  The downside, it is very very large, and hot and remember whatever you buy you will need to schlep it back to your hotel- otherwise, happy shopping."

Chor_Bazaar,Robban68,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016,Worth a visit,"The Chor bazaar has a great history and it´s well worth a visit. You can buy plenty of ""antiques"" here, very well made copies. It´s not a ""cosy"" feeling here, but you don´t want to miss it."

Chor_Bazaar,shyamrupani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Get old whay u need and cheap too!,"Looking for antiques, second hand bikes, Photographs of English Rule and Maharajas of India, Old guns,Gramophone records of your favorite Hindi singers of 50's etc?You may not find these easily anywhere in India and may have to go on a hunt.No need- just go to Chor Bazar in South Mumbai's Pydhonie area. In Hindi Chor means thief- but it is neither a market by thieves or of stolen goods.It is just a fancy attractive name for an open air market from 10 am to 8pm.I bought Cricket stumps for 30 rupees each- similar goods in a sports shop were Rs 250! If you get tired, good non veg restaurants are close bye.Good luck!!"
Chor_Bazaar,Anto O,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016,Everything ends up here,"Chor Bazaar (Thieves Market) is one of Mumbai's unmissable experiences. If you want to see what happened to your ancient hard-drive, here's where you'll see it being broken up. Ditto cars, motorbikes, bits of buildings, clothes, anything you can imagine. It's a source of amazing antiques, both genuine and fake. There are also some good street restaurants and excellent chai wallahs. Allow at least a morning to explore it. "

Chor_Bazaar,savio_pinto12,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,The biggest Flea Market in Town,There is a great history that lies behind this place.It was actually know as Shor Market which means noisy market as it is still one of thr biggest flea market in the country.The Shor Market was misinterpreted as Chor on account of their accent and hence derived the Name Chor Market.As said earlier it is the biggest flea market in the country where bargaining of anything and everything is at its glory.Most of the goods sold out here are stolen and hence one can get a very comparative rates for everything.Worth a visit at least once a while when you are in Mumbai.
Chor_Bazaar,GauravChand,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Friends,Everything old an new old,"A visit to Chor Bazaar can take you back in time.  It you are looking for antiques this is the place to visit.  It is a crowded area and not clean at all.  There are tiny shops all around full of dusty antique wares of all kinds... chairs, tables, lamps, chandeliers, gramophones, glasses, dishes, auto parts, cameras ... Just about any thing you can think of. Even something you would consider junk has value here.  But be ready to negotiate cause you can easily buy a brand new antique at a high price.  A lot of  interior designers source their items from here."
Chor_Bazaar,eruditer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,Chor Bazar- A Treasure Hunter's Paradise,"As per the folk-lore, when Queen Victoria landed at Mumbai port, her belongings and violin got lost while unloading.These were later found in Chor Bazar. This may not be true. However, the name appears to be corrupted by British from ""Shor Bazar"" (Noisy Bazar) to Chor Bazar( Thief's Bazar).Chor bazar,is  located  in the narrow by-lanes of Mohammad Ali road, near Bhendi Bazar in South Mumbai. Chor Bazar is an 'organised' flea market that offers everything for ""connoisseurs"" as well as the bargain-hunter. The experience of scouting and exploring the market amidst the call for the faithful, din of cars getting stripped down and incessant haggling gives you a shopping experience unlike you have ever experienced.Most of fine-dining eateries, pubs  and happening places in Mumbai make up their decor with artifacts from Chor Bazar.Chor Bazar offers you antiques, brass items, big clocks, chandeliers, furnitures, automobile parts, old cameras, gramophones, Bollywood posters, LP viny records and other knick knacks. You will require lot of patience and fortitude to strike a deal without being ripped-off. Most of these businesses have been handed over from generations to generations and the sellers are adept sellers.If you are seeking a ""Bambiya"" shopping-experience on the streets, make time to visit the Chor Bazar."
Chor_Bazaar,essexdean,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Couples,Bizarre Bazaar,"Our guide called this the Thief's Market, insinuating that most of the goods had been stolen & were being sold on. I'm glad we had him with us, as I'd easily have got lost roaming around the vast streets. You really can buy anything here, from antiques to parts of dismantled cars. They were literally hacking cars apart in the street, and taking the parts to their relative shops. You have to see it to believe it"
Chor_Bazaar,Rahul P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,Good place to buy antiques,"This is a good place to buy antiques. However the charm of it has diminished over the years. But still one can find old gramophones, silver and gold antique jewellery etc."
Chor_Bazaar,MalinBergman,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,Crowded and good antiques!,"A great place for getting a good view of an hectic crowded Indian flee market. You can find all kinds of things at the market, both good antiques and really bad dirty broken things. "
Chor_Bazaar,Traveleasy15,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014,Chor bazar,"previously very good place to buy antique items, and old items at cheaper rates, of course with ample bargaining. One should be cautious while purchasing for duplicates."
Chor_Bazaar,mukulsjain,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Solo,unique experience,Place is full of people trying to pull one off. try not to buy anything important from the place. Great place to visit once to have feel of how a chor bazaar looks like and how it functions. Try to bargain as much as possible.
Chor_Bazaar,RaphaBarreto,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Business,Reality check,"I really love places that shows you the REAL deal about the place, not the touristy stuff. This place is a top one at that aspect. It is raw, smelly and quite unique. It is a trashy place which every block is especialized in something - from rubber to metal, from vintage clocks to marble. It is a great experience just to lose yourself in this immersive place. Book something quiet for afterwards - you will need to dig it all in."
Chor_Bazaar,Sushma S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Couples,Not very pleasing !!!!,"This place is best suited for those who wants to buy stuff related to their bikes and cars , some brass idols ,lamps and wood works  ( not many options though!!!!)........ we don't have options with respect to clothes , accessories and definitely no eating-joints !!!!!!"
Chor_Bazaar,Taylor L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Friends,"worth visiting, bargain hard almost as if you don't want it","BARGAIN BARGAIN BARGAIN HARD!!!  especially if you are a foreigner.The place is fun, and definately worth visiting. I know some local film people even some times would drop by to purchase or rent for props. But the vendors are smart to know that foreigners don't know a thing about antique. So they either charge extra or provide a counterfeit. But that still didn't make my experience there less ineresting as there are so much to see already! Even if I don't buy a thing. A must visit for old object lovers."
Chor_Bazaar,ThaiCookingRocks,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,Not for every one,"This is one of those places that you will enjoy it or you will hate it.Its crowded. Its smelly at times. Its chaotic. There seems to be no manner of rhyme or reason. Goods from the shops overflow onto the streets and everyone is hawking their wares. I was there with my 15 year old daughter and I was on high alert honestly, but there wasn't anything I sensed as danger, but it felt like there could be at any moment. My daughter was blissfully unaware as she dug through albums, stage lights, cameras, bike parts, plaster statues and so much more."
Chor_Bazaar,sahilagarwal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Solo,Good place to get antique furniture,If you are looking for unique antique furniture pieces or lamps do go to the chor bazaar. It takes a little bit of hunting but you may end up with something incredibly beautiful. We bought a vintage chest for a reasonable price. Be sure to bargain!! And do carry a bottle of water

Chor_Bazaar,MohanAmin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014,"If yiou can not get it here, you will never get it anywhere.","Visit to Mumbai city without visiting Chor Bazar is incomplete. You will find everything and anything here' !. There is a saying goes ' If you can not get it here, you will never get it anywhere '.  Years ago, I had to set up a guest house at Goa for my company with all the antique furniture and things and I found the old antique wall clock only at Chor Bazar without which our guest house would not have been completed !

Chor_Bazaar,intrepidtraveller288,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Friends,"Fantastic find, though bustling and be prepared to bargain!","A great spot to find unusual and interesting items - ranging from auto parts to household and antiques, old Bollywood posters and records to wholesale kitchen items. We came as a group, the highlight was the fresh street food and snacks. Be prepared to bargain hard and to walk into the rabbit warren to find the interesting stuff. A fun experience! "
Chor_Bazaar,vinodkhedkar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Solo,Thief Market,"This place in South Mumbai is a market for antique and cheaper goods. This place's real name is Bara Imam road but since goods use to come here for sale from unknown sources.Hence it was called Chor Bazar means Thief's market. You will find automobile accessories, cloths,antiques etc for sale. You should have good bargaining skill. It's a very dense place,hence avoid taking your vehicle. Credit cards are not accepted. Few food stalls are also there."
Chor_Bazaar,Miotoni,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Business,Stinks,I've been to a lot of rough bazaars in my day.  I quite enjoy them.  This one was many more downsides than good.  The filth and smell over powers any quality experience.
Chor_Bazaar,ARV2907,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Solo,Great Market for real and fake antiques!,"Chor Bazaar on Mutton Street is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon looking for bric-a-brac and collectibles for the home.  The place has some really good stores selling real and newly made but old looking (read: fake) antiques. They also have furniture stores specialising in antique looking and old style furniture which they can also make according to your specification. But beware and polish your bargaining skills as they shopkeepers here tend to quote preposterous prices, especially if you are a foreigner. But all in all a fun place."
Chor_Bazaar,Sajeed K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Solo,Not Thieves Market (Chor Bazar) Bit Shor Bazar (Noisy Market),"It is very old market. It's name literally means Thieves market. it was originally called Shor Bazaar, meaning ""noisy market"", but ""shor"" became ""chor"" because of how the British mispronounced the word. Mutton Market, Chappal Market and Many Markets are in this area. The area is full of crowded streets and crumbling buildings, and can be a little overwhelming. Don't be daunted though, it's quite safe but do be careful of pickpockets. Prices at Chor Bazaar are very fluid and will depend on how good your bargaining skills are (or aren't!)."
Chor_Bazaar,Balvinder S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Solo,Beaware of Pick Pockets,"The area is full of crowded streets and crumbling buildings, and can be a little overwhelming. Don't be daunted though, it's quite safe but do be careful of pickpockets.The area is still worth a visit on Friday when it comes alive with the Juma Market. This is the real thieves market. From sunrise on Friday morning, vendors cram the lanes selling all kinds of goods, many of them stolen. You'll have to get there early to get the best stuff"
Chor_Bazaar,andy p,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Business,"theives market, how appropriate","The food is good but watch your bill. Attempted to overcharge us by 2000 hkd. An honest mistake, I don't think so"
Chor_Bazaar,gammo,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,Not what I remember...,"Used to go as a kid three decades ago with my dad and buy China vases , chandelier spare orbs/crystals etc and it was a great memory. Took a German friend in November so he could experience a slice of ' OLD BOMBAY' but it was a waste of time and very disappointing...tons of junk for sale, the old shops selling worthwhile items are simply missing!!"
Chor_Bazaar,masaccio,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Great browsing,"I am somebody who like browsing around markets and Chor does take some serious growing as its enormous. You can easily walk away thinking that it's about car parts or some such, as you have not really wandered very far. I suspect that we only really saw a small part, but we did end up with a nice brass ""antique"". I have no idea whether is real or not, but I like it and it wasn't that expensive."
Chor_Bazaar,Nergish2014,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Friends,In my opinion...overhyped.,We spent 3 hours here looking for carved idols in stone which a friend in Pune wanted but found almost nothing worthwhile and realized that the place is basking in past glory. Lots of really rubbishy items for sale makes finding a worthwhile purchase a lottery.
