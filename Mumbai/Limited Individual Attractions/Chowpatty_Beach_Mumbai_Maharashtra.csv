Chowpatty_Beach,Pradipjiyog78,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Solo,Not great experience at Chowpatty Beach,Chowpatty beach which is one of the most iconic beach where people from all around the world come to visit has been not kept well.Beach is littering with full of garbage on the beach as well as in the water.The whole strech from mafatlal bath to the end is filled with all kind of garbage from platic to glass bottles which also harms the marine life in the water. Strict penalty should be imposed for littering anywhere not only chowpatty beach.In that way the beach can also be maintained amd we can also maintain the iconic value of the beach amd the beautiful Arabian Ocean. Prime minister Swacch bharat Abhyan should be strictly followed as its always said that Cleanliness is next to Godliness.Appropriate authority BMC should take strict cognizant of this and appropriate action should be taken

It has been a fashionable area dating back to the days of the British Raj. It still enjoys stunning views back to the Marine Drive area of the city. However, for the Western tourist, you are unlikely to be impressed by the thousands of bottles and plastic bags which clog the beach at low tide. Basically, the sight of hundreds of crows picking through the trash is not endearing. It is strongly recommended that staff be employed to clean up this beach. With a little loving care, this could be a real drawcard."

The culture is probably to throw everything on the ground.Chowpatty beach is definitely not a beach in the typical western sense of the concept. It's too dirty for a bath and there's no way you'll ever see anyone sunbathing here. In fact, the main interest of the beach is in the evenings and on Saturdays when the city's residents come here, in pairs or with the children, to take part in a variety of activities: eating, haircuting, cleaning ears, listening to street musicians, shooting the target, enjoying a massage and taking the children on a pony riding. Astrologers will be happy to advise you about your future... All this good around a beach covered with so much garbage which does not allow you to see the sand."

Now, it is very congested and not very clean. Nonetheless, the views are spectacular. If you like food stands, this is a great place to come.

Chowpatty_Beach,Chandleur,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017,Beach Mela (Fair),"This is brand Mumbai. Chowpatty is the common man's Champs Elysee. It has been made famous in song and Bollywood movies. The eating places have been moved under sheds and are no more in a queue as of yore. The beach is jam-packed in the evenings. Families and couples trample the beach in a Mumbaiiaa outpouring of camaraderie. This you have to do to be a part of the real Mumbai. If you go further left or right of Chowpatty you will find hundreds of groups of youngsters playing beach cricket.Sadly the beach is littered with garbage brought in by the tide. As the sea recedes it leaves the beach full of garbage bags and discarded human waste.I went there because of the romance attached to Chowpatty through Hindi movies of yore. Alas, this is something new, crowded, human but very littered. Arrive at your own risk but the rhythm of Mumbai can only be judged by being a part of this lively crowd."

Chowpatty_Beach,Prasanna1965,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Mumbai Beach,"This is located in heart of Mumbai city. It is a very famous tourist spot. It is usually very crowded in the evenings. There are plenty of rides for kids. Besides, there are various food stalls, where one can get diverse varieties of hot & cold as well as sweet & spicy typical Indian street food. Overall, it may be a good place to visit with kids, friends or families, if you have patience to deal with crowded places as well as patience to weather hot & humid climate, which may prevail there.

Chowpatty_Beach,bandagi123,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Garbage beach,I went here this December with high expectations as I have listened about this many times but reality is that it is a garbage beach full of litter.  Street food is average and this place is over rated.  Mumbai in all is disappointing.

Chowpatty_Beach,Mark S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,Didn't stay,"As an Australian I'd say this beach is nothing to write home about. Fine for some if their expectations are not too high, it's a beach, it has sand, the weather is warm. Not  a destination in its own right, except, perhaps, for Mumbai natives. We came and looked, but didn't stop."
Chowpatty_Beach,26mariannev,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,Street food!,"We went to Chowpatty Beach for supper and had vada pav and bhelpuri and ice cream from the food stalls. We bought from vendors who had lots of customers, as we had been advised. Lovely, authentic experience and highly recommended."
