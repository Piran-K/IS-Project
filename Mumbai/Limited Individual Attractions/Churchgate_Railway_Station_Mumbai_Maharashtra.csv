Churchgate_Railway_Station,Radhika Narasimhan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Friends,Awesome station lighting,"This is my first time to Churchgate station today. Since I travelled in the evening I got to see the old British architecture building, covered by trees in the front. Thinking it to be an iconic spot I clicked the pic. While returning back to catch a train from the station, my eyes widened and in awe I stood for how long admiring the building I don’t know. Lovely colouring enhancing the lovely parts of the building that before getting into the local train I clicked the pic. One such place to visit after sunset to have a glimpse of the lighting’s."

It is one of the busiest stations, millions of people travel through the daily to commute to the offices / business centers as well as nearby tourist spots like Nariman Point, Gateway of India, Flora Fountain, CSTM, Fashion Street and Colaba Market.

Churchgate_Railway_Station,Naresh S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,GOOD APPEARANCE BUT INADEQUATE FACILITIES !,The station premises are clean and tidy. The train indicators are working properly. Water and eating facilities are located in proper places without hindering the incessant traffic flow. The platforms are on both sides enabling the travelers to alight and get in the trains without inconvenience. Police help is available on the platform for twenty-four hours. But there are NO ADEQUATE LAVATORY FACILITIES. It was better in earlier times when lavatories were provided with self-cleaning water flows with sensors. Genuine passengers suffer on account of this. THESE FACILITIES SHOULD BE FREE ON EACH AND EVERY STATION FOR GENUINE PASSENGERS.

Churchgate_Railway_Station,Deborah K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,If you are remotely clastrophobic - avoid,"The terminal building itself is nothing to write home about - the experience of travelling on a train through Mumbai is one I'd wished not to have had.  The first station where we boarded - Churchgate - was fine for crowding, but I swear each successive station saw another 20-50 men get on the train to the point where they were hanging out the door.  I was travelling with my Son and 2 young women - that made exactly 3 women in the carriage we were in.  I found the number of people, the closeness of it all, the lack of air flow terrifying.  I'm sorry to say my Son has now experienced his Mum having a major panic/anxiety attack.  I would not recommend train travel in India for a Westerner, especially one with claustrophobic tendencies."

Churchgate_Railway_Station,Jan O,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Go here to see the Dabbawahlers!,"You need to be here at around 11 am Monday to Friday (not bank holidays) to see the Mumbai lunchbox men.  This system employs 5000 men and is unique to Mumbai.  You need 30 - 60 mins to watch and understand what is going on.  During this time you can get some amazing photos of these guys but you will be constantly pestered by hawkers.  Do not buy anything or you'll never get rid of them.  Read up about this fascinating system of delivering lunches before you go so that you have a good idea of what's going on - unless you have a guide to explain it to you.  They are happy to have their photos taken but few speak good English and, let's face it, they are trying to do their job, which involves a very complicated system to ensure that the right tiffin box gets to the right person miles across the city."

The regularity of the trains, each pouring our myriads of coommuters all charged to go to their workplaces, this is no place for the strolling hang-outer... beware you may be elbowed by a serious faced secretary dashing to clock in... It is actually fun witnessing the spectacle. Such motivated workers... And while you are watching you may sip some coffee at the stall or go across the road for a nice dosa breakfast. Peak hours are 9 to 12 noon and then the entire crowd starts going home from 4 to 8 PM. Even a toe-hold on a train is good enough for some. Huge risk but many would rather that than wait 5 minutes for the next train... And some have a long long commute ahead. "

Churchgate_Railway_Station,KrispyPlymouth,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Calm and quiet on a Sunday,"As a British tourist I thought the train station would be a bit overpowering on a week day, but on a Sunday it was nice and quiet. I only wanted to go one stop, to Marine Lines, so I could walk down Marine Dri e to see the Art Deco buildings.The ticket was 5 rupee, I bought it at the ticket counter, rather than try the machine. Although I had been told to take a train from platform 1 or 2 I asked some cricket players if I was on the right train. These teenage boys were delightful, assured me I was on the right train, then reminded me when my station came up, even though it was very obvious as there are announcements on the train. These guys are a credit to their country as they were so polite and caring.A lovely, calm introduction to the Mumbai train system!"
