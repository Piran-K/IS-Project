Colaba_Causeway,Acineto,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Busy area,"The causeway just really busy with newer shops as well as a street market and plenty of restaurants. It is quite an experience since the place is very packed with stalls on either side of the footpath, so pedestrians have a narrow path to go in either direction. The road is quite busy, but some people were walking on the street side, but you do lose the experience.The stalls sell a variety of items like clothes and accessories to pans and fruit. The shops are also accessible if you're able to get through the crowds to the store entrances.There are plenty of things to experience around here and worth a visit if you're in the area, particularly if you have come from the Gateway of India."

Colaba_Causeway,prannnn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Street Shopping,"This is one of the prominent places in south Mumbai and well known among the locals for street shopping. One can easily reach this place via public and private transportation. The nearest station being CST. As for private transport is considered, the entire onus of parking would be left to the owners itself which is a bit challenging given the fact the streets are arrow and extremely crowded. Weekends are the best time to visit this place in case you happen to be a shopping fanatic and you have plenty of options in terms of clothes, food, shoes etc. Ensure that you carry a lot of cash as most of the shopping will be done using cash and no digital payments. One thing that you need to ensure is you have to bargain heavily to get your stuff at a good price as the shopkeepers will always quote at a very high initial price. Unfortunately, thing have changed over the past few years as the crowds have dwindled a lot, thanks to the upcoming of malls, online shopping etc. But in any case, if you are still interested in bargaining and street shopping and happen to be in and around south Mumbai, then this would be an ideal place to visit."
Colaba_Causeway,Thomas J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Good old Causeway,"Go there for the hustling pedestrian street market for cheap clothes/antiques/watches/shoes etc etc. Thumb rule when you buy is never to agree to the price of the seller how much ever the price sounds rite,  always quote your best price and start with 60-70% less of the quoted price,  you will definitely get good deals and done amazing products in antiques. Girls who like imitation jewelry will love the place. Best time to visit us during late evening where the chances of getting a higher discount is more as the sellers are about to wind up. Note - If you are from a foreign place and do not like a product you can confidently move away from that place even if the seller aggressively tries to get you buy the product. And to end it all would like to post something which got my attention in one of the shops there was a writing which said ""CUSTOMER IS KING AND KING DOESN'T BARGAIN""Well I responded back to the seller saying. EVEN THE KING IS A HUSBAND xDHappy Shopping"

One outfit I loved was too small on me, but my salesman was not easily deterred. He figured out that it could be fixed, so he called in his tailor. They said they would remove the zipper on the pants, insert a triangle of fabric on each leg, and put in an elastic waistband. Oh, and deliver it to my hotel in 2 hours! I agreed.  For these services I paid $10. Yup. I also bought a beautiful tunic with pants and 2 saris.

Colaba_Causeway,Mark R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Couples,Average shopping. ,"After reading in travel blogs and travel books that Colaba Causeway was great for shopping and for restaurants I was really disappointed by what we actually got. Essentially it was the same 6 stalls on a variance up and down the road. The restaurants are few and far between too, not what we expected. "

Colaba_Causeway,222nay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,Food.. shopping.. gossip,You will see people from all around the world shopping from clothes to junk jewellery to footwears of different colours and designs. Great collection at very good price. You name it and they will have it to offer you. There are many eating joints too to fetch something if u get hungry while shopping. Very well located in the heart of the main city.
Colaba_Causeway,Malini N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,The flavour of old Mumbai,"Colaba Causeway is a lovely street to laze around, shop for little gifts, clothing and jewellery from the road side, as well as hop into old eateries and cafes to taste a variety of tantalizing food! You also get to pick some really good restaurants to suit various budgets in and around this place. It is also a stone's throw away from the iconic Taj Mahal Palace & Towers and the sea is right round the corner along with the Gateway of India. Depending on the time of the day you can also catch a boat ride from the ferry wharfs. You can pick up modest Kurtas, comfortable pants, tee shirts, traditional imitation jewellery, lovely little craft and gift items etc. The vendors who have been around for ages, are open to bargaining and you can manage a good deal. I have found most of the stuff from here to be of good quality. You will generally find the shop-keepers friendly and helpful. The quaint ambience of old Mumbai is really a wonderful experience. If it is summer time remember to carry a cap and water - it can get really hot and sweaty!"
Colaba_Causeway,Graham P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Solo,GREAT SHOPPING,"The Causeway is a street market area (one side only) full of great little gift and souvenir shops. There is a good variety of clothing as well as toys and mementos on offer as well as some food stalls. McDonalds, Café Leopold and Mondy's Café are also located on this strip.Just slightly off the strip is a wonderful jewelry shop with fantastic prices. Worth a visit.. I bought a nice marble elephant there for a good price.This is well worth visiting. Note that the market does not really start until around 12 noon and goes late into the night. When it is crowded (like anywhere), its best to watch out for pickpockets. Keep your valuables such as phones and wallets safe."
Colaba_Causeway,gapkenyagayle,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,Good for a wander.,Lots of shops and small market stalls worthy of a browse and a haggle. Places to eat and a supermarket. Road itself is always busy with traffic but I liked the business and hustle and bustle of the Causeway.

Colaba_Causeway,elvin2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,A SLICE OF MUMBAI,"Colaba Causeway is one among the iconic spots that define the character and vibrancy of Mumbai (Bombay). It is always teeming with tourists and local shoppers which makes it crowded with very little personal space which too is a trait of Mumbai. In days of yore it was a prestigious place to live, being very very close to Bombay University the High Court, the Cathedral colleges, library and art galleries Today it is fully commercial, with one side covered with  street stalls selling artificial jewellery, handicrafts, old coins, curios, antiques,  artefacts, casual wear,  souvenirs,etc. This is the crowded part.. One needs to heavily bargain here and it is quite possible to walk away paying even half or a third of the quoted price.(Foreign tourists please note this) . One cannot be sure about the genuineness of any branded stuff or antique sold on these footpaths.However, apart from the footpath, are regular shops on either side selling genuine branded clothes, footwear, accessories, fabrics as also many eateries to suit all budgets and tastes.( Leopolds, Churchill, Delhi Durbar, Food Inn, Cafe Mondegar, Kamat's...to name a few) There are economically priced hotels on the side roads as also the iconic Taj  Mahal Hotel and the Gateway of India closeby.In fact this area is at one end of the 'heritage precinct' that stretches from here right up to Crawford Market, via Flora Fountain and Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus, with beautiful  and historic buildings with Gothic and Indo-Sarcenic  architecture. Spend a little time here and you will get an idea of how Mumbai ticks"

Colaba_Causeway,Jainthi M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Need more space to walk!!!,"The area has a lot to offer. However, there should be better planning to allow for walking on pavement. Many street stalls hinders the movement of people. maybe shop names & addresses should be displayed at entrance of area. sometimes you can run around before finding your desired shop. "
