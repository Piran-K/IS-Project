Colaba,Munna,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021,Best place to spend a day!!,"Colaba is one place where you can spend a day. Be it shopping, sight seeing , restaurant hopping or a mix of all these(which is usually do) , be it anything! You can spend an entire day roaming around this place. When I visited Colaba in 2013(college time), we visited every single shop in the Colaba market looking out for the best of the best available here. Frankly speaking, I got some best stuff at best rates(even at Rs 50) which I still use. If you have time to go through the shops and bargain with the shopkeepers, then Colaba market is one place you shouldn't miss in your shopping list. Second time we visited this place, we did some sight seeing and tried to make some memories. You can enjoy the best sights of Taj Mumbai and Gateway of India in Colaba. (I recommend going here in the morning to get the best experience because it becomes too crowded in the evening ). Coming to food, we have been to Leopold's cafe(yum food + the popularity of being attacked by terrorists in 2008 makes it a must visit place) and Delhi Durbar which servers some average Mughalai and North Indian stuff(the interiors are done like a typical Indian restaurant). Altogether, Colaba is one of the best  places in Mumbai to spend a day with friends, be it walking through the streets or getting some food !! It gives a pleasant experience for tourists. On the way back to the hotel, we spent few hours in Marine Drive, Mumbai in the evening as well which again adds up to the experience!"

There is a lot to see and do here.The waterfront has a fish market that is interesting to visit. Many boats are in the area of all shapes and sizes, also interesting to see. We checked out some of the shops but didn’t try any of the street food or eat in any of the restaurants. Conditions seemed iffy to me at many of them.Walking along the streets, there are many old buildings and mansions. Some are beautiful and seem to have been restored, while others are dilapidated and crumbling. Still, it is an area worth seeing and enjoying while in Mumbai."

He's the perfect travel guide because he's spent over 40 years living in Mumbai. He's an easy-going, down-to-earth kind of person who can answer so many of the questions that linger long after the last page of Shantaram has been read. I recommend Kishore above all the other offering higher-priced tours. The people he brings you to see are all welcoming, and all the places you go are steeped in history and lore. I cannot recommend this tour enough!"

Colaba,Payal G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Bombay blues,"The Colaba area is the starting point of any Mumbai/Bombay tour. With the Gateway of India, the Taj Palace hotel and the various museums, institutes and government bodies housed in colonial era buildings, the place still exudes the essence of the fable that was Bombay. It is also the location of landmark hangouts like the Leopold Cafe and Cafe Mondegar as well as the Regal and Eros cinemas. Over the recent years the area has earned infamy because of being the site for the 2008 terrorist attacks on Mumbai which targeted many of these places.This area is distinctly different from the rest of Mumbai in age and grandeur. Most of the old buildings lining the roads have heritage status. It is also the best area to study the varied architectural styles Bombay is famous for such as the Victorian Gothic, the Art deco etc.That said the roads can be very crowded because of the sheer number of eateries and streetshops packed into the area with several roads closed due to the construction work going on for the Metro. Parking can be a nightmare and it's best explored on foot. Still then a trip to Mumbai is never complete without exploring this area."

Colaba,Nomad Govind,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,Just explore the real Mumbai ,"I have extensively walked in Colaba and it's always energizing and never tiring. You will get all.kind of things here from the naval memorial to old Gothic culture buildings, new buildings , slum, garden , flea market and everything that you desire. You may visit during early morning or in the night. During summer , don't attempt if you are not habitual as it will be very tough and dehydrating. "
Colaba,DVRS,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Awareness to the members!!!!,We had a musical program in one of the hall on 1st floor n had to book through member. We had paid the amount in advance for 30 guests n had to pay for 5 guests We had kept hi-tea in which the snacks served were cold n chilli cheese toast was so dry n cold. After the program got over we tipped the waiters n were going to pay for the 5 guest n extra time charges in the office the waiters came with a water bill of 160/-then charging us 780/- for using 2 plug (both were  already paid) as they had taken advance n I showed them the bill. He said no this is DJ n these are extra n he dint know which plug points were used coz he said it can be any. When we refused to give he said ok we’ll charge in the members account. N we finally paidThis is just to bring awareness to the club n members for the hidden cost they charge after paying in advance

Colaba,Aryeman R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Good shopping options,The street side offers good shopping options much better than fashion street. Do make sure u bargain a lot.I always pick up some creative n chunky pendants and souvenirs for my friends who stay overseas. 
Colaba,Jarhmanite,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Can't say you have seen Mumbai if you havent been here,"So you dont really have to do anything you do not want to. For me strolling down this area with a stop at any eatery of choice is good enough... But if you are an accessory fan you wont be able to resist the huge variety of bargain accessories thrust at you. Indulge after a good haggle over the stated price.Or step into a store for a Mumbai souvenir.Stylish cotton clothes, funky jewellry, atmosphere, food, history. Colaba has it all"
