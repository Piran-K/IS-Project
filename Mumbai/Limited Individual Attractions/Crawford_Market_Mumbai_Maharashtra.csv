Crawford_Market,Melina Devi Seeam,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Disappointing,"This place was so confusing to get around. The quality of the products aren't that great and they aren't as cheap as you might think it is. From a distance, it could look ok but once you've had a close looks at the products it begins to look deceiving. We just left after a short while and decided to rather get to a mall or the shops on Veer Nariman road in Fort for better deals and good quality products."
Crawford_Market,Apolonia70,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,"Very busy market - street stalls, shops - fruit and vegetables","This was almost a full day city tour with guide Jayashree from Mumbai Wanderlust tours. Jaya was flexible with shopping locations - i wanted to see a variety of locations - Mall, stores and a market. We came to Crawford Market because it was best located to fit in the other places on my list.  I wanted to see the flower market but that happens much earlier and sellers are finished by the time tourists appear. So I had to settle for fresh produce and the general offerings on the street and shops we passed. The countless sellers sell everything from face washers ( i bought one to mop up perspiration - hot and humid) to fashion, leather goods, makeup and a mind-blowing range of items including cookware. It is a bustling market with locals buying here.  The prices were very reasonable and quality good.  My guide's advice on which stalls were reliable was useful.  I wish I had bought more but weight and luggage are always a problem.  It was fun exploring this market and i especially loved the quality of their fruit and nuts and dried fruit. It was Diwali so I bought a couple of lovely boxed fruit and nuts - freshly packed as you wait. The only thing that wasn't the best was seeing live animals in small cages - not only birds but cats and dogs.  The market has an old world vibe with no modern trappings - just hard working stall holders and lots to explore."
Crawford_Market,Anup K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Good market with variety,"For anyone visiting Mumbai and coming here as part of sight-seeing -- you dont need a guide.  You can enter and just browse around.  It's a market visited by locals from Mumbai.  Communication should not be a problem.  If you are at a place where you are unable to communicate, just walk away."
Crawford_Market,SalimM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Very busy and crammed,"Crawford Market, the largest market in Mumbai, is an incredible place to shop for food and household goods, take photos, or simply wander around people watching. It's also not a bad place to try local snacks, as there are myriad street-food stalls serving up all sorts of treats. Give yourself at least a couple of hours to wander slowly and see what is on offer."
Crawford_Market,igolfCA,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Too much,"This market is huge and has everything under the sun ...flowers, spices, fabric, fruits and vegetables, clothing, tea, pets and birds, sweets, and nuts. There are also cosmetics, perfumes, and handbags which seem to have good prices, but they are knock-offs. The whole place is dirty, crowded, and too much for me. One quick visit was enough."
Crawford_Market,Sanjeev Nanda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,A Day Of Adventure For The Thrifty,"A few months ago, before this outbreak of coronavirus was just a blur on the horizon, my friend and I were on the look out for decent lamps for our outdoor patio project. A friend of us suggested a place called the ""Chor Bazar"". While not unheard of by me, I was taken aback by the assurance of this friend of mine that I will find what I need over there. Me and Vivek (the project buddy) took a long drive from Andheri to South Mumbai, and finally reached the hallowed ground - the Crawford Market area (which is a lively fruit wholesale market by the wee hours of morning, and a front for the Chor Bazar, by the afternoon). Vivek and me parked at one of the many pay-n-parks around the location, and began our adventure on foot. While we eventually found our way to the many lamp dealers in the market, we were also greeted my honestly fascinating odds and ends all over the place. Home decor, electronics and dinner-sets galore - everything was unique to say the least. We could've wrapped the whole affair in an hours time, but somehow, three and a half hours proved insufficient. It was a hoot. A definite MUST visit for thrift shopping.~Sanjeev Nanda"
Crawford_Market,EtzyKetzy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Too many guides," We arrived at the market to be met by a guide who said he would show us around, we said we were happy to wander by ourselves - eh then showed us a sign stating that porters were mandatory but no payment was required.  He took us to a spice stall, a fruit and veg stall then hustled us along another aisle and then we were back at the entrance.....I wanted to see where the animals were so he grudgingly took us there.  Then he was not happy when we didn't pay him.  Not a great experience, I have been in far more interesting markets in the Far East and have never had a ""guide"" before.  The architecture is interesting but you can see that from the exterion, I wouldn't go back there."
Crawford_Market,David D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,An adventure in Mumbai,"Wednesday 4th March and we walked from CST Station to this old market, it took just over 10 minutes.Outside the market was chaotic with delivery lorries, taxis and tuk tuks all converging.It is best to ignore anyone who speaks to you at the entrance to the market. They are either trying to make tourists visit their shop and buy something, or to act as a Guide, then demand payment.Inside this old building are rows and rows of stalls selling, spices, fabrics, cosmetics, fruit & vegetables, sweets, clothing, nuts, foods and so much more.If you can't find what you are looking for here, then you wont find it in Mumbai.The metal grid supports the roof and the large lantern shaped lights.A must to visit when in Mumbai."
Crawford_Market,Ellen P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Huge market with a variety of things,"Went here as part of a tour. It is a huge market that sells lots of things, like fruits, spices & tea leaves, as well as pets. I bought a number of tea leaves packets cause it has a lot of variety & the price is much cheaper compared to the prices in the shops."
Crawford_Market,Brenda H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Good market,"This is a great market indoors with original features from early 19th century.Felt very safe with lors of little side stands selling fabulous spices, fabrics fruit, flowers. etc. We visited on a cruise but were not allowed much time to explore the area properly which was a shame."
Crawford_Market,Leonid,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Travel,"Very big market, but all products are the same. People are not pushy, but will take advantage of you in terms of price."
Crawford_Market,manojINDIA,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Narrow and crowded ,"The place is over crowded but you may get everything you need for daily use. Cosmetic, bags, electronics , fruits, vegetables,spices, pet animals, birds etc etc etc. If you are not Indian you will be puzzled. Here most products are cheap but quality is low. Many shops sell pirated cosmetics, perfumes etc. So beware while shopping. You can get good quality fruits here. I took my kids to pet animals and birds shops , they found these shops very exciting but the area was dirty. Area where Fruit and pet animal shops are situated is very unhygienic. Some touts sell duplicate international brand perfumes on roadsides, so take care if you are dealing with them. This market may be good for local people but for tourists it’s not good place to shop."
Crawford_Market,Wearside_Wanderer,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Too much hassle. ,Left because the spice stall owners were hassling us to visit their respective stalls. Despite me getting angry and telling them to leave us alone they just followed us around trying to steer us in the direction of their goods. At one point two of them started arguing about which of them saw us first!We just left which is a shame because we wanted to root around the place and spend money! 
Crawford_Market,LeeBrad,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Diversity in shopping,"Crawford market is huge...it really takes a few trips to see it all as it is a vibrant crush of people & goods. The market seems to have everything from kitchen goods, fresh fruits & veggies, nuts & seeds, clothing, spices, to puppies & parrots. Then the variety of those goods...so if you are looking for a specific variation of green curry, custard apples, or Marsala tea this is the market to do it in. "
Crawford_Market,Divya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Great shopping place,"we bought handbags, fruits, track pants, home appliances. everything is available at affordable rates"
Crawford_Market,eacrnc,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Theives Market,"We dropped into Mumbai while on a cruise from Singapore to Dubah,  and visited both the Crawford Market and the Thieves Market which is close to Crawford.  The Thieves Market has everything you can imagine for sale, its and education to visit this place, people friendly and helpful, with lot to look at, turn corner and you have spare parts for the car or motobike, next door to an Antique store or furniture repairer. The people live and work here so there is lots going on very interesting.  We only spent a day in Mumbai but I will definitely go back.  So many people and heaps of little cars."
Crawford_Market,Akshat Lad,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Crawford market a must visit,Crawford market is best visited if u have a planned occasion likewise if you have a birthday party or maybe a function which requires lot of time and money to put in to organise an event. You will get all materials at reasonable rate.Best time to visit this place is in the month of December since the Christmas Eve is a absolutely fantastic time.If u want to purchase anything and everything related to electronic items mobile accessories games playing accessories for children's. Dry fruits soft toys shoes garments toys for kids.etc
Crawford_Market,Sudha S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Crawford Market,"Not a place to visit. it is all stores selling Chinese made goods.  I am  not a big fan of this place. the roads were filthy and had to negotiate people(throngs) and cars . no good buys. We did not go to the jewelry section, which seemed quiet vast."
Crawford_Market,Joshua C,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Crawford Market - probably won't go again,"Ive been reading reviews on this place for months and was quite kazzed about going.ButWe had to have a state guide when we arrived, told us we didnt have to tip.  Then brought us directly to a store for spices....no chance to browse around.  The salesman kept flopping down prepackaged masalas....i wanted whold spices....so after the third time i asked him about cardamom he finally gave in.  I compared some of the prices with a visit at a previous market and he kept telling me what i got wasnt real or not organic.  I asked, how do I know your stuff is organic....he couldnt answer.I think I got a little taken....but i think he knew I knew what i was talking about.Finally our guide took us to the animal portion where there were baby ducks in cages and turtles etc...and then saw a man beat a dog with a stick.  He lead ua through the fruits section where we wanted some ohotos but he was rushing us along.  Then after three attempts to get us to look at pashminas (already bought some in a factory up north), he got frustrated and lead us to the door and asked for a tip.My partner asked ""you said we didnt have to?""""You dont if you didnt enjoy your time""I replied....""we didnt"" he threw his hands in the air and marched off.We were prepared for a two hour meander but were in and out in 25 mins.Had a much better experience for spice shopping at G W KHAMKAR SPICES (KHAMKAR MASALA)"
Crawford_Market,Ashraf4916,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Excellent Food and household items wholesale market ,"This is a very old wholesale market wherein you will find fresh seasonal fruits (the best you can get) and also huge market for dry fruits, sweets, dates and lots of foodstuffs, n much more. You will find also lots of imported food items, chocolates, olives olive oil etc. The pricing is competitive and better than retail market. "
Crawford_Market,Kesha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Nice,Excellent place for the shopping lovers you will get different variety of clothes over there must visit once.
Crawford_Market,Naresh1936,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Daily needs under one roof,"Crawford market, now renamed as Mahatma Phule Market, situated in south Mumbai, is a traditional market, where all the daily household needs are available, literally under one roof; vegetables and fruits, groceries, meat and fish, kitchen accessories, toiletries, flowers,  and everything else for the house. But unfortunately it is average quality and a bit of bargaining is common. Usually crowded and congested."
Crawford_Market,Kelvin Y,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Most aggressive TOUTING in my 16 days in India - that's saying a lot!,We went to Crawford Market on our own.  What a disappointment!  We experienced the most aggressive TOUTING in my 16 days in India - that's saying a lot!Perhaps we would have a different experience if we went to Crawford Market with a guide?
Crawford_Market,amit andhare,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Street Shopping!!!,"This is one of the best place for shopping in Mumbai. Starting from the Dry Fruits, Cosmetics, Home Decor, Lights, Artificial flowers, Clothes and other things. You just name the thing from street shopping and you will get it. Things are very cheap here, they might be first copy or custom free. One should spend at least 4-5 hours here, and of course Badshah Restaurant is here for your refreshment.Must Visit for Mumbaikar if you love shopping."
Crawford_Market,MaryKP,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,Not good value better off going to d mart or hypermarket,"Market was congested and smelly. Hygiene was awful. Spices everywhere and very expensive. Brought spice from spice king, apparently meant to be good quality but saw them picking up spices from a crate on the floor and not off the shelf.Caradom was quite expensive. We later brought some from d mart for less than £1!!"
Crawford_Market,Aditya K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Shopping galore!! Read for some tips,"It is a really huge market with really cheap prices. Extremely crowded but you will find almost anything and everything here. Tips:1. Very near to CST local station, so go by local train.2. Forget taking kids there, its really crowded and kids may get lost. Also you can focus on shopping better.3. Taking private car should be last option, parking is always full @ 150/- per hour.4. BARGAIN HARD. start by quoting 1/4th price. Though some of the vendors have fixed prices.5. Shop smartly and dont fall for fakes. Prefer going during day for better inspection of products.6. Baadshah restaurant is the place to eat even if you have to wait for 15-20 mins.7. It will take atleast three days to roam around the entire market. So make a priority list and shop likewise.8. Depending upon weather, carry enough sun protection, wear cotton clothes and drinking water.9. If in a group, try to stay together. Sometimes the mobile network goes bad and noisy atmosphere will make your ringtone not audible.10. Secure your personal belongings and valuables.It is a really good place. Must get the feel atleast once if you are in mumbai."
Crawford_Market,Renu2,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Crawford Market,"I had heard so much about this market and as a lover of bazaars, flea markets and souks I decided to check this out. I took a taxi from Churchgate and reached the market. It was a Saturday evening and it was very crowded. A word of advice...avoid Saturdays. The market is closed on Sundays. A weekday is good though you will still see a lot of people. The market has so much to offer. There are rows of cosmetics shops offering all the good brands at discounted prices. The covered part of the market across the road has a large number of dry fruit shops and candy shops. A large variety of candy, imported biscuits and chocolates, coffee are available at wholesale prices. Then there are shops selling cushions, hangers, bags, wallets, wooden trays and decorative objects, stationary, paper bags, gift bags, jute bags,crockery, tea light holders, colored lanterns, quirky storage trunks and so much that it becomes impossible to cover the entire market in a day. I went on Saturday and then on Monday. The prices are unbelievable and at some shops haggling is also possible though they dont reduce prices drastically unless you are buying in bulk. "
Crawford_Market,AngMiholjek,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Busy... massive,"Worth going with at least one other person. Negotiate, negotiate. Bargains can be found if you have the patience. Must allow plenty of time. If you really like something, mark the spot, look around for a better price, as usually you will find a better price, and then if you still want it go back. Just make sure you pay attention to where you were, as you may never find it again. This place is huge."
Crawford_Market,davec101,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Great Place to visit,"Visited Mumbai as part of a cruise to India. I loved the whole experience. The city was busy, crowded, and loud. But for all that it was fantastic we visited the Crawford Market and it was absolutely fascinating. Loved all the vendors and people my wife was not a lover of the selling of live animals but that aside we enjoyed the visit."
Crawford_Market,ajay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Good Products at Wholesale Costs,"A very crowded place for shpping which has mangaldas market, lohar chawl, nagdevi street, manish market etc by its sides. A place for shopping for different articles like home decor, toys, garments, gift articles,electronics at reasonable costs. There are wholesellers for each item and its priced decently. Good for small business owners, who can buy from here and resale it. Small eating joints around the market and is easily reachable. Its a landmark by itself and can be reached easily by public transport."
Crawford_Market,Mysuccessrulezz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Good but crowded,"This place is good for wholesale shopping. It has multiple streets, one for electrical things, one for toys etc. However it is always crowded."
Crawford_Market,692leon,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Family,Expensive,"Not as cheap as Mota Market. You must bargin here, dont be ripped off.Sari's can be bought from as little as R150.00 stunning eastern outfits.Otherwise go to Mota Market. VERY BEST PLACE TO SHOP IN INDIA"
Crawford_Market,Gautam Pendharkar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Business,Shoppers Paradise,"This place is an offline Amazon or Alibaba, no thing is not-available here, if you have the will to search. Most of the businesses get there wholesale stocks from here and sell it in their retail shops all over. It has a typical downtown Mumbai feel, just short way from CST station. Its an unwritten rule, if you dont get some product anywhere in Mumbai, you will get it here. Polish your bargaining skills and you're readyIt really gets crowded sometimes and unclean"
Crawford_Market,joarder-white,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,OK but beware the spivs promising an authentic shopping experience,We walked to the railway station and stopped at Crawford Market on the way. It was interesting for a wander round but not fantastic if shopping for gifts is your objective.  This is a working market selling everyday goods and foodstuffs much the same as anywhere else in Asia. Some intersting stalls and foodstuffs but the main thing was the feel of the place and the hectic atmosphere. Nice architecture too. Several times we were pestered by spivs trying to encourage us to visit particular stalls and particularly to sell some supposedly authentic indian goods (mainly spices at hugely inflated prices). Better then tourist trinket stalls but not a shopping expeirence as such. 
Crawford_Market,Mohit W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Feel of Mumbai,"Want to feel the local Mumbai? Come here and experience the local shopping manza here. You need to bargain on the prices to shop here. From home decor, wardrobe, to your makeup, accessories, you get everything here. It is always crowded but this is what you enjoy here"
Crawford_Market,Aleta14,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,I was here during mango season!,Mangoes everywhere.. I love this market but not the sellers who want you to buy 2 kgs. of mangoes and won't sell you just a few to take along.. This market is fun to wander around and it will be difficult not to buy something.. I can't wait to shop here again..
Crawford_Market,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,"Busy market; nice architecture, but maintenance a concern","The Crawford Market is one of the older marketplaces in Mumbai. Located very close to CST, this market is in a single building built in the Gothic style. The architecture is eye-catching for sure, but a number of encroachments prevent one from being able to appreciate it.Inside is a very busy market selling a whole lot of items for daily use or as curios. The maintenance of the market is a worry, with safety a particular concern, with some incidents recently. It is hoped the authorities awaken and restore this heritage site to at least some of its past glory."
Crawford_Market,juvlemm,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,wide varieties,The market is crowded by small shops and street vendors. The rates are reasonable. Advisable to visit on working day to reduce the rush.
Crawford_Market,Raymond W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Couples,Victorian Market in  Mumbai,"Crawford Market has been a famous feature of the city of Mumbai since the Victorian era. In one of the museums here, I saw a painting of it surrounded by horses and carriages from around the 1870s.Today it is still very much in use. It mostly offers food products such as nuts, spices and other delicacies. There are also a few imported food stores. What you won't find here are cafes and eateries. This place caters to Indian tastes not foreign ones.Like many of Mumbai's Victorian treasures, this place has seen better days. There are ugly modern signboards running all down one side of the structure. The stone could also do with a deep clean. However, it is still worth a look."
Crawford_Market,Ashish Choadhry,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Busy market with lots of stuff,"Crawford Market is a Market for fruits , dry fruits and provisions. Imported cosmetics, food items are available in abundance here. It's a shoppers paradise. If you are looking to buy imported food items, this is the place. Opposite to the Crawford Market is The manikdas market which is a textile market. Lots of stuff is available. Not very cheap though. Flea market is huge and the price is what best you can bargain. Avoid Saturday as it's too over crowded. Don't take your car. Parking is a big problem. "
Crawford_Market,FoodieFun,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Cheap and fun:),"so i visited in January- weather was good and i had lovely time. Many ppl asked me how can i enjoy Crawford market. Its crowded and smelly.. well i say if you don't like bargain shopping, don't go Crawford. Imp*-make a list of stuff u wish to buy, (big list if you are travelling from suburbs as distance should be worth tarvelling). Dry fruits to table mat, socks, gifts everything is available."
Crawford_Market,Jan O,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,"Interesting mix of fruit, animals, spices and cloths",This market is worth a walk around. It has different things in different sections. I particularly liked the fruit and veg area and the spice area.  It's a locals market and very busy.  Worth a visit if you have an hour and want to see where the locals shop and what things cost.  Some things were surprisingly cheap but others such as cashew nuts were no cheaper than England. I didn't really like the animals section as I don't like to see exotic birds or cats caged.
Crawford_Market,Nigel G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Business,Typical Colonial Style,"Crawford Market — a British Institution and corner piece of Colonial architecture, named in commemoration of Arthur Crawford who once served the British Colonial administration in Singapore also. The sounds and smells of India come alive here. Spices, nuts, fruits of all varieties. Fortunately the Alfonso mango was in season, so I was able to buy some. If you like fruit this is the place to come. This is well worth a visit and gives you a feel of British India. Take care of your belongings here cos it’s the kind of place your pocket could easily get picked. Coolies are there to carry what you buy and will carry to your car. If you have a driver tell him to find a parking space nearby but not the market car park as they charge R 100 to park I’m told. A must on the map of the first time visitor to Mumbai. "
Crawford_Market,SerendipityIndia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Decent street shopping experience,"Visited Crawford with my wife as she wanted to do some street shopping. Prices were insanely good and most products seemed decent quality (obviously not luxury). It got very busy on the weekend and since it was a hot day, I didn't have a great experience - so try to avoid busy times and a hot day."
Crawford_Market,Dr. RFN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Everything and more,"Yeah, ‚Everything and more‘, you can find a lot of things to buy. The place is actually dirty, but you don‘t need to spend long time there. I recommend you to see the fruits and vegetable areas, the spice stufs and short walk to the other areas. Anyway is a good experince in Mumbai."
Crawford_Market,Pintya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,Always busy,Wide variety of goods are available in small and large quantities. But one should be good at bargining. The market is always crowded and busy.
Crawford_Market,Skaramoosh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Thumbs Up!,"We went to the ever bustling Crawford Market at night. It was such a mind-blowing experience walking and squeezing through a smorgasbord of colours, aromas and decibels.Tons of people everywhere and it's such a kaleidoscope of goods for sale as you meander along. Be aware that it's very tight quarters while walking through this fascinating market. There is very little space, if at all, between you and another human being.For the uninitiated it can be intimidating. Whether day or night there's throngs of people.Stop by at any one of the food stalls and enjoy the tea coupled with the local kebabs. Truly tasty. Just make sure the tea is hot and the food is cooked!Recommended!"
Crawford_Market,G V Naggenddra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Busy and bustling,"There are some places which never disappoint you, this is one such place. With a plethora of shopping options which suits your budget, you definitely have to visit this place just to experience the magic of street shopping. This is one of the most revered markets in South Mumbai named after Arthur Crawford, the first Municipal Commissioner of the city. After independence, it was renamed after prominent Maharashtrian social reformer Mahatma Jyotiba Phule. You will find all sorts of items here in both wholesale and retail mode. You will also find a lot of imported stuff from cosmetics, perfumes, fruits, garments, etc. I particularly liked the fruit market with fresh fruits from all over the country, some even from abroad. It is crowded and not convenient for vehicular traffic so park your vehicles somewhere else or use the commuter train till CSMT and walk your way here. One mantra to go by at this place is to bargain and bargain hard. It sure is a buzzing place."
Crawford_Market,Sheena H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Spicy!,Always love markets and this one did not disappoint. We got some lovely spices from Spice King and have used them since we got home.

So beware - "
Crawford_Market,sijick,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Best place to shop,"I have visited this place 20 years back when I was doing my engineering to purchase TK drawing sheets in bulk with other colleague students. You guessed it right, this is the place for wholesale trading, but you will also get small lots too at a slightly higher price. You need to bargain heavily with the street vendors, shops will not reduce prices much. I went there in Dec'18 for purchasing return gifts, and got it at half price of what we get at retail shops close to your home. My wife visited this place for first time, and fell in love immediately, but the crowd here is too much. The best thing we bought was a Xmas tree for 200 which retailers would sell for 2500-3000, but yes bargained from 400 down to 200. It was just for the experience of bargaining, I would have paid 400 :) Bought kid shoes for 250, which one would get nothing less than 800. You will get everything under the sun here, but the market is so big and congested, you might take more than a month to explore each and every shop here. There are shops even in the buildings upstairs in narrow wooden stair cases. Yes, the structures here are very old.This is the place from where your shop keeper buys and stocks his stuff. You might have noticed that your shop keeper calls up his distributor to check if the item you need is not in stock. Yes, he is calling someone in Crawford market.If you liked my review, say it is helpful. I have yet to explore dry fruits and other items, but can try to answer your questions."
Crawford_Market,Sticknrudder47,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Business,Indiana Jones Market,Great place to get your local on.  Lots of little shops and a great spice place called the spice King.  Bring back your Indian curry but be ready to explain it to customs.

Crawford_Market,mikelapsley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,You've got to see it,"If you love the sights and sounds and smells of India you should love Crawford Market.  Well worth a visit just to walk around and check out spice sellers, fruit stalls, confectionery shops...everything is here. If peace and tranquility is more your scene then avoid it."
Crawford_Market,Clive Wilson,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,"Yes, a dump and even worse, animals and birds in tiny cages","I don’t know why our tour guide thought this awful place worthy of a visit in this mad city. Initially it looked okay, the usual fruit and veg. But wander further in and you see the horror of tiny birds crammed into tiny cages and lots of them as well. We saw meat hanging , flies buzzing and we heard from others, though didn’t see, that animals ( pets) were also crammed into small areas. That was enough for us. If you love animals and birds give this blight a miss."

Crawford_Market,gillymadam,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,What a dump,"After reading that it was the market to go to, we were totally disappointed.  We got a taxi from the cruise port to take us there and when we got out, this little guy insisted he would take us around.  I wanted to buy some spices but was unable to get prices as nothing was priced and when asked, they overpriced everything so ended up with nothing.  I have been to markets in Marrakesh, Cairo etc. which were really interesting and exciting and you could barter with the locals over the prices but this did not happen here.We could not get out of the place quick enough and the guy who insisted in taking us around asked us for $10, we offered him rupes but he would not accept them."

Crawford_Market,simpleman66,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,"Amazing place, loved it!","I could have spent hours here. I was told that the market was just recently renovated. The market is old but set up extremely well. Organized by sections and with a great selection. fruits, vegetables, all kinds of dried nuts and fruits, spices, ground and whole, gifts, wrapping, cake baking supplies, holiday stuff, you name it they have it!!!  Oh a word about parking, there is not any and its crowded, take an UBER or Taxi or Auto rickshaw to get there.Very attentive sales people and if you are not okay with bargaining you are going to be an easy mark. Make sure you bargain and you will get some great deals. My friends from the US feel like they are cheating the sales person. Trust me they won't let you cheat them. They just won't sell it to you if they are going to loose money. Stay friendly and have fun. If they agree to a price, buy it, don't insult them.What a great place to shop. So if you enjoy this place don't miss out on the flood of shops and shoppers and vehicles of every kind right around Crawford.  It is amazing and if you are a city person, so energizing! Indian shopping experience at its best."

You shall get dry fruits, stationery, gifts, clothes, gifts and much more. Wear decent clothes as the place is full of orthodox ppl. Take your own water and cap. Take a big bag so you can keep your stuff. I am sure a small bag won't suffice your shopping. Take lot of cash as majority of ppl don't use cards. "
Crawford_Market,Stephen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,"Architecturally beautiful.  Shopping-wise, mostly fruit.","Architecturally the market is beautiful.  Being the oldest market, it is worth a quick visit.  In terms of shopping, unless you want to buy fruits, there isn't much to buy.

Crawford_Market,Tharpo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Couples,Old bazaar of Bombay,"Named after first Municipal Commissioner of Bombay, this marketplace is certainly a must visit for reasons more than marts. The nineteenth century colonial architecture is great though needs maintenance in many places. There are all round chaos with thousand of people buying and selling products. We happened to visit when Alphonso was the key offering. Notwithstanding, you get everything there and in a moderate price. Bargaining allowed. It's 10 minutes walk from Marine Lines railway station along Lohar Chawl that is famous for electrical goods."

Crawford_Market,AucklandWiz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,Came To EXCELLENT SPICES As Part Of A Tour But Beware,"We visited this market as part of a tour we were doing for the day. Was told the spices were hand made as opposed to machine made.  After smelling several and getting the price through the guide (mistake) we paid too much. It wasn't until we got back to the car and realised what we had paid was too much but was too late to do anything about it. The guide spoke to the EXCELLENTSPICES stall by phone and they said their prices had gone up since last month which is a crock of bull. So be very wary of pricing and go with an idea of pricing in mind. Since I have complained to the tour company the guide worked for and they were going to meet with him and also refunded us the price of the spices. I think the guide was on the take for taking tourists there. Since we have been to Kerala and Sri Lanka and yes, I can confirm that Excellent Spices are a rip off. We should have been payng about 1/3 of what he charged us.Other than this there was a big variety of very nice looking fruits etc and good photo opportunities with the buildings age and the colours. We didnt get to see the whole market but saws enough to get an idea."
Crawford_Market,Amruta R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,One stand for all your needs,"Crawford market is the place in mumbai where you can get everything and anything,The nearest railway station is CST from there you need to take a right and then walk down for around 15-20 in a straight path (No right no left).What you can find in crawford market?Pets, chocolates, mouth fresheners, cosmetics, vegetables, fruits, utilities, stationary etc.Near crawford market you can find various other market also.

Crawford_Market,David D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Iconic building - busy market,"Monday morning 6th March and we visited this market. It is very easy to locate with its iconic clock tower and is situated opposite the Commissioner of Police building . When we visited part of the tower had scaffolding around it as it was being repaired, it still looked mighty impressive.Although some of the market was closed due to redevelopment there is still lots to see. There is a great atmosphere about the place in conjunction with the hustle and bustle of a very busy market. This wonderful old building, which is an attraction in its own right, is home to a vast market with hundreds of shops and stalls filled with everything imaginable. There are some great displays of fruit & vegetables and spices Occasionally there was a bit of hassle, we were followed a few times by shop/stall holders wanting us to visit their shop, it did not last long we kept saying no thank you. The streets around the Market were packed with stalls and traders, we discovered Mangdalas textiles market near by (reviewed separately)."
