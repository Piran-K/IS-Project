Dharavi,dgomez2022,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,An other Mumbai,"I have made my tour with my teen daughters (12 & 15) and my son (11). No risk, our guide, Razak, a student, has his family leaving in Dharavi for 5 generations : we visited the industrial area, the old residential part and the new one. For my kids, thanks to Razak comments it has been a ""normal"" visit. I strongly recomment this visit"
Dharavi,Nilesh Kumar,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Solo,Very Dangerous,Dangerous place to visit . All people will stare at your clothes and try every possible ways to steal money from you.  All people will not bother  about whether you lost money or life
Dharavi,Anthony,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 • Solo,Knife attack,I guys follow me for too long … and at the moment he got a opportunity he try to stab me with a big knife… I run but Indian people are just spectator. Nobody will help you. I jump in a cab. And the driver stop to take the guys… I almost die this day. I need to hide myself in a garbage for one hours waiting for the police.. don’t go there
Dharavi,Ananya Bajpai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Amazing food,"Fabulous place to go and meet Divine's mom and have handmade food. Vivian Divine was my tour guide, when I reached Pune, I received a phone call, it was Divine, he said chal naa tu bombay maa see milaana hai hath see khilaana hai and I was soldBest food and hospitality ever!"
Dharavi,Wen-D K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Not sure...,"This is a confusing story of slum life in Mumbai. According to our guide, the many hard working and industrious people we saw are not the main residents of the slum. The main residents, it seems, all work at jobs outside of the slum and rent these spaces to the newly arrived, who earn a fraction of what the long term residents earn on the outside. So, are we to believe that life is good here? It is a crowded metropolis of people struggling to earn a living. Better than one might perceive a slum to be, but hardly what they are trying to sell us as a self sustaining, working community."
Dharavi,Iqbal M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,Wow,Worlds one of the largest slum area was dharavi .its located in south mumbai when i saw the house here very congujstad and very nice affordable  place to stay 
Dharavi,igolfCA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,The real India,"We had a guide to take us through Dharavi and explain how the people lived and survived. It was quite eye-opening and showed us a side of life that is unrelated to any we have known. This slum has over a million residents, which that number alone is hard to comprehend.We saw the places where the people lived, some of the work they do, and how they live their daily life. Incredible and unimaginable. The recycling businesses going on there are quite industrious, as well as other businesses such as pottery making and leather goods.The rooms where some of the people live are located on alleys that are full of holes and are narrow and dark. We saw inside some of the rooms, very small considering the average family size.This, to me, represents a large part of what the real India is like. Everyone should take this tour. Only then can you appreciate fully what you have in your life."
Dharavi,MWandAW,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,This reality has some hope,"My wife and I had a guided tour of this area with a local youth leader and the things that they are doing there are truly inspirational. As you visit, you see industry in motion. No-one is sitting around feeling sorry for themselves. They are all active. The children were in school with their teachers. The women were washing clothes, shopping for groceries, selling food in the markets. The men and boys were building new walls on houses, digging drains, collecting plastic, paper, cardboard and metal and bagging it in batches, to take to recycling plants. So much happening down every street and alleyway. Small cars, motor bikes and scooters bustle around the small lanes, our group often had to jump out of the way, to let them through. The area is alive with a beating heart of industry with people clawing out a meager existence any way they can. They are at the bottom of the caste system and they are doing the best they can. The local youth workers help the children to seek higher education, even to University. Life is hard there, but they just get on with it. The Mumbai Local Government does clean the streets, but the sheer number of people with little understanding of public cleanliness, drop paper and bags of rubbish wherever a place exists. There are no fines, people can't pay. Littering is a big issue in this environment and the blocked drains are a continuous problem that needs addressing. They said it is a very slow process, but education about not littering is underway. It may take a few years, but it will happen. We were just shocked at the smells of mountains of litter that adorn that whole settlement. We visited some of the industries, including textile production and the tanning process and the making of handbags and leather coats from goat hides. We visited a leather shop attached to a tanning factory with good quality items being made and sold, inside the settlement. It will never end, it seems. The government are moving people to their own flats on a regular basis, though the area seems to rebuild itself with more people. A visit to see this part of Mumbai is a real eye opener and is recommended, but not for the feint-hearted."
Dharavi,NauticalDreamer3010,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,The real India!,No trip to India is complete without a visit to Dharavi.  You will need a guide but meandering through the narrow alleyways observing the industrious and hard working locals at work and in their home setting is to see the real India.
Dharavi,Marilyn Cornwall,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Inspirational,"Reality Tours again. Recommend this group.  Dharavi was amazing. Many places had very narrow alleyways with buildings containing an incredible number of industries.  The streets were swept clean, the children play happily, the dogs content with well fed tums. My guide, same one as for the Food Market,  Tuvej was a delightful, well spoken and very careful young man.I do recommend this tour with Reality, good company"
Dharavi,Shreya Sharma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great place to see,The place is a great place to shop artistic things along with seeing the slums which are quite old but well managed.
Dharavi,markb120,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great experience,Visiting the slams was a tremendous experience. It will make you learn a lot and see the usual world at different perspective.
Dharavi,Vinod S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Intense experience of a parallel world.,"Visiting the various sections is interesting. I visited the pottery area and saw potters turning various bowls, making diyas and the various kilns used. Best to go with someone who knows the area or a guided tour"
Dharavi,adityainc,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great to experience slum,The Dharavi area is a slum dwelling place which is quite popular for movies photo-shoot and visitors for project work.
Dharavi,mtse88,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Dharavi tour & Street Art Wak with Reality Tours & Travel,"This was the first tour we tried with Reality Tours. The guides are energetic, full of passion in their work and have good knowledge about the tour. The best to see India is by foot - see more life in the local area and feel like you are local ;))Our guide, Sabrina, was grown up in Dharavi and she has good knowledge about everything. It was amazed to see the 'recycle' business there, you name it, plastic, fabric/clothes, glass, metal etc. To respect the local life, you are not allowed to take pictures.  Make sure you wear comfortable clothes and shoes for the 2-3 hours walk. In case of doubt, just ask the guide who is most willing to answer you.Inspiration from the visit - life is simple, people work hard and earn enough for food/living, and then enjoy the time with kids.  What more you want?!?"
Dharavi,GoPlaces622828,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Hanging out with the locals in Dharavi,"This tour of by Magical Mumbai Tours was spot on in many ways. The tour guide and his driver picked me up on time at my hotel and got me safety across town in the crazy Mumbai traffic.  Ricky took time to explain many things about Mumbai on our trip over to the the Dharavi Slum and the driver Saddam make sure that the drive over was quick and safe. My local tour guide, Chirag, was raised in Dharavi and had an excellent understanding of the community. He pointed out many interesting facts about the community and how the different trades operated on a daily basis. Chirag showed me the different types of schools that local children attend and explained the differences between them.  He also made sure that he answered all my questions about how the people live in an area that is home to 1.3 million people. Once the tour was over, Chirag and his driver got me safely back to my hotel. This tour in Mumbai is something you will not want to miss if you’re interested in understanding how some people in the world live and prosper on a daily basis under conditions much different than you are accustomed to."
Dharavi,karthik0410,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Good leather products,"Dharavi is famous for its slums and a lot of tours are arranged just to showcase the chaos and the slum life. For locals, visit the place if you are interested in leather products - jackets, belts, wallets, shoes."
Dharavi,Mulchand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Must See in Mumbai,"By far the most famous slum of Asia. A reel-life bought into the reality where there is action, people, cows, humans, cars, and everything that's under the sun, all on one street and area. People are friendly but please ask permission before you take their photos. The area is divided into various lanes, paper recycling, cloth recycling, plastic recycling are must watch.  Best time to go would be from 11 to 2 pm and 4 pm to 6 pm. Avoid Saturday and Sundays. "
Dharavi,Mars,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Eye opening insight!,"Was very fascinated with the entrepreneurial spirit here..... a good introduction to the history and present workings of this famous area of Mumbai. Gladly supported the leather industry by purchasing some wonderful products. Learned about a little-known way of life and an amazing community of hardworking , industrious people."
Dharavi,sharjeelcool,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Good,This place is is constantly buzzing with all the buyers especially those who love leather products be it wallets or shoes you get them here at cheap prices
Dharavi,seeker_here,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Largest Slum in Asia,Dharavi is famous as the largest slum in Asia but there is more to Dharavi than that - it has its own local economy and is almost a mini-city in itself.
Dharavi,Kiwi on Tour,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Eye Opening,"I think what struck  me the most about Dharavi is I thought it would be full of misery, it really wasn't people there are so friendly, It really was great "
Dharavi,Debra A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,This tour is amazing!,"Our guide and resident of Dharavi, Farazan, was incredible. He opened our eyes to the hard work and dignity of the residents and the amazing things the slum contributes to the city, including recycling the majority of plastic in Mumbai. This tour will change and inspire you."
Dharavi,Haarby,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Bethelocal - slum tour,Great and authentic tour of the Dharavi slums. Informative guide and felt as we were the only tourists 
Dharavi,sactokw,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,"Not really slum, but a living producing city","Took the Dharavi slum tour. It's really not a slum, but a thriving city that recycles and produces many products. Great to check out if you haven't seen it before."
Dharavi,neilwinch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Highlight of Indian Trip. Absolute must do,"We'd driven past Dharavi a few times with our driver. Me making lots of video out the car window. I made the comment I'd love to get out and walk around the place. Didn't actually know it was possible.Back at my hotel that night an ad popped up on my browser advertising walking tours with Reality Tours. So the boss and I skipped off work early the next afternoon and met up with Tevraj (a young bloke born in the slums and now working as a tour guide).We spent the next 3 and half hours wandering through the back alleys and seeing all there is to see. A real eye opening, humbling experience that was no doubt the highlight of our Indian trip.Seeing how the locals works and live puts everything into perspective as a privileged Westerner. The people were so warm and welcoming. Not once did I ever feel uneasy or threatened or anything like that. We bought a few items to treasure those memories.The only drawback for as a photographer - no photos allowed - I found that excruciating but can completely understand the reasoning why.If you only do one activity in Mumbai, let this be it. You will not regret it."
Dharavi,Clyde R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Dharavi plus plus plus tour,"Anyone visiting Mumbai should contact a superb guide named Mubeen, his WhatsApp address is +91 98929 25697.We did a morning tour with him which included Dharavi slums, Gandi's House/Museum,Dhobi Ghat laundry. We then did an evening tour with dinner taking in the Gateway to India, Taj Hotel, Victoria station, Marine Drive, Hanging Gardens, a high society Indian Wedding (impromptu), Prince of Wales museum. Krishna Temple.His command of English is superb, good sense of humour, His presentation was full of factual historic facts. I would suggest anyone reading this and visiting Mumbai should contact him in advance and use him."
Dharavi,Phil P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Moving and humbling experience ,"We booked our tour with Reality while in the UK. They were flexible enough to collect us from the cruise ship dock at 10.00am during our one day stay in Mumbai. A quick city tour, rail station, flower market and laundry, all by local bus and trains and then on to the Dharavi slum. Our guide, Neil, was excellent and able to explain how life works, having lived there himself. It was a moving and humbling experience seeing people working long hard hours for just £4 or £5 a day, sleeping in rooms above their factory. Recycling, machining, leather, pottery, etc. It's not a tour for the faint hearted and you need to be fairly agile and have good footwear, but it's another example of an experience of India that leaves you a slightly different person. Neil was a great guy to get into philosophical conversation with and I would suggest asking if he is available for your trip. Highly recommended. "
Dharavi,Tim Marsden,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Dharavi tour with Simran,"Fabulous and eye-opening trip around Asia’s biggest slum this morning with an excellent tour guide, Simran.  I would strongly recommend Reality Tours.  This is also a great way to support the local community and know that the funds are going to the right place!"
Dharavi,KathleenIndianapolis,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Desperately Poor But Vibrant and Alive,Tours of the Mumbai slum are controversial and to be respectful one doesn't take photos of the people. What surprised me was the strong feeling of community and the huge number of businesses both large and small which operate there. An inspirational visit.
Dharavi,skybluesmurf,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Different,"We had a tour booked with local guides whom were born and raised in the slums.It's pretty intense with people, stray animals, bikes, trucks and interesting smells.We were taken to see the recycling area, pottery area and skin hide area.It's definitely worth doing a trip.We weren't allowed to take photos which was a bit of a shame but also understandable."
Dharavi,Debbie P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,The Real World of Mumbai,"You need to have a strong heart, not to be touched by what you see at the Dharavi.  The facilities will shock you, but shows you how industrious the people are with their many skills and recycling activities they undertake. Seeing chickens getting ready to be sold and pottery being made, was so interesting!  This is where Slumdog Millionaire was filmed, so you can really see how people live and work. Well worth a visit!"
Dharavi,Kelvin Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Well worth visiting with the proper guide. Not at all like the movie Slumdog Millionaire,We visited Dharavi with a guide we arranged through Odonovo.  We were fortunate to have an excellent guide.  We saw the conditions the residents live in (not all bad). We observed close-up the plastics recycling and pottery industry in Dharavi.Choose the right guide!
Dharavi,John,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,"must see, with a local resident","before we arrived in mumbai we booked a tour with a local resident of the slum, the tour was incredible and it seemed we got to go to places that all tourists dont get to see, was one of the best tours and shows the slum in a very positive light."
Dharavi,Geoffrey Thomas Gillies,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Eye Opening,"It is hard to review such an interesting place, everybody works hard, the children amuse themselves, not a computer in site sticks are their toys. The industry is to be seen to be believed. JUST GO THERE! "

Dharavi,Daniel Westfield,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,People Living Big With Small Things !,"I Have Heard about this place a Tons of time. We met tour Guide at Tour Guide Railway Station. He Told Us to take a tour of this Place. When we reached there. There was noise all around the streets. Scraps Everywhere, Small Houses, Very Very Densed Place, They are very tightly in small area with small houses. Bad Smell and it's a place of poor people. All people of this are engaged in some kind of small activities. Our Guide Told us Many Movies have been shot Here. The guides were all very friendly and made you feel at ease. Our guide was very Knowledgeable and showed us all the different sections of this huge thriving community. It was busy and noisy but I would recommend it to everyone."
Dharavi,Anwer Dhanji,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Slum Dog Millionaire movie was shot here but it stinks,This is not for the faint hearted as it really stinks but worth a visit to see how the congested very poor and down trodden live. The famous film Slum Dog Millionaire movie was shot here
Dharavi,Anjalee Deshpande Hutchinson,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Important to see.,"We had an excellent tour guide named Ahad, took time to really show us all about the area, all the businesses, the recycling, the living areas - answered all of our questions. It was really astonishing to see what life is like in this area and just how many people live there."
Dharavi,Aleta14,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Slumdog Millionaire,Finally i got to tour this very productive slum area in the center of Mumbai... so much recycling done here and leather and pottery still made here in spite of the pollution that it causes in the city. Our tour guide for Dharavi was most knowledgeable and lives in the slum.. We were invited to his home there and were able to experience the true slum life as guests.. Amazing and i recommend this tour to anyone who is interested in how importand Dharavi slums is to many big businesses.
Dharavi,rjpriyanka,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Slums,This is one the biggest slum in world and home of many small scale business. You will be amazed by the kind of talent is hidden here in such small streets and homes.

Dharavi,Fearless692941,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,Mumbai Slums,I booked with Reality Tours and we met our guide at the Railway Station. The guides were easy to pick out with their Blue Shirts and embroidered emblem. The guides were all very friendly and made you feel at ease. We walked a short  distance and then the tour begun. Our guide was very knowledgeable and showed us all the different sections of this huge thriving community. It was busy and noisy but I would recommend it to everyone.

Dharavi,bongofurylondon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Solo,"Brilliant sensitive tour from local guide. Use ""be the local"" !!","My guide Muzafar met me at my hotel and as I had asked for a trip to the Dhobi Ghat as well we went there first. I would recommend this if you have time. A fascinating look at one of Mumbai's amazing open laundries. We then took a local bus to Churchgate Station. The train journey is another great experience with the carriage getting fuller as we reached Dharavi. Getting off is a challenge !! and so to the ""slum"" which is not a slum in the way we might imagine.it's a thriving community and you get to see all sections with this knowledgeable local guide. The recycling of plastic is done in every stage here and accounts for 80% of Mumbai's recycling. This interestingly is a market economy, not a collective and its been around long enough to say this is a choice. It's busy, noisy but you will have a great timer. we stopped for tea, a sugarcane juice and a snack Indian lunch can't recommend enough."
Dharavi,roe15,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Mumbai's Slum,"Incredible to see how this ""slum"" has developed into a busy area where some 1 million people live in a small area of about 2Km.  Small businesses creating work, particularly in recycling.  Amazing to see how people live there.  Life goes on and children still play with whatever they can find.  Cricket can be played with a piece of wood and stones for balls."
Dharavi,LANGARR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,A must see!,"My tour of the Dharavi slum was an experience I will never forget. Amazing, Jarring, humbling and wonderful.

Dharavi,Myrddin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,only go with REALITY TOURS,"I'll be honest there's something about being a poverty voyeur that made me not want to go here, but we took a tour with REALITY TOURS, and I'm so glad we did.They explained how a slum works, and what is a slum.I've done a review of Reality Tours elsewhere, so please have a look at it.The thing about them is 80% of your money goes back into the slum and the work RT does with it's NOG to help everyone there.Remember this, you're not a poverty voyeur if you take a proper tour -  and make the effort to go"
Dharavi,travelbuddies99,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Eye opening and uplifting,We visited Dharavi Slums and were pleasantly surprised. The people are resourceful and productive whilst living in crowded and difficult conditions. We walked through both the housing area and the business area and even had lunch in one of the homes. It was clean and the lady of the house (a home about 12ft x 6 ft) presented a tasty Indian lunch to the small group of 6. It's something you must see but remember that no photography is permitted in the entire area. 
Dharavi,Gail C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Great insight to the slum life of Mumbai,"I have read many books on Mumbai that include the everyday life in the slums. To be able to see it first hand was very different than I imagined. Firstly the people are busy working as there are 3 major industries prottery making,leather and recycling. It certainly isn’t a way of life any of us would want but it does give you a much better perspective of their lives. They are people looking after their families and trying to improve their lives the best they can. The children seemed happy and the ones I saw were clean and decently dressed."
Dharavi,Ceallachain ☘️,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,That HUMBLE moment.......,"A question was asked why do people visit the slums is it to feel good about ourselves, coming from our 5 star hotels to visit Dharavi. The tour was good, it was great to have a real insight in to everything they did here. These people work hard and it shows and are really proud of the work they do and so they should. We seen bags, belts, wallets all magnificently made to perfection. And when I done research on these products high manufacturers and company’s across the world buy these products from the slums and sell them at a really astronomical prices were in Dharavi they get just enough to get them. I’ve seen kids here with no shoes, iPhones, iPads or toys literally just playing with gravel stones and they’re the happiest kids I’ve seen in my entire life. People always perceive the people living in the slums to have “nothing” yet their the happiest of people, so to me they’ve everything. Coming here for me, I wanted that humble moment but unfortunately I didn’t get it. 👀 But it showed me everything in a sense you can have all the money in the world, and go on exquisite holidays and still feel unhappy about life or yourself. Everyone wants to prove they’ve been somewhere like you can’t take a photo of a statue nowadays cause you need to be in the photo to prove you’ve been there. Yet here in the slums you’ll only see hard work, love and laughter. No phones, iPads. And I think it’s incredible something I haven’t seen in a very long time. From all my traveling around India I felt extremely safe here in the slums. Parts of India you’ll feel alien really, you’ll get the odd stares here and there but at the slums, nothing. Going in to some factories the men working were happy to show you what they were working on.Definitely worth a visit for whatever reason or whatever reason you might feel will help or humble you. It’s worth seeing!"
Dharavi,DonnamjCan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,You really need to experience this.,"The only thing I regret about this is we didn't give it enough time and cut our experience too short.  It was such an incredible time to really challenge the view society holds on poverty.  Yes, it exists, but the industry, culture and innovation that lives here is outstanding.  Leather, plastic, cloth, aluminum, markets, schools, bakery, hospital, it's all here.  We didn't get to see all of it, but we saw a good portion.  You need to go with a guide as there are places that you do not go as it is not respectful to just wander around in some areas, you actually interfere with their life (day to day and their industry, they are very busy working).  Pick a tour that speaks to you--we chose one that supports university students, although we were disappointed to find out the ""student"" wasn't in school any longer and hadn't been for a few years.  I would instead choose one that supplies school needs (supplies) to the children. If you simply google, a few options will come up (that's why I am reviewing the slum and not the company).  It is a very, very busy place, it exists like a separate city.  You are not able to take pictures inside, but you can stand on the bridge that enters the slum and take some pictures looking down into it.  There is a leather goods store that makes and sells higher-end leather goods such as jackets and purses etc. and we were able to take a few pictures outside of there, but that is about it.  We were pleasantly surprised by many aspects of the slum, and I would not hesitate to go back  Definitely put this on your list."
Dharavi,nims,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Definitely visit!,Well worth visiting and we did the tour with Mumblu tours who were excellent especially as Anket our tour guide is a resident and so it was interesting to hear his perspective on being brought up and living here! It is eyeopening to see the resilience of the residents living in small tight living quarters but still remain happy and positive as they all share a community spirit of togetherness!To see innovative recycling cottage industries where nothing is wasted and everything turned into saleable goods is an art only found in India!!
Dharavi,Ralph Wilhelm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"One of top five highlights in ALL of India, a MUST","Yes, you will be surprised, totally.  But visiting Mumbai and NOT visiting Dharavi is a shame and a huge hole in your education.  Many tour companies are set up for taking groups of five to seven tourists on a walking tour of Dharavi.  They typically hire local residents who live and work in Dharavi to be your face to face tour guides:  amazingly capable and talented people who will answer all your questions.  Yes, Dharavi residents grow up, go to school through college and work and continue to live in Dharavi.Promise that this tour will break many of your preconceptions about a “slum” as the Indian citizens call it.  Amazingly dense, typical housing of 100 to 150 square feet per FAMILY UNIT, common and central (many) toilet facilities, half of area focused on housing residents to live and the other half focused on industry (recycling, value added manufacturing, leather goods from raw hides to finished goods for sale at very fair prices, etc.Please make time for this adventure and DON’T come with your prejudices, come with an open mind to learn, to ask questions, to understand, to interact, to see a part of Mumbai that is critical to their success.All of us on our tour were moved and impacted in positive ways by this tour.  A MUST for you to consider."
Dharavi,Jodi R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,An absolute must!,"Please do a tour in this area, it will completely change your perception of the “slum”!  This area and the businesses within it are necessary to Mumbai.  Without Dharavi Mumbai would have a massive garbage problem.  The slum houses thousands of different recycling businesses that recycle around 60% of the 450 million ton of garbage made in Mumbai each year.  In my opinion, Mumbai would be a huge rubbish dump without it."
Dharavi,suze,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Such an interesting tour,"We arranged the tour of the Dharavi Slums with Trans India.  Our guide was called Ahad who picked us up from our hotel and took us to the slums.  Ahad lives in the slums and was therefore able to conduct a really interesting tour which included the different areas - market stalls, recycling units, factories, school and houses.  It was really interesting to see how this place functions.  Ahad also told us that the money generated from these tours helps to pay university fees for the youngsters.  I was really apprehensive about this tour but I was definitely glad I went and would recommend it to others.  Make sure you wear good shoes and walking around can at times be challenging."

Dharavi,steadyslack,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Voyeurism,"The slum visit which I did bordered on voyeurism.I sit in my 5 star palace 6 hours later wondering why I went.Yes I can marvel at the resourcefulness of the inhabitants there, the neighbourliness, the sense of community.....but in reality in the 21st century this is a shock show. Squalid, polluted, an assault on ones every senses.I’ve witnessed this type of living in parts of Africa and the Far East during the earlier parts of my 60 years and not as a tourist either..."

Dharavi,Skaramoosh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Loved It!,"It's not for everyone but a visit to the Dahravi slums is a must-do...in our books! One of the Dahravi local teenager/resident/University student, was our tour guide through the slums. He was very proficient in English and gave us a deeper insight into Dahravi. He was also quite energetic and truly proud of his roots.This 1 sq.mile area houses about a million people. It was such a mind-blowing experience as we walked through the alleys, roads and lanes, some barely 2 feet wide and capturing all that our eyes and brain could muster.There are many industries in this dense area...pottery, recycling and tannery just to name a few. Photos and words can barely describe the feel we had but I am trying to share the best I can through the photos posted.Highly Recommended!"

Dharavi,AndynLibby,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Walking tour of Dharavi with Reality Tours,"I had the priviledge  to be on a walking tour of Dharavi, run by Reality Tours.  This was started with the residents of Dharavi and it is their voices and what they want to share about their home that is at the heart of the walking tour.  Divya was a brilliant guide.  Highly recommendable. Thank you."
Dharavi,rjaffelieb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Slum life - not what you expect,"This overpopulated slum is surprisingly industrious. Shows you what the human spirit can do. What a positive experience, not staring in at their lives but allowing their spirit in to see what it means to have less and to live more. "
Dharavi,Sim0n68,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Dharavi Slum Tour - a must do for anyone visiting Mumbai!,"Having been working and living on and off in India for 12 years, much of the time in Mumbai, I had never taken a tour of the Dharavi slums. So when a friend who was visiting India for the first time suggested we do the tour, I decided to join him. I must say that it was two of the most fascinating and eye opening hours that I have ever spent! Dharavi is a 'city within a city', fully functioning with industrial areas (such as the famous plastic recycling), residential areas, retail, schools and hospitals/medical centres. Crime is minimal and mafia do not control Dharavi. It has Hindi, Muslim and Christian communities living and working together. The kids in the slums looked happy and energetic. Some of the sights in the residential areas showed how tough the living conditions can be and we in the west should take note of how these amazing slum communities seem to just get on with what they have got and live their lives. Do yourselves a favour....go and visit! All hotels will have details of a tour company."
Dharavi,Dhaval B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Dharavi slum tour,Did a 2 hour tour. Our guide Vishal was really good - had good knowledge of the subject and was really well trained. I would recommend this tour to all who want to see different facets of Mumbai

Dharavi,Felicity P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Great walking tour of Dharavi Slum,"I was reluctant to do this tour with Amaze Tours as I didn’t want to witness such poverty and sadness, I was so glad I changed my mind it was uplifting and so interesting.Our eighteen year old guide Ganesh was so knowledgeable, we walked through what was a tightly packed maze of business quarters and then a residential quarter. The recycling businesses, the potteries, the leather and the textile side. I imagine the stews in London in the 19C would have been similar to the area minus the humidity and heat.  The area didn’t smell and everyone was clean and neatly turned out. We could peer quickly into everyday chores of the women in their kitchens and talk to the workers via Ganesh. There are 32 slums in Mumbai and this is the largest.... it is a hive of activity, everyone works and the turn over is $1 billion a year from an estimated 5,000 businesses in an area of 0.7 sq miles. It needs to be seen to be believed.You are not permitted to take photos."

Dharavi,Mukul G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Also called Antop Hill,"While many would have seen the place through so many bollywood films which have been bringing the insides of this most densely populated piece of land in Mumbai, it is an experience to feel the vibe first hand.Called the largest slum in the world.. the place is congested but no dirty. One can shop for nearly anything. The caste, religion and social differences take a back seat before the aspirations of people to make it big."

Dharavi,Amandaha21,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Fabulous and so very interesting,"We took a tour booked via no footprints in Mumbai and waris our guide was an amazing young man who spoke with enthusiasm about his home area of Mumbai. He guided us with ease through the alleyways of the area all the while imparting various items of information in the process on recycling, garment making and pottery as well as a visit to the residential areas. We found the people we encountered on the journey hospitable and friendly with the little ones all wanting to “high five” with us. We have left the area with a feeling of a tight community who respect each other working in harmony with each other. There was no offensive smells as reported in other reviews and we are humbled to have waris share his time with us in this fantastically interesting place "

Dharavi,gastronaut_11,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Definitely not a slum,"This is a place of great entrepreneurship, family commitment and  community. To call it a slum is a great misnomer. Super to visit and speak with a variety of artisans in their place of work. Good prices and excellent workmanship. Self sufficient. Chaotic roads. Smiling and friendly people."

Dharavi,BondiRescued,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Business,Not what you think it might be!,"I’m not going to wax lyrical about Dhavari, but I will say that it something to experience if you get an opportunity.Having been to Mumbai many times for work, I’d had this as something I was interested in doing and my Indian colleagues were keen for me to experience it, as were they.We went with Mystical Mumbai (separate review and a fantastic guide) and it was fascinating. Not going to say too much on it, but yes of course it is eye-opening and confronting in many ways when you absorb the information, but also there is much to admire and respect in what is a high functioning, industrious and supportive community. It’s a city within a city. What I will say is it is very safe and no-one asks for money or tries to sell you something you don’t want (although you do end up in one of the leather shops, as you might expect!), so you are left to focus on the place itself rather than watch yourself and that makes it all the better. To get the best, do go with a guide. Ours was 500 RUP each and absolutely the way to go. "
Dharavi,Shoeb,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018,Nothing Great,"By visiting one of the largest slums of the city, i dont think anyone is going to gain anything. Certain people derive pleasure in painting the city in bad colors and I am certainly not one. There are slums in lot of cities and Mumbai is no exception."
Dharavi,Robert H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Mumbai Slum Tour:Dharavi,"Fascinating insight into a hidden part of Mumbai. Dinesh, my guide and owner of Mumbai Dream Tours,grew up in the slums and is the perfect spokesperson for the community. Showing how the slums are organized and functioning as industry recyclers for India, he led me through the catacombs of the famous Dharavi slum made famous in the movie Slumdog Millionaire .There is method  to this apparent madness:industry, schools, businesses from barbers to bakers , food shops ,pan wallahs, etc. and homes to thousands living in tiny quarters accessible by ladders going up at  steep angles.One leaves with an appreciation of how strong the human spirit is and how technology has helped level the laying field for those with entrepreneurial spirit like Dinesh.For the seasoned traveler and adventuresome, this city tour is unique and not sugar coated : but it speaks to the reality of so many who are usually hidden from our view.Well worth the effort . I recommend it if you are ready to see things without prejudging."

Dharavi,sylvial,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,An eye opener!,"Unlike the unemployed poor in North America who receive social assistance to survive, it was uplifting to see the various industries employing the population of over a million in this relatively small sector of Mumbai. Children run freely with smiles on their faces, small living quarters off narrow alleys are colourfully decorated & smells of cooking permeate the air. Best place to buy pottery gifts at a fraction of the price elsewhere. "
Dharavi,Carol K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Super interesting!,Loved our time at Dharavi.  I like the fact that you can only tour this area with a resident. -- they know their way around and it is truly a maze.  Gave us an excellent glimpse into this area and in addition showed us the industrious side of a less privileged demographic.  The kids were especially fun.  We visited on a school holiday so there were kids everywhere.  It always amazes me how kids are kids no matter where they're from.
Dharavi,ColinP57,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Dharavi slum tour,We booked a two hour Reality Tours tour to the slum. We met the guide at Churchgate  station...excellent meeting point and easy to find. The guide bought railway tickets and we set off by train.  Comfortable train ride..not busy.Arriving at the Dharavi station we were met by our guide for the tour. A delightful young woman named Divya. Her English was excellent and her enthusiasm for her home community was to be admired.The your is in no way voyeuristic. Diva was clearly proud to show the commercial activities of the slum and the residential partsThe community is amazing and the memories will stay with us for a long time.Reality Tours ensure the proceeds of the tour goes to improving life and education in the slum. It was good to be able to support them.

Our guide Farzan who proudly said he was born in the slums and wants to die there , is a university commerce undergraduate.  This slum has been recycling plastics, metal for 50-60 years, long before it became trendy to do so. This tour is a "" must do "" for Mumbia"

This tour was fascinating. There are over 1 million inhabitants and over 15,000 businesses. He took us to see 3 of them...a cabinetmaker, a maker of jeans, and a leather manufacturer. There are hundreds of schools, and people of all incomes live there. Yes, visit it! Our tour was arranged by the concierge at the Taj Palace. Tour guide was top rate. "
Dharavi,John W,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Eye opening and uplifting,"What a day with Be The Local and our Uni student guide from Dharavi slum. We visited one of India's largest slums, the area made famous by Slum Dog Millionaire. The area is home to 1 million people at a density of 570,000 people per square KM!It was such an uplifting experience, and slum is just a word. This place is amazing and Australia could learn an enormous amount about how to deal with our waste. Firstly, Mumbai has banned single use plastic bags for the entire population of 26 million people (and we complain when Shops take bags away).So what we saw was thousands of small scale industries based almost entirely on recycling. They purchase the plastic and metal wastes of almost the entire city. They break the materials down to all their components etc. Plastic is graded and sorted then chopped up into tiny pieces. As an aside, they need machines to chop up the plastic. Solution, one factory makes the machines using the steel from old train wheels. They melt the steel and cast it on site. (This factory covers an area of about 20m x 20m). After the plastic is graded and chopped they then melt it and cast it into little pellets which are then sold to manufacturers to making the next product. Nothing is wasted, and puts us to shame.Aluminium is sorted, and melted down to ingots which again are sold to industry. Old paint cans are cleaned, repainted, fixed up and resold to industry for new paint products. Cardboard boxes are cleaned, cut down to a new size and sent to industry for the next product. It is hard to describe, but this area converts the waste of 26 Million people back to raw materials for another round. The economy of this ""slum"" is enormous in comparison to the business district. Almost everyone has a job or role, and they are making a positive difference by changing waste to money and raw products.If in Mumbai you really should do this tour. Extremely informative and changes perspectives.P.S. They hated the movie. It in no way reflects the reality of this amazing place and wonderful people.PPS. You can't take photos inside. We totally respected this but thought we should mention it."

Dharavi,buffy0182,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Slumdog Millionaire ,"This slum served as a backdrop for the movie ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Though it was depicted in the film as having maimed or disfigured child beggars and and prostitution, this is actually not the case in these particular slums. Tours are guided by students that are actually from the slums and quite informative and educational.  While the streets of the slums are dirty, he homes appear to be in clean condition, despite housing an average of 5 family members per 200-300 sq ft household.  Dharavi is the second most densely populated area in the world, with 1,000,000 people living within a 1 sq mile. The slums employ residents of the community in their storefronts and a hot bed for textiles and leather production. A tour through these slums is an eye-opening experience and highly recommended.  Tip: wear close toed shoes and long pants if you come here."
