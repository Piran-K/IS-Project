Dhobi_Ghat,Andrew D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Hyperlocal,"I am a sucker for watching the local lives, so this was an interesting stop. It is an easy access from Mahalaxmi Station with a viewing gallery overlooking the Dhobi Ghat. There are a few vendors who would try to sell you things, but otherwise this is a quirky attraction for those who want to observe the world's largest open air laundry."
Dhobi_Ghat,Apolonia70,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Epic undertaking - old and iconic.,I especially wanted to see this operation - over 700 families are involved in this old and forever busy laundry. It provides an essential service and runs efficiently - there is a viewing area and provides great photo opportunities. Worth seeing just to see the scale and layout. 
Dhobi_Ghat,Tom G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Hand Laundry for the Ages,"Chaos at first glance, then the organization takes shape. Colors, types of material, customer collections -- moving from the hand washing, drying and starching. Watch the workers scurry beneath the drying lines, adjusting, picking and folding. A hand laundry of unequaled size and variety."
Dhobi_Ghat,TenBaylor,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Dhobi Ghat,"We attended after a slum tour, it was middle of the day so perhaps the wrong time to visit but it is quite a spectacular sight to behold. You can smell the soap from the train,"
Dhobi_Ghat,Wen-D K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Unbelievable Sight,"Mind boggling sight  - Mumbai’s unique outdoor laundry system  is where chaos, color, activity and sounds mix together in a freakish blend. It’s a fascinating place where Mumbai's laundry gets done. Clothes are hand washed by hundreds of Dhobis (laundry men and women) on concrete sinks and hung on clotheslines.For 18 to 20 hours each day, over 7,000 people flog, scrub, dye and bleach clothes on concrete wash pens, dry them on ropes, neatly press them and transport the garments to different parts of the city. Over 100,000 clothes are washed each day. The dhobis collect clothes from all corners of the city, with their biggest clients being neighborhood laundries, garment dealers, wedding decorators and caterers, and mid-sized hotels and clubs."
Dhobi_Ghat,Alice L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Intriguing & fascinating,"Dhobi Ghat, a 140 years old open-air laundromat, is such a marvel of Mumbai. Watching the clothes painstakingly hand washed by the laundrymen in endless rows of concrete troughs fitted with flogging stones, provides an unforgettable glimpse into the workings of the city and unlike anything you have ever seen. The highlight was  the laundryman beat the clothes on the flogging stone."
Dhobi_Ghat,Anna,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,A wonderful and colourful outdoor spectacular,One of the highlights of Mumbai. Absolutely amazing. How does anyone get their own washing back? We'd highly recommend a visit even if it's only for 10 minutes. Lots and lots of street traders selling their wares too though so be prepared. 
Dhobi_Ghat,springbank,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Called the world's largest outdoor laundry,"a traditional outdoor laundry, where clothes are still washed in large outdoor pools. Dhobis pick up laundry from the better-off section of the population, hotels and hospitals. Wash, iron and return it. A hard physical work. It was constructed in 1890. There were rows of open-air concrete wash pens, each fitted with its own flogging stone. Called the world's largest outdoor laundry, Dhobi Ghat is a very popular attraction among foreign tourists."
Dhobi_Ghat,igolfCA,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Quite an experience!,"This is quite an experience and should be visited by every tourist to Mumbai. It was certainly one of the most enlightening things we did. This open air laundry is the largest in the world and the laundry is done by hand by men! They use concrete vats filled with water and soap and pound, slap, wring, twist, etc. the clothes and garments until they are clean. They also do sheets, towels, and other linens from hotels. After the items are washed, they are hung to dry on lines and anything else they can find. The place is huge and mind-boggling. It was like nothing I have ever seen. Definitely worth a visit even if it is out of your way."
Dhobi_Ghat,MWandAW,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Over 7000 men washing clothes,"Find the lookout point on the bridge over the railway line. This is a place to see the worlds largest open air laundry. What you actually see are hundred of clothes lines built on top of the dwellings, covered with every type of garment usually in color order.  The men called Dhobi, used to hand wash all of the garments in open air concrete wash bins, but now you can see that many use washing machines. This occupation passed down from one generation to the next. The families of the Dhobi live in the dwellings under the clothes lines. It is one of the most famous sites in Mumbai and definitely worth a visit for photo or two."
Dhobi_Ghat,Paul S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A tourist must,Worth a trip out to watch the washing being done outside. Head for the viewing area. While in the area the Dadar flower market is a short Uber ride away . The people are very friendly and make you feel very welcome
Dhobi_Ghat,neslihani2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Impressive.  A view of one of a lifetime,"Open air laundry of Mumbai. Unbelievable  scene.  All around, men wash all kinds of laundry by hand, they hang, dry in open air. Then they make bundles to send back the clean laundry. Worth to see. "
Dhobi_Ghat,NauticalDreamer3010,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Impressive operation,Our tour pause for  a few minutes above this impressive operation.  It is as vast as it is fascinating. The level of cooperation between competing businesses is impressive.
Dhobi_Ghat,gfsc5,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Laundry work,"This is one of those amazing places that one has to see to believe.  The largest open air laundry in the world with men washing clothes, bedding, curtains - you name it - in large concrete vats.  Lots of stomping on clothes, belting, lathering, rinsing (not in that order, obviously!).  It's an amazing place to visit to see the washing and all of the sparkling clean garments, sheets etc. hanging out on the lines.  There's a viewing platform so no danger from traffic or anything.Well worth a visit."
Dhobi_Ghat,Libby in Cincinnati,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,One of those things you need to see in Mombai,"This is the largest open- air laundry in the world. It is part of the slum areas with men washing other people’s clothes in large open cement tubs. They beat and scrub the clothes with brushes. When they finish, they take a bath in the water they used to wash the clothes. It is interesting to watch them and to see what life is like in this community. There is a community school for the children which we thought was interesting to see."
Dhobi_Ghat,lislander,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Must see,Make sure to stop here and see how Mumbai's clothes get washed. It is very interesting to learn how all clothes are marked and delivered to the correct owners throughout the city. A logistics miracle. 
Dhobi_Ghat,oldiesontherun,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Incredible.,"When watching the men ( yes only men do the washing) doing the laundry , stamping on them, it amazes me that things cone out looking so clean and whites so white."
Dhobi_Ghat,Ellen P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Solo,A unique culture & place,"Went here as part of a tour package. Because I arrived in the afternoon, there wasn't much acitivity there. As my guide was explaining about the amount of money each person gets per piece of laundry, I couldn't help feeling amazed about their ability to survive. A truly unique culture & place"
Dhobi_Ghat,ankushsunkale,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,must visit place for foreigners,"For foreigners this is a must visit place as they can understand logistics , working of traditional laundry business.you can only view from viewing galary  and it has write up in english in gallary. around 15 to 30 minutes are more than enough"
Dhobi_Ghat,Marion L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Impressive,"We were there in the afternoon, therefore missed  a lot of the main activities of the day. We were still able to see some people at work and could see the many lines of linens including hospital laundry on the line. Had fun with a bunch of kids, just having fun"
Dhobi_Ghat,markb120,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Unique, but go inside",Once you see Dhobi Ghat from inside and not from the above view point you will see the people that live and work there. Much more interesting than an overall picture.
Dhobi_Ghat,MukeshDave,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Cloth washers home,This is an amazing place esp for photography as several washermen (dhobi) making this place as outdoor laundry. The drying of clothes make the scene very photogenic and colourful 
Dhobi_Ghat,Max92,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,You will come anyway,"but it's really only for a quick look-see. There is nothing to do, and you take your photo and move on."
Dhobi_Ghat,AnilJ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Hand washed on a major scale,A must view place to see the way clothes are washed by hand on a major scale. Just remember to check your hotel bed linen as chances are it’s been hand-washed here! 
Dhobi_Ghat,Henry099,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Unbelievable,"Do not miss this attraction. An open-air humongous laundry all done manually taking care of tens of thousands of laundry bags. Put your cell phone in video mode and move it from end to end, you will amaze people at home."
Dhobi_Ghat,Nisha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Great,Such a lovely place it was .Great place dhobhi that is great place and such a lovely huge laundry place it was I totally enjoyed it
Dhobi_Ghat,Kate R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Worth a look,We travelled to this tourist site by train. You only get to see the laundry from a viewing platform which is a bit disappointing. We had seen similar in Goa where you had hands on experience so was not the end of the world.
Dhobi_Ghat,Snakecharmer,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Seen from a viewing platform,We were taken here on a tour but did not actually go in.  Having been inside a dhoby at Goa I suppose I didn't miss anything.  You need a long lens to see any detail.  It's certainly big but not much of a tourist attraction.  Unless you are into laundries?
Dhobi_Ghat,seeker_here,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,A Legendary Mumbai Place,Dhobi Ghat is the place where the dhobis or the washermen wash clothes. It is probably the largest such place in the world.
Dhobi_Ghat,Ilana Keren Gil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,The largest laundry in the world,"Every day, very large quantities of sheets and towels and clothes are washed here, manually and in extremely difficult working conditions. It is a very special site, yet difficult to watch."
Dhobi_Ghat,Charlotte Jam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Interesting,"My husband and I visited Dhobi Ghat whilst sightseeing in South Mumbai. We were told it was a good tourist spot even though its normal for locals to see. It's basically a huge washing area. The contrast between the slums and the huge sky scrappers in the background is surprising to see. You can't really stay here long but worth stopping at if you are out and about sightseeing. We didn't go into Dhobi Ghat, we were unsure if you even could, however there is a viewing platform at the top."
Dhobi_Ghat,2torontotraveller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Laundry Done the Old Fashion Way,"I actually visited the Dhobi Ghat twice while I was in Mumbai.  I saw it the first day when I was on a shore excursion from my cruise ship.  The second day I saw it as part of tour of the slums of Mumbai.The laundry is done the old fashion way by a number of workers who do the work manually.  There is a platform overseeing the area so that the tourists can get a good look and take some interesting pictures. This is a very popular tourist attraction.   My friend who loves to take pictures was also able to get good pictures of the numerous trains going by this area, as well as pictures of the laundry."
Dhobi_Ghat,Jacko,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Amazing,Don't miss!A huge place which desicated only to laundry. The workers are really nice and can explain you the laundry process.
Dhobi_Ghat,Mulchand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Excellent Place,"Look at the human laundry live in action. DO NOT MISS kinda thing that one should experience in Mumbai. Pro tip: For the best photographs, visit the place between 6am and 9am. "
Dhobi_Ghat,Mars,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Clinging to the Past,"This enormous outdoor laundry is quite a colourful and interesting place to visit and learn about. Although it is not as popular as it once was, it still remains a vibrant endeavour which attracts many tourists. The contrast with it’s surroundings is stark and startling!"
Dhobi_Ghat,747nadia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Wow,We stopped for photos and were amazed. It is bigger than what i imagined.This municipal washing system is so impressive and is still working through all these years. The look out point gives you a great opportunity for photos.There are a lot of hawkers trying to sell souvenirs.Overall definitely a place to stop and stare in Mumbai
Dhobi_Ghat,westphillyboy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Cool to see,Incredible operation. Amazing to learn how it works just like the lunch delivery system. Had a guide which helped fill in my questions.  Good place for a quick visit 10-15 minutes.
Dhobi_Ghat,golouis99,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Short stop for photo-op,"This massive outdoor laundry has been in operation for 125 years and probably hasn't changed much over that time except for the viewing platform built for tourists to take pictures. The washing is done by hand in large tubs and the laundry hung out to dry on lines. Remarkably, even though this is a collection of individual family operations in a crowded space everybody receives back the precisely items they delivered to the laundry."
Dhobi_Ghat,Eliya Devan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Dhoby ghaut to ghat,Amazing to see how the ghat functions. Good lookout is made for tourists or passer by to take a look as well. With plaques to inform of its origins. 
Dhobi_Ghat,neilwinch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Fascinating - a must see,Another of those sites you have too see when visiting Mumbai. Stand up on the bridge overlooking the open air laundry and ponder how the hell anyone knows what belong to who. Never seen anything quite like it. Really is a must see in Mumbai.
Dhobi_Ghat,Peach P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Washing,This is an amazing place to visit to see how your washing is done when you send it out to the laundry. 
Dhobi_Ghat,Jeremy J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Gritty. Working laundry like no other.,"There is a viewpoint spot overlooking the site. Most will stop there, but the intrepid can (and should) walk down the steps and wander. It's not an exhibit and workers don't like to be photographed. But if you are polite, respectful and sensible no one will trouble you and it's another amazing Mumbai experience"
Dhobi_Ghat,TBSMKS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Amazing to See,We were there on a miserable rainy day and there were people washing clothes in these big concrete tubs/squares. This is an open air laundry - I don’t know how they can keep track of what gets delivered where. This is old fashioned ingenuity at its best. 
Dhobi_Ghat,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Amazing sight,"Dhobi Ghat is the washing machine centre of Mumbai. It’s basically a community of laundromats where many institutions of Mumbai get their laundry done. I wandered in and I could see concrete pens where some people still do the washing by hand, although the majority of the “shops” have mechanical washing machines. The washed clothes are hung out to dry in the open air and it’s a real sight to see. It’s great wandering around the ghat to see the washing in action, but the best view is from the viewing platform on K K Road."
Dhobi_Ghat,JAMS51,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Wow what an amazing sight,Unbelievable how they manage to wash clothes the way they do & not just for homes but hotels & even hospitals how they can manage to keep track of all the items without modern technology is also amazing.  This should defiantly be on your must see list.  
Dhobi_Ghat,amcaJamaica,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Laundry City!  Fasincating,You have to go there to believe it!   White of White and Denims....how they keep track of it is beyond me... Only in India!   A super service!
Dhobi_Ghat,Andrew D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Friends,Something different to see in Mumbai,"The viewing platform allows Dhobi Ghat to be easily viewed from above, and it's a great sight. Without doubt you'll be hassled by people selling things but that's the case with any attraction, just be vigilant. If you go down the stairs to the entrance of the Dhobi Ghat you'll be greeted by people who want to give you a tour - they weren't pushy but it was Rs200 per person. We probably could have got this for less if we tried but it seemed a fair price. You need to be shown around by someone who knows the area given that you probably wouldn't find your way back out very easily! Definitely worth seeing if you have a spare half hour.  "
Dhobi_Ghat,daisynook2,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Take Care,A fascinating place but advise fellow travellers to take care.  There are so many steps and narrow alleyways to explore.  I lost my footing and managed to end up in hospital with a broken bone.  The workers in there were wonderful actually carrying me to a taxi to go to hospital.
Dhobi_Ghat,amazingtogo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,the laundry,this is really interesting to get a tour with a guide in Dhobi Ghat to get all information of how it works !
Dhobi_Ghat,Debbie P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A Must to See in Mumbai,"We had heard a lot about this place and was not disappointed.  Make sure you barter for a guide as the price varies from guide to guide.  We paid 300 rupees which we were happy with.  The guide took us around the Dhobi Ghat pointing out some interesting facts and seeing it in action, from washing and drying clothes to ironing new shirts which were going to the stores to be sold.  Well worth a visit"
Dhobi_Ghat,Kelvin Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Stop by when in Mumbai. Unique (bird's eye) view of Dhobi Ghat.,A brief stop during our tour of Mimbai.  Well worth the stop. Unique (bird's eye) view of Dhobi Ghat from a built-for-tourist platform - much safer than viewing from the street.  Dhobi Ghat is much smaller than I imagined
Dhobi_Ghat,SaveyFLTraveler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Largest open air laundry in the world,"Oh my goodness, this is a sight to behold. 500 men work in this outdoor laundry.  Jeans, sheets, clothes, etc are all hung out to dry. It is 140 years old and still going strong. "
Dhobi_Ghat,wizardoldman,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Fascinating,"An unusual tourist stop where you watch the washing being done. You can marvel at how they manage not to lose anything in the multitude of garments being washed. Watch out for hawkers and beggars,"
Dhobi_Ghat,John,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,something a bit different,"dhobi ghat is india's largest outside laundry, we managed to get a tour with a local and he explained how it all works, im really amazed that nothing gets mixed up lol. to see they still use irons which run on caol is incredible."
Dhobi_Ghat,Krishna Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,best place to check how we get clean cloths everyday,this dhobi ghat is largest and you can check the number of people washing clothes which we give our dhobis ..great vie and a great place to do photography for the project work
Dhobi_Ghat,Chubb,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"To call viewing washing a sight seeing must is strange, but it is!","The authorities have recognised the value of this sight and have put in a little viewing platform, you used to just stand on the bridge, so this is a really positive development.  The washing, wash tubs, and clothes lines are a sight to behold and a definite stop by in Mumbai.  Unfortunately the small area is also now surrounded by hawkers so be prepared to say no a lot."
Dhobi_Ghat,KathieVee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Couples,This is better than any Museum ,"Truly, this is a must see. This laundry started in 1890 and continues to be just about the same today. Acres of clothes hanging on twisted ropes so no clothes pins needed. Men do the wash and spank the wash against the stones to get the dirt out. They do the laundry for most 1star to 4 star hotels, apparently and they don’t make mistakes even though there is no computerized system. It’s truly amazing to see n action. "
Dhobi_Ghat,jonesan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Old methods live on,This area is shrinking as the property developers move in all around but still worth a visit to see how laundry for the masses is still done very much by hand
Dhobi_Ghat,NancyBercaw,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Extraordinary Example of Industriousness,"You have to see the world's largest public laundry! What an incredible example of Indian industriousness. The people here are working hard, and serving the community in a way that most of us could never imagine."
Dhobi_Ghat,Petra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,"watched for an hour just when the rain started, what an experience!","Very nice to see all the activity going on, impressive. Take your time and just watch what is going on. Of course the washing but also the little kids playing in the washing area. When we were there it just started to rain, makes it extra special!"
Dhobi_Ghat,Geoffrey Thomas Gillies,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Washday Blues,"A good way to keep fit, working at this outdoor washing area. I now feel spoiled having machines to do my laundry, it is a very interesting experience and definitely well worth a visit. "
Dhobi_Ghat,Dashers2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Business,Wow indeed!,Never knew such a place existed! Families who were brought by the British to wash the uniforms for the forces many years ago continue to do the task for the city! Amazing place. Incredible. A MUST VISIT SITE! 
Dhobi_Ghat,Arvind Kumar Yadav,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Different Experience,"I only had experience watching this place in bollywood movies. Though, Experience became live in Mumbai Trip. This is one of the area where most tourist want to visit as this kind of place is rare to see."
Dhobi_Ghat,TOMVAS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019,Beware of people charging money,If  you are taking pictures inside the ghat there are people charging you money and saying they are civil servants...they are not very kind. 
Dhobi_Ghat,alseward53,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Amazing,Our private tour included this amazing open air laundry and you have just got to see it to believe it. So enterprising and much better than tumble drying!
Dhobi_Ghat,Tae Wanderer,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Business,An amazing scene to see in Mumbai,Dhobi Ghat is the biggest outdoor hand-washed laundromat in Mumbai. The view of thousands of clothes and sheets are being hung in that area surrounded by big buildings was just amazing. It's like the scene from Slum Dog Millionaire!
Dhobi_Ghat,Anwer Dhanji,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,The worlds largest laundry,"Really worth a visit to see how Mumbai washes its clothes in the biggest open laundry. Beware of tauts who will pester you to show you around and then ask for a lot of money. Just go there and you do not need guide, just follow the small alleyway that leads to the different parts of the world's biggest laundry "
Dhobi_Ghat,let's travel now,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Open Air Laundry ,This open air laundry is in Mumbai on the west coast of India. 4000 people are employed here but the service is decreasing as the years go by with hospitals buying commercial machines. The soiled laundry is left to soak overnight and the following day each piece of laundry is flogged by hand and rinsed 5 times.  The laundry is dried outside on the roofs of outbuildings. Dryers are used in the monsoon season.  The charge is 30 rupees per item.The laundry is spread over 3 acres
Dhobi_Ghat,Ben,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Business,Crazy,Worth a quick stop. Recently built platform that gives excellent views. Fits into other parts of tours very well
Dhobi_Ghat,Michael D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,What an interesting business to view from above in Mumbai,"Over 1,000 people a day are employed by the laundry from dawn to dusk in shifts manually doing the laundry of hospitality businesses in Mumbai. Viewed from street level and crammed into an area next to a busy railway line, these workers seem to perform miracles cleaning clothing and Manchester without appearing to make errors. How those clothes stay clean in that environment is also a challenge. "
Dhobi_Ghat,Aleta14,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Laundry plus!,Our visit was great to learn about life in Dhobi Ghat.. not just laundry for big businesses and private people but a historical place with stories that stretch way back...
Dhobi_Ghat,cannytripper,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Organisation on a massive scale,"We visited here with our guide after a trip by train outside of rush time. We never imagined the area would be so vast, clothes and textiles being washed and dried visible from our vantage point above. How things are returned to their owners is a feat of brilliant organisation, love the method of hanging the items which does not require pegs, must learn this for the English weather as removal when it rains is often happening. So many people involved and so many processes including folding , and ironing which was not visible. Ideal for the Indian climate which means the items can be quickly dried. So glad we visited. "
Dhobi_Ghat,rjpriyanka,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Washers...,Visiting this place is amazing feeling. A huge open place where so many washermen are cleaning cloths like entire mumnbai has decided to get their laundry done today
Dhobi_Ghat,Umang A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Laundry,"A huge open space used for laundry , you will feel like these people are washing cloths for entire Mumbai here."
Dhobi_Ghat,Raymond W,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Why All the Fuss,"While the facts behind Dhobi Ghat are interesting, such as the they never lose or mix up things, and jobs are passed down from father to son, the actual site is not that interesting. We spent less than 10 minutes on the viewing platform, and this was the same for other visitors we saw. Mumbai is also such a huge city that a trip out here takes quite a while.All in all, maybe just read about it rather than visit."
Dhobi_Ghat,Lianne_and_Leighton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Amazing!,"We caught a train from Churchgate to Mahalaxmi station to visit Dhobi Ghat. Return tickets cost INR 40 per person. Get off the train and turn left to get across the railway lines. Turn right at the road and then turn right at the traffic bridge. The Dhobi Ghat viewing platform is on this bridge but if you go down the stairs and walk towards the entry to Dhobi Ghat, an informal guide will approach. Negotiate a price and a fantastic experience awaits. Such organisation in this old but intergenerational vocation is evident. INR 3 per item is all that is paid for laundry and wages are INR 100 per day. We loved this unique and special tour."
Dhobi_Ghat,MARKEITH69,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Good but not Brilliant,"I was quite excited about going here, but disappointed when we arrived to find out we could only view it from a very crowded and busy viewing area and were not allowed to go down and visit it. "
Dhobi_Ghat,Jan O,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Absolutely fascinating,"This open air manual laundry is amazing. You can view it from above on a viewing platform for free or you can pay to go and walk around inside.  Personally I would do both as you get an idea of scale from above and an understanding of how it works if you have a guide to look around inside.  Even with an explanation from a guide and having visited twice, I still have no idea how they get the right clothes back to the right households. Really clever way of hanging clothes with no use of pegs too! Fascinating experience and an absolute must see in Mumbai along with the Dabbawahlers (lunchbox men). "
Dhobi_Ghat,01tw1969,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,You have to see it to believe it,"We were fortunate to go twice in two days on two different tours. It is spectacular and a newly built shaded viewing platform means you can watch it all happen in front of you. Thousands of garments and bedlinen from the city being washed and dried by hundreds of men. The bright colours, hundreds of pairs of jeans and bleached white sheets hanging on the twisted lines. Fascinating to watch and unique"
Dhobi_Ghat,Robert S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Amazing,"How one gets his laundry back is a mystery as apparently hotels, hospitals and individuals send their laundry here for washing, beating on a rock, rinsing, ironing and packaging is all done and returned to the owner without loss.  Amazing!"
Dhobi_Ghat,Ralph Wilhelm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"Stunning, one of a kind; must see to understand Mumbai","The Dhobi Ghat is best seen from the overpass that is on one edge of the Ghat itself.  It is not practical nor really needed to walk down into the Ghat; way too crowded and too many people working hard at cleaning and ironing clothes.  The city has created cement “steps” areas that the Dhobi’s use to clean clothes.  There also are slum type houses where the Dhobi’s live and also iron clothes, etc.  This is a vital part of the city that is required and used by many of the middle class and above to get clean and pressed clothes.  You would be able to see, but there is a middleman community that picks up dirty clothes from customers around the city in the morning, delivers them to the Dhobi Ghat, and returns clean clothes in the afternoon.Best time to visit would appear to be in the morning due to rush to turn clean clothes around.And from our tour guide who uses the Dhobis to clean her clothes, the cost is anywhere from ten cents to fifteen cents US to clean an article of clothing with an extra charge for ironing.This is a vital part of Mumbai that makes the city work and work well.  Strongly suggest a visit to learn and observe and understand."
Dhobi_Ghat,Mikan999,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Interesting view of working people,"This is an interesting view of a huge open air laundry where thousands of items a day are being laundered by hundreds of people (almost all men) - almost without any machinery.  You can see the area from a bridge just next to the Mahalaxmi Train Station. Quite understandingly, you can't enter the congested and busy laundry itself. No payment is required as you look down from a public area. It can be crowded when a tour bus arrives but they all go within 10 minutes so wait for this.It is a good reminder that despite the immense wealth being generated in modern Mumbai there are still people like this, working in extremely poor conditions and living in poverty."
Dhobi_Ghat,jim m,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,must see,"It is a spectacle without any doubt - there is a viewing platform but you do not need it.  If you want to spend time looking at people working hard in poor conditions then this is the place.BEWARE of two things - the people begging and getting close, - the traffic that zooms past with no intention of looking out for you."
Dhobi_Ghat,Jodi R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,A must see - Truly amazing!,"So this is a giant laundry!  Businesses around Mumbai, hotels, factories, hospitals, etc have their laundry collected, cleaned, dried and ironed and delivered by the laundry.  Their methods and organisation is quite something.  Definitely a must see when in Mumbai."
Dhobi_Ghat,Atm530,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Interesting and well worth the visit,"This was one of the places I wanted to visit in Mumbai. It did not disappoint. It was very interesting to me. When we were there they were constructing a viewpoint that would overlook the dhobi ghat. This is a good idea and will be appreciated by the people visiting it.Don't take a tour - you can easily get to this place via taxi, rickshaw or a train."
Dhobi_Ghat,ATTILA B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,Interesting,"interesting ""sights"" If you are not going to miss it. Just a few photos, but you can't see it elsewhere. This is a laundry! You'll see millions of washed, expanded garments at the same time that the sun dries."
Dhobi_Ghat,safarisurfers,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Interesting,Our Taxi driver warned us that we may be asked to buy tickets to visit the Ghat but advised us to ignore them. Its no longer all traditional. We saw use of industrial size washing machines. Still it was interesting.
Dhobi_Ghat,Surrey 13,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,Fascinating ,Well worth a visit to see the city's washing being beaten against stones to clean them and then  hung out to dry on lines or roofs of buildings. It is massive. You have to watch out for the huge bundles of washing being trundled on carts being pulled by hand. 
Dhobi_Ghat,Ethelberga H,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Amazing Sight of Washing by Hand,"We visited here by taxi and got out on the bridge so we could overlook the whole area. We went early in the morning as this is when most of the actual washing is done. We were amazed at how many men were washing clothes, sheets, overalls, even saris in stone troughs and then beating some of the sheets on the stone side. The lines of washing were soon pretty full over this huge area. Many of the men had to climb up and down rope ladders to get the lines fastened in place. Such hard work."
Dhobi_Ghat,Nangavaram R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,A Unique spectacle see clothes being washed,Very huge place tons of clothes are washed by washer-men (Dhobis). It is spectacle see how clothes beaten on a stone dried and folded.
Dhobi_Ghat,Skaramoosh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Thumbs Up!,It was quite early in the morning when we visited this place. Decided to observe from a perch rather than startle the 'dhobis' with our presence and trigger happy photo-snapping.It's quite a sight to behold as we watched them start their day.Not necessarily a must-see but worth the while. It's quite educational and great for photographers.Recommended!
Dhobi_Ghat,Penwyllt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Wonderful insight into Mumbai Laundry,This was a fascinating visit to see how the Dhobi wallahs do private and hotel laundry for many in the city it is a self contained community which even has its own school well worth a visit

Dhobi_Ghat,Santosh Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Unique place,Had been to this place and found this place very unique in Mumbai as it is expanded at very large area.
Dhobi_Ghat,Simi_,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Dhobi ghat,"For those who don't know,Dhobi Ghat basically means a washerman who collects and delivers laundry...this place is located near MahaLaxmi Racecourse...it's a typical area where people come to wash their clothes...I'd recommend this to people who like to do photography of places or people to visit for knowledgeable aspects...as I see alot of foreigners visiting this place for experiencing and photographing"
Dhobi_Ghat,Clive Wilson,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,See it to believe it,"This place is on all tourist agendas . Some may wonder why, others may be intrigued. It’s a massive open air laundry . Huge, within a shanty-town area. A railway runs yards from it, modern buildings in the background. With all the squalor surrounding this area and the train line by its side  how do all the hundreds of clean items stay clean? How do the people running the site know who’s garments are who’s? It’s a mystery but worth the ten minute or so stop to view. Yes, it’s crazy but so is the city and so is the country!"
Dhobi_Ghat,fizzy1991,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,World's largest open air laundry,"Over 200 families live and work in these makeshift homes.  The ""trade"" of washerman is handed down from generation to generation.  This one has been here for over 140 years and is fascinating to watch from the street above."
Dhobi_Ghat,rjpriyanka,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Unbelievable,So this place where laundry people come to wash clothes of theirs clients.  The amount of volume is amazing
Dhobi_Ghat,BackPacker818211,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Business,the old Indian laundry employs a lot of men,"This is an unusual, exotic and easily available experience, when you are in Mumbai. If you visit in early day hours, you will see clothes washing, in late hours you will see clothes hanging on strings and men folding dry clothes."
Dhobi_Ghat,Nirja,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Unique open air laundry,"Dhobi ghat is generally by the river or lake or pond but in this place, it is actually built for dhobi's . It's an unique experience, how systematic it looks... very simple n very Indian. Best view is from the Mahalaxmi station bridge. They've shown Dhobi ghat in Munnabhai MBBS. Foreigners love to visit this place."
