Elephanta_Caves,Acineto,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Interesting History,"The boat to Elephanta is located directly behind the Gateway of India in Colaba. I brought my ticket in line while waiting for the boat. I came quite early on a Sunday morning (0930) so it wasn't too busy at the wharf or on the island. The boat ride was interesting as people were feeding the gulls but was quite long, about an hour.A wasn't planning on getting a guide when I arrived but one latched onto me. It cost 3000 rupees for the tour. The entry into the village and into the caves was on top of that, about 600 Rupees total. There is a toilet in the village which also was paid.I probably would have enjoyed walking around by myself to explore the island without the guide. However, having him there was interesting since I was able to learn about the history of the island and the caves. I was also able to learn more about the culture and the meanings of the different carvings inside the cave. There are monkeys on the island so be wary in case they snatch things from you. I also did learn that they close on Mondays to that the island villagers are able to stock up for the week. I was also informed that it is less busy during the weekdays.The village area has plenty of souvenir stalls as well as restaurants. They are present from the wharf to the top of the caves area so there are plenty of opportunities for both. They were a bit sketchy with lunch though since I ended up paying for lunch for myself and my guide without prior knowledge. The place did get really crowded as I left. The wharf area was packed so it was a little difficult getting around. I did try the train on the way back to the boat, which was a novelty. Be aware that there are two companies that work the boats, show your ticket to the people in charge so that you return to the right place.Overall it was an interesting way to spend half a day learning about the history and culture of the area. It could potentially be a day trip if you were planning on exploring the whole island and having a picnic."
Elephanta_Caves,Michelle D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Couples,Excellent tour guide,"Manoj is the best guide ever AND very talented photographer. Taught me a few tricks with my own iPhone! Full of interesting information, but not too much! 😉 Highly recommend requesting this guide. Made a great trip for us, recommended good food, and was nice and slow for us walking up all of those steps. Would request him again in one second."
Elephanta_Caves,Muthoni K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 • Solo,Heartfelt trip and loaded with informative history...,History preservation at best.I got a guide courtesy of the review that was made by a couple on this site they recommended him he is such a great gentleman and a great guide. To visit the caves one needs a guide as there are no writeups there. I loved the boat experience and the history of the place it was worth the visit as much as I was contemplating..If you need a guide I totally recommend him his number is +91 98704 73673 he is called chandrakant.He made my visit to the caves very memorable. I did a solo trip ..
Elephanta_Caves,Happy King,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Great 1/2 Day trip from Mumbai but ferry ride process is challenging,Well preserved monolithic cave temple with inspiring sculptures. Highly suggest to get a local guide to walk you through the site - well worth it.  Be prepared to pay a 15x entrance fee if you’re not an Indian citizen (aadhar card or passport proof required if you’re challenged). The ferry ride from Mumbai Gateway of India has a lot to be desired.
Elephanta_Caves,Andrew D,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Solo,Average,"I have seen quite a number of cave temples in India such as Ajanta, Ellora and Badami—I have to say that Elephanta is my least favorite so far.Out of the 5 main caves, only Cave 1 is truly great. The other ones are mixture of good to plain. Near the cave entrance, there is a Cannon Hill point which is a plain hike offering little sceneries under a hot sun (even in the early morning).I also took an off-the-beaten hike through one of the mountains towards Cave 6, which again offers no meaningful reliefs with poorly-maintained pathways.Seeing that it took 1 hour per way to get there, I am not thrilled with the overall experience. I am glad I went there to tick off another UNESCO World Heritage Site, but I am not planning to return a second time."
Elephanta_Caves,Apolonia70,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,"Ferry boat, mini-train and 120 steps to fisrt cave","The main reason I scored average for this tour was that it needs endurance to do this tour.  We arrived at the ferryboat to be told there was a delay.  My guide did some negotiating and managed to get us on board the first ferry to depart. It was delayed because security was tight - some dignitary was visiting the island. We were the only ferry boat to depart until after another 1.5 hrs. Lucky.  The ferry trip is good because you get great views back to the city - Gateway to India and the Taj hotel and city skyline. Lots of small boats add colour. There are also large commercial ships, tug boats and the Indian navy.  A massive oil refinery and pipelines stretch out to sea as is the newly being constructed highway system joining another part of the mainland.  It is impossibly long. Once you reach the island and disembark at the jetty - you have the option to walk or ride the mini-train. Hot and humid so the train a logical choice. Endurance is needed to reach the caves - 120 steps of various height and surface demand constant focus and persistence. it would have been less arduous if there was better airflow. The stall keepers had erected blue plastic shades over their stall and the steps so it made things even hotter and more steamy. I was determined to climb all steps and refused offers to be carried up in a 2-4 man sedan chair.  I did climb up and down all of them.  The first main cave is an example of religious figures telling the story of Shiva and other gods/ goddesses. It was cooler in the cave and not too many tourists. I dint visit the other caves or areas - by then I was too dehydrated. Thankfully a stall was selling fresh lime soda and I drank 2 glasses.  This visit was tough for me at over 70yrs of age - so perhaps for younger and more able persons this would not have been their experience. Basically - I am glad I visited and even if you have seem other similar sites - there is always something new to learn. If nothing else the photo ops from the boat make it worthwhile."
Elephanta_Caves,77cjk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Need to do at least once when you visit Mumbai,"What a spectacular site to see these caves!   There are a number of guides that harass you on your way in - we didn't partake.  The walk through the caves takes only 30-45 minutes.  The ferry journey from Gateway of India to Elephanta island takes 1-1.5 hours each way.  The degree of trash while you walk from the jetty to the caves is off putting.  There are a number of stalls selling souvenirs, drinks, food on your way up/down from the jetty.  The gimmicky train from the jetty to the stairs is unnecessary."
Elephanta_Caves,Neelam Rawat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Friends,One of the best trip,I have been there in 2009 when I was in college.We were group of friends and initially I thought it will be boring place for old age or history lover but I was wrong.This was a one of my favorite place as for reaching there you need to take a boat or something and that makes your trip more memorable and beautiful !!Also when you reach there you feel very peaceful as it's a bit away from city and less crowded !!I would love to visit again as it's been I long time and I really wanna take a break from a fast forward life and it's actually a good place to change your mood !!
Elephanta_Caves,Sudhendra D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Couples,Excellent,"The place is worth visiting. You need to trek about 45 minutes after reaching steamer. No need to carry any food or snacks, lots of hotels are available.If you take a guide, you can get lot of information."
Elephanta_Caves,mausumee,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Elephanta Caves.,"It was a great experience going by a Launch leaving from the Gateway Of India. From the jetty, had to walk about a kilometre and climb up a considerable number of steps to reach the caves. Though much of the carvings have been destroyed with the course of time and maybe also by invaders as these carvings depict Shiva/nataraj, the remnants speak of the rich culture and heritage of India. Quite a touristy place where the road is lined with shops selling street food and souvenirs. While on our return journey to the jetty, we took the quaint toy train and the journey was fun as the small carriages rattled their way amidst the bay water on both sides. The whole day was a bit tiring but it was indeed much fun. Visitors to Mumbai should not miss this place.By the way, all basic facilities are available at this spot. The launch leaves frequently every half hour and the ticket is Rs.250/="
Elephanta_Caves,Caroline C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Family,A wonderful morning,"The main cave was absolutely breath taking and a real hit with the whole family. The toilets were well kepy and the variety of good available on the walk up and down was very good. Just be mindful that if you have mobility issues, this would be quite a difficult trip."
Elephanta_Caves,Diane Lapworth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Couples,Absolutely Incredible!! Could not recommended it more!,"I hadn't really done a lot of research about this place before we went, more of a last minute trip once we'd arrived in Mumbai. This ended up being my favourite day of our whole trip! The caves were amazing and the statue carvings are incredible! I would highly recommend using a tour guide as there are no explanations or information boards once you go in. We got the ferry from The Gateway of India and were met by Chandrakant at the other side. I wasn't looking for a tour guide, but I immediately got a good vibe from him and took his offer of showing us around. It only cost £14 for both me and my partner and it was worth every penny. He took us through the crowds and past the busy shops, then he enthusiastically explained all the history of the caves. He also helped us jump the queue for buying tickets which was great. After that, he walked us to his village on the island, a really unique experience which was only 10 minutes away. He made us tea and we chatted about all sorts of things! We also met his daughter. Later, he walked us back to the main area and showed us a great place to eat! I cannot recommend this tour enough. A real authentic and once in a lifetime experience. I've even put his number on (with his permission) in case you want to book him too! Chandrakant +919870473673Have fun!"
Elephanta_Caves,Maria Ligaya,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,"This site is filled with maltreatment and abuse of stray dogs, which turns me off.","It was a nice day out for the family, we learnt about its history, and there are areas to relax and have a picnic. HOWEVER, what truly turned me off about this site was the maltreatment of the stray dogs by the Guards and locals.There are an alarming amount of stray dogs in this area, and many are in critical condition. Malnourished and dehydrated, the majority are skin and bones. I realise that not everyone likes dogs, but the absolute least they should do is leave them alone. The only reason they become hostile is because they have been mistreated and abused by humans. They will return in kind if you leave them alone and respect their space. The guards, on the other hand, are beating them with sticks and starving them to death. If you are concerned about the impact of the stray on your guests, I recommend contacting a Mumbai Animal Shelter, the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or one of the other organisations that may help. This type of situation bothers me and makes me uncomfortable.  You might also simply give them food or water. You may bring them some inexpensive cookies to feed them. When a location and its inhabitants are harsh to stray animals, it has a negative and psychological impact on certain tourists, turning them off."
Elephanta_Caves,Wilson Miller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Visit the caves and local villages,"Overall, Elephanta Island is well worth a visit on a first trip to Bombay. As compared to the bustle of the city, the island and its scenery are serene. The ferry from the Gateway of India is pleasant, with views of the harbor and many cargo ships, though not spectacular. Upon arrival, the path to the caves ascends a number of steps lined with vendors hawking souvenirs -- a bit tacky for my taste but expected at any popular tourist attraction. The caves themselves are interesting, well-kept, and beautifully set. Though I did not partake, a guide may be worthwhile to learn about the caves' religious iconography and history.The caves themselves take little time to explore; however, while on Elephanta, it is also possible to follow a path to three villages -- Shentbandar, Morabandar, and Rajbandar -- around the outskirts of the island. I initially intended to visit myself, but ultimately hired a local man I met along the way as a guide. The villages are largely untouched by the nearby tourists (though many of the residents work at the caves or the nearby container port), so a visit provides an interesting case study in the tensions between industrial development and traditional livelihoods. Well worth a visit for those keen to escape the tourists and learn a bit about the people on whom the operation of the attraction relies."
Elephanta_Caves,Sharad J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,journey to history,Caves are very neatly maintained. Lots of history lies in there. though i'm not a enthusiast of history but i liked they way these are preserved. The journey to the caves is even better. You cross the sea to reach the island by a mid size boat from gateway of India. For some time you forget you are in mumbai. overall it is a nice half day to one day picnic for family.
Elephanta_Caves,CharlesMcCall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Unbelievable! Indiana Jones meets Abu Simbel! This is a fantastic place to visit,"This was one of the top destinations of our trip to Mumbai - it was fantastic! It's a great way to spend most of the day. I would suggest getting a guide - they aren't expensive and they help you understand what you are looking at. plenty of shops and places for local food, but the caves are the main destination. Highly recommended!"

Elephanta_Caves,Mihir K Tiwari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Friends,Visit,If any person want to go there they have to first visit to Gateway of India after that you have to take boat for going there price is 250rs  you have to return before evening 
Elephanta_Caves,Debapratim Chattopadhyay,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Couples,Majestic,"An unique world heritage site, magnificent and beautiful. The caves are well maintained, toilet and resting areas are there, many eateries including MTDC hotel are there. The 1st cave is majestic, the rock cut statues and reliefs are beautiful. Also the 1.5 hour boat ride to the island is relaxing and enjoyable. Two things only which we observed could be improved, 1st - there was no numbering or way board for the caves, we have missed the Buddhist caves (cave 6 & 7) for that. Another is there were numerous shops lined the climbway upto the hill top, and those completely blocked the view if the hill and sea.A must visit while in Mumbai."

Elephanta_Caves,Sandy_JSR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020,Interesting Ancient History,"We visited the Elephanta Caves in Mar'20. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The caves nicely depict the Indian culture and ancient architectural techniques, though mostly depleted. It is around one-hour boat ride from Mumbai dock / Gateway of India to the Island. The return fare of boat ride is Rs. 205 per head. The boat ride was a refreshing experience with cool breeze and watching seagulls flying pretty close or quietly floating on the water. Once reached the Island, there is an option of toy train @ 10 per head or walk to reach the main attractions, there is a fee of Rs. 5 per head to enter the site.  There is around 120 steep steps leading to the cave, several small stalls selling different souvenir items and  tiny restaurants are lined-up on both side of the stairs.  The climb may be tedious however, if require, one can take rest in between to regain the breathing. The entry fee in the caves temple is Rs. 40 per head. The cave temples are associated with some interesting ancient history and to know the same, hiring a local guide @ Rs. 500 is recommended. The Elephanta Caves contain rock cut stone sculptures of Lord Shiva and Hindu mythology, however most of the artwork is defaced and damaged by the Portuguese soldiers. Presently,  it is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India to prevent further damage to the caves. Beware of monkeys and avoid carrying food stuff to avert encounter with them. A visit is recommended."
Elephanta_Caves,Rani75,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020,Elephant Caves,Old Heritage Place.  One of the most interesting place in Mumbai.It's a must visit for tourist.The caves are located in the Ocean.
Elephanta_Caves,Anjali kumari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,UNESCO world heritage,A different type of place to visit in mumbai.Awesome view on boat.You can easily take a ferry from gateway of india.
Elephanta_Caves,Deepak Mallyk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A good place to kill a day,"If you have a day to kill and you are new to Mumbai. You could probably plan a visit to Elephanta caves. This place is on an island, it can be only visited by boats operated from 'Gateway of India'. It means, in a visit to Elephanta caves you can cover Gateway of India, The Taj Mahal Hotel, and many places nearby. You can find a lot of foreigners visiting the caves. There are plenty of shops selling souvenirs, foods, and other refreshments on the way to the caves after reaching the island.Stone carvings, the entire architecture is interesting too.Preferred season and timing: The trip is going to be sultry in summers. I wouldn't recommend the peak summer months. Plan in the morning and it is not recommended to visit if you are starting from 'Gateway of India' around 4 pm, the caves could get closed by the time you travel on a boat and climb up to the caves.Though I wanted to give a 5 star, I reduced one star because of the dirty water during the boat journey."

The walk uphill throgh the path lined with stalls selling all sorts is hard work but good. The sculptures in the caves are very interesting and there are lots of monkes to watch running around.

Elephanta_Caves,Swagata D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,UNESCO site that needs care,"This is a really nice attraction, that is overrun with tourists and is on the verge of decay. Worth a half-day trip. The ferry ride is lovely and that alone makes it worthwhile. Take your time and see all the caves and the magnificent sculptures. Dont bother with a tour guide and dont buy anything from those fake souvenir shops. Take the toy train ride as well. Wear comfortable shoes as its quite a walk to the caves. Respect the caves and you will not be disspointed."

Elephanta_Caves,Cedric N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,A UNESCO World Heritage Site,"Had been to this ancient rock cut caves near Mumbai a long back ago. It is located at Elephanta Island. These caves are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is famous for the rock cut sculpture of the Trimurti. There are 5 rock cut caves on the western hill that are visited by tourists. There are 2 rock cut caves on the eastern hill that are unexplored by tourists. One can get views of the surrounding area and the other side of the Island. Beware of monkeys that roam around in the vicinity. One can trek up the hill for 15 mins to get a good view and see only 2 large British era cannons. Earlier, the entrance fees were Rs. 10 per Indian and Rs. 300 per foreigner. But now, it is Rs. 40 per Indian and Rs. 600 per foreigner. There are restaurants nearby. There are small shops lined on the steps. One can walk or ride on a toy train to reach the foothill. It takes an hour to reach the island by ferry from the Gateway of India.These caves are an ideal place for families as well as history lovers. It is a must visit and should not be missed."
Elephanta_Caves,heathk7,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Very cool place,Nice place for the afternoon - very nice ot walk around once you get there as you pass HUNDREDS of market stalls on the walk up to the caves.  Many stairs (shallow) but no accessible entrance that I could see.  The boat ride over is a trip.  Dozens of seagulls swarming the boats as the tourists feed them.  Interesting but terrifying!
Elephanta_Caves,MWandAW,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva,"My wife and I visited the Elephanta Caves as part of a guided tour of Mumbai. Not limestone caves, but a stone construction that was dug out and sculptured from the top down. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. That is amazing work and is truly mind blowing to think that the artisans did that. The caves were named Elefante by the colonial Portuguese, when they found elephant statues on it. According to Archaeological Survey of India and UNESCO, the site was settled in ancient times and the cave temples were built between 5th and 6th century. Knowing that, it is worth the 1 hour boat ride each way, the 10 minute mini-train journey and the 15 minute walk up the 120 steps to the cave entrance. Our Chartered Boat was the first to arrive at the island that the morning. Arriving first meant that all of the stalls on the steps weren't set up yet and we were the first people into the caves. Our guide spoke quite loudly and I was able to hear what she was saying as I ran around and snapped my pictures without anyone in them. We had a good hour before anyone else arrived. We are glad we went and it showed us a different aspect of Hindu history of the area. We think that the visit was entirely worth the cost, the energy and the time to get there."
Elephanta_Caves,Jayan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Must visit but if healthy.,"You can reach Elephanta cave by boat from Gate way of India. You have to take ticket to board the boat from Gate way of India. Both tourism dept boat and private operated boat are available. But I think the cheap rated Govt boat service are not functioning properly to boost so called ,'luxury boat'. Nothing luxury in it. You have to pay extra (now Rs.20) to sit on the deck. Deck may be or may not be covered. Nothing worthy in sitting in hot sun or in rain there. The seats may be dirty due birds  excreta. Boat will take minimum one hour to reach the island. If weather is bad, some people's may feel little sick while oscillating in waves. Better avoid heavy spicy food. At Island first you have to take a ticket to enter the village. Then another ticket to enter the cave. Both are very cheap. The cave on a hill top. A toy train available. But, it will took you to hill bottom only and children only can enjoy the drive. It is better to walk. Less than hundred steps is to be covered to reach the top. It is a group of ancient caves. Almost all are perished. But even now you can feel the greatness.  Due to limit of time we could not visit the other side of hill.  About two hours required to round all the places.  Some snack bar a small hotel available there. A toilet block also available."

Elephanta_Caves,gfsc5,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Rock carvings ,"These UNESCO listed caves are located on Elephanta Island, about and hour by small boat from near the Gateway of India.  There are a number of caves but most of the carvings are in one of the caves.  It's actually quite an open space and not like going down into a cave with stalactites and the like.The carvings have had some damage over the years but are impressive in size and detail.  Most are dedicated to the god Shiva.  We had a guide with us who helped bring the carvings to life with her detailed stories.As mentioned, the boat trip takes about an hour.  Then you can walk to the start of some steps or take a small train which is fun.  Then you're faced with a climb of some 120 or so steps but with lots of non-step areas also on the way.  Our tour group had a woman with bad knees and she made it.  There is an option to be taken up by chair but I’m not sure how safe that would be.  And there are lots of stalls on the way selling all sorts of stuff for tourists.Worth a visit but perhaps not everyone's cup of tea.  Amazing to think about the skills required to carve into solid rock, though."
Elephanta_Caves,Fraser66,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,UNESCO world heritage site,Elephanta caves need to be reached by a ferry from near India Gateway to the Island of Elephanta.Please note it is across a busy shipping port and has lots of large ships. You do not have life jackets so bear that in mind if not a good swimmer.Once you get to the island you can either walk or jump on the baby train to get to the base of the steps. The steps are steep in places so take water if its warm.Once you get in the caves its essential to have a guide as the statues will mean nothing without the history of Shiva and his wife and other gods.It's amazing to think these were all carved and dug out of the caves by hand many many years previously. Some of the statues were damaged by Portuguese but others are still in very good condition.

Elephanta_Caves,Libby in Cincinnati,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Worth a visit if you have time in Mumbai.,"This is a good trip for about 2 to 3 hours. You take a ferry from The Gate of India pier over to the island. You pay about $25 per person for the trip.The ride each way is an hour and costs 10 rupees per person each way. When you get to the island, don’t take the train. It doesn’t take you to the top of the hill as some websites suggest. You walk for about a mile and then pay to enter the park and then you pay 600 rupees per person to enter the UNESCO site. You walk up a long path with a number of stairs past vendors on either side of the walkway to get to the caves. It is covered, but be mindful of all the monkeys around.Some consider the 6th Century cave temple to be masterpieces of Indian sculpture. It was okay.The entire cave site can be seen in an hour. The first cave is the best. We enjoyed the ride over and the people watching as much as anything."

Elephanta_Caves,Sally Arora,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Friends,In the mood for adventure,This activity is for those who are bored and want to do something thrilling. Fare warning the caves can make you feel a little claustrophobic so make sure you pack enough water and take deep breaths. There are good option for eating out here. This is perfect to go with a large group. 
Elephanta_Caves,Sudip Basak,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Not worth it,"As it was holiday time, there was a big crowd. You have to stand in a long and meandering queue (like the body of a serpent), before you are allowed to board the boat. You won't find the start of the line, believe me. The best thing would be to just go into the line from the middle. And try to take place at the front, or else you will have to wait an hour or two before boarding the boat. Once you do get in the boat , you have a nice and peaceful  and serene boat ride for an hour. You can watch seagulls flying pretty close to you or quietly floating on the water. After that, you come to your actual destination. However, the climb is sheer vertical. It is very cramped and the possibility of a fall (from the stairs) is very real. It is very exhaustive also. After reaching the top, you don’t feel it is worth it to  come all this way to see some broken sculptures made out of the mountains. Simply not worth it."
Elephanta_Caves,Schanbis,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,An Island with Heritage,"These caves are situated in the Arabian Sea. You have to take a boat from the India Gate area to go to this Island. The boats are moderately safe, but one must be careful. They are open from all sides and you may get drenched while in the wavy water. Landing from the boat on the Island is not very safe. The caves on the Island are a must-see. Many episodes of Lord Shiva are sculpted in these caves."

Elephanta_Caves,Zippy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A few tips,"I read the review before going and would like to reinforce a few things. We went with a guide and I would recommend that. We went over on the boat which takes one hour fifteen. it’s very slow. if you have the funds, go on a speed boat! our guide queued for the tickets and helped us miss the queue a bit, saved us wandering about! We were on one of the first boats in the morning and you really don’t want to go in crowds or heat. When we got over there it was hot and muggy. We are both fit and walk a lot but it is a drag up to the site. It’s was only Feb and we had a good sweat on despite using the little train for the first part. Again our guide knew exactly where to stand to jump right on! The walk up is under a cover with market stalls either side. In March or after I imagine it would be boiling and crowded. It isn’t suitable if you struggle to walk as the path is also worn and slippy. Some crazy chaps will take you up and down on a sedan chair for about twenty quid! the little stalls are really good value compared to some places so bring a bag and get your nick nacks! the caves themselves are quite a site, big and open so don’t worry about claustrophobia. there is one main one and a couple others. We stayed about an hour as our guide told us all about it and we felt that was plenty."
Elephanta_Caves,Leonid,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Travel,"This is must to visit place. Round trip ferry 205 per person. Entrance fee 1600 and it all worth it. No need to pay a guide 4000, read online, and just walk this place is amazing and clean. Bring cash for shopping and pay only 1/3 of asking price.But if you come on the 9:00 am ferry, I highly recommend it, you can bargain price to the 1/4 of asking price."
Elephanta_Caves,atul_garg1408,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Review to help visitors to this important tourist spot,"First things first, excellent place to visit during day time. Caves are maintained clean, clean washrooms also are available.Approaching Elephanta from Gateway was cheap and convenient also. No bargaining fixed prices and help to guide new comers was available.But worrisome was the safety of tourists in the boats. I could see life jackets and a couple of inadequately sized and wrongly placed life boats were there. But no body is informed of any emergency procedures or any emergency phone numbers. The capacity of each boat was also not to be seen qnd no body was monitoring.The path from deboarding point upto cqves need mqssive cleaning and maintenance effort. It is all very beautiful with mangroves but dirty with lot of scrap in water.Overall a nice experience but can be improved further. "
Elephanta_Caves,Matheu M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,"Great site, not a great ride there and back.","  Caves ( cave 1 complex ) is awsome. WayToo many shops and vendors on the way up and down! The ride is about a hour each way in Mumbai harbour. Way too long, dirty water, trash, rusty old ships for an hour. There were dolphins on the way, I felt sorry for them swimming in all that S**t. If the air was clear and you could see something that would help, Great Site, takes a lot of time and patince."
Elephanta_Caves,Ellen P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Impressive caves,"Went here with a tour on my short trip to Mumbai. Once arrived at the island's jetty, we took the slow toy train to the location. Near the bottom of the steps there were decent restroom provided. I was told that such facility is not provided up in the caved area. We took 120 steps, which surprisingly did not made us very tired. The caves are impressive, though sadly most of the statues are not in good condition. Our guide explained a lot to us about the caves history & helped us get good photo angles, which I did not think of before. Truly enjoyed my trip here."
Elephanta_Caves,T Jacobs UK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Superb self exploration,"My wife and I visited the Elephanta caves self guided, the boat was 150Rs each for a return (benched ferry) or 205Rs (plastic seats). The transit takes approx 1hr, on departure and arrival you can get the best photos of the gateway and Taj hotel. There is a 'lazy train' which will transport you from the pier to the bottom of the hill for 10Rs (we did not take it). The assent up the hill is all under tarpulling and lined with souvenir stalls. You are required to pay a small tax on entry to the island of 10Rs each followed by 600Rs per adult for entry to the caves (40Rs for Indians). The main cave was amazing and we spent 90% of our time there, we were approached by a number of guides, we personally did not think one was needed. A great day out, we took approx 4.5hrs from departure to return. Watch out for scammers - we were approached at the port by a 'helpful gentleman' who informed us that because the cave did not have electricity that we should wait a few hours to go to the island and in the meantime give him $70 for a two hour tour of the city :-)"

Elephanta_Caves,arundev100,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Rock sculpture on a grand scale. ,The boat ride of one hour is very calm and peaceful event. The toy train ride to the steps is quite novel. The climb to the caves has been made quite comfortable for “ people of all ages”. Wish they could censure the vendors lined along the climb. The caves are magnificent. Cave 1 is the main one to see. The carvings on a grand scale with attention to minute detail is mind boggling.  Worth the travel from Mumbai to check out.

Elephanta_Caves,Shekhar Srivastava,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Buddhist Site,"Elephanta is about one hour from Gateway of India by motor launch. Sea gulls accompany you on the way. Once you reach there you can take a short distance train ride to the base. Then the trek starts. Five caves are ready there to enchant you. The size of the first cave gigantic. How people would have made it! After finishing the cave temples, the Cannon Hill beckons you. The gigantic cannons there are to be seen to be believed. So huge with 360 degrees rotation to ward off the enemy. Really a sight. It’s a memorable experience with sea gulls again escorting you back to the Gateway of India."
Elephanta_Caves,MoominJ,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Best part is the boat trip out and back,"Sadley I really wouldn't bother visiting this attraction. If you are going go on the first or second boat of the day as it getts a bit manic later. Elephanta is poorly kept, having said that probably if you are Hindu it would have more appeal. Some of the carvings are good but have been damaged through the ages some sevearly. You have a steep walk up to the caves entrance which may be an issue for some people although there are sedan chairs for those that can't manage the climb. Beware of the theiving Macaque monkeys they are a bit of a nuisence. The steps have stalls on both sides selling all sorts of souveniers.The boat ride out and back gives you a good view of Mumbai and the Gateway to India monument."
Elephanta_Caves,Rajesh S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Our Visit to Elephanta Caves,"We took a taxi from out Hotel and were dropped near to the ticketing office. Make sure you take your tickets from the office (accredited by gov of India). You also need to buy tickets for the boat trip. The boat trip to the island is 1hr one way, so it is good to go early to beat the crowd.There s some pushing to get in the boat, so be careful. There is a Rs10/pp extra fee for going on the deck. You can see birds flying next the boat which is very nice. Keep in mind that there are around 120 steps to get on top and backOnce on the island you can either take the Toy Train (again be careful of pushing) or you can walk to the spot. Once there you have to get your ticket (Rs600 for tourists). The caves are impressive with carvings in the stone. You can take pictures and appreciate the view as well. You can meet some monkeys there looking for food and water."

(From island 6.30 pm is the last ferry)From the boat landing stage on the island, a walkway leads to steps that go up to the famous caves.When you reach the jetty there is a toy train( 20 rupees return ticket).Again mismanaged!But you can walk the 600 mts distance , followed by climbing steps.Beware of lots of monkeys.( totally 20 minutes till cave number 1)The entry fee is 20 rupees pp and 640 pp for foreigners.Closed on Mondays.Elephanta Caves, that have been carved( 5th to 7 th century,Hindu plus Buddha caves), out of rock are the main tourist attraction.The most important is cave number 1 .The carvings narrate Hindu mythologies, with the large monolithic 20 feet  Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of dance) and Yogishvara (Lord of Yoga) being the most celebrated.( few say its Brahma,Vishnu and Mahesh),the Shivlingas,Ganesha  all are damaged by Portuguese ( and it pains to see the destruction)There are water tanks in the caves.Caves 2,3,4 are also similar with stupas and stone rooms.Cave 5 is in broken,delapilated condition and is closed for entry.But one can visualize a big shivlinga and the place gets filled by water in the  monsoon period.There are two caves in the nearby hill but are not open for public( the watchman said few ancient coins were recovered from there)There are plenty of eating joints serving veg and non veg food especially Bangada fry etc.Along the path, hawkers sell souvenirs like necklaces, anklets, showpieces and keychains.But real fun is eating Karmala( star fruit),which is a yellow,local fruit with sweet and soar taste and appers star shaped on transverse section.Also the rawmango( कैरी), cucumber, chanyamanyas,fruit plates,limboo sharabat and buttermilk all tempt you while climbing!There are a total of three villages: Shentbandar, Morabandar, and Rajbandar, of which Rajbandar is the capital. Caves and stalls can be seen in Shentbandar. Morabandar has a thick forest. Staying overnight is not permitted for tourists.You enjoy this half day picnic,feel proud about our navy and when we start approching the Mumbai skyline ,with Tajmahal hotel and Gateway if India ,we feel proud and love this beautiful metrocity!@Dr.Vijay Athalye 2020."
Elephanta_Caves,Dierdre R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Must see in Mumbai,Magnificent World heritage Site.  Inexpensive ferry ride from the Gateway of India Pier.  Lovely 50 minute ride each way.  Take the miniature rail cars to the base of the hill.  Lots of stairs but plenty of shops on the way up..  Places to get a cold drink and cool off under ceiling fans along the way up as well.  The stone carvings are monumental and awe inspiring.  Keep water bottles out of sight of the monkeys because they are very bold and will grab them from you in an instant. Can be a little frightening when you aren't expecting it.  Take your time because of the heat and humidity.  Plan on at least 4-5 hours to see it comfortaby including the ferry ride.
Elephanta_Caves,Aigoual,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Stunning World Heritage site," I caught the ferry to Elephanta Island (or Gharapuri) for R1.50 return – about a 1-hour journey, with great views looking back at the Gateway of India, though passing a huge complex of oil rigs/platforms and military vessels. It was an extremely hot day, and a long walk to the village where one commenced the very long climb up steps to the Elephanta Caves, negotiating market stalls on either side (some with attractive goods, others with tat), which there was little time to stop and admire.  There was an alternative in the shape of a little tourist train, but I preferred the exercise, and felt smug to have arrived at the village before the train did!The island is a World Heritage Site, built on to hills, and consists of 7 caves, carved out of the rock, dating from the 3rd Century BC. The carvings are Brahmanical and mainly devoted to the worship of the Hindu god, Lord Shiva. The stonework in the smaller caves is sadly quite damaged, but is amazingly well-preserved in the huge main cave, portraying Shiva (the destroyer of evil) Parvati (his wife), Ganesha (their elephant-god son), and Vishnu (the preserver god) among others. The boat trip back as the Gateway gradually comes into view, is most enjoyable."
Elephanta_Caves,Sara O,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,127 steps a few too many for me,"After our ferry ride to the island, and a walk in morning heat to the steps to the caves, I only managed about a third of the steps upward.  Fortunately there is a brisk business in carrying tourists like me up in chairs carried by four very strong men.  The caves were cool and carvings of Shiva (although largely defaced by the Portuguese) fascinating.  But so was the ride!"
Elephanta_Caves,Sangeetha Vikram,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Beautiful rock cut and Architecture,"On 29th Apr'19, myself with my hubby got to visit Elephanta caves. We have taken a ferry from Gateway of India to Elephanta caves. Elephanta caves is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a specimen of rock-cut art and architecture from the times of medieval India. We have got to view the beautiful sculptures and have taken more pictures of it.  The caves are located on the Elephanta or Gharapuri island which is situated at a distance of 11 km from the city of Mumbai. Natively known as Gharapurichi Leni, the Elephanta Caves that exist today are ruins of what were once elaborately painted artworks. It also provides an amazing view of the Mumbai skyline. This collection of cave temples dates back to 5th to 7th centuries and most of them are dedicated to Lord Shiva.After viewing all the places, got to have food at a restaurant inside. Food was of so poor quality and prices were also too high. It's better to avoid having food there.A well spent day at Elephanta caves !!"

Elephanta_Caves,Sharron S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,An unexpected beauty!,"The Elephanta Caves were an unexpected delight with incredibly large carvings of Hindu gods. We didn't have a guide or book, so if you would like to know the details I suggest hiring a guide or buying the book, there are however some plaques with some details at the major cave sites. Approximately 6-7 caves, although the first few were the highlights. The boat ride was slow, ours was approx 1 1/2 hrs each way, luck of the draw if you get on a faster boat. There is a 'toy train' you can purchase tickets for when you arrive for a short distance which only takes you to the bottom of the large amount of stairs that are required to reach the top of the mountain and the entry to the caves. Market stalls are set up both sides of the stairs touting for business which makes the climb and decent narrow with crowds in abundance. We went in the middle of the day in January and it was very warm, I suggest first thing to beat some of the crowds and before the heat rises. Overall a wonderful unexpected delight!"
Elephanta_Caves,Yolanda,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Too expensive ,"As a foreigner tourist I had to pay 600 INR (Indians and SAARC countries pay just 40 INR) what I think it's too much. First because I think it's totally discriminatory and second because of the 5 caves you see the first one is the only one worthy of visiting as the other 4 don't have any carvings nor decoration, nothing... They are plain walls. Beside the island sadly is full of plastic bottles. If you go for a walk to the canyons you will see bottles everywhere. Positive is the ride to get to Elephanta, the boat trip is great as you can see closer the petrol platforms and so on, also you get very good views of Mumbai and the skyscrapers. "

Recommend buying the inexpensive guide book.Ferry trip over was fine, takes an hour each way but it was nice.  Steps up to caves are a bit daunting, but you can take your time and shop at the innumerable stands on the stairs.  Worst case, they have people who will carry you up in a chair !It doesn’t take long to see the caves, but count on about 4 hours for the excursion.The monkeys and cows every where are really fun."
Elephanta_Caves,Catherine L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Interesting caves but damage and rubbish a big turn off,"The caves themselves are quite interesting with engraved pillars, shrines and large sculptures of Shiva, based on Hindu mythology.  Disappointingly, the sculptures are quite badly damaged and the elephant statue (for which the caves were named) is not located here, it is at The Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum.Getting to the caves requires a 1 hour ferry ride to Elephanta Island, then a walk or toy train ride (the train was disgustingly filthy and bumpy) to the base of the ""hill"" containing the caves.  Our guide quite proudly told us to look at the beautiful mangroves beside the pier but you couldn't see them for the rubbish - so sad.There are quite a number of steps to climb to get to the caves and was a bit of a workout, but not so easy for older and frailer tourists."
Elephanta_Caves,shan,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,0 maintenance & local natives ruined the world heritage,"I had an overtly high expectation from an UNESCO world heritage site, but i am ashamed to admit that the locals from that area have turned it into a cheap business unit and a garbage dump . you don't wanna peak outside the set path that leads to the caves or you will be surprised to see the amount of waste they dump there. The caves are still standing cause of Rock solid ancient architecture but the modern day pathetic maintenance will lead it to its ruins soon. There is 0 maintenance involved and the guards have turned into guides with little to no knowledge about the caves or that area. i wish they stopped the tourists from eating spitting and having a free run at a 2000 yr old historic site. caves are no doubt beautiful and have the architecture to give you goosebumps whilst thinking bout the amount of unprecedented hard work and perplexing technology our ancestors might have put in to build the caves. hope the local government will at-least electrify and maintain the site in near future to save it for coming generations ."
Elephanta_Caves,pranzalagarwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Beautiful caves!,"Located about an hour's ferry ride from the iconic gateway of India, these r a cluster of 7 caves supposedly built in the 6-7th century.

Elephanta_Caves,srinivast5,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Must visit place,Located in the Arabian sea a small island which is an one hour ferry ride from Gate way of India.  It's a pleasant ride as seagulls follow you for the food.  We can take close-up pics and videos of them.  The ferry fellow charges extra Rs.20 for upper deck sitting.  From the arrival point at island there is a small train which take you to the near by starting point of the steps to the caves.  The train charge is Rs.10 for 2 way ride.  Or else you can walk for half a km.  From the stairs both sides shopping is a relief for the climbers but beware they charge exorbitant prices as they charge to the foreign tourists.  The caves entry fee is nominal for Indians.  We hired a guide for Rs.250 which I feel is reasonable and must to know the facts of the cave temple.  The main Temple cave complex is very important and rest of the other caves which are small can be skipped.  From out side the caves there a way to the uphill where you can see the Cannon.  We skipped it.  Near the alighting point of the train there are many snacks are available but be careful about the hygienic.  The returning ferry would wait till its get filled we have waited nearly half an hour for this. Overall for ferry it's 1 hour for 1 way.  1 to 2 hours for caves.  Waiting for ferry half an hour.  So be ready for 4 to 5 hours for this trip.
Elephanta_Caves,Sam W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Half a day,Beautiful. Especially if you like ruins and monkeys! Tickets for foreigners cost 600rps. You only need half a day there. Take your own snacks as food on the island can be a bit pricey.

Elephanta_Caves,Jola F,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Day trip to Elephanta Caves,We took a boat ride from The Gateway of India to the Elephanta Caves. The boat ride cost 205 rupees per person return & the journey took just over an hour to get there. The journey back was about 45 minutes. When we arrived we chose to walk all the way but there is a little train which takes you closer to the steps. The steps up to the caves are steep and lined with stalls selling souvenirs. We didn't feel hassled at all. To enter the island we had to pay 15 rupees each then to enter the caves we as foreigners had to pay 600 rupees each. The first cave was the most interesting & best preserved. There are lots of monkeys running around & can get very close to you. We saw a monkey snatch a ladies scarf.  There are places to buy food & drinks. Four hours including the boat ride is enough time.
Elephanta_Caves,srjtmadhavan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,A world Heritage Monument,Do keep time from your schedule to visit the Elaphanta caves. This is a world Heritage Monument under Archialogical Survey of India. There are 7 caves in total 5 on the Western side and 2 on the Eastern Hillock . But you can only view 5 caves on the Western side.you need atleast 4 hrs for the entire visit as the journey through sea will take atleast an hour each.

Elephanta_Caves,Payal G,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Avoid on holidays,"Mismanaged is the first word that comes to mind followed closely by sad. Recent years have seen lot of administrative focus on maintaining and presenting our heritage. However, found this absolutely missing on revisiting Elephanta after more than a decade.First and the most important advice is to avoid going there on any public holidays. The steps leading to the caves have absolutely been covered up in tarpaulin sheets and shops line both the sides - resulting in a severely cramped space where people joustle for taking a step. It is creating a situation for a stampede. The lack of air is worse in the holiday crowd given Mumbai's muggy weather.There are 2 separate charges one for entering the island and the other for the caves - one wonders why they can't be collected at the same time instead of lining up twice. The toy train is a sham in such crowds. It is faster to walk up rather than pushing in the scramble to get on like on a fast local train.After all this trouble once one makes it to the main caves more disappointment awaits. For a UNESCO heritage site from which the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation derives it's logo there is absolutely no information provided about the caves and the features one must look for. Probably for the benefit of the sham guides pestering people to take their services. The caves are poorly maintained with the overpowering stink of bat droppings. There is no lighting inside. Nor is any information on the sculptures available.With a return journey of atleast 3 hours on the ferry and another 2 on the island, one must keep atleast 5 hours in hand when planning a trip.      Contrary to many reviews there are lot of eateries around the steps with proper food and water available. The souvenirs are very pricey and cheaper in Mumbai."
Elephanta_Caves,hifunday,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Easy day trip,Very convenient and inexpensive. And the sculptures are truly amazing. Boat ride to Elephanta Island from Gateway of India is comfortable. Takes around 40 minutes each way. Note that the small train between the jetty and the base of the steps to the caves is a bit of a scramble- particularly if it’s a holiday when you can expect greater crowds. My advice is just wait your turn and smile until you get to board it. Else if you are comfortable with walking - it’s not too long a distance. Remember though that once you get to the base of the caves there are still another 120 steps to go up the hill to reach the caves. And you need to plan for the journey back as well. At the base of the Island and on the steps to the caves there are lots of opportunities to shop and dine. Restrooms available only at the top and bottom of the 120 steps. Have fun!
Elephanta_Caves,keith morgan,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,Elephant Caves,The boats leave Gateway of india to the island every 15 mins and cost us 210 rupees return it takes about 45 mins to get there and is very enjoyable passing numerous tankers cruise ships etc. When you arrive at the island its about a 30 min walk to the entrance to the caves. and its up a lot of steps but you can take a breather on the way up and look at the many souvineer stalls all the way up. If you are not good with steps there is a Sudan type chair with two men who will carry you up not sre of the price though!The entrance fees are 10 rupees for the government plus 40 rupees for indian nationals and a whopping 600 rupees for foreigners ! The visit was ok all over in 30 mins . The monkeys were good fun to watch stealing peoples food and drink .One of those you need to see but feel wasnt value for money !
Elephanta_Caves,mbalajicool,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,The Impressive Elephanta Caves,The boat ride was filled with fun and frolic with the sea gulls flying in close proximity of the boat with people feeding them from the boat. The boat ride takes around 45 minutes from gate way of india. The rides start at 9.00 am and end at 5.00 pm.the boat ride costs Rs.205/- the entry tax is Rs.5/- & the entry ticket for the caves is Rs.40/- for indians and Rs.400/- for foreigners.The monument has been declared a heritige site and is maintained by the ASI.The place is maintained spic & span and there are guards to help you with anything you may need.  the washrooms are neat and well maintained.there are ample hotels to have food and they are reasonably priced also.you can shop for a lot of memorabilia and at good prices.  you can do a hard bargain to get good rates.All is all a moneys worth.  You can spend 6 hours in the whole trip.
Elephanta_Caves,Deepak S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,A world heritage site to visit near Mumbai ,"An hour long ferry ride from the Gateway of India will take joy to this island that hosts the UNESCO world heritage site. Its 7 th century set of temple mainly of lord Shiva. The temple were carved out of the mountain and host some lovely sculpture work ; though a lot of these carvings have deteriorated over the centuries. The main carving of trimurty (three idols) of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh is a well known Hinduism and cultural icon. After landing at the ferry site, a gentle climb with paved steps takes you up to the heritage shore. Totally 7 caves, our of which only 4 are accessible; others have become destabilised and are closed to visitors. Gives in idea about the well developed engineering skills of the time. The path leading up to the cave site is lined up with souvenir shops and food stalls, and is a bit narrow. Probably may benefit from some improvement like widening and landscaping and move the shops a bit away. Any one who is not used to lots of people around may feel a bit claustrophobic. But absolutely worth a visit.Another thing I noted : the ferry ride though very enjoyable could be more comfortable as it looked to be in need of maintenance. Broken seats, no safety drill or life jackets. It's almost 11 km long journey in the ocean and some attention to safety may help ; but this is something that is unfortunately typical of the subcontinent. But for foreigners, a unique experience and the site is a great opportunity to sample one of the oldest civilisation in the history of mankind. "
Elephanta_Caves,PRADIP DAS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Elephanta Caves ," Logo of MTDC (Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation) shows a 20 ft high monolith of the three-headed Trimurti Sadashiva representing the three aspects of Shiva: the right half-face signifying life and creativity; the left half-face, its obverse — the deity as a destructive force that can reduce the world to ashes; and the central face shows Shiva deep in meditation, as the protector of humanity. This awe-inspiring piece of carving, hewn out of rocks similar to Ellora in the same Maharastra  State, is the focal point of the Elephanta Caves, a small island about 10 km from Apollo Bunder, Mumbai. Both the Gateway of India and the Elephanta Caves are huge tourist attractions, and every year thousands of people from India and abroad visit the caves, whose carvings, dated mostly between the late 5th and late 8th centuries, narrate Hindu mythologies and depict various magnificent figures of Wedding of  Shiva with Parvati. Elephanta Caves can be reached by an hour-long enjoyable boat ride in the Arabian Sea from Gate-way-of-India. Originally known as Gharapuri, the island was renamed by Portuguese invaders after a giant stone sculpture of an Elephant, which was removed from the island and now stands outside the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum.The Elephanta Caves in their entirety, and the forested areas around them, were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site  in 1987. A must visit Tourist Destination in Mumbai. "
Elephanta_Caves,Ketaki K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Couples,Good caves but poor transportation and information,"The caves themselves do not take more than an hour to see, unless you visit the caves 6 and 7. The information provided about the things to do/see/expect at the caves is not consistent and not enough. I would recommend buying an information book for Rs.150 or get a guide at the cave directly, which offer way less rate than if you book one at the bottom/ferry terminal. The ferry service itself sucks. It takes easily from 1 hr 15 mins to 1 hr 30 mins to get there. So expect to spend 4 to 5 hours if you are visiting only the caves 1 to 4, and more hours if you are planning to visit caves 6 and 7. The ferries are not maintained well, and different ferries may charge different rates depending on the deck you choose to be on. So beaware of the fake rates and get it confirmed before you hop on a ferry from gateway of India."
Elephanta_Caves,Vessense.Elizabeth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,I guess the best tourist attraction in Mumbai,"I love history and anything historical.And Elephanta Caves helped me quench my thirst during my stay in Mumbai. And what's even better - they are far from hustle bustle of the main city. You need to take a boat to reach there, which adds on to the fun as you are getting to enjoy Arabian Sea too :) . You can plan your day so that you start in the morning, spend some time there and are back by the evening.Overall, you can't afford to miss this place if you are visiting Bombay (Mumbai)."
Elephanta_Caves,sullyns,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,"Great Value, Good Afternoon","Do not buy a tour!! Purchase a boat ticket behind the Gate to India for 205 rupees and pay an extra 10 rupees on the boat to sit on the top deck. The market stretches all the way up the hill, it is very enjoyable to look, barter and buy. We ate at a restaurant at the top of the hill on the left before entering the park, the food was excellent and also great value with the best view of any restaurant we saw. Locals pay 40 rupees but foreigners pay 600 this is still good value you only need 4 hours including the boat ride each way."
Elephanta_Caves,Sweetbunnycute,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Worth paying a visit,"The caves are a beautiful art piece. Although it takes a little effort to go on an Elephanta caves tour one needs to spare one whole day bit according to me it is worth all the efforts. In order to visit the caves you need to go to the gateway of india, Mumbai. Buy a ferry ticket to Elephanta caves(available till 11 am only) and then the ferry takes about 50 minutes to take you to the island. There again you can either walk or take a short toy train ride till the caves. The same way one takes the route back to the gateway. The interesting thing is that one can collect souvenirs like fridge magnets or key chains or elephanta t-shirts from the market. Since there are steep steps hence i wouldn’t recommend aged people or people with problems in climbing stairs to visit here. The caves are no doubt huge and beautiful. They maie you wonder how they would have been carved. But some are damaged pieces so again you think of the story behind such destruction too. All in all it is a once in a lifetime experience where you go and explore the city for a whole day experience. Also recommended for one day picnic or a daytime tour."
Elephanta_Caves,mukesh p,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Amazing visit,"Takes about 15-30 mins from boarding to caves if you are with family. There are wide steps to climb 120 , so people with back pain or disability needs to take care. Once I reached it was mesmerising noticing the art form our ancestors had carved on rocks...the finishes and dedication is just amazing. Don't just click pics ...take some time to absorb the effort they would have taken to carve out such place. Note: no need to take the toy train ..walk is just 8-10 mins and can be taken. There are shops on the way on steps and have good collections ..do take a look..."
Elephanta_Caves,Saddam Khan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Must visit for its Archeological love,It should be on your list when u visit Mumbai and love for Archeological exploration. You can get a boat from Gateway of India starts at 9am till 3pm and it takes 1 hr. Recommend to take early boat. There is a small 1km toy train for kids that takes u to start of hill. Lots of restaurants available. Chair facility available for senior citizens at Rs 2000 to carry you on top hill and bck.
Elephanta_Caves,shishir,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Unsafe ,"The ferries are unsafe, they don't even offer life jackets. I don't think they count people before taking. The walk from drop point to caves was long. There is a toy train , but the tickets were finished. My mother had to walk. It was hell crowded due to Christmas. There is palki available but after 1 km of walk. Pretty dirty and not worth going with kids and senior citizens. "
Elephanta_Caves,Esbe2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Know before you go,"1. There are two rates for the ferries, there are two ticket prices, 150 & 205. The latter will get you into a slightly less crowded ferry ONLY on the way to the island. For the return journey, this will not happen. So think before you choose to pay more for one-way comfort.2. Getting ferries is easy. There's one leaving the Gateway every 10 minutes. 3. The ferries are properly operated, and you get to see much of the harbour. Plus snacks, soft drinks, and beverages, are sold on board the ferries. 4. There's a very mini mini-train (fairground variety), with return tickets priced at Rs.10 per person, which takes you about maybe 400 metres. It might be better to walk that distance rather than fight with holidaymakers for a seat on the train. It's a pleasant walk, too. 5. The stone steps that take you up to the top of the steep hill, need a degree of fitness. So be prepared. Those unable to tackle this can hire dandis, chairs supported by bamboo poles, carries by four men. These men, though they look old and fragile themselves, are possibly stronger and fitter than many gym rats. 6. The caves are worthwhile, and amply repay the climb. The site is well maintained. Security guards also keep monkeys away with slingshots. Besides, there are guides, and there are amazing views all around, too. 7. Temporary curio shops line the stairway up the hill, and there are restaurants interspersed, which seem clean and friendly. 8. There's a tourism department restaurant right at the top of the hill, next the caves' gate, which offers a good choice. 9. The return is easy, and in little more than half an hour you can be back at the jetty. There you take the launch that's ready to leave, and in an hour you're back at the Gateway. Take care!"
Elephanta_Caves,Jayanthkumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,"""Nice place to visit after nice boat ride""","Nice place to visit. One of the must visit place in mumbai. You can come to this place from Gateway of India with paying 200 rupee return fare. One hour journey from Gateway. It was really nice experience. I enjoyed alot with feeding kurkure, potato chips to sea birds. They follow the boat and we can give them from our hand. I prefer upper side of boat. You can get upper seat with paying 10 rupee to boat person. After reaching to island by boat there is a small toy train. You can get that ticket for 10 rupee. That distance if you like you can go even on foot.Then you have to climb some steps till the caves. Then you can find elephanta caves. Entrance fee is 40 rupee for indians and 600 for foreigners. Washroom facilities are there. And foods and cool drinks also available but little high cost.There is one another hill nearby named cannon hill. Other than cannon gun there is not anything to see. Inside caves there are someu guides. And security people do not let for video. But you can capture photos."
Elephanta_Caves,PuneTravelbud,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Historical carvings,"Its unique to find sculptures & carvings in such caves on island. In India / Maharashtra, we mostly find such carvings / sculptures in caves on main land hills. Journey to this Gharapuri island starts from Gate way of India and takes about an hour. Avoid rush on Sunday and public holidays. Journey ticket is Rs. 205/- and take Rs. 10 extra for upper deck where sea view is nice. You can find birds flying above and ships sailing in sea. Toy train available from jetty to main island (around 500 meters distance) at Rs. 10/- Then you have to climb stairs which takes around 15-20 minutes. Doli service available for senior citizens with charges. Main cave is having lot of Shiva sculptures explaining various events in his life. Main sculpture is called Sadashiv murti (logo on MTDC website). Also few more caves are there which has less / no sculptures. Small lake is nearby to walk and enjoy nature. Canons are situated uphill which takes almost half an hour to reach (avoid if no practice as steps are uneven & broken). Many restaurants and eateries are available for food and beverages."
Elephanta_Caves,Namit J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Very well kept,"The entire Island is superbly maintained. The stairs, the shops on the way, although too much, but still very clean.The caves are also clean and maintained. Only one thing missing is the information for tourists. Some boards showing history and details should have been there. Also, guided audio tours can be arranged, so that no more PPL be created by crook guides.Rest all good. "
Elephanta_Caves,Kiwi on Tour,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Highlight of India,"Loved this place. Try and get a tour guide who lives on the Island, not one of the ones who arrives there daily by boat. Loved the stories behind the caves."
Elephanta_Caves,Niro K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Nice getaway from Mumbai,"Distant c. 1 h from the Gateway of India by ferry, the island is definitely worth a visit if you’re in town. Ferries run every 20 to 30 minutes. You can by the ticket for 205 rupees - both ways - at the entrance of Gateway of India. The deck is located immediately behind the monument - I found no indication of deck #4, as informed at the ticket counter where to take the boat. Once in the island you can take the minitrain or walk about 1 km to the first booth to collect local tax. After that there is an uphill walk among vendors until you reach the entrance and by your ticket - 600 rupees for foreigners. The largest and most important cave is #1. It has a small entrance but is almost 40 m deep with columns and wall carvings. Most of details have been eroded by time and looting but the remains are still impressive. The other caves are smaller and there was not much to see except for the space itself. There was no written historical information on display, so it is worth to read about it beforehand or bring some print information unless you want to pay someone who presents himself as a local guide. I spend two hours appreciating the caves and it was enough. Besides that, there was only an old cannon that did not interested me at all. This is not an activity that an handicapped person can do by him/herself - in addition to the minitrain, there are some people who can take you through the stairs by means of a पालकी - some kind of litter. Still, this primarily a walking tour. Last but not least, beware of the monkeys - one of them tried to steal my drink! If you’re not planning to visit Karla and Bhaja caves in Lenavala, Elephanta caves are the way to go."
Elephanta_Caves,Sandy S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Exquisitely detailed carvings well-preserved,"Our brightly painted two-decker tour boat left from the dock behind the Gateway to India and took us across the bay, past a large LNG litering station and on to the hilly green island that housed the Elephanta cave temples, which dated to the 7th Century of the Common Era. To spare my arthritic left knee, which seemed to be protesting the recent flights from the States, I hired a sedan chair, hoisted by four local men, to take me up the steep stone steps, which climbed past a gauntlet of souvenir vendors. I felt like a queen.	Dedicated to Shiva in his three roles – the Creator, the Preserver and the destroyer – the caves were so massive that they swallowed sound. Only by standing within ten feet of the guide for the site could we understand his explanations. As we discovered throughout the tour, local guides tend to be long on detail, explaining both the mythological significance of the carvings and the techniques used by the carvers. The first order of business had been chopping out and hauling away tons and tons of raw rock leaving rough pillars and niches for the artisans to go to work. Our guide explained that the teams of workmen probably possessed several levels of expertise, with the final, master carvers capable of extraordinary detail  We noticed that the breasts of Shiva’s consort and the other women depicted were invariably high and round and, in proportion to their slim waists, large.	On the launch back to Mumbai, several vendors accompanied us, hawking necklaces fashioned from carnelian, lapis, tiger’s eye and other semi-precious stones. The prices eventually agreed upon after bargaining seemed reasonable, and we were literally a captive audience."

It is a normal system for change from small boat to big boat while returning from Elephanta cave.NB: For to & fro journey, I will recommend readers to use big boat ferry with double deck system & sit on top deck to enjoy with Seagulls from very near.Even though boats do sell chips & wafers packet of Rs.10 for feeding to Seagulls, I will recommend the readers to buy groundnuts & similar such grain packets for Seagulls. Throw chips, wafer, groundnuts in air & Seagulls will catch it in their beak. You will be amazed to see their perfect catching ability. If it falls in water, they will pick it immediately. If you are holding it in your hand for Seagulls to come & eat then it is a lengthy process that requires a bit patience as Seagulls takes lot of time to come near you & eat it. 3)	Helpful Information From Elephanta Cave Jetty Onwards:a)	Elephanta Cave Jetty To Toy Train Start Station Ticket Shop:It is 50 meter walk.
