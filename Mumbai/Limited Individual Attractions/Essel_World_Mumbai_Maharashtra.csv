Essel_World,Chalo Travellers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021 • Family,India's largest amusement theme park.,"Esselworld is India's largest amusement theme park.It is the best place to visit for one day picnic with kids in Mumbai.we enjoy almost all the rides in it.firstly,we ride Bay watch tower, it's an amazing ride."
Essel_World,VINITA DUGAD,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,SHALL BE VISITED.,"Essel World is one of the oldest Amusement parks in India, I have know. Along with Appu Ghar and Fantasy Land, but this one survived.I have visited Essel World more than 10 times, and it never gets old. The rides are average but yes, they have added a few more rides as the competition has increased.This is good chillout amusement park, not so thrilling but mid-thrill rides and nicely maintained place.Location : MumbaiTicket : 900 Rs.How to reach : BY car, bus or Ferry."
Essel_World,Roxanna M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2020,My wonderful experience as mentioned above.,"On January 14, 2020  my family and I visited the famed Essel World Bird Park in Mumbai, India.  I am from Canada and had been in India for about 2 months by then. The journey by rickshaw/ ferry/rickshaw to the park was a new experience for me and adventurous.  We arrived in  the afternoon and had a bit of a snack at the cafeteria, we started out on our tour of the park, following all the rules so that we do not harm our environment and for the safety of the birds and ourselves.  It was so clean and in fact there were some workers, scrubbing away in an empty pond which was impressive too, that great care and attention is paid to the minutest detail.Was wonderful to see all the variety of birds from all over the world and was fun trying to look for the hidden birds in the trees and bushes. The best experience of course was the feeding of the birds and for some reason they would land on top of our heads before flying down to the tray of seeds we were holding.   The smaller birds were in cages but large enough for them to still enjoy their freedom.   There were many unique birds and some were very colorful and we learnt a lot about the care and traits of the rare ones.We also enjoyed the parrot show in the small arena but afterwards was more fun watching the white cockatiels with their yellow plumes and how they could fan them open.At the end also got to browse through the information boards in the entrance way and all the while trying to identify the different chirping of the birds as they started settling down in their favourite places for the late evening/night to follow.All in all a very well maintained park with great loving attention to each species of which there were countless and caring staff on a rotation basis.Would recommend every resident and visitor of/to Mumbai to go there to have a wonderful fun time and admire the variety.I encourage all my friends in India and here in Canada as well to not miss the opportunity to visit this beautiful park where you can also gain so much knowledge."

Essel_World,samjo2486,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,great place to enjoy,"Though this place is a little far from mumbai city, it is a great place to enjoy time with friends and family. The rides available suit children of all ages. adults will also have a great time here. this park has rollercoasters to simple rides. this park is great as there is not much waiting time here for rides unlike in other places.

Essel_World,Angela G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Family,Son's birthday,"The quickest route is by ferry which takes you across the lake to a short walk for the entrance to both the theme park and water park.We went to the theme park for the rides.All the rides are open and the queues are non existant though you will be asked to leave the ride and go round to the entrance again of you want more than one ride.If you like spinning rides a lot then this is the place for you!If you like water rides, prepare to get drenched!Fun day out with the children of all ages "
Essel_World,Cedric N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,India's largest Amusement Theme Park,"Had been to this amusement park in Gorai a long back ago. This amusement park is located close to Water Kingdom.This amusement is visited by locals as well as non locals. It is suitable for all ages. This amusement park has roller coasters, vertical drop, mirror maze, bumper car ride, ice skating, hedge maze etc. It also has an interactive bird park which is a new attraction. Bollywood movies and serials were shot here. It often gets crowded during the weekends. Events too are being organized here. There are small eating joints,  restaurants etc. Had enjoyed roaming around the entire park and going on the thrilling rides as a school going child.This amusement park is an ideal place for families, couples, children as well as friends."
Essel_World,YPS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,World of adventurous rides,"We can enjoy many adventurous rides at Essel World with family and children's. There are 11 adventurous rides, 15 rides suitable for children and 14 rides opt for families. "
Essel_World,seeker_here,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,One of the first amusement parks,Essel World was one of the first amusement parks in India built in the nineties. It still retains its old charm for kids.
Essel_World,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Bird Park at Essel World,"Bird Park is a brand new addition to the popular Essel World in Gorai and we had visited the same during our Christmas holidays. Tickets are priced at 400 rupees per person and 200 rupees for senior citizens for the Bird Park only. The concept is similar to the parks in Bangkok and Singapore. This place has a very good collection of wide variety of birds from all over the world but the place is not very big. There are some big ducks, swans and parrots which are not caged and freely roamed around with the visitors. We saw colorful love birds, different types of colorful parrots, macaws, peasants and even giant ostrich. There is a nice souvenir shop at the exit. "
Essel_World,deepikarocks22,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Best theme park in india,"It's one of the best theme park available in Mumbai & also in India..Must visit for anyone who is visiting Mumbai..It as so many rides, even if u we're 1st to enter all the rides, still difficult to complete in a day..For different age groups rides are there.. so everyone can enjoy the rides..Suggestions to enjoy the full theme park -1. Take the map with you & cover slides..2. Try to avoid heavy food, it may make u dizzy if rides are complex, best to go for liquids..3. Try to reach when it opens so that can enjoy every thing, wait till last announcement of closing..Don't go to water park on same day, not at all possible to cover both in single day..Lockers available..If u have time go to theme park & water park on separate days..Also check the resorts..A good family holiday for sure.."
Essel_World,RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Revisited with grown up kids after ages!!!,"We had visited this place for the first time in 1996 and this time another family with teenager kid joined us and had good time. However, too many people during day time results in long queues.  We were disheartened to find the rides getting closed by 7.30pm.  Getting back to ferry for Gorai Creek was too tough for me, they do not show any concern for senior citizens of persons with special needs. "
Essel_World,Ramesh Pagadala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Business,Best ammusement Park,"The best ammusement park, they have fully utilised each and every area and also they are having 03 gates whichever and nearest guest area they can come and avail the tickets. "

Essel_World,baleron,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,An all times classic water sports venue in Mumbai.,"Do not expect western standards, the place is a bit outdated and simplistic in terms of design, but it is definitely an interesting place to visit if you are not staying too far away.  It is quite a trip to get there and if you pick the wrong time maybe hectic, but overall a worthy daily excursion if you can spare a day for relaxation out of the city. I struggled between average and very good.  It is definitely good, bordering very good, not average. But not VERY good. One of the main reasons is the poor food and drink options. Otherwise it is definitely nice and relaxing. Best spots imo, the relaxing pools, and the disco. Very unique and fun. "
Essel_World,Rama,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Sweet memories,"Other amusement parks might come up but Essel World will always stand out for it's nostalgic memories, the rustic beauty & above all the friendly staff. Do not get bored coming to this place with family as it has rides for all age group & also depending on how adventurous you want to be to keep yourself engaged & happy. The topping is the enthusiasm level of the staff who add the wow factor which is definitely a USP of this place which i have not found in other amusement parks & to display their commitment it was pouring but they were still on the job which encouraged us to try the rides even in the rains & must say it was a different experience so next time it rains don't stand in the shade but hop on to the ride for a different experience .They have seating, water, wash rooms, eating joints across the park. Additionally they have paid attractions which are very reasonable priced which is encouraging. Last but not the least hats off to the unsung hero's the ferry staff who even during this testing conditions kept their cool & pulled off a coup which was really impressive. Overall it lives up to it's theme song Esselworld mein rahoonga mein ghar nahin jaoonga mein..... looking forward to visit again."
Essel_World,Krishna Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,greta places for fun for children,I like been there with my family...a full day fun is available in this location...many many amazing rides and food stalls...great service and great fun-loving environment to have stress out fun after a hefty work.

Essel_World,Wandering Soul,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,So So Experience,"AAAAHHHHHH what can I say about Essel World been there many times, but now it's not so interesting anymore only 2 new rides have been added since my last visit in 2014. As I have mentioned in my Imagica review Theme parks here in India become a boring place to visit after 2 or 3 visits. please Essel World people make it a desirable place again bring new rides plan new things to make us visit you more.

Also there are recharge stations located wherein the basic card can be recharged to any denomination.the silver ticket is advisable to be taken if someone is going to sit in most of the rides.If planning to sit in aqua dive..one is bound to get wet. carry extra clothing accordingly.

Essel_World,Nilesh G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Family,Long weekend to start with Essel World (first visit),"With two families, four kids and an infant with a holiday on  Friday and long weekend to start we were all set for our first Essel world trip. They have arranged for buses from the car parking area to the main entrance (ticket booking area). These buses do a pickup from car parking to entrance and also a drop from entrance to car parking. Ticket counter was less crowded and we managed to get in quickly. The Essel world entrance and Water-Kingdom entrance is next to each other. Also is the Bird park which is inside Essel World. The place is clean with ample of shadow due to good amount of trees. Though summer season in month of April we did not feel the heat as much as it was outside. There are places where they have setup places for refilling water bottles. We saw two food courts which were pretty big. It was a good experience and until the day ended except the kids most of us were tired.May be next time we might try the bird park and/or Water Kingdom. "

Essel_World,Mayank R,,,,"Essel world lies off the coast of Mumbai on a small island and was a bit painful to get too. The rides were good, though a bit outdated and I have had better experience at Imagica. Still, for people within Mumbai, this can be a decent amusement park experience - at least better than most in India."

,,,,,"Went with family to essel world on Holi, as had expected less crowd & it went as planned, the crowd was much less in the park & maximum people were going to the Water Park, Earlier we used to visit essel world every year, but this time we visited after many years, & yes it has not changed much, everything is similar, had lots of fun, the children enjoyed a lot of dashing car & other swings. Everything is good even the food inside is not over priced like few other amusement parks, even the souvenir shops are normal priced, thats the good part, the staff inside is also very supportive.Will love to visit again."

,,,,,Only amusement park in the suburbs of Mumbai and the closest to the southern part of mumbai. In order to visit this place one has to take a bus from bhayander station or the alternative way is to take a bus from borivili to gorai and then ferry are available from gorai jetty

Essel_World,Pratik1310,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Has lost its charm,As kids we used to visit essel world every year for picnic but now it has lost its old charm.  Imagica is much better.  The rides are more or less same.  Its easily accessible via borivali ferry.  Rates are cheaper than imagica. One can spend a whole day only in dashing car..  My favorite ride..

Essel_World,Nikunj S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Old but still the gold...,"Essel World is an amusement park located on an island close to Mumbai. There are many rides for adults and children - roller coasters, ferry wheel, etc. Also many eateries inside the park. We'd to hop on to a ferry to reach Essel World, which is quite an experience in itself. There is also a Water Park next to this, and if you go in morning, you can visit both in the same day. Also the grand pagoda on the island is a nice place to go to."

,,,,,"Recently i have visited Essel World with Friends. Even though the park is famous since the ages, being in Mumbai since last five years i haven't visited it before. I still remember TV add ""Essel world me rahunga me, Ghar nahi jaunga me :P :P"". You can reach EsselWorld easily from Borivali railway station. From borivali railway station you can take shared auto to Gorai creek which will cost you around 20 per seat. Then from Gorai creek you have to take ferry services to cross the creek. It will cost you around 50rs for return ride. Ferry will drop you at the gate of Water kingdom.Now Come on to the attraction, if you enjoy adventurous rides then ""Thunder"", ""Top Spin"" and especially the ""Enterprise"" rides are there for you. The whole will rotate once you out from enterprise. Certainly not the ride after food. Even Thunder will also make you scared. It will hold you upside down for certain amount time. Certainly not a ride for light heated person.Shoot-N-Drop, Hoola - Loop and Zyclone are also good. Recently they have added Ride with VR named ""Tunnel Twister"". The ride will take you in the world of Virtual Reality.There are certain paid activities which you can enjoy also like Ice Skating, Laser tag, 7D shows and many more. Food outlets are fantastic.  Even with lots of amount ride EsselWorld lack in terms of shows which you can find in Imagica. So overall of you enjoy adventures rides then visit EsselWorld and if you enjoy shows more then visit Imagica."
