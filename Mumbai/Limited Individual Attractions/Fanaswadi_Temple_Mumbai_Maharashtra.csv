Fanaswadi_Temple,Sunil V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,The oldest temple of Lord Balaji ( Tirupati Balaji) in Mumbai,"One should visit this temple in Fanaswadi near Kalbadevi/ Bhuleshwar in Girgaon Mumbai.

Fanaswadi_Temple,Somaseshu Gutala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017,"About Venkateshwara Devasthanam, Fanaswadi, Mumbai","This is one of the most beautiful temples I have seen in Mumbai. The Dravidian style of construction with traditional sculptures and idols reminds us the grandeur of South Indian temples. Many people call this temple as “Small Tirupati” of Mumbai. Here the temple rituals and ceremonies are performed just like in Tirupati .   This temple was constructed in 1927 and was inaugurated by His Holiness Sri Sri Anantacharya of Kanchi Mutt on 10th June, 1927. Some of the idols in this temple were brought from Udaya Rajendrapuram at Vaniyambadi of Vellore District, Tamilnadu. These idols belonged to Chola Period of 1080—1130 A.D. The temple has a very massive Raja Gopuram with various sculptures of gods and goddesses. The temple has two prakarams. On the walls of the corridor the slokas from Bhagavadgita are painted in colors. The twenty four forms of Lord Vishnu wielding weapons in different postures and positions are seen, a very rare feature of this temple. The 108 Vaishnavite Divya  Kshetras are also beautifully painted . The ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu are seen on the panels of the outer sanctum. In the Garbha Griha, the statue of Lord Venkateshwara looks like a replica of the Lord of Tirumala. There are shrines for Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy, Raja Gopala flanked by Rukmini and Satya Bhama and Lord Rama with Lakshmana and Sita. All poojas are done as per Vaishnavite customs and tradition. In the crowded area of Fanaswadi this temple gives a chance to experience a peaceful and pious feeling  for people. The temple timings are from 5.40 a.m to 11.30 a.m and from 4.00p.m. to 9.30 p.m  (Monday to Thursday) and from 5.00 a.m. to 12.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. One can catch Bus No.103 from Chatrapati Shivaji terminus and reach the temple within 15 minutes. The nearest railway station is Charni Road Railway Station."

Fanaswadi_Temple,Chukki27,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Friends,Ventkateshwar temple in the heart of Mumbai,"Gorgeous temple, feels divine & holy on entering, a must for Lord Balaji devotees and for those who are unable to visit Tirupati. On a Sunday morning be there at 7.25am to attend nice aarti which lasts 20 minutes. Access is bit difficult as location is very deep in the narrow Kalbadevi alley, take a taxi from Charni Rd station the best way to get there.Footwear can be kept in the shoe closet on the right side, recommended as branded ones can get stolen ! My cousin's Reebok slip ons were stolen:(After temple visit enjoy authentic Maharashtrian breakfast / fast food at a nearby restaurant:)"
