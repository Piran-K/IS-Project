Ferry_to_Alibaug,PalakM1794,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,"Skoda M2M Roro boat is the best option, 2nd Best is Maldar Catamaran","We booked M2M Skoda Roro boat, superb experience. It has an AC lounge but even  in March it was better to sit outside as the wind was very cool and the AC lounge was very crowded with not a single seat to sit. Note - It leaves EXACLTY on time, so reach ~15-20mins before departure. At the boarding there is an AC waiting lounge with seats, better to reach early. It leaves from Bhaucha Dhaka Waterfront, ensure you reach the right place. There is about 200m walk while boarding but its a longer walk when de-boarding. Best way to go is take a car and drive right inside. Super comfortable to drive in and drive out. Only issue was to sit anywhere you have to climb a few steps. People who couldnt climb, i saw them being carried on a chair. Ensure you book it onlineLoved the experienceNow Maldar Catamaran - again superb experience, they ensure everyone gets a seat, which is not true for Ro-ro who overbook the seats. Catamaran also has an AC seating area. Only issue is they are not punctualAll ferrys leave you at Mandwa jetty where you have to walk ~400-500m to reach car parking"
Ferry_to_Alibaug,Maneka,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2022 • Couples,Staff is aggressive and untrained !!,"Boarding was smooth and professionally handled. The staff on board however is untrained andRude.. the staff was unpleasant not just with us but also mocked, grunted and misbehaved with our pet also which is absolutely unacceptable social behaviour.They will also fight you tooth and nail in the most aggressive manner possible ( think of the worst possible street fight scenario ) and if you are seen doing something that is not in their rule book..it is a reason good enough for them to pick a fight with you. They choose not to keep it civil, customer service and Decency is clearly not a priority as they have a monopoly contract.They look for opportunities to fine you ( they celebrate it ) and makeThe extra dime which is mostly going intoThe staff s personal pockets hence the aggression. P.S. there is no signage ( no smoking for eg ) ofTheir rules so If you do light up unknowingly, they will let you do so instead of warning you of the rules. click photos  of you without  your consent and start a fight. Well!!Also the staff themselves don’t followBasic rules like wearing masks.When pointed out to the supervisor he seemed unaffected because staff clearly can get away withAbsolutely anything here it’s the customers that need to stressDate of boarding - Mumbai  to Alibaug 27th Jan 2022"
Ferry_to_Alibaug,Girish D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2021 • Couples,M2M is good but on board catering sucks!,We were on board on 3rd March. Professionally run service on ground. Very efficient upto boarding and unboarding. But that's it. Onboard staff is untrained. WiFi issues for card payment especially once ferry sets sail. Double debit issues on card payments. No Gpay option! They don't refund either. Moral: buy n pay for whatever you wish BEFORE ferry sets sail. Never after that.Enjoy you time.
Ferry_to_Alibaug,sudip51,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Short Ride from Mumbai to Mandwa and back,"It was very nice. Booking can be done online and onsite. One can book for persons as well as vehicles. Vehicles can drive into the M2M ferry. one can remain inside ones car or move out to the open decks. Snacks are available in enclosed airconditioned sitting area. Around two or three trips per day and per one way. Little more on Papu Mashi The Nomad , title, ""Birds & Breeze off the Coast of Mumbai."

Ferry_to_Alibaug,JKD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Family,Best Dec 31st day trip ,"It was a lovely decision to take a day trip to Alibaug on Dec 31st. We drove to the Gateway of India, and parked at the MCGM Pay &Park behind the Taj. We walked to book tickets on the PNP ferry that left Colaba at 10.15 but would have been late to catch it so booked the10.45 Maldar one. Anthony at the PNP desk was extremely helpful in suggesting what we should book. He also suggested we book return tickets for 5.45 that would allow us to prepone our journey on the 3.15 ferry from Mandwa jetty. We had a lovely ride on the upper deck of the Maldar catamaran thats a 400+ seater. The ride took approximately an hour. Unfortunately the wada pav on deck was cold and we were quite disappointed. The coffee was okay though after we asked for them to make it stronger. The boat staff pointed out dolphins to us so we caught a glimpse of the lovely, lucky mammal! The seagulls flying along side the ferry made for an ABSOLUTELY beautiful experience!The ride back was even more comfortable especially, since we were full after lunch. We napped in the cool AC seats and reached the Gateway in about an hour. All on all, a smooth, very enjoyable day trip from Gateways to Alibaug! "
Ferry_to_Alibaug,mumbaindicator.com,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Unforgettable Experience,"A good way if you want to reach Alibaug without hassle and on-time, This ferry ride was very comfortable, clean, and spacious too, and as well as along the way it gave a beautiful view of the place. It was very convenient and same time saves some money and energy. The journey was just an hour but we had an amazing hour on this journey."
Ferry_to_Alibaug,mustpppp,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Better than road. Grimy.,First getting on and off at the Gateway of India end is an uncomfortable acrobatic experience jumping on and off in between heaving vessels to get to your ride.The air conditioning is underpowered.  Perhaps for saving money or that the equipment is not powerful enough.  Probably both.  I was wondering if it would be better to have no air conditioning at all.Would I do it again?  Most likely as the alternative of driving from the other end of Mumbai is a nightmare.
Ferry_to_Alibaug,cool_satchmo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,PNP service is very good & reasonably priced,"Visited Alibaug on a day trip recently and took the PNP ferry from Gateway to Mandwa and back. The ferry to Mandwa in the mid-morning was on time and it was quite packed being a Saturday. The return ferry in the evening was a few minutes late. The seating is comfortable and the cabin is airconditioned. There are speedboats that do the same trip but they are much more expensive and just a few minutes faster, We preferred to travel in a larger boat and in airconditioned comfort"
Ferry_to_Alibaug,vaibhavaero,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Much better way to travel than roads,"I went to Alibaug in December 2019. While going I took a normal ferry and while returning I took an air conditioned Catamaran. Normal ferry takes around 1 hr 30 mins to Mandwa jetty and is decently comfortable. They charge you Rs. 130 for single side. The Seagulls keep you entertained throughout your journey. The ride is not at all bumpy. Catamarans take around 40 mins and are a lot more comfortable. They charge you Rs. 190 for one side. It was perfect to take an air-conditioned ride after 2 tiring days in Alibaug. Whichever ferry you take, it is much better than travelling by road. It takes lesser time and is much more comfortable,. Roads from Mumbai to Alibaug are in a very bad state."
Ferry_to_Alibaug,kemchho,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Pleasant Trip to and from Gateway of India,Lovely view and a wonderful breeze to/from Gateway of India to Ali Baug. What more can I say? Plenty of Vegetarian Restaurants .. It's heavenly if you like Fish!
Ferry_to_Alibaug,Kishor Pansare,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Awesome Experience with Apollo and PNP,Nice experience with Apollo for onward journey and PNP for return journey.We reached Gate Way at 7.15am on friday for 8.30 PNP but its was sold out so thay advice us to travel by Apollo to save the time and Apollo 7.45am catamaran was good in condition and was not so crowded due to weekday. You can buy ticket at entry point or on the ferry itself. We started our journey at sharp 7.45 and reached Mandwa around 8.40am. In return we reached Mandwa around 10.45am for 11am PNP.PNP experience was good but AC was too chilled and with limited view.  Apollo Fare - INR 170 - Upper DeckPNP - INR 190 - AC Lower Deck.Note - You can easily purchase ticket on board only and if you really want to enjoy the sea then please avoid Sat and Sun.
Ferry_to_Alibaug,molak49,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Time saving but crowded,Ferry to Alibaug have started after the monsoon season which was prolonged this time. The ferry is run by two three operators. Apollo runs basic ferry used by locals and daily travellers. Pnp runs a more decent and Full ac ferry. Tickets can be bought at counter outside gateway of India security check and directly while boarding ferry. Lot of ferries and frequency is good but at peak times and on weekends and public holidays it can be nightmare as the area is not shaded so you have to stand in sun which can be a tough time for kids and no proper queue system for different operators and no proper landing and berthing quays also. For aged people and young children it can be dangerous. It's run totally by private operators and no police or coastguard involved which may seem a bit scary. There are ample of life jackets and staff on each ferry is well trained. The mandwa Jetty experience is better as it's covered and has free golf cart service for the long walk to the terminal. There is a second option of speed boat travel which takes only 20 minutes ( half of ferry time ) but it's totally unorganised and no tickets issued. It's rates also change and can be expended in peak season (7-9k for whole boat which can be shared) though return fare from mandwa to Mumbai can be a deal breaker as the speedboat goes empty. But these boats don't have enough life jackets and they tend to be greedy to overload which can be risky. 
Ferry_to_Alibaug,nilimag2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Lovely experience,"Went by ferry to alibaug. Was told ticket for AC section will be given on d ferry itself. The upper section has 2 areas...ac & non AC. It was fun to feed d birds from d ferry.While coming back,we bought tickets of PNP...it was a faster ride..the boat was kind of closed & made me a little dizzy. Would prefer the other boats anyday. It's was a difference of 20 minsbof ride .. immaterial for us."

Ferry_to_Alibaug,sunil_dhing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Ferry trip to Alibaug is very good,I would suggest if you are traveliing to Alibaug by ferry usr PNP or Maldar AC ferries. You will feel like travelling in aeroplane.
Ferry_to_Alibaug,Sneha S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,good ride worth the money and time,"well managed rides. cost effective and also time saver.few vendors available.Takes approx 45 min boarding from gateway and mandwa .I have taken the AC ferry, though there are non AC ones also available. can check the website for the timings of ferries on either end.You can buy tickets in advance or if lucky can get before the ferry leaves. if not much traffic you could purchase on the ferry itself. but if you are a big group makes snese to purchase in advance.No reservation of seats. its a first cum first serve seating.while on the journey you can also go to the upper deck - non AC section.The sea and the sea gulls are worth watching. A photographers delight.the mandwa entry - "" port"" is a very user friendly place.few shops where you can purchase some snacks. there are also few restaurants in this vicinity.Outside there is a bus stand (tickets for which are included in your ferry cost) which takes u to the city centre. Alternatively you could use the auto rickshaws from here to take you directly to your destination in Alibaug."
Ferry_to_Alibaug,ketan1709,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Reach the Mumbai backyard by the sea...,"Ferry services are from Gateway of India to Mandwa beach and is a scenic travel full of surprises..Seagulls, anchored speed boats and huge ships and ship moving for 45-60 minutes add different dimensions to the journey. It has 3 types of boats, a speed boat which can take you to other side on 15 minutes b Catamarans with AC and Non AC sections and travel time of 45-55 minutes and 3 ferryboats also called as launches which takes 60-80 minutes with all coming with different price tags.

It is closed during monsoon ie 25th May to end of August. Ferry services provide complimentary bus service till Alibag from Mandwa which is 20 kms away. "

Ferry_to_Alibaug,Nikhil P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Saves time as compared to roads.,"Alibaug is a nice weekend getaway from Mumbai. One can enjoy the cool sea breeze and watch seagulls flying while on board the ferry  . Most of the boats are just ok though some provide amenities like A/C hall, toilets as well. However,  it’s a short trip to Mandwa jetty so I feel some trade off can be done for the comfort."

Our ferry from mumbai to Alibaug was ok, boat got stuck in the mud before Alibaug which wasted our 30 min. However, worst was while returning, we reached for ferry at 3.30 pm only to find out no ferry are coming from Mumbai due to low tide, no official or proper information provided. Me and my wife to travel on activa from Alibaug to mumbai (158 km) "

Ferry_to_Alibaug,RVN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Faster and Fantastic view,"We (family with 2 kids) took ferry (A/C by Maldar) while going to Alibaug. We booked the return tickets after getting down at Mandwa jetty. But one need not book return tickets at Mandwa jetty since while doing this, the bus service to Alibaug will leave. One can book the return ticket at Alibaug. The ferry and bus service are punctual. The return A/C ticket, we came by PNP; I felt Maldar's A/C is better than PNP. Fantastic view if you leave in the morning 8:30 trip from Gateway of India, toilet facilities are there. Walking from Mandwa jetty to the point where buses are waiting might be tiresome for old people. Take with you water , snacks and refreshments since the service providers charge more. Sea gulls view while travelling is great. Ferry travel time is exactly 1 hour. In the bus service from Mandwa to Alibaug, if one wants to get down at Khim beach, they can get down."
Ferry_to_Alibaug,Gautam Pendharkar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Great way to travel to Alibaug,"The ferry's are operated by locals and a great way to connect to the northern parts of Konkan like Alibaug, Kashid, Mandwa which are coastal areas with lot of beaches and resorts for weekend picnics. Though all the ferries are not so maintained, some of them are air conditioned which are relief during summers. "
Ferry_to_Alibaug,Anandkhanvilkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,Mumbai to Mandawa hooo la la lla...,This was first time I was travelling to Alibaugh through this mode. So far my travel to Alibagh was by road but this route saves a lot of time of journey and takes you to ride on cleaner sea which is a rare sight for Mumbaikars.

Ferry_to_Alibaug,Akshay P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Ferry to alibaugh in monsoon,If you want to visit alibaugh via ferry the the ferry operating from gateway of India are closed in monsoon.. So you can instead take a ferry from Ferry warf(Bhaucha Dhaka) to mora then take 5-10 mins take rickshaw to karanja(uran) from there u can another ferry to rewas and then reach alibaug via there.. The journey was quite pleasant even In monsoon as this is the only option currently via ferry to alibaugh and it is fun for family as it is unique way to reach alibaugh for a weekend get away instead of the conventional route by road.. 2 wheelers where not allowed in the one I went so if u plan on taking u would have to park at the ferry warf itself

Ferry_to_Alibaug,Rahul_Baba,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,Best way to reach Alibaug from Mumbai,"Ferry will drop you to Mandwa beach from where the service providers will arrange buses for Alibaug. The ferry takes on an average one hour and another 45 min through bus. Ferry is the best way to reach Alibaug in the non peak season. You will like the entire route, will love birds catching ferry for food and will also reach faster through it. The one big issue during the peak season or long holidays is that you have to wait as long as one hour or more just to catch bus from Mandwa beach to Alibaug as the service providers have limited buses. Other options like Auto and Taxi are available but they are pretty expensive during rush. "

Ferry_to_Alibaug,Teeej100,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Mandwa Jetty - Alibaug Ferry from Gateway of india,"The Air Conditioned catamaran is comfortable and much faster than the ferries. On the weekend it is sold out so an advance reservation is recommended. The return trip is harder to book, so make sure you can get that before you book the trip to Mandwa/Alibaug. The regular ferries will give you a crowded, bumpy and slow ride and I would only use it at a last resort.From Mandwa Jetty to Alibaug you have to take a bus ride, whose cost is part of the ferry ticket. Bumpy and dusty it is recommended you do NOT do this unless you have something particular planned in Alibaug. Just enjoy the views of the city from the sea, eat and drink at one of the restaurants at the jetty itself. Boardwalk by Flamboyante one of the more popular restaurants on the jetty will require an advance reservation."

Ferry_to_Alibaug,Prem Pandey,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,Value for Money - well organised,"Overall it's a great experience. Basis ferry schedule orgsniased by 3 operators i.e PNP, Maldar and Ajanta. I chose 9.30 AM Maldar ferry from Mandwa jetty for which they have connecting bus from Alibaug bus stand which left sharp at 8.30 (as I expected and and was told on phone from their contacts - which is good)Category ranges between lower deck, Upper deck and Upper deck AC costing 125, 150 and 165 respectively.Taking upper deck is good option for enjoying the breeze, Arabian sea beauty, birds and different small and big Ships, yatch, speed boat, marines, etc I didn't track but guess it took about an hour to reach gateway as it was a awesome experience travelling in ferry. Will certainly do more of it and soon.Keep track of schedule to save time.."
Ferry_to_Alibaug,vipultmi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Ferries are Fun and cheap,"If you are visiting Alibagh, travelling by ferry is highly recommended. You can easily make it a 1 day trip by starting early morning and returning back by evening. Its a ~1 hr. trip from gateway of India to Mandwa and then mandwa  to Alibagh by bus will take another 45 mins.There are diff operators like Pnp, Maldar, Ajanta...PNP gets occupied very quickly...but for Maldar operator which has bigger ferries, you can always expect seats...lower deck - 125/-, upper deck - 150/- and AC - 165/-.(above price include both ferry to Mandwa & bus to Alibag )There is no online reservation... you need to go there and book tickets...1 suggestion: you can directly stand in the queue to catch ferry, get seated and on the way go can get tickets.you can also go for private jetty's and speed boats which are obviously much expensive."

Going via sea is far better than going by road. The start from Gateway was cool. You can see the sea birds, cargo ships and offshore rigs which is one a lifetime experience. It was sunny day so we relaxed on a sea side resturent with an amzing view, crowd and awesome music...Took a speedboat on the way back, sea was very rough and that made our way back ride a rollercoster.It was hell a weekend..."

Ferry_to_Alibaug,Aartichand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,Nice ride,The ferry ride to Alibaug can take 20-25 mins on a speed boat which are private. However the ferry ride takes about 50 mins on the big one and an hour and a half on the smaller one.Its pleasant and relaxing and the ocean breeze is a good feel.Worth it.
Ferry_to_Alibaug,MotoMitch,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Bring your camera and bread for the gulls,"We took the slow boat from The Gateway of India, Colaba, to Mandwa Jetty then bus to Alibaug. Just a few hundred rupees each.It was a calm and sunny day. Perfect for a boat ride we shared with the locals.It took us just over an hour on the ferry and another 30 minutes by bus to Alibaug village.Enroute, one of the ferry passengers was feeding the gulls by hand.  Throwing the bits of bread into the air for the 50 or so gulls to snap up in mid air.  Quite a sight and cameras and videos captured it all.  I know, don't feed the seagulls...but....Once at Mandwa Jetty, your options are to have lunch at the wharf where there are half a dozen or more food stalls or fully licenced, white table cloth dining.We chose to take the Tata into Alibaug Village.  The ride is a thrill.  Think dodgem cars without the contact.Alibaug village is a small town but plenty of activity.  We chose to go further (15 minutes) out to Alibaug Beach.  Not really for swimming.  Food stalls and walking along the sands.We had lunch at the Radisson Blue Resort.  Great location and food.We decided on a private car back to Mandwa Jetty for the trip home which gave us a comfortable ride in airconditioning...we wimped out.A quick drink at the jetty and then back to The Gateway of India by ferry. it was an all day adventure with lots of colour."

Ferry_to_Alibaug,ketan1709,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Solo,Leisurely travel ....definitely need to be experienced,I am quite regular user of this route for travelling  to Alibag since it started around 1996. This journey has its own charm as it starts from Gateway a landmark of its  own and transports you to tranquility of Alibag. Positives: Multiple service providers are available through out the day . It has bus service connected a Mandwa jetty till Alibag. Journey is quick  and  less of hassles than by road. Nagatives: It is closed in monsoon. Late evening options are limited. In holiday season it does become chaotic as no of passengers become unmanageable. Bookings can not be made except for physical booking. But in spite of all odds it is indeed an experience especially in early morning. Travel  Options available are of both AC & Non AC  launch or catamarans & prices are reasonable considering bus service provided along with it.
Ferry_to_Alibaug,arnobi2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Friends,Best way to avoid Mumbai Road way and experience the water way,"The ferry mostly leaves from the Gateway of India. The frequency of these Ferry is pretty good. You will get one after every 30 minutes or so (Indian Time standards :P ) The last ferry that leaves from Gateway is somewhere around 5:30, so to avoid any last moment cancellation its better to take a ferry latest by 4 pm. It takes around 45 minutes to reach the other side of the shore. From there one can take a cab or a over-crowded bus to reach Alibaug. Though I would always suggest to shell a extra buck and take a taxi!"

Returned back in the next ferry, one hour each side. The captain of the ferry allowed me to sit in his cabin on the deck with nostalgic Indian songs blasting full volume. The breeze de-toxes."

Ferry_to_Alibaug,GauravChand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015,Best way to reach Alibag,Alibag is located approximately an hours boat ride from Apollo Bunder / Gateway of India.  It is known for being a weekend getaway from Mumbai and had a number of beaches.  Alibag is also accessible by road (but a long drive).  Most people prefer to take the ferry to Mandwa from where it takes about 20 mins to Alibag town.  The ferry takes about an hour and runs several times a day and is not very expensive.  There is also a catamaram service which also has an air conditioned section.  The rich and famous have their own speed boats which cuts down the journey time to about 30 minutes.It is a fun thing to take the ferry in the morning to Alibag and return in the evening after visiting a couple of beaches.
Ferry_to_Alibaug,Jaison J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015,Good!!!! Its worth an experience!!!!,"We took a ferry to Alibag. It was very good experience. Throughout the trip seagulls followed the ferry. If you could take some bun (pav) you could feed the seagulls. Its a nice experience to observe the way seagulls follow. Bike carrying ferries will be disembarged at Revas jetty. Its 10 kms from Alibag town. The trip will take around 2 hours time. We could carry bikes also. Four wheeler are not allowed. We need to reach Baucha Dhakka near dockyard if we are travelling with bikes. The bikes shall be registered in the register maintained by Police at the gate. They may even ask for RC book, Insurance, PUC etc. depending upon their mood."

Ferry_to_Alibaug,Alok K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Family,Nice 45 minutes in Arabian Sea,"A Ferry trip to Alibaug is available from Gateway of India, Mumbai. It is not just a good fun, saves precious time compared to the road journey to Alibaug from Mumbai. It is a 45 minute Journey on a catamaran from the Gateway to Mandwa jetty and then road to Alibaug. Several services are available to choose from and now a days AC catamarans are also available with few of the service providers. If in a group I feel the open one is more fun to enjoy a cleaner sea off shore. Be careful in choosing a service provider as all of them  have not kept their catamarans in same State of fitness & seaworthiness...!!!"
