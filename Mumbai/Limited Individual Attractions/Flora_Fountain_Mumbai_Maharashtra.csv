Flora_Fountain,Richard_in_England,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,Nice little monument.,"The Flora fountain was so named after Flora, The Roman Goddess of Flowers.  It stands right next to a very busy road junction offering a small oasis of calm.  The sun can make it difficult to take photographs. This one I had to take of the back as the sun was behind the monument.My Trip: If  you want a good photo visit very early in the morning or late afternoon when the sun is not behind the statue"

Flora_Fountain,Randolph M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,Cultural Landmark!,"Felt so good to visit Mumbai again and walk through the cultural center of the city. Flora Fountain is considered to be the cultural epicenter of the city with major landmarks and tourist attractions in close vicinity. Many of the walking tours include this attraction on the itinerary. ‘Hutatma Chowk’ and the ‘Eternal Flame’ are right next to this fountain. Would strongly recommend tourists to read about this attraction before paying a visit to relate better.There are several leading retail stores, restaurants, including a couple of Starbucks outlets in walking distance from this attraction."

It was not working on  the day we visited, despite that it was worth a visit.The fountain was surrounded on all sides by traffic.It is worth a look, does not take long as there is not a lot to see."
Flora_Fountain,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,Mumbai's iconic landmark,"It is one of the most famous spots in Mumbai. Many Bollywood movies have been shot here. The name Flora comes from Roman Goddess of Flowers whose beautiful sculpture is on the top. It was constructed by the Agri-Horticultural society of Western India in 1864 and designed by R. Norman Shaw. The square in which the fountain is located was named Martyr's Square or Hutatma Chowk in 1960, to honor the people who died during the struggle for separate state of Maharashtra. The whole area has many restaurants, cafes and book shops."

Flora_Fountain,Enthusiastraveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Solo,Fountain Chowk,"The fountain is situated at the chowk and is easily accessible.To have a full lovely view of it , you need to visit during evening time when the lights are on around the fountain. It is an exquisitely sculpted architectural fountain and is very old architecture. Its very near the CST railway station, around 10 mins walk through the bazaar."
Flora_Fountain,chow69,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,MODELLED ON FLORA - ROMAN GODDESS OF SPRING,"This beautiful piece of architecture is located in one of the busiest areas of Mumbai. Made of Portland stone, the statue was made in England and thereafter shipped to the then city of Bombay. On one side of the Flora Fountain is the Churchgate station while on the other is the erstwhile Victoria Terminus, now CST Station. Plenty of shops dot the streets all around where you would find a plethora of knick knacks, from pens to toys etc. The fountain needs a major makeover, was looking filthy the day we were there. I suppose it would be done shortly. The architecture is astounding and something to be admired."
