Gateway_of_India,adc189,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Iconic building next to the Taj Mahal Palace hotel,"Both the Gateway and the Taj Mahal Palace hotel (not that of  Akra) are iconic buildings, making the area interesting. From there,  you can take a boat to Elephanta caves. Worth visiting!"
Gateway_of_India,Acineto,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Archway into the Sea,"The Gateway is quite a large archway located in the Colaba region of Mumbai. There is a large area in front of the gate where many people congregate and take photos. The gateway is very large and has some information about the history. There are a few other monuments nearby, including the Taj Mahal Palace.There is only one entrance to the area which requires bag screening and searches, usually when it's not too busy. It is free to enter the place. There are food stalls located outside the main entrance which sell a variety of different street food. It does get really busy though, since the area also has terminals for many ferries around the area including Elephanta. It was particularly busy on Sunday where the traffic was very heavy along the area. It is a nice place to make a day of since there are plenty of other attraction and sites around here."
Gateway_of_India,Melina Devi Seeam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Gateway of India,"A must-visit landmark when in Mumbai. I got to see the sunset, nightfall, sunrise through the Gateway of India while staying at the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower. As part of the Tata Mumbai Marathon, there was a show going on at the Gateway that got the whole area filled with a serenade of Indian classical music and beats which made it truly a magical experience. An important point to note is that due to the Gateway being a very popular landmark it is very crowded. In the mornings before 8am or late nights after 11pm are the best times to visit from my experience. To get a full view of the Gateway along with the Taj, you would have to catch a ferry ride."
Gateway_of_India,abhilashadoor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Gateway of india,"The Gateway of India is a historical monument located in Mumbai, India.

The monument is located at the tip of Apollo Bunder, overlooking the Arabian Sea.One of the major attractions of the Gateway of India is the boat rides to Elephanta Caves, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The boat ride takes around an hour and offers a beautiful view of the Mumbai Harbour and the city skyline.The Gateway of India is a popular tourist spot and is always crowded. However, the crowds are manageable, and the monument is well-maintained by the authorities. Overall, the Gateway of India is a must-visit destination for anyone visiting Mumbai."

Chef Surendra @ Shamiana and chef Simon Shauqat @ Souk were excellent! and their suggestions spot on. Mala and her staff at the Sea Lounge, Anslem at the breakfast service also deserve special mention for their warmth and helpfulness. Anslem even shared photos of the view on a clear day as we had cloudy/rainy weather. The housekeeping is unobtrusively efficient. What impressed is that trainees are so eager and willing help too.

It is recommended to come here early morning when it is empty. The crowds build very fast and it becomes really hot around this area as there are no shades. The place is full of touts etc selling travel packages. There are chargeable toilet services but the quality is poor. Could not see any offices for ferry  services, but maybe they open later in the day. Nothing much to do here unless you want to enjoy the historical monument architecture and view the Taj hotel architecture. No place to sit. The monument itself is separated by barriers and you cannot go to the other side facing the sea."

Food was tasty, right spice levels and Paneer was tender. Good size portions.Mains were a Daal Makni and Chicken Jalfrezi accompanied by their crispy garlic coriander naan and rice. Mains were as good, if not better than starters.This is an authentic restaurant with decent Punjabi cooking. I really enjoyed all the food and would love to come back. Nice to have home cooked food away from home. Being a huge curry fan, this place ticked all the right boxes. Staff are polite and on a Saturday night, restaurant was one of the busiest within the strip."

Gateway_of_India,Sandy_JSR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020,Symbol of Mumbai,"Gateway of India is the symbol of Mumbai. Rich history is associated with this monument. During British era, the gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance for important colonial personnel and also the place from where the last British troops left India following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront, just opposite to Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel, overlooking the Arabian Sea. The gateway is a prime tourist attraction and a gathering spot for the locals as well. Plenty of street vendors and photographers are available there offering their services. The photographers provide on-spot photo print and file transfers, the rate may be negotiated. The monument looks stunning under elimination. Plenty of public transports and restaurants are available nearby."
