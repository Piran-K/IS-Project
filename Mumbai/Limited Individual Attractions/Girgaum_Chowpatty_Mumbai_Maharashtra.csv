Yes, it was an unusual experience for me to watch the kids making their dream castles and carving them to their level of perfection. No wonder it’s the most sought after place to play beach volleyball.Take a walk barefoot on the golden sand of the beach and unwind from the hustle-bustle of your monotonous life.Always keep your belly empty for that lip-smacking Bhelpuri which you can get there in abundance.Apart from that Pav bhaji, barf gola, sev puri, malai kulfi are a must try.My advice would be to go empty stomach and starve yourself before going there !"

Girgaum_Chowpatty,PrashantTN,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Good beach wrt to Mumbai...,"Its close to Taraporwala stadium hence you can club with this. The chowpatty is quite clean wrt to Mumbai atmosphere and lacs gushing to enjoy on the beach. The load on the beach is less vis a vis Juhu Beach. One can seat on the tetrapods and gaze at the sea watching sunset... enjoy the mungfalli and bhel... or you may like to stroll along with beach alone or with your near and dear ones. For kids, they can get indulged in water (though not restricted to kids) or play with the wet sand making castles etc... though the sand may not be that clean...Enjoy!!!"

Great view of sunset - simply amazing. Did not find good parking options though - might need to research for next visit though.
