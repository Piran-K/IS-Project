Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Ashiq Dosani (Addy),5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022 • Friends,One of the most peaceful place in Mumbai,I had been to this place long back before covid. I have never visited such calm and peaceful place before. They have so many sitting places available where you can just sit and calm yourself. They have an amazing chamber (i don't know what they call it) which is in the centre of this place where i saw people in meditating. After speaking to some people there i got to know that they sit here for hours and hours to find inner peace. They have got food stalls installed too where you get food at reasonable price and quality is also very good. So many good places to capture. I just enjoyed being there during my visit. P.s- i don't the protocols post covid so before visiting you must inquire and then go. I am sure you will like the place.
Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,David D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,"A peaceful place for modern Buddhist meditation, built in Burmese architectural style.","The pagoda is a welcome break from the bustle of the metropolis of Mumbai. The golden spire sits atop a large stone dome, one of the largest in the world, and the apex of the dome is said to contain ashes of the Buddha. Fountains, gardens, and a replica Ashoka column adorn the complex. Most impressively of all though, is the descendant of the Bodhi tree in Mahabodhi, under which the Buddha is said to have attained Enlightenment 2500 years ago. Whether one is a Buddhist or not, it is impressive to be able to have such a connection to such an ancient tradition. Obviously this is a religious and meditative site and visitors should behave with respect here."

Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Santosh-N-Thorat,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,An average day at Pagoda,Visited this simple and quite place with my family in the month of December 2021. We started very early morning from Ambernath. After reaching Borivali station took a bus to reach the Gorai creek.From Gorai creek you can take ferry and reach opposite side. From there either you can start walking for 25 mins or hire an auto-rickshaw.It seems most of the people come here to spend there leisure time. Only few people visit this place to stay and complete 15 day meditation course.Separate room is available for experiencing meditation with audio tape.Two Vegetarian canteens are available to have snacks and meals. Washrooms are neat and clean.You can continuously hear the sound of recorded verse. Some people found this sound annoying.I recommend to visit this place once.

Staff is helpful and the souvenir shop is a good place for a quick shopping visit. Opens at 9am everyday and entry closes at 6:30."
Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Surabhi Deshpande,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Worst experience ever - Surabhi Deshpande,"I had the most unpleasant experience at the Global Vipasaana Pagoda. Not only are the authorities ill-mannered, but also the staff is extremely rude. I was at the Pagoda on Saturday morning i.e. 15th February 2020 to meditate and before I realized I had to visit the Management ofrice to complain. Having entered the wrong gate and apologizing for doing so, not only was I questioned about my intention of doing so, but also I was asked numerous times as to why I was visiting the pagoda. After apologizing yet again and mentioning that the pagoda used to be open to the public a few years back and did not require a 10-day course in vipassana, a guide present there yelled at me asking me who gave you this information. Reiterating the same thing again, he yelled at me again saying that the pagoda has never been open to the public. So I merely questioned why he was being so rude and who was he to question me about anything at all. I was yelled at again, this time very loudly. So as a citizen would react, I headed to the management ofrice to complain and met with the Public Relations Officer - Mr. Shakti Kapoor. A very calm and cordial person to speak to, I vented out my issue. The worst part about my conversation with him was that instead of taking action against the rude staff, he began to explain he concept of 'Vipassana meditation'. Neither did he listen nor did he care. He instead declared that it was my fault and instead tried to shew me away by asking me to head to the lower level for meditation. I had absolutely no words for this sheer manipulation and hoax instituition and management. Being well educated and being in the profession of communication, the Officer lacked the ability to listen or take any action. To top it all, there was also a police officer present in the same room and chose to walk out while we watched me complain. I am surely never going back to this bogus place which they call 'sacred' when theu cant respect a human to behin with. I would just urge people to be careful about their encounter with people like these who know nothing but to manipulate and spoil your visit."
Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Daisytells,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great day trip from Mumbai,"The travel info to come to the Global Vipassana Pagoda is very helpful and clear and I took the train from Churchgate, tuk tuk to Gorai Creek and ferry over to Esselworld and walked to the pagoda. As an old student (done 10 day courses) I was allowed to enter the large pagoda and mediate inside (30 minutes minimum). It was so peaceful. If you have not done a 10 day course, you can do a 10 minute guided introduction to mediation (anapana) in a hall to one side. The shop sells lovely souvenirs and information CD's and DVDs and books and the library has many resources. The teachings on the outside walls are reminders of the importance of non-sectarianism that is affecting many people in the world today. A small cafe sells masala chai/ snacks and water."

As a local you wouldn't want to come here twice until and unless you are related to Buddhism.Reachable by jetty from Gorai as well as a longer motorable road is available.One you reach there, you need to park your vehicle away from the temple. The temple is a magnificent structure played in golden colour.You go up a flight of steps and reach the main pagoda. You are not allowed to go inside the pagoda because of upasnna. It is an Engineering marvel that such a big dome is not supported on pillars. The upasna place also has the relics of Lord Buddha.Please be prepared for lots of walking. You will enjoy the cleanliness, good horticulture, shlokas written on the walls and the hymns which are also produced in a loyd speaker.There is a very big statue of Lord Buddha.Two places to eat, washrooms are clean.While leaving you can go through a souvenier shop and buy artefacts, books etc.Donation can be given in the temple. A two hour trip is enough. Worth visiting atleast once. "

Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Shraddha Bhowad,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Must visit once kind of place,"A majestic place. Being a Vipashyee myself, I know how much I yearn to meditate inside the meditation chamber in here. It is said to be a construction marvel, since the entire pagoda is build on 'no pillars'. The location itself is very amusing since Essel World is right besides it. A place where adrenaline is in full flow, and the other place, which teaches you how to control it. Side to side. Curious, isn't it? 😊Not much to watch as the insides and most of the premises is prohibited to the tourists. Facilities are satisfactory here. There's a small souvenir shop at the exit (you can't miss it, since the exit is through the shop itself). After clicking numerous photos, you will be out in half an hour. A word of advice -. Please don't go in the full sun, especially around 11-2. There's no shade and you will burn yourselves.Must visit once and see it for yourselves kind of place!"

Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Aadhes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Great Architecture and Mediation Centre,"We went here as just tourists, but our impression is completely changed while we were there. This is Buddhist meditation centre with the remnants of Lord Buddha 's relic, hence it is one of most venerable place for all Buddhist followers.   This was built recently by a group of followers for Vipassana Meditation. There are regular programs for the followers from India and globally. Architecture is concern it follows Mynamar style and the dome was built without cement but using interlocking method. The dome can accommodate up to 5000 people at once. You find peace and calm inside. We went on a VIP invitation hence we had Mr. Sakthi Kapoor as our guide, he was very knowledgeable and extremely polite. Exterior is painted in Gold colour paint and can be visible from far away places. If you have some time a day or two better you attend a meditation program on prior appointment. Entry and all are free of cost. Since it is a religious place dress decently. There is a vegetarian cafeteria you will enjoy the meal."

We had gone by Uber to Gorai jetty where we purchased ferry tickets priced at 70 rupees per person for to and fro trip. The view of the Golden Pagoda from the ferry and its reflection on the water was an amazing sight. After getting down from the ferry, we had to walk around 10 minutes to reach the Pagoda after passing by the entrance to the Essel World. Entrance to the Pagoda is free but you need to join a course if you want to meditate in the glass hall inside the central dome. We were mesmerized by the architecture and the beauty of this place and clicked as many pics we could. There are fountains too and souvenir shops and restaurant. "

Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Stormyallen,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,An amazing structure,"Whist in Mumbai for dental treatment, this was one place my wife wanted to visit, as she had been to the Vipassana centre in Queensland Australia twice. Because she had done this, she was allowed to enter the main meditation hall, but I could only look through the visitors window.  The building itself is really spectacular and definitely worth a look. There is also a canteen where you can buy a snack or a meal and of course a souvenir shop.A word of advice - make sure you organise your return journey before you leave. We hired an Uber car to take us there, which was quite a long way, as the centre is located on a kind of peninsula.  However, after leaving the centre we found we had no reception on our phone and could not book a return Uber!!!!!! and of course tuk tuks don't venture that far. We eventually learned that if you turn left out of the gate and walk along the road, you finally come to a ferry which for 35 rupee will get you across to the 'mainland' where tuk tuks etc are available.."
Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Beautiful architecture and peaceful meditation hall,"The Global Vipassana Pagoda is Buddhist complex with a stupa that houses a relic of the Lord Buddha, which also happens to be the largest dome without any supporting pillars. The stupa is a meditation hall, which only used for meditation purposes, though you can still see the hall via the viewing gallery. Aside from the stupa, the complex also contains  several buildings dedicated to Buddha such as the art gallery containing paintings that chronicle his life, a photo gallery of stupas around the world containing Buddha relics as well as a library on Buddhism.If you like South-East Asian architecture then you’ll love visiting Global Vipassana Pagoda. The buildings are beautiful examples of Burmese architecture especially the elaborate roofs of the gate and pavilions containing the drums.The easiest way to get to the pagoda is by taxi or auto which will take you right to the entrance. I did it the local way using the 294 bus to get to Gorai Jetty Market, followed by a ferry ride from the jetty. Have fun either way."

Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,mythace,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,"Achitecture, peace, a symbol of progress of humanity","We went to the Global Pagoda on a Sunday evening - took a Ferry from Gorai market (a return ticket costs INR 55 per person). The architecture of the pagoda is amazing and we spent quite some time soaking into it. There is a small garden with a children's play area around. There is also a 10 minute movie on the story behind pagoda and the Vipassana practice, followed by a 10 minute meditation lesson for those interested. There is a hall that contains hand made paintings depicting scenes from Budhha's life. Overall, a great visit for the entire family."

The travel has to be planned even if one stays in Mumbai because of the distance. In case kids are accompanying can be a joint trip with Essel World. Need to visit early since Essel World closes around 5-6 PM and charges full fee even if visiting for one hour.

I want to visit Global Vipassana Pagoda since the day i have visited EsselWorld. I have seen the large Pagoda from one of EsselWorld ride.  You can reach Global Vipassana Pagoda easily from Borivali railway station. From Borivali railway station you can take shared auto to Gorai creek which will cost you around 20 per seat. Then from Gorai creek you have to take ferry services to cross the creek. It will cost you around 50rs for return ride. Ferry will drop you at the gate EsselWorld. From that gate you have to follow signed direction to Global Vipassana Pagoda. It is silent place where you can feel peaceful energy. The Pagodas are build with burmese architecture style. Enjoy the pictures."

Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Yogesh,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,not worth at all...over rated,"Its highly over rated. Good for only those who enroll for vipassana course and can meditate inside the dome. Normal tourist are not allowed to go inside the dome.During exit, one is forced to visit the gallery and the souvenier shop coz the railing/rope boundaries are installed in such way.The security staff are inconsistent in their behavior, over react in the name of security which spoils the very purpose of visit.The funny part... in the name of not allowing photography all mobile phones are allowed, but not the point and shoot and other cameras; (the mobile cam have far better cam these days)The guards come after you screaming if you take out your digital camera's.Its only good for foreigner's who are liitle curious about Buddhism; fellow countrymen can easily skip this wasteful tourist spot."

Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Marek D,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Only if you haven't seen other (and old) buddhist pagodas,"For overseas casual visitors who are not there for a meditation course I would say go only if you have never been to countries like Thailand or Burma and have not seen other buddhist (old) pagodas, and if you have almost a full day to kill. The trip from southern Mumbai there by train + autorickshaw + boat easily takes 3 hours (and this without any queueing - on our way back we saw the lines for the ferry had grown very long, it was a Sunday, maybe it's better mid-week), and the same back again. However, the trip by suburban train itself was an experience (you might want to get 1st class ticket, otherwise you'll get crushed or left out on the platform by the crowds, even on a Sunday). The building itself is new and looks impressive mainly for the size and from the distance. Inside the site it's a lot less impressive, we were done in less than half hour. The construction work is not finished and you cannot go inside the pagoda (you can peek through a dirty glass window, and it's just empty space, no decoration). Also note that you have to deposit your camera, only mobiles are allowed for taking photos."
