Gorai_Beach,richanish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Secluded beach where you can take your ride,Approach to beach is good but a bit narrow. The sand is black and there is a lot of garbage floating in the water. Very few food stalls available so it's better to bring your own food. The only positive is that you can drive your car or bike on the beach and have some fun. There's nothing else that you can do over here. 
Gorai_Beach,S D Chandra,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2020,Fraudulent Cheating Locals. Dirty Beach,"Dirty beach. Cheating LocalsOur car got stuck in beach sand. The locals demanded 5000 rupees to pull out. We found a crane operator who would help for 500, they threatened him. The lifeguards were corrupt and refused to help. Ultimately we had to shell out the amount. It is a dirty beach and greedy and cheating locals are out to make a quick buck. They charged us 50% money at liquor shops as well. Nightmare in times of Corona. Hate this place"

Gorai_Beach,Cedric N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,A popular day trip destination for Mumbaikars,"Had been to this beach in Gorai a long back ago. This beach is a popular destination for Mumbaikars.This beach is good for a one day picnic. It is lined with palm trees and small houses. It also has a few stalls selling street food, Golas, corn on the cob etc. However, some say it is a clean beach. But due to increase in local tourists, this beach gets filthy and dirty as they start littering on the sand. This beach is black in color. It offers sunset views. Had enjoyed having fun in the waves and collecting seashells as a child.This beach is an ideal place for families, couples as well as friends."

Gorai_Beach,Prabhat Jain,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Reasonably nice place ~,"One of the main beach in Mumbai.U can reach via ferry from Borivali or by driving via Mira-Bhayendar. Driving in your own vehicle is preferred as u can have drive over the beach to go on extreme end which is more cleaNed and serene. There are various basic resorts too in gorai for overnight stay though with kids not recommended for overnight. Couples are ok. Beach water is not that cleaned..it has a black sand. Would suggest to drive down to extreme end and have good time with family, kids or partner. Good place for couples.Beach side food items are available. You can play games on beach. Early morning visit is a far greater experience then during the day as its comparatively empty.Don't have too much of expectations but can certainly visit once to explore and then take your call for next time. I personally drive down quite often just for time pass with kids."
Gorai_Beach,Shoeb,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018,Far from Mumbai,"It is pretty far from the city and need not be visited by those who are coming to Mumbai for the first time. Basically it is for locals. May be if you stay in Bhayandar or Mira Road, only then you can think of going to this beach"
Gorai_Beach,Sszaman,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Business,Waste of time ,We did not find any peace there. Fresh air is far cry as the bad smell is all around the beach. It should have been more clean and well maintained.

Gorai_Beach,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Yoga on the beach,On a Sunday morning I had visited this beach with my yoga group for an early morning yoga session. We had travelled by car from Mira Road and it took around 30 minutes to reach this place. The beach has large black rocks followed by soft blackish sand bed leading to the sea which was peaceful during our visit. We placed our yoga mats on the beach and did yoga session for about an hour while enjoying the cool morning breeze and the beautiful sight of numerous fishing boats. Another group was enjoying zumba dance session while another runner's group were training on the beach. After yoga session we enjoyed home made breakfast on the rocks. The beach is cleaner compared to other beaches in Mumbai.
Gorai_Beach,PRiya S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Mini goa,"I have been to this place via Borivali gorai creek, from there we have to take a ferry.we went there with bikes so we decided to let our bikes hop into ferry too.within 15 minutes we reached there.so this beach is easily accessible. When we reached the beach we found it like an isolated place because they were very few people. But this was also a plus. Because the beach was very calm peaceful less crowded. What's the beach was very neat and clean. It was so soothing and peaceful hear.awat from city's Hustle and bustle, birds chirping, noise of waves.amazing. The nearby tourist attractions are EsselWorld and Water Kingdom.  Accommodations are  available near the beach only, but make sure you choose the Classy ones, because there are many cheap ones also available. Also one thing I didn't like here is the shameless activities by few couples I would request please don't destroy the scenic beauty of this beach by such activities. As far as safety of the beach is concerned I found that there was no lifeguard available and also it is pretty isolated place over if you are in a group and leave before sunsets. This place reminds me of goa.few kolis near the beach, local people, scenic beauty, calm n clean beach.overall a very good place away from mumbai's fast running life.a good weekend place."
Gorai_Beach,armanjarekar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,Cleaner Beach in Mumbai!!!,"We visited Gorai Beach on a Saturday. Being a holiday season, it was slightly crowded but relaxing. Due to low tide,  beach was dry and everyone were driving in with four wheeler with their four wheelers and having fun. Even there were horse rides for childrens and their parents. Even there were womens selling fresh catch fish.Food stalls and Ice gola stalls in every corner of the beach. After the sunset, the tide rose then waves started coming in and once a dry beach was completely wet after. Even a nice, cool breeze passing by. Even very secure beach with Police on patrol after sunset everywhere.Definitely must visit place in Mumbai once...!!!!    "

To reach gorai, one must 1st have to travel through ferry which is normally INR 5 -  INR 10. Then there is a long way to travel to the beach. Multiple restaurants, hotels and resorts are available near the beach. It feels like you are visiting Goa."
Gorai_Beach,Sameerman,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Okay types,Beach is extremely safe as there is no threat of Rocky depths. It's flat however it has got black sand which spoils the ambience. Can go to play football or walk. But cannot call it a beach. 
Gorai_Beach,Doilyn M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Vehicle Parking needs to be better managed, Cleanliness required","We visited the beach on weekend and it was way too crowded. The main entrance to the beach is usually blocked by all the cars and scooties trying to get in and get out. Its a nightmare for the walking people. The constant honking nearly deafens you. There are traffic police's but inspite of that the mayhem continues weekend after weekend.Also a lot of garbage is thrown by public. The ""Swachh Bharat Abhiyan "" doesn't seem to apply to this beach. People prefer to litter than search for dustbins and keep the place clean"

This is a great place for locals only.  "
Gorai_Beach,DheemantShetty,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Getting worse year on year,"A long safe shoreline is going down the drains. The sand is black oily muck and the water is equally horrible. This used to be a beautiful.beach 30 years ago.There are a lot of budget accommodation right on the beach. You get nice toddy here from some of the toddy sellers. You can come here with a vehicle via Mira road - Bhayander- Uttan or if you are coming on a bike or without a vehicle from Mumbai suburbs then you can take a ferry from Borivali, gorai creek, cross over and then take a bus or auto to the beach."

Gorai_Beach,Sandip S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Excellent Day-Out near to Home,"Visited Gorai beach last week. It's excellent experience all together. Though, we are staying very near to this beach, but not able to visit this place in last 4 years. We started around 3 PM and it took around 1 hr from my place (including traffic). The entry point of the beach is bit narrow, so creating some traffic. But the entry point is fully managed by traffic police. However, there are parallel roads to reach the beach. But those roads are full of up and down. So, it‚Äôs better to be careful in these roads during driving. The beach is super clean and less crowded and there is no restriction for driving. However, we have decided to park our car safely. We played football and other games and spent the entire evening. Though food stalls are limited to that beach, however, those are more than sufficient for evening snacks. If you are non-vegetarian, one could purchase Pompfret, prone, bombil and other fishes at a very cheaper price. Fishes are much much more fresh than normal market as sellers are collecting these fishes from fishing boats anchored there. One must go with family and friend for family entertainment."

Gorai_Beach,sridharan2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Peaceful clean beach close to Mumbai,This is a beachside that is yet to be fully tapped for its potential. The beach front is vast with lovely trees lining the landscape. The beach sand is somewhat blackish but fairly clean. The approach road from the main road is somewhat narrow and hence those driving into the beach front must be a bit cautious. Though there are some small coffee/ snack shops do not expect much restaurants etc near the beach. Better to carry your own food/ snacks. But the beach is definitely nice and food for families.

The sunset is very Nice. there are 4-5 resorts near to the beach and sea food lovers will get a chance to having it. Alcohol is also served in those restaurant if you want. ***Veg Lovers plz bring your own Food if you are Pure Veg and Cant even eat in Restaurant that serves Noon Veg******"

Gorai_Beach,skTripAdvFB,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,Not happy at all!,Not happy at all with the civic authorities! As they have not provided even a single water tap or toilet/ wash area. Families with kids come & are tend to get drenched but at the end there is no place to relieve/ body wash.

Gorai_Beach,Shaileshak,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015,Calm & Serene,"Though this is popular beach around Mumbai, there are no facilities for tourist at the beach. We reached the beach mid afternoon and saw few people around. The beach was dirty with lots of garbage around. Not worth the effort to reach there."
Gorai_Beach,Krishna M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016,Good experience,"Its a good experience however you need to check the tide timings then only visit this beach or else the water enters into the resorts.  famous to eat GOLA,AAM,VADA PAAV,PALM..."

Gorai_Beach,Tejas A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Best beach in mumbai.,The shore was too much muddy during low tide...feet were sinking upto 2-3 inches at places..god knows what was wrong with it..earlier it was not so..or may be whenever I had traveled here it was during high tides ..overall the beach is good..I would say best if compared to other beaches in mumbai.It's safe to swim here.
Gorai_Beach,Olinca,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Waste of natural resource!!,"The access to the beach is by ferry or by road, the ferry being the fastest. The docks of the ferry too are very badly maintained . There is a stench at the Borivali khaki and horrible to walk through as well. Once u get on the other side , the beach is definitely not a pleasing site.. With young couples all over and not that great stalls it's a complete tu n off"
Gorai_Beach,Kartrekker,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Needs lot of improvement,"After reading reviews on the internet, planned to visit the beach by bike from Mumbai.. When I finally reached the beach, I was surprised to see how different it was from whatever I heard and read. Beach is shabby, stinky at some places. We did not spend more than half an hour there and started on our way back.. "
Gorai_Beach,SunilW,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Lot of focus required,"The beach is quite shabby, the water is not good.. it stinks badly in some parts of the beach. Both the authorities and the people are to be blamed for this."
Gorai_Beach,640sameerp,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,One of the dirtiest Beach,It's a mud Beach. Water is very dirty and smelly. Beach is crowded. It feels disgusting by walking on this Beach. Try to not visit this Beach. No personals for safety too. 
Gorai_Beach,rrayleigh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Route is better than the Destination,"Beach is not a lot clean but what's attractive is the road you travel to reach there. Entire road is surrounded by greens and is great to travel early mornings. Beach itself is bit dirty at some places but the view it offers is amazing. Likes:-Scenic views-Less Crowd.-Lot of room for sports-Food offered along the pathDislikes:-Locals bugging about rooms.-Certain Dirty areas on the beach.-Water itself not clean enough to go intoHowever, it's a relatively cleaner beach compared to most of the beaches in Mumbai and offers a great getaway over the weekend. I love to drive to the beach every weekend as it's close by so 3-4 hours of fun are easily available over the weekend without affecting the weekend plan with family or friends. Do remember to visit early morning to feel the fresh air and enjoy break taking views. uploading a few photographs for you..Regards,Ray"

One is reminded of Konkan and Goa roads briefly.Local fishermen and young couples can be seen here along with other visitors"
