Growel_s_101_Mall,niki dee,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Couples,Spacious mall in Kandivali,"This mall is huge with lot of open space and located right at the highway. Decent place to spend time if you do not want to go far only to visit a mall. It does not offer many options for shopping. However central is coming soon. Most people visit this mall for Big Bazaar or watching movie at cinemax. Though it also has globus, puma, reliance stores, esbeda, karigar, health and glow, bata, mochi, enrich salon to name a few. The food court has options for all - KFC, Pizza Hut express, Mc Donalds, Maroosh, Subway, Cookie man and few more. Apart from that it has stand alone restaurants like Mainland China and Zaffran. It also has couple of activities to keep your children busy."

While moving  inside, one has a  feeling  of strolling in Europe. The  Christmas  time it is the place for kid's enjoyment.  Games, Santa,  London  bus, choochoo chocoholics trains.
