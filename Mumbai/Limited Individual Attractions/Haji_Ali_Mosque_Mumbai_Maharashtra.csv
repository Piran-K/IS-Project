Haji_Ali_Mosque,Debapratim Chattopadhyay,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021 • Couples,Beautiful but urgent need of maintenance,"On our trip to Mumbai, we planned to visit Haji Ali Dargah as I had a wonderful experience 20 years back. A serene place nestled amidst the waves of the sea, we were excited. But our excitement soon died out as we reached the place. Hundreds of hawkers and street vendors crowded the approach road, they even try to pull you towards their shops. However we loved the sea causeway that connects the dargah to land. Sea on both side, cool breeze and sunset, it was a perfect backdrop. But you cannot ignore the garbage alongside the sea, it was everywhere. Once we get inside the shrine we were shocked, there was an unbearable stench all over the place that we could not stand. We noticed that there were toilets inside the complex and those were the source of that stench. We noticed a overall sign of mismanagement in the entire place. It is our heritage and one of a kind, please maintain it."
Haji_Ali_Mosque,Sandy_JSR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020,Visit to Haji Ali,"The Haji Ali Dargah is a mosque and located at around 500 yards inside the Arabian Sea, one has walk through a pathway to visit the mosque. The pathway has several small shops / hawkers. When we visited in Mar’20, some construction work was going on inside the mosque. There was limited crowd and we offered Chadar and took blessing from the Pir. While entering the pathway, there are several shops on the main road, selling Chadar, flower etc. However, there rates are exorbitantly high, the chadar we bought from them was available at shops on the pathway at 1/3rd rate."

Haji_Ali_Mosque,Sudip Basak,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Not Recommended,"The Dargah is simply not the place to visit in winters. There are no big waves crashing upon/near you. So, there is no real fun. The place is littered with filth and garbage. The hawkers encroach upon the passage to the Dargah. It is a stinky place. The Dargah is under renovation, so you are not allowed to experience the divine feeling of touching the holy book of the Muslims. This opinion is purely from a tourist perspective."

Haji_Ali_Mosque,jmt12london,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Should be magnificent but it’s left to rot,"in theory, this should be the perfect excursion. a stand alone 15th century white mosque on a tiny island in the arabian sea, accessible during low tide via a narrow causeway. from afar, the haji ali dargah mosque is like an ethereal structure. in reality, however, as you get closer, you cannot help notice that the whole area is covered in garbage, the stench is unbearable, stall after stall is selling the same plastic tat, there are beggars left in appalling conditions and the building itself is crumbling. meanwhile, everybody is busy taking selfies. I really don’t get. How can any civilised government let its national heritage go to ruin like that. It’s simply appalling."

Haji_Ali_Mosque,Namit J,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Such a historical place in ruins,"I was amazed to see the neglect of authorities towards haji ali , n for that matter even siddhivinayak temple. They are in such bad shape. PPL visiting Mumbai would love to see these places . Haji Ali as seen in movies seems so calm and serene n Joly, but it's totally the opposite over here. The place is in renovation works. But still , it can be handled so much better. There was garbage all along the way to reach mosque. It was stinking bad, with beggars lined up on both sides. It produces such a sad state of our country. If PPL are listening, pls do something do preserve our heritage."
Haji_Ali_Mosque,Adamspencercook8,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Really unpleasant place,"I would highly recommend viewing it only from the shore. I did the entire walk and will have nightmares about this place. Your nostrils will be blown out with a horrendous stench. People with no legs crawling around on the ground alongside you. The surrounding low water is littered with garbage and barefoot children digging through the mess. It’s a horrendous sight. The mosque itself just feels derelict and cheap and dirty. There is nothing special here. Mumbai is a lovely city and there are wonderful things to do, but this is not one of them. I returned to my hotel immediately to shower."
Haji_Ali_Mosque,Anika S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,"Accessible only during low tide ,a popular landmark of Mumbai.","This dargah(mosque) is located just off worli,in the Arabian sea.The approach road gets submerged in the water during high tide,so this mosque is accessible only during low tide .It is very popular but the approach road has lot of beggars who keep haggling you ,also very crowded place but worth seeing,even from a distance."
Haji_Ali_Mosque,macedonboy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,You probably need to be a member of the faithful to really appreciate it,"The Haji Ali Mosque is a mosque located off a small islet on the western shores of Mumbai in the Arabian Sea. It’s probably best known for the location of the tomb and shrine of the muslim saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. The mosque is very picturesque especially as it’s accessible via a causeway, which is lined with beggars and hawkers who  have no compunction about grabbing passersby.The only thing to really see in the mosque is the shrine. You probably need to be a member of the faithful to really appreciate it. Plus one for being pretty though."
Haji_Ali_Mosque,Jeff See,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Beautiful India ,We took a local train. Crossed a junction. Use the underpass. This is a unique place. Sea tide determines accessibility. We walked all the way and round the monument. The place was strewn with rubbish and smelled of urine. I started to wonder whether all these unhygienic features would make my journey more memorable? I loved this authenticity and i still do.

I did walk out through the alleys and causeway to get to the mosque.  The filth from rotting garbage along the was and especially just in front of this holy place was an assault on my senses.

Haji_Ali_Mosque,James K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Solo,"Dangerous, delapidated, filthy, very wet and in a horrible state of disrepair","Don't go. You'll get extremely wet and dirty as the filthy Indian Ocean splashes over from one side of the pier. A very large wave might even knock you over - or into the ocean. There are beggars everywhere on the floor among the crowds scavenging for dropped food scraps and children selling items of near-zero value. There are likely pickpockets as well. There are no staff, no secutity, and it's very poorly-lit. The Mosque/shrine itself is in terrible, dilapidated condition, and - of course - it's surrounded by trash. There's also nowhere to park. DO NOT GO."

Haji_Ali_Mosque,prannnn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,One of the Main Attractions in Mumbai,"This is one of the prominent attractions in Mumbai and is considered as a holy place to visit for Muslims. The good part about this place they allow people from all religions to visit and although this place is open on all days, the best time would be during Ramadan. The place is located near the seashore and at a walk able distance from Mahalaxmi race course. You can reach here by public and private transportation. I would suggest you to prefer public transportation (Bus/ train - The nearest railway station is at a walk able distance) as they don't have any parking facility. Besides, being very prominent, the place is always crowded. Since its a religious place, you don't need to pay anything for entry fee, however you could always donate as per your wish. When you reach the sea shore, you need to walk along a narrow strip of land so as to reach the holy place and of course you have to go through security checks as well. The only issue with this place is the vicinity around the mosque as it has become very dirty and i hope the authorities would take some action in order to do a clean up for the sake of this iconic place."

But keeping the religion aside, Hajiali Mosque has its unique importance. People from almost all the religion visits this divine place. As it is built in the middle of the bay this mosque makes the scenery so beautiful that anyone would stop there to witness the place. You can also walk down from back side of mosque in the water during low tides. The beauty of Mumbai is clearly visible from that area. The water floods on the roadside during high tides and people living there are also seen dancing and enjoying in that water.Being this place always crowded,one should also beware about the pick pocketers in this area."

Haji_Ali_Mosque,alikarim,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Nice Dargah to visit while in Mumbai,"This shrine to Muslim saint Haji Ali, is situated on a walkway into the sea, and unfortunately, even before you get tot he walkway, you get pestered by the local hoping to sell you a head covering handkerchief telling you that you will not be allowed inside without it. Ignore all these touts, and only buy if you want. I just ignored them and was soon left alone. The walkway is a little dirty, and has small stall on one side selling all kinds of things. There are also a number of beggars. The shrine itself is Ok, though it is dirty at the entrance. Peaceful place inside, and lots of activities at the dargah itself. Take a few minutes to walk around outside and enjoy yhe view of Mumbai from the shrine grounds."

Haji_Ali_Mosque,aneesh_menon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Peaceful,Haji Ali is a mosque or shrine in Mumbai ... Good place to visit and pray for any religion ... They allow all religion to visit and it’s beat to visit in the evening avoiding rainy season because it’s away from the land and sort of island with only a strip of land leading to the mosque which is accessible by a short walk ... Lot of small eateries and shopping places surround the walk way ... Visit the mosque if you believe or just want to spend some peaceful time in Mumbai ... Loy of trust and faith is spoken about this place and it’s an experience from which I am writing this review... Stay blessed and happy visiting ... 👍

Haji_Ali_Mosque,Culture827089,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Haji Ali  Dargah,"It is the Dargah of Haji Ali baba . It is a  place  where Muslim pay their respect to the pious preacher and look out for peace. The extra ordinary  thing about it is, although  there is high tide twice a day and the full  way to Dargah is covered  by sea water yet the Alhamdulillah nothing happens to Dargah which is surrounded  by water on all side"

Haji_Ali_Mosque,Anshul Goel,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Holy shrine with good view,it looks really good from the far as it is in the sea. You have to take the pavement to reach there which i would say is pretty dirty. The view from the Dargah is really nice. 
Haji_Ali_Mosque,Adele M,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Good building but very dirty area,"Glad to say I've been there, but it is filthy and stinks. Sad to see so much  beggars and it is a very busy place"
Haji_Ali_Mosque,DeepakBachu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,needs better maintenance,the pathway leading to the Dargah is poorly maintained..there is hardly any staff to manage the crowd...even no proper provision to leave your footwear
Haji_Ali_Mosque,Deb,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,A nightmare,"Pains to see the apathy with which the management of this place handles the place. The path to the Dargah is plagues with beggars and small shops, in midst of the filth and the stench of the sea stretch beyond. Unimaginable amount of trash floating around. You feel a sense of rage thinking what makes the people who manage this place push the place to such a state, such a popular destination but a blot in the face of Maharashtra Government."
Haji_Ali_Mosque,MANCHIMASTER,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Haji Ali Mosque,Haji Ali Mosque is named after the saint and it is said your wish granted. Warning do not venture during high tide else coming back is tough and you will have to wait till it subsides

Haji_Ali_Mosque,Govind P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Mumbai visit,This place is so beautiful! It’s situated on the sea shore which gives It a awesome look. But the problem is that it’s not well maintained the way which you pass through is so dirty but every thing is fine other than that and some times when water flow is not so high there is no water around the Dargah so make sure that when you’re going to watch it there is enough water so you get a beautiful pictures!

Haji_Ali_Mosque,Ganesh G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Nice Place,Very Nice place to enjoy the peace and crowd noise both at the same time. For best view and Photography it is recommended to visit the Dargah in the morning or evening time not in the afternoon for sure. You have to walk around 1 km to reach the main Dargah.
Haji_Ali_Mosque,Explorer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,People from different religion come to this place with love and respect,"Dargah is situated in sea so when you go through way you can enjoy high waves during rainy season..Inside the dargah, It was so peaceful. But the way to dargah was very dirty. If the way is kept neat and clean tourist could have a wonderful experience all together."
Haji_Ali_Mosque,Sachin0408,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Sorry State of Affair,Agreed it's an important pilgrimage destination.Agreed it's thronged by people of different communities.Agreed it's an important landmark of Mumbai............ ButYou cannot ignore the fact that its in a sad state of affairs. It's full of filth and smells awful. The management should think of making it a little attractive and well planned. I visited twice and was disappointed on both the occasions.

Haji_Ali_Mosque,Nelvis R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Beautiful mosque in the Sea,This is once one the must see places during the winters and summars as its well decorated and lit up in the night. During the monsoons there are usually very less people as the sea goes rough and sometimes covers the pathway.In the night there are really nice group of people who sing kawali and entertain the visiting crowd. 
Haji_Ali_Mosque,Shoeb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,Inside the sea,The mosque and the musoleum is sorrounded by sea from all sides and is on an island which is connected by a road  . It can be reached only when the tide is low. A stream of vistors come here everyday. The place is very popular with people from all religions. Surely worth a visit.
