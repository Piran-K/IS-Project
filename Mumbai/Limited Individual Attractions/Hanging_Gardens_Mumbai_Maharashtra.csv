Hanging_Gardens,shakmed,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Can be made attractive and well maintained.,"Hanging gardens are not hanging actually ! Basically its terrace garden sort of. Even in the month of October, it was not maintained green and flourishing ! Tourists just come for its name but BMC or whosoever is maintaining it is not doing justice with this historical garden !"
Hanging_Gardens,Sandy_JSR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020,Nice Greenery in the Middle of City,"The Hanging Gardens in Mumbai is a terraced gardens situated at Malabar Hill, just opposite to Kamala Nehru Park, the garden is in the middle of the bustling city. Entry is free, as part of city tour, we visited the park in early afternoon. The park has several hedges carved into animal shapes, an attractive flower clock situated in the middle of the garden, different types of plants and flowers. It is a green space spreads over a vast area of land with pathway for moving around the garden. However, in the hot weather, moving around the Garden may be tough due to limited trees / shades. It is a popular spot for the locals as well."
Hanging_Gardens,igolfCA,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Not what I expected,"Our tour guide was quite excited to show us the Hanging Gardens. It was large with paths throughout. The paths we were on were mostly red dirt with small pebbles and didn’t give it a neat, clean look. Many of the beds were bare which may change with the seasons. It was early March when we were there, so I would have thought many things would be planted and blooming (the weather was beautiful). However, that was not the case.We walked around and did see some decent views from one area but found the park in general to be very unexciting. I wouldn’t waste my time to come here if it requires a special trip."
Hanging_Gardens,gfsc5,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,Water reservoir,"We visited the gardens as part of a tour group.  Maybe we didn’t see the best of the garden but most of us were a bit underwhelmed.  The gardens are built on a reservoir so there isn't much soil which accounts for the lack of trees except around the perimeter.  It was quite hot without the shade.  There are lots of paths and apparently the gardens are very popular for walking and promenading.To be honest, the gardens across the road looked more interesting."

Hanging_Gardens,let's travel now,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Hanging Gardens Next To A Burial Ground,"This is a very interesting place, not necessarily the gardens themselves so much as the very interesting neighbour.The gardens have been built over the top of a city freshwater supply.There are roses and pagodas to view and the gardens are free to enter.   There are public toilets on site that cost 10p to use. Next to the gardens you can see vultures circling over land.  That land is the burial ground of the Farsi religion. It is called a burial well  ...... whereas it is really a pit.  Following the death of a Farsi, a family member and a priest take the deceased to the pit, strip the body and place the body in the pit for wild animals to consume.  Our guide explained all of this to us and it was absolutely fascinating albeit you cannot see the pit or the bodies from the hanging gardens but you can see the vultures circling in the distance.Fascinating  ......"

Hanging_Gardens,Santosh Kumar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Awesome place,Good place to be with kids too as it has best attraction as old lady's shoe which was very unique and nicely maintained.
Hanging_Gardens,Raymond W,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,It's Certainly Not Babylon,"With a grandiose name like the Hanging Gardens, you might get your expectations up. That would be an error. This place will not bring to mind visions of ancient Babylon. What you can expect is a rather bedraggled park which is picked over by murders of crows. It might once have had a few nice modernist touches (e.g. the concrete gateways with wavy roofs) but these too are showing their age. Still, you might walk up here if you're chasing echoes of Salman Rushdie's ""Midnight's Children"" in its Malabar Hill section."
Hanging_Gardens,Simon L,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Pleasant city park,"Worth a visit but only takes a short time to walk round it. Golly, does Mumbai need more open space! Not sure there is much specific to note but it was interesting to learn of the water storage underneath the gardens and there are some good views over the city"
Hanging_Gardens,jim m,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Nice city park,"This is a nice city park with things for children, a selection of plants, nice walks and good views.  It is encased by walls and some of the gates are locked so finding your way out can be a little difficult."
Hanging_Gardens,Jodi R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,Uninteresting to see!,This is just a garden not particularly impressive or interesting.  The more interesting part of the visit to Malabar Hill is the view of Marine Drive and the story behind the Hanging Gardens.  Be sure to ask your guide to explain how the garden came about.  There apparently used to be a lake there and it was filled in as it became a health hazard!
Hanging_Gardens,Surrey 13,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,A lovely location to spend an hour ,The gardens are lovely and very well kept with a variety of colourful annual plants and shrubs. It is normally not too busy  although you do get groups of people visiting as well as school parties 
Hanging_Gardens,G A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Pretty Garden For Local Residents,"I visited the Hanging Gardens this morning while in the area, after a year.  It was pretty, well manicured, with not too many people probably because it is getting warm now!There is some work going on in a couple of layouts but otherwise it is neat and colourful.  Seasonal spring butterflies have arrived, so if you have the patience, you can get some good butterfly images.I do not know why all tourist groups are compulsorily brought here.  I mean it is a pretty enough garden but nothing out of the ordinary for a tourist.  It is a good walking ground for local residents."
Hanging_Gardens,kalex15,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Good place on top of Mumbai.,"This is a very high place, on top of Malabar Hill. The garden itself is nothing to write about, but is expansive, and a place where people come to stretch their legs and have a breath of fresh air. Lots of pathways through the garden.There is a good view of the Ambani Residence in the distance."
Hanging_Gardens,ImVishu,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,visit it if you plan to go malabar hill,i found nothing special about this garden but still as you are visiting you must visit this garden its good there are some patterns made of flowers which is good otherwise its just a garden.

It also has a boot like structure which is quite popular with kids and also adds up for photo ops.
Hanging_Gardens,Liz S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Not an impressive garden,I am sure people visit this hanging gardens only because across from it is a viewing platform of the 'Queens Necklace'.The gardens are unimpressive. I literally took no photos.

Hanging_Gardens,Vivek Dhadha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Well Maintained ,It's a picturesque location situated at Malabar hill. The garden has been redeveloped and it looks beautiful now.The view of the beach from the garden is worth a visit. The only problem is since it is newly built you cannot step on the grasses anymore and forget about eating like you used to before..It is best place to visit with family. For children there are many plants which have given the shape of different animals..There’s also  a giant shoe which is known as old lady shoe.
Hanging_Gardens,RoyDebashis,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,It is just an ordinary garden,To me the garden was not so attractive. The garden is not so well maintained and green. As this is located on a highland that's why its called hanging garden. The name is little misleading. No entry fee required and visit time is not more then 1 hour. From the edge of the garden you can have a good view point for Mumbai. So if you are there you can take a picture over there.
Hanging_Gardens,Boyd J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Didn't Live Up To Expectations,"I had a much grander picture in my mind of what these hanging gardens would look like and was disappointed by how underwhelming the gardens looked.  The fact that it was during quite a dry spell didn't help.  There were many Indian families beautifully dressed taking portrait type photos, so this in itself was interesting.  There are good views of Mumbai from the look out point."
Hanging_Gardens,MANCHIMASTER,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,HANGING GARDERN,Hanging Garden is a beautiful place for nature and plants lover. One should go before noon and as early as possible to enjoy the bliss. Old women shoe at hanging garden is an added attraction for kids

Hanging_Gardens,Deb,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Just OK,"A big garden, which perhaps would be better to stroll by when you are relaxed and the weather is good. Not really worth when you visit it as a place of attraction."
Hanging_Gardens,R_Sweden,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Nothing much ,"It's a very dry garden with not so many flowers, bushes, trees etc. Most red dust. We walked around for 10 minutes.. "

Hanging_Gardens,Wim,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Solo,Disappointing,"I expected probably way too much of this 'hanging' garden, but it's fairly small, very dusty (winter time) and there are not much  (interesting) flowers / plants / trees to see. Many local people dress up to take pictures for the family album... so it's fun to watch but the garden itself is pretty disappointing considering the lang walk uphill."

Hanging_Gardens,Ness S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Great location especially if you have little children,"We used to come here often, both when I was a child, and then when we visited Bombay with our young children. The gardens are generally well maintained. There is room for kids to run around and play and explore slides, etc. It also provides a bit of tranquility from the hustle and bustle of the city. Moreover, since it's on a hill, if you're lucky enough to have a clear day, you do get to see lovely views of the city."

Hanging_Gardens,Pepper,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Breath of Fresh Air,"Hanging Gardens on Malbar Hill is a breath of fresh air in Mumbai city. If you live in the vicinity, it's a great place to walk by or in the garden or sit there to meditate. It may notbe very well kept, but it is a great escape from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai's traffic and certainly offers a great view at both sunset and sunrise. It is built on a reservoir, which supplies water to adjacent areas in South Mumbai, but it certainly is not certified for drinking without further treatment."
Hanging_Gardens,sparkyKent,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Beautiful gardens and interesting story about Parsi burial site,"We visited the garden which is in a Parsi area of Mumbai. The gardens are beautiful and clean. Floral shrubs and old trees offer some shade. There’s also an area which is used as a holy funeral site by Parsi residents. Families stroll around the gardens and locals sit on the benches around the gardens which are well kept. An escape from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai. There are often vendors selling items for tourists to buy. You can buy beautiful peacock fans from a guy in the park for a couple of hundred rupees. Get a driver to wait for you outside, you can spend 15 mins or a few hours walking around."

It's a park, and certainly nothing special.  It's not beautiful or anything like that, and it is a little out of the way.  There are some bushes that are groomed to look like animals.  This is certainly a place that you can pass on."
Hanging_Gardens,F S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Friends,Nice place to enjoy and rest,"Hanging Gardens, also referred as Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens, are beautiful terraced gardens that are set atop the western side of Malabar Hill. Established in the 1880s, this garden was designed by Ulhas Ghapokar to protect a nearby water reservoir from getting polluted. This painstakingly manicured garden is spread in a vast area that has well-laid pathways. The colourful flower clock at the centre and numerous animal-shaped hedges are the unique features of this park. You can also enjoy spectacular views of the Arabian Sea from the Hanging Gardens. The Boot House or Old Woman's Shoe, completely made up of stone, is another interesting feature that would make your visit a memorable one. Whether with family or alone, visitors will definitely have a great time amidst the serene surroundings of these beautiful gardens. Its well-maintained pathways are perfect for a jog or stroll around the park."

Hanging_Gardens,Paulina J,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,It's not a viewpoint,I was cheated by the review that described this place as a vantage point. Let me explain... It's not. The park on the hill is kept clean. You can spend a moment of peace here if you are on the way. If not - nothing will happen if you miss that point.
Hanging_Gardens,rea2der,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Hanging Gardens,I recently visited this place with friends.It is also one of the major attractions in Mumbai.The garden is huge and we can able to spot lot of couples here.One can get a relaxing and refreshing walk at evening here.There is no entry free for the garden visit.Malabar hill is quite near place to hit.
Hanging_Gardens,Himanshu G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Can be avoided to visit,"We visited this place last week on Friday on 26th January around 4:00 PM. We found this park very average in size and as well as in view.It was not having much greenery or trees and most of place was just muddy. They have special section for senior citizens and children playground.We didn't find any special or extraordinary, it is just a average park and can be avoided if you have limited time."

Hanging_Gardens,DrNic1,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Not worth the Trek,The gardens are hanging above the water tanks built to supply the city. But this is a park on a hill. There’s not much to see and the views are a little muted with trees obscuring much of the view of the skyline
Hanging_Gardens,Klaus E,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Business,Nice Garden ,Not quite the hanging gardens one would expect but a well maintained park with many benches and covered areas for people to rest and have their peace and quiet and listen to the birds and the squirrels. A few hours in the morning and early evening are strictly for Senior Citizens. Around midday it is full of students and young lovers. Not too many flowers in bloom when we visited but nice view of the scenery around.

Hanging_Gardens,brg68mga,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Family,Somewhat disappointed,"It was a hot, stifling day and although a peaceful garden it needed a lot of TLC. The hanging gardens title though was somewhat misleading. Worth a walk around, though would not go out of your way to do so."
Hanging_Gardens,Ishuheri,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Oversold it in the Name,"It's pleasant as gardens go, but I think they slightly oversold it in the name. When you hear 'hanging gardens', you think Hanging Gardens of Babylon - one of the seven wonders of the known world.This is nice for a stroll, but a wonder of the known world is pushing it a little. You can stretch your legs, admire the butterflies, and grab a snack at one of the vendors over the road."
Hanging_Gardens,Foxy-Froggy,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Very disappointing ...,"The reason this is called the ‘Hanging Gardens’ is not, as you may think, that it contains hanging vegetation, but by virtue of its height on the top of Malabar Hill.  The Hill stands 50 meters above sea level, so is not in any sense very high, but it does dominate the surrounding landscape, although the views are constrained by the many trees surrounding the park.The park sits within the most expensive real estate in Mumbai / India / the World, but is itself very lack-lustre and unkempt, and really not worth the diversion.  It was dusty, dirty, and a far cry from many of our hotel gardens we’ve been privileged to enjoy over recent days.  Having said that, it did seem fairly popular with locals and their children, which was nice to see.  I guess we don’t realise how privileged we are, coming from the UK, and this visit maybe helps contextualise things ..."
Hanging_Gardens,GordonW318,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Hanging Gardens Tourist Attraction Not Worth Visitng,To get here requires a coach or taxi journey through streets grid locked with traffic and can take some time to reach being at the top of Malabar Hill. The gardens are desolate in places and some of the worst seen; don't know how this garden can be called a tourist attraction
Hanging_Gardens,sharjeelcool,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Wow,Nestled in malabar hill this is a beautiful garden.the children just love it and have a grand time at this place.do visit this hidden gem of mumbai.
Hanging_Gardens,AlexSwallow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,My favourite area of Mumbai,"Wow, just loved this. When we were walking up towards the park we were unsure if we could even get in (a lot of the top of the hill is off limits for the Tower of Silence). At the top it opened out into a beautiful garden. The butterflies were breathtaking, the best I've ever seen outside a zoo or wildlife park. The many vultures wheeling overhead were incredible. The air was fresh and welcome after staying in the traffic-choked centre of Mumbai.Just the most brilliant place and so impressive it is free."
Hanging_Gardens,AnitaKhandelwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Garden situated on Top,Its very near to Mumbai chowpatty situated on the top of  malabar hill in Mumbai.Animals made from leaves can be observed here.
Hanging_Gardens,Vakil1951,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Couples,My own abode.,"Hanging gardens at Malabar hill is one of the most visited site by travellers. The views from the gardens are very good as you get to,see the Arabian ocean and the Napean sea road area.Kampala Nehru park is just opposite of this garden.one gets the full view of the famous queen's necklace and Girgam Chowpatty. The entire area is green and dull of trees.As the name suggest the Hanging garden has been built on a large reservoir and as the garden is on the hi I I.e. Malabar hill the temperatures are about 4 degrees less then rest of Mumbai.I can go on writing amazing stories of this garden as I am staying just 5 minutes away from hanging garden."
