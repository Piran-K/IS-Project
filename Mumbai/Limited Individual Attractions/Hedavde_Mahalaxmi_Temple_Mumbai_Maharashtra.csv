Hedavde_Mahalaxmi_Temple,Nitin Joshi,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Mandir hijecked by trusty,Today I went to Mahalaxmi temple at Hedvade after 20 years and was highly disappointed. Road to mandir is in poor condition. After using all driving skill reached mandir at 10am and found it was closed and all devotees were waiting since early morning. Mandir remains open on Only Friday and that also from 9.30 to 10.30 and 1.30 to 6pm. I waited till 11 am but it was locked and no one in temple has idea wen it will b opened. Regular visitor were complaining that there is no discipline on time and Pokhari opens at his will. I along with few ppl went to a small room where Poojary stays in temple but he was missing. In earlier days ppl use to get darshan without any problem but now trusty has made us commercialise by hijecking god and licking temple door without any information to public. Finally many ppl left their flowers on temple door step and left.
