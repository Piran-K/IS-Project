NEED A CHANGE!!,"I think its high time the owners of this place realize that people have wide option to shop these days from many fabulous malls…. So think something new and different to redevelop the place into a lively shopping hub…Heera Panna used to be one of the good bargain place to shop for fake stuff decade back… like copies of many brands…Diesel, Levi,  or watches like guess and all… or perfumes…. But these days people travel a lot…. Everyone has someone or the other travelling abroad can easily get fake stuff at best price so why would you shop from here. That too at insane price!! you can see all pan spits around the wall very unhygienic!!!"

Heera_Panna_Shopping_Center,PrabhuSM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Solo,Not so great ambiance,"Had visited the shopping center on recommendation from a friend. It majorly consists of small shops of leather goods, phones & electronic items. The goods on display were average & never go by the listed price for any of the merchandise. You need to bargain hard! Though, the notice claims that the center comes under ""No Smoking Zone"", the areas near the washrooms seems to be smokers paradise. Stinky toilets too."
Heera_Panna_Shopping_Center,Nergish2014,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Friends,Disappointing.,Went here at the suggestion of friends to look at phone and electronics shops. Highly avoidable place full of low class shops and ordinary goods except for a few items.

Heera_Panna_Shopping_Center,Mayank G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014,Remember to haggle ,"Let me warn you by saying, it is not a shopping mall. It has small shops, most of them have 1st copy of all brands across most products. Always ask for warranty card but you might never get it. This could be one of the bargaining chips.

Heera_Panna_Shopping_Center,1234786,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Ask directly for half the rate Offered by the Vendor.,I had gone there today to buy clothes. Following are my experiences1. I like two T -shirts in a shop. I was offered 1800rs for two. However after bargain I got the two for 800rs.2. In another shop I liked 4 t-shirts. I was offered each for 500rs.However after bargain I took three for 800rs.3. In another shop I liked 4 t shirts. I was offered 400/t-shirts.However after bargain I got 2 t-shirts for 500rs.So I got 7tshirts at 2100rs. They are good and I think would last not more than 12 months. That's not at all bad.Guys Beware. The shop keepers are cruel at pricing. Their marked price is on their mood. If you find them good mannered and sweet tongued you will be cursing yourself later.  The shop keepers are the most  I cunning traders I have met in Mumbai. They have ability to lie in your eyes. You should never get over exited. Don't get over whelmed by the exciting part of the products. Always calculate the actual price. You will  get stressed by bargaining!! Not a pleasing experience overall.
