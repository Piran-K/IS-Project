They say it's one of best shopping centers in Mumbai, but I think this is more of a 'market friendly' kind of city. The markets like Dadar West and Mangaldas were superb.

This mall caters more for the tourists . Links to the palladium mall. Many international branded stores . Free WiFi . PVR cinemas . 
High_Street_Phoenix,Mustardseedy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Beware of scammers,"The shopping centre is no doubt excellent with the choices of shops and the ambience. However, the toilets may be a little smelly and dirty especially on weekends. Some people may approach you selling bogus package and ask for money. Just be careful and walk away. Lastly, you will notice there are lots of taxis parked outside the shopping centre on both sides of the streets. They work as a team. Do not ever take those taxis as their taxi meters are modified and you will have to pay for your mistake. Don't believe? Try it for yourself. I have experience one incident today and noticed the meter jump by 10 rupees in just 5 seconds even the car was not moving. Checked Uber/ Ola and the fair was only 1/3 the price I have paid. 1000 rupees for a 20 minutes taxi ride? Doesn't make sense. Do also keep small change since some drivers tend to keep the 20-30 rupees change. All in all, Mumbai is a beautiful city with nice locals but just a few bad experience."
High_Street_Phoenix,WanderingXpat,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Mumbai's least awful shopping centre,"Despite the lack of overall planning, the eccentric car parking arrangements and the week-end crowds, this is Mumbai's best shopping experience - though that is not setting the bar very high."

High_Street_Phoenix,stantp1916,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Luxury at its best,"Eye dazzling is what would be the apt description for this mall. You get to see some top notch brands, you may not have even ever heard of. Great to see, but burns a hole in the pocket unless you’re ultra rich. We were happy enough strolling through the floors of the mall without buying anything."
High_Street_Phoenix,Ayan Khan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Best in Mumbai,I would definately rank this one as the best mall of Mumbai. All the expensive and imported brands are available along with the common brands. Best place to visit in South Bombay.
High_Street_Phoenix,prannnn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,Good Brands,"This mall is relatively new but offers a variety of brands and collections for shopping lovers. you can find a variety of items including clothing, entertainment, decorative, cosmetics and even foods and snacks.  In terms of variety, they have a huge collection ranging from Indian/Western outfits, perfumes etc. but some of the items would be slightly pricey. so, keep all your options and explore every shop before making up your decision. The place is so huge that you would probably end up using almost half of the day with your family and friends roaming around in search of your requirements. There is no entry fees and the place is located along the main road and you can reach here via public and private transportation. the nearest railway station - lower parel is also very close by. Additionally, they have ample parking space within their building to accommodate everyone. The best time to visit would be during discount/offer seasons as you would be able to buy stuff at very low prices. Hence in case you happen to be in and around this place, then i would recommend to have a visit to this location."

High_Street_Phoenix,AucklandWiz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Another Mini America In India,"I have seen many malls in many countries and as far as malls go, this is a very nice mall. It has all the well known American brands under one roof. But personally this bores the pants off me. I feel once you have seen them once, that's enough and really this is not where 'normal' people buy their clothes etc., unless you want to be seen in all the right places carrying all the right shopping bags, and wearing all the right clothes. And what I did see was a lot of young women, in western clothing trawling the mall with lots of shopping bags. So great for them. But for us, being tourists with many many trips to the USA, it is monotonous. I would much prefer to see some Indian art, homewares, manchester and department type stores."

It took about 50 minutes due to traffic congestion.We entered via Palladium which is ground floor and 3 other levels, there is also the cinema sector along with Sky Zone and Grand Galleria and a 20 lane bowling alley. The buildings surround a large open air Plazza area, there was an exhibition of colourful statues of elephants, raising awareness of elephant conservation, amazing.This shopping mall is vast, really huge there are around 500 outlets, shops, restaurants, coffee shops and bars.Most of the stores were famous high end International Brand Name stores, similar to any large mall anywhere in the world. There were some very upmarket Indian  Stores as well.In some of the stores we checked out the prices of stuff we would buy in the UK, when compared, some of the items were on a par others were more expensive.It did have the WOW factor as we entered, due to its size and decor, the glass roof could do with a good clean. Not the easiest place to find ones way around. It is possible to browse /shop here for hours - lots of walking. There was constant loud music being played in the main area of the Mall which was in competition with the music in the stores.If passing drop in worth a look, would not make a special effort to get there."

High_Street_Phoenix,Luke-n-LauraB,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Lots of Shops,"We popped into the mall for a break from the travel, had a good wander around and browsed the countless shops.  Lots for everyone, no matter if you are shopping for clothes or toys or anything in between, and also lots of restaurants to choose from too, according to what takes your fancy.  There was also a small number of amusement rides too which was nice."
High_Street_Phoenix,Medagam Praveen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Lively Place for Shopping.,"A Huge shopping mall in Mumbai. It has the most of the world famous brands. They have a different variety of cuisine and food in their food court. Worth to see if want to do shopping without bargaining and walking in the Rushy streets of Mumbai. But definitely nothing like the usual street experience in Mumbai. Mall is awesome but usually Crowded. It's too big as it might take almost one day if you need to visit all stores. Just ignore crowd and move on and enjoy the mall. Live music, fun activities many more events will be going on mostly on weekends. So better visit on weekends.I enjoyed a lot Hereby doing Shopping and Watching Movie in PVR Cinemas."
High_Street_Phoenix,Lily S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Restaurant Runaway Project,The restaurant Runaway Project at Phoenix Mills Parel is probably the worst restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of eating in all my worldly travels as a food critic.The portions are not even enough for a child let alone a grown up person. The prices are extortionate and the service is rubbish. A main course of prawns only 4 on a plate...who are the feeding a cat?This restaurant is not fit to be called a restaurant. It's even worse than a cafe on the roadside.
High_Street_Phoenix,kevin m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Most famous brands,The Mall is huge with a large variety of international brands. There was some sort of sales when we went there and most of the shops were offering attractive discounts. Did most of my shopping at the celio shop. The lady manager was one of the best salesperson we ever came across. Very professional and helpful.
High_Street_Phoenix,Mistymauve1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,"Good space, lively and high-end!","For the elite shopper, this mall is a dream run with the best brands and the most expensive goods. For others, it is a good hangout area with a lot of eateries, lots of space for kids to move around and a general high energy which makes your time there quite lively. A must try is Jamie's pizzeria or one of the many bars/pubs around. A good place to spend a few hours if the malls are your place of choice."
High_Street_Phoenix,kamal_innovaa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Huge Mall,"It has very huge area with bigger showrooms of international brands with PVR.They also have separate play area for kids as well good brands of eatable like M'c Donald's,Fiza, Subway and Dominos Pizza.Also showroom like Croma and Reloence digital.All are very well kept with cleanliness."

High_Street_Phoenix,TheUnderdogChampion,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Something For Everybody,Very good mall - it has a premium section Palladium that has very expensive internationally renowned branded goods for sale. There are also a few big stores that cater to the mass market (middle class). The interiors are very well decorated and the place is very clean and well managed. Toilets are spotless and have no filthy smell whatsoever. There is also a McDonalds that is easily identifying by its large chimney (the place was a mill before). Parking is available. High street Pheonix is frequented by Foreigners and educated people having a good economic background.

High_Street_Phoenix,degrassihigh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Tries its best,"If the aughts was the rise of Indian shopping malls and the footfalls it was to generate, the 2010s was the decline of some (e.g. Mulund Nirmal Lifestyle, now a shell of its former self, and also Thane).  Anyway, High Street Phoenix has survived and thrived and is popular with the masses.  Interestingly, I didn't see any Bollywood stars frequent the malls, nor any Lok Sabha or MLAs or any cricket players.  I did see lots of western brands but hardly any westerners!  Curiously I saw a politically correct family where the mother was white and her kids half-Indian (or Sri Lankan or Pakistani or Bangladeshi) in a store, so that was politically correct.  I also saw a young mother all stressed out (time of the month) with a child in pram yelling ""Excuse Me!!""  Quite uppity if you ask me."

High_Street_Phoenix,prosenjit72,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Wonderful Ambience,Attractive and well decorated shopping place for high end products. We visited the place on 4th January 2018. The interior is awesome and the rest rooms are user friendly. Listening to the gentleman playing Piano at the ground floor was an unique experience. We enjoyed the shopping experience and the walk on the central courtyard afterwards.
