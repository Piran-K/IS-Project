The caves have been designated a `world heritage site'Was wonderful  with just the image proper with the sun shining on top birds giving attention the taj adding beauty and the boat ride adding fun"

Indian_Museum_Ship_Vikrant,ameyajoshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2012 • Friends,Worth a visit,"The IMS Vikrant as it is now called, was the first aircraft carrier of Indian Navy - INS Vikrant and has seen action in 1971 war. It was an ex- UK ship. After serving for decades with Navy, it was retired in 1997 and converted into a meuseum after a lot of public pressure. However till today, a permanant place is not decided on its location. Efforts were made to convert it into a hotel as well, which havent worked.Currently, Navy opens up the ship for visitors time and again but not for longer period of time. You generally need some contact in Navy to get a glimpse.It houses a couple of decommisioned planes, missiles and other naval stuff.ITs a good learning experience and a nice trip in the breezy seas of Mumbai"
