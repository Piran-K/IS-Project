Infiniti_Mall,Uma P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Honest Employee!,"It is extremely gratifying to notice that that Infinity has hired staff, like Ms. Muthulakshmi, who are not only very honest but also bear impeccable integrity & utmost sincerity towards their duty. Such people are a backbone to your organisation. On 15/11/2022 l forgot to collect my brand new watch which l had removed & left in the wash room, which, after an hour or so, was restored to me by Ms. Muthulakshmi, when l came to your Mall searching for it. I am of the opinion that honest employees like Ms. Mithulakshmi deserve encouragement. Thank you!!"
Infiniti_Mall,SanjayPunjabi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,"So yes, go for it. But one experience is sufficient to last a lifetime.","#sanjayrestaurantreviewalert Mainland China, Infinity Mall, MaladMainland China, owned by Anjan Chatterjee‚Äôs Speciality Restaurants Limited (Haka, Hoppipola, Machaan, Sigree Global Grill, Oh! Calcutta, Zoodles, Riyasat, Episode One) is a fine dining Chinese restaurant, and apparently doing a great job of it.This location at Malad Infiniti Mall is a large estate, however, the ambience turned out to be below average. The seating arrangement was cluttered and with an odd layout ‚Äì they seemed to have made a mess of it. Jostles, accidental dropping of fares by the servers, a clunky billing counter in the middle of the area open for everyone to have a gallery view of it ‚Äì not working.Food wise they are good, not offering the absolute premium stuff but not peddling the absolute basic fare either. The Chicken in Roasted Garlic sauce (525) had a nice aromatic air around it, a good number of chicken pieces dunked in a garlicky sauce, not too spicy, just the way I like it. So was the Ginger and Capsicum fried rice (475) with tiny bits of capsicum and ginger juliennes sufficiently spicing up the fare. Overall the meal was light and fluffy, not overwhelming you with its weight, and at the same time delighting your palate.So yes, go for it. But one experience is sufficient to last a lifetime."

Infiniti_Mall,c_saumya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Best reear points among malls..,"Everyone knows about the mall already so I am not writing about that.. what I wanted to write about is it‚Äôs excellent reward program.. they have tue ups with rappo app which can het u points for checking in, purchasing or dining out,. These points accumulate to get u into various status like blue, silver, gold n platinum.. each tire gives u benefits like free parking, movie tickets, shopping assistant etc..I like the best thing about movie tickets.. with gold tier u get 2 movie tickets every quarter while the platinum tier gets 4 tickets every month.. I am not sure whether this is advertised much but it is one of the best programmes in malls where we anyway go shop and spend money.. then why not earn points and get some free movie tickets n parking as well.. but mind you this is good for those people who frequent this mall otherwise no benefits as such..Currently they are running 3x points and its very lucrative..So if u live near this mall or frequently shop from here, go for this benefit.."
