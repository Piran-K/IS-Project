Inorbit_Mall,Cedric N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Family,One of the best malls in India,"Had been to this commercial mall in Malad a long back ago. It is located at New Link Road.This mall is huge and has 3 storeys. It has national & international brands for apparel, fashion and sports. Also, there are other shops selling different types of merchandise. The space is open and huge, so that it is easy for people to roam around. Also, there is a huge food court in which there are restaurants offering a wide range of choice of food. There is a gaming arena for children. Had roamed around in the mall and dined in one of the restaurants as a college student.This mall is an ideal place for families, couples, friends as well as shopoholics."

Inorbit_Mall,Nithin M Agarwal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"One of the oldest malls in the Malad-Borivali belt, owned by Rahejas since 2005!","My Google Review # 000155.One of the oldest malls in the Malad-Borivali belt, owned by the Rahejas and being operated since 2005, I suppose.The mall boasts of an awesome spread around car park and a huge basement parking as well. The parking charges are INR 50 for a full day, which I must say is the cheapest for a premises like this one. The location is a famous landmark and well accessible from Malad Station, Liberty Garden, Goregaon SV Road etc.....actually, almost every where on the Western side.Most of the famous apparel and jewelry brands operate here, along with a food court, game zone and a multiplex. Big list to make a compulsive shopper empty his wallets on almost everything that he can think off, except cars and planes :)My key store visits here are for the WORLD OF TITAN, who sell and service your TITAN watches and SHOPPERS STOP.Date of Experience : December 2019."
Inorbit_Mall,Aryan2007,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Love the overall vibe of Inorbit mall,"Inorbit mall over the years has become extremely popular with folks in Western suburbs.

Inorbit_Mall,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,An ok mall; large but not that impressive,"Inorbit Mall in Malad was one of the first large malls in the Maximum City of Mumbai. The place still stands and boasts of housing many leading brands. However, competition in the form of the nearby Infiniti Mall now sets the benchmark in this area.Inorbit Mall is relatively smaller, though quite spacious. It has a large Lifestyle store, but the central atrium is rather small and not very useful to hold events. The food options are decent, but relatively fewer. One good aspect is the Mindspace garden next door. I also has a Timezone centre for kids to indulge in video games and indoor rides."

Inorbit_Mall,Mital_Ashish,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Nice place.,"This mall has most of the stores I like visiting - Crossword for books, FabIndia for clothes, Godrej Nature's Basket for groceries, Chumbak for beautiful trinkets, and The Body Shop for self-care products. Weekends are a bit crazy but that's the case everywhere. I think the best time to visit is afternoons when things are relatively quiet. They have a food court, a number of restaurants specializing in different cuisines, and a multiplex cinema hall. It's a good place to watch movies that are made for niche audiences and with small budgets, so they rarely make it to single-screen theatres."

,,,,,"Went with kids to watch movies , first day show and back to back at INOX INORBIT MALL. The theatre was amazing as the experience to watch the 3D was amazing. One should visit this place to watch the animation, graphics and details of 3D effect to perfection. When buying soft drink just check , they should not be flat and spoil your zing. Have a nice day with amazing spiderman ( very good movie ) and splashing Aquaman , equally good."
