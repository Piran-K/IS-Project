Jain_Temple_Mumbai,MichaelChew,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,Small Jain temple,"This is a working Jain temple, so one needs to respect their religious customs. No shoes - hence useful to bring some socks - and shoulders and knees need to be covered. We were not allowed to enter the inner sanctuary and could only view from the doors."

They do not allow women on the premises during a certain time in their monthly cycle. One of the five tenets of their beliefs is celibacy, which makes one wonder how they continue."
