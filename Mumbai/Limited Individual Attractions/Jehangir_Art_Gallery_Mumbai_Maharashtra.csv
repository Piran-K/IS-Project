Jehangir_Art_Gallery,Voyage798781,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Modern Art and beyond,A great selection of modern art with many halls exhibiting different art forms from the well known to the lesser known to the budding artists but all beautifully curated to make a good viewing experience. Don't forget to check out the street artists as you step out of the Jehangir. They are on the left and the right as you step out and have some beautiful art adorning the street fencing. I personally prefer to help the unknown artists because these are the voices that go unheard. Some of them have such amazing natural talents but merely due to circumstance are unable to afford the hire of an exhibition space. Please look them up if you get a minute.

Its getting slightly worn out now when you compared to modern galleries. Very conveniently located in the Kala Ghoda area .. you can just walk from CST (albeit long but can walk from Churchgate too). There used to be an amazing restaurant in the gallery earlier called Samovar Cafe.. its closed now. But there are several options to eat around the gallery.

Extremey beautiful display of paintings , very well kept and maintained property , surrounded by natural beauty as well , and overall makes for a great time to spend ! "

It was constructed in 1952 and the entire cost of this mansion was donated by Cowasji Jehangir. It is situated at Kala Ghoda, just behind the Prince of Wales Museum, in South Mumbai near the Gateway of India. They have 4 exhibition halls. Entry is free. They have various artist exhibiting their paintings, sculptures and other works of art here throughout the year. Its an art lovers paradise, though the maintenance is that that good. The location of this art gallery is so awesome that they could have converted this place in to a much better structure for display of art and have facilities for visitors to get educated about art and also relax and have some refreshments.

Aditionally there's no entry fee. Sometimes if you're lucky, you may get to meet the artists. "
Jehangir_Art_Gallery,Nigel G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,Showcasing Art,"This building is subdivided into five galleries all with exhibitions of their artists work on display for several days, and then the space is taken over by another artist or gallery. Some of the work is extraordinary good. There is diversity of medium and I was fascinated recently by an artist that worked solely with copper - his skill was unimaginable. One hall only gave me a bad a experience - one of the staff with rottweiler mentality at anyone who pointed a camera in the direction of their artwork . Small mindedness has no place in art and we should all share what we know. I was a little worried visiting other galleries and decided to break the ice with the artist. Tell them I loved their work and could I take their photo next to it. Flattery will get you everywhere - even a free book from each of the galleries on their art on display. I love this place. The rules on photography are general. If you want to photograph the artworks feel free to chat with the artist and ask. Allow an hour here for all galleries. You have to pay to use the toilet here, but if you can wait the Prince of Wales Museum and the Modern Art Museums both have free toilets - and better cafes. This is well worth a visit. Come relaxed and ready to talk to the artists themselves. Art without appreciation is nothing - I believe in art!"

Paintings, sculptures, photography...there's plenty happening, always. No fee and a breath of fresh air for the mind, in the southern heart of Mumbai city. The toilets, sadly, although chargeable - which is good to keep riffraff out  (at an affordable 2Rs)- really need much better upkeep...or constant cleaning staff (not merely the diligent lady who takes your money for a receipt, at the door!) Sits uncomfortably, with the rest of the beautiful place. Please....do something, if any mgmt is listening. Love the place and have been coming for 40 years, so...hate to see it decline (what with Samovar gone, and everything!)I'd recommend charge higher, but hire a full-time visible janitor!"

Jehangir_Art_Gallery,Anjoos,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,Poor upkeep,"Jehangir art gallery is need of some serious makeover. When your legs tire, there is no place to sit, there is one shabby little shanty for a tea maker, infested with cockroaches. The washrooms have only an Indian loo . Is it coz it is run on charity and with very low costs to put up an exhibition that it remains in such a shape.The art that you see there is brilliant but can we not show se respect for art, by giving it a better medium to express itself."

There were paintings shown in smaller side galleries that were also worthy of note; I'm told that they were typical of work from this region. Although not an expert, I enjoyed the window into another world."
Jehangir_Art_Gallery,barry p,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Couples,Mixture of few great artists and lots of very ordinary not such great art,this is the people's gallery.

Jehangir_Art_Gallery,keshav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,arttour,"my gut feel, a museum and art gallery and a theater in a city tells how deep the culture is. hence Jehangir Art Gallery, with its circular structure, makes more attractive and must visit spot of the city. Its proximity to churchgate railway station is more helpful as every art lover can reach from farthest point of BruhanMumbai, On an entrance you led into a big hall, which is a highlight of the gallery with its display area, I think every artist/photographer will love to exhibit in this main hall, most of year its booked and time table are seen on the notice board, later are other small display areas and it is possible to make showcare art work on Rooftop too. its important to visit all the gallery space with you are family or friends and unwind yourself while seeing the works of various artist, Just on the periphery of the gallery you find an artist avenue with resident artists works on display and sale, meet them talk to them will bring out your sense of art in you..so the effort of the visit never fail to bring a contentment.."

Jehangir_Art_Gallery,travelbug,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,They closed down Cafe Samovar,"We were looking for cafe samovar, a 50 year old historic icon of Bombay when we were visiting from US and were eagerly looking forward to seeing this classic cafe which had been a part of the Jehangir Art Gallery. If you don't know what it is, look up the movie Choti si Baat (Amol Palekar and Vidya Sinha). This is the cafe where Amitabh and Jaya had their first date, not to mention various other legendary facts around it. However the cafe was gone and after some research we found out that the owner of the cafe, Usha Khanna had passed away a year after its closing and that Jehangir Art Gallery had wanted to expand their gallery and were fighting to close this iconic cafe for 3 decades. This is ironic because on one hand the gallery is supposed to preserve a heritage/art and on the other hand they worked to close down a very important part of history. We were not impressed and will never recommend this art gallery to anyone."

Jehangir_Art_Gallery,Deven58,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Not really a good experience,We were looking for some art and were told to go here. The place is incredibly badly managed and dirty! There were some exhibitions but the actual building and its state just put us off. Shame on whoever is managing this facility. Try and be a little more proud of this and update this place to impress. If it gets money then someone is pocketing it. Mumbai is moving forward as a modern city but this place is letting its reputation down big time!

This beautiful place in the prime place in Mumbai, just adjacent to famous Kala Ghoda monument, has lovely halls all air conditioned for display of arts and paintings. Art lovers can leisurely enjoy the paintings and buyers can buy. This art gallery itself has a long history and has heritage value. Just outside on the wide foot paths, people can get their pencil sketch, coal paintings made by artists."
