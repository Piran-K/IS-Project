Jogger_s_Park,Heliana Mano,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Amazing park for both adults and children,"We love joggers park :) it has become better and cleaner! So many tracks to run, jog, walk with an additional mud track. Few statues have been added and always fun for the kids. A new playground for children and ample greenery around. We love visiting the ducks by their pond and just walk around or run in the green areas. Always amazing sunsets by the sea and breeze is lovely during high tides!Super fun place either in the morning or afternoons (it tends to get busy post 6pm...) and any weather is good because even if it rains there is ample places with shade provided to await rain to stop.Absolutely recommend this place for any adult or child."
Jogger_s_Park,Craig A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Running track,"Joggers park is the largest park with a running track in the Bandra/Khar area. Generally well kept, although the running track does become rutted after monsoon and could do with more regular maintenance. The track measures between 360-370 metres according to my Garmin and is a good place for training. Personally I use the track a lot, especially for interval training work. The park is open from early in the morning before sunrise but the running track is not very well lit as the lighting around the track is poorly maintained so a headlamp is helpful. There are free to use working toilets which are ok for public toilets in Mumbai with running water for hand washing. There is also a water fountain for drinking water although whenever I’ve  drunk the water it tastes very highly chlorinated.  "

Jogger_s_Park,wheelchairandeye,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Friends,The laughter club at joggers,"I was invited by the laughter club of Joggers Park to celebrate Holi with flowers which is in a little separate area of Joggers Park. there are two sides to it, on one side there is a very little low step which can be climbed with wheelchair but it would have been great if there was a little ramp it is not difficult to make one there:) and the other side has a little higher step but if its a manual chair it can even get to the park from that side. the celebration was awesome the whole Park was decorated with flowers and the holi was played with the same flowers and little bit of colour to just put the teeka.  the Joggers Park laughter club area has been really maintained well and I guess they are always upgrading the same."

I have cycled to this place and run around its concentric circles in an attempt to keep fit - that too for such a small fee. It gives me access to the ocean without being irritated by hawkers or any miscreants. It has its share of well kept greens and poultry on exhibition and an occasional rabbit keeping away from the cat. It has indeed been a home to so many people trying to beat the city stress. It is an interesting place to observe various types of meditation and forms of belief. All in all it feeds you body and your soul. Thumbs up!"
Jogger_s_Park,Trisha S,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,"Worst side of Mumbai, paid entry, policed by rude men ","Built by a multimillion business conglomerate, this park showcases the worst of Mumbai's situation with moral policing. All benches are purpose built to keep couples or friends or anyone from sitting next to each other. And there are extremely rude men in white uniform, patrolling and loudly reprimanding any signs of skin contact. Particularly, arms on shoulders put them off a lot. But everyone mostly kind of puts up with it. If you like to put up with that kind of stuff, sure its nice enough. There's a view and a half mile running track. And fat men telling you to not sit together."

Jogger_s_Park,khyati_gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Solo,"Calm, serene, well managed with a nice view","My review is divided into two parts1. For the locals: This is an excellent place for a walk/run. One around is around 300 m or so. All walkers/joggers move in one direction so it is very convenient. The jogging track is suitable for the knees and easy vehicle parking nearby. They charge INR 2/- per entry which helps in maintaining the park and yes indeed they have maintained it well.2. For tourists: If you want to see locals in action and a nice view do visit. You will get a nice view of the sea and a very clean and green park. However, I won't suggest you keep it high on priority."

Jogger_s_Park,Neerja Tiwari,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Family,Exercise Away,This paid for place (nominal) that lets you walk in relative peace ( compared to Carter Road) is a boon for people with kids and living around Bandra.Three circular tracks around a landscaped garden afford you the luxury of choosing to walk over gravel or concrete pathway.You might spot some rabbits too.The only downside is the smell of dried fish.Otherwise very scenic spot.

Jogger_s_Park,Zubinhio,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,A place tor refresh your inner mind,"Joggers Park strategically located along the sea coast, will surely be a refreshing location to consider for your daily walk, run, meditation, yoga or nature lovers for star and sea gazing. As we all know oxygen is the key during any physical exercise, this park will bring plenty of it. Its best to visit the park between 7am and 9 am and between 5:300 pm and 9:00 pm. A 2 Rs ticket will not hurt you at all. At times you will have a naval concert performance, ask the park authorities for the same. The Park also holds applauds for its numerous species of botanical plants & trees, maintained extremely well. An exceptional and must visit location in Mumbai for those whoa re avid joggers and who want to spend time to relax."
Jogger_s_Park,AmitChheda,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Family,evening at Jogger's Park,"If you spent an evening at joggers park you will experience a different mumbai. As usual, if its a holiday, one will experience lot of crowd there. A small park, well maintained by the locals staying nearby. Nominal charge of Rs. 5 to 10 is taken as entry fee. No major attraction for Kids."
Jogger_s_Park,Mahesh K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2014 • Solo,"Walk, sprints, exercise, and for the kids","As a spot for exercise, joggers park is great for walks.  The 400m short track (where you can only run in one direction) can get monotonous for runners, although being next to the sea does make the view different each time you run one half :)Joggers park is a great place to pitstop - jog along the promenade on Carter Road, do sprints at the park, and a tidy exercise station nestled in a corner.Young kids to 6 will love the birds, ponds and play area."
Jogger_s_Park,SuhailSayed,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Family,Peace and Pleasure!,"The Jogger's Park has been designed especially for people, who like to jog and walk regularly. It's location is very pleasant and the park is always at peace. There are some birds out there and a place to sit just near the beach, which shows the Arabian Sea. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link is quite visible from here. Although food stuffs and drinks are not allowed inside, a bottle of water can be brought within. A place to energize your body and mind, and you'll really enjoy visiting this park. Plenty of greenery around too!"
