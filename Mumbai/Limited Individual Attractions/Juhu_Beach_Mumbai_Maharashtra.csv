Juhu_Beach,Arun Mani Kanta Gunda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Friends,Nice one,"It was a very long way to reach here by walk after the point where vehicles are not allowed,but it is worth visiting here had nice time "
Juhu_Beach,gaurav4321,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,Good area lacking hygiene..,Crowded and spilled garbages near approach of beach made this lower rating. This is definitely a good place if you reach here by sunrise or sunset time. Only thing you will not like is various food stalls littering items on beach and not getting it cleaned. You can have good food at stalls near road side entry area. Do try local cuisine on that stalls as it is freshly prepared .  Beach is otherwise good.
Juhu_Beach,aarjey,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Good sunset experience,"I am from Delhi and visited this beach in June 2022 with family. This beach is enjoyable during sunset. Despite of muddy sea water and dirty sand, its still enjoyable at the sunset time for some stunning sunset views. I spent two evening in this beach and the thing I noticed is that this beach is going to be vanished in coming years if no action taken. In Delhi, mostly all public places have dustbins and strictness about not throwing the waste here and there. In this beach I found that no one is worried about cleanness. People eating kulfi, gola, bhutta, etc etc.. and throwing gola glasses, kulfi stick, eaten bhutta stick, polythene and all sort of waste anywhere on beach..very sad. Dustbin are very rare only with some food stalls. Every few steps on beach you will strike with a garbage thing. The situation is actually critical but no mumbaikar is worried about it.. as if Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has nothing to do with Mumbai. This beach's future is looking like of Girgaon chowpati where now its impossible to go in water during low tide as the beach is full of garbage. Very said that the city municipality, state bodies all busy with politics, millionaires and stars living in city spend time on foreign  beaches and no one thinks about Amchi Mumbai."
Juhu_Beach,Trav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Solo,Very busy but clean beach,"I visited this beach in the evening and it kept on getting busy by the hour as the sunset started. The beaches are full of local vendors selling all kinds of goods and food items on the beach itself. There are food stalls in a kind of open food court selling local food items at entry. Bigger restaurants are just a walk away on the main road. Chargeable toilet services are present at entry but poorly maintained. Good place to enjoy the evening. Could not see any water sports. The beach appeared clean. Lot of regular walkers and a large number of city people, lead to a huge crowd by sunset. It is a very long beach so you can walk along and find less crowded areas to sit down"

Juhu_Beach,Sandy_JSR,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2020,Lively,"Juhu Beach is the most popular beach in Mumbai among the tourists and locals and hence mostly crowded. It is a long beach and certain sports / fun activities are also available, also seems to be a preferred place for locals for morning & evening jogs / walks. The beach is also known for several street food stalls with a distinctive Mumbai taste like Pav, Bhel, Pani Puri, Kulfi-Faluda etc. While buying anything on the beach, a proper negotiation with the vendor is recommended. The neighboring area of the beach happens to be one of the posh localities in the city, which houses several Bollywood biggies. Several prominent hotels are located at the beach side. Parking could be an issue during peak hours. The place has its own vibe and an ideal place for spending some relaxing and entraining time with family and friends."

A very long beach that is surrounded by iconic hotels and residents of famous cine personalities. No tickets, better to go in the evening. Mumbai is always humid; so avoid the mornings.  The beach is open till late night 11 pm. On weekdays, less crowded. But come holidays and weekends, the place teems with people.It is a favourite place for jogging among locals. If you are lucky, you can spot a celebrity. Water is clean, the beach is far cleaner  than others in Mumbai. Approx 2 hours is enough to cover the important parts of the beach.The waters are safe, and the beach area  too is safe but finish by 8 pm. Lot of eateries dot the beach---Mumbai special flavours like vada pav and pav bhaji are easily the best.  In Mumbai, your itinerary is incomplete without a visit to Juhu beach.  "

Making and cooking wonderful including the famous Pav Bhaji.There are a few places of interest nearby, Gandhi Statue, Mermaid Statue and Chatrapati Shivaji Monument.There are no sunloungers or umbrellas along the beach, not really a holiday beach. Some visitors do come and sit on the sand.The authorities do endeavour to keep the beach clean, including a tractor raking the sand and removing the litter. It is a thankless task as some visitors are reluctant to take their rubbish away or place in the bins.In the evenings there are thousands of people along the beach watching the sunset and enjoying the cool sea breeze, some got into the sea.There are loads of hawkers selling, sweets, snacks, inflated balloons, candy floss and so much more. There were a number of beggars, mainly young children. On evening we were having a sun downer, beer, at the Bay View Bar (Citizen Hotel), a guest gave 2 beggars a large carton of food, which he purchased in the hotel. They looked at it and when the guest left the tossed cartoon and food onto the beach for the crowd to eat, were not that hungry then.One day we walked along the beach and we were surprised the see the amount of rubbish in the sand including condoms."

Fact that it is very long almost 6 kms from Juhu till Versova end, makes it more popular for visitors and tourists. It has everything from eateries to some water sports.

Have seen this iconic beach shrink in size , as well as I've seen the commercial exploitation of the beach. The traditional bhelpuri stalls, are outnumbered with new fast food type of food. Guess, moving with times. Good for the masses. However, this spot can be avoided."

Juhu_Beach,sijick,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Now a cleaner beach,"Juhu beach used to be dirty and not maintained, but things have changed now. It is much cleaner, and we can see tractors moving around most of the litter. The water is dark, due to the fine sand, and one would think twice before entering. The sand area is huge and kids will enjoy playing in the sand, and collecting shells. One should be with kids when they do shell collection, lest they pick up live ones. The food shanties have been converted into formal shops, and are clean and much hygienic now. Pav bhaji, paani puri, kala katta and falooda are the most popular items here. The Shivaji statue is a good selfie point as well. One thing which is not good is lack of parking. There is a paid parking, but space is very limited."
Juhu_Beach,KeshavChakraborty,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Not a good place to visit,This is the most popular among Indians but most dirty also.I would not recommend you to waste your time there except you want to enjoy chowpatty foods and snacks.
Juhu_Beach,shishir,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Dirty beach,Thus is one on the most dirty beach I have ever visited. Not worth going. There are hell lot of people and they ensure they do justice in making it dirty as much as they can. Not sure why commercial shops are allowed to serve food and create so much garbage. 
Juhu_Beach,Esbe2013,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Not really,"It's a small beach. The sand isn't clean. The city's too close. If you're a beachbug and cannot do without one, well, then you could give it a try. But if you're going to Mumbai to see this beach, you might be disappointed. There are speedboat rides, and some street food. But that's about all. There's a police station almost right on the beach, and so it should be safe."
Juhu_Beach,Nomad Govind,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,It is over rated and dirty ,"I recently after a long had been to Juhu beach with family in the night. The place is highly crowded, you can get many things to eat however it is filthy, dirty and not worth. Despite efforts by many to clean the beach, it is back to original condition majorly due to release of sewage by the municipal corporation. We even saw dead body of an animal floating on the beach. Water is dark. Avoid it. "

Juhu_Beach,Pauline Drayton,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Business,Beach?,Don’t visit if you have ever seen a good beach.   Very disappointing.   Rubbish buildings line the beach and no shade or seating to speak of.   This could be made nice with a lot of money spent to clean up the whole area as well as the pollution in the water.  Must be very disappointing for the residents of the area as well as tourists.   I will go back to my Queensland beaches with clear skies and rolling sands.

Juhu_Beach,Etsub N,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,In need of major cleanup,"Coming from a landlocked country, I was excited to see Juhu Beach. But I was disappointed as the place is littered with plastic waste. It needs major clean up that runs throughout the year as more plastic waste is likely to come to the shore."
Juhu_Beach,Mso Mso,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,CONCERNING EXPERIENCE,"Forget everything you know about white sandy beaches. Have in mind a dirty brown beach with water that looks black-ish. Still , some people get in the water so your child might be interested, for that reason carry a change of clothes. There will be photographers scouting for you, and beggars as well. It’s not a relaxing beach, but you will enjoy the boat ride."
Juhu_Beach,SACH S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Attraction of Mumbai,"It is most visited beach.of.mumbai after chopati situated in Juhu area ,the people who goes to Amitab h bacchan house Jalsa they definitely visit to Juhu visit because of very near to His home,it's near by local railway station is santakruj and Bandra station easily taxi and auto available"
Juhu_Beach,Chubb,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Potentially Idyllic but so dirty,"This is a stretch of beach that in any other major city with a climate like Mumbai would be a major draw and super busy.  There were a nice crowd and atmosphere and there are boat rides, etc on offer, so plenty to do.  It is just all so dirty, from the dirty sea water washing onto the beach combined with the multitude of litter on the beach it is all massively disappointing. There are a lot of  'No Litter' signs and similar, the authorities need action, not signs.It seems ironic that during this trip we attended a 150 years of Gandhi and i noticed the quote there:Gandhiji said, “So long as you do not take the broom and the bucket in your hands, you cannot make your towns and cities clean."""
Juhu_Beach,mananmht,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Solo,A great place to start the day with,"Juhu beach is a nice, clean beach, fit for a visit at almost all times. The beach is generally less occupied during mornings and there's a lot of crowd during evening time. Plenty of food stalls selling a great variety of foods. The ice gola is something one wouldn't like to miss. If you're in Mumbai, Juhu beach is certainly a place to visit.However, beware of some coconut water sellers, who at times charge exorbitant prices to tourists and try to fool them."
Juhu_Beach,Deepak,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,Nice place but maintenance to be improved.,One of the major attractions in Mumbai. We reached there after 5 in the evening on a Friday.Evening visits are cool and nice pics can be taken.Sea waters were dirty as usual and beach maintenance was not that good.Family visit for a duration of 2hrs is more enough for this place.

Juhu_Beach,Cedric N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,One of the most popular beaches in Mumbai,"Had been to this beach in Juhu a long back ago. This beach is a popular tourist attraction.This beach is visited by locals as well as tourists. It gets crowded during the weekends and public holidays. This beach has street food stalls selling Bhel Puri, Sev Puri etc. It also has a small ferris wheel and other things to entertain the tourists. It is also famous for film shootings and plane spotting. This beach offers sunset views as well. However, it is filthy and dirty due to tourists littering on the sands. Had enjoyed strolling on the beach and the cool breeze as a school going child.This beach is an ideal place for families, couples as well as friends. It is a must visit and should not be missed."

Juhu_Beach,iwillbetheresoon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019 • Solo,famous beach with long stretch,"Its near to santacruz local railway station. You can get 231 bus number for fare Rs5 from santacruz station to Juhu hotel(10mins ride).Juhu Chowpatty beach was full of garbage scattered all over the place. May be due to recent Ganesh Visarjan. The beach was crying and still people throwing tea cups and left out eatables even there were bins.The clean up drive was going on there. There were garbage trucks, jcb and municipality workers were cleaning the beach tirelessly with removing tonnes of garbage. I hope it gets better day by day and workers gets extra salary bonus for this clean up drive.Overall good place to visit and have a good memorable life time."
