Juhu,Brit07,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Juhu Beach - A Surprise Element,"In earlier years whenever I visited the beach of Juhu, I found it filthy, stinking and dirty. But surprise awaited me when I was there in December 2017. It so reminded me of my childhood days with its cleanliness, stalls in a better shape with hygiene maintained. I had given up visiting the place because of its filthiness but now, would definitely be revisiting often."
Juhu,cool_satchmo,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Crowded and filthy beach,"Juhu beach used to a beautiful stretch of sand in the good old days. It is now overcrowded, especially in the evenings and on the weekend. Also the water is quite polluted and not recommended for swimming. The beach also tends to have a lot of litter strewn all over. Therefore, avoid visiting here"
Juhu,SarfarazSyed,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Couples,"Where land, sea and Sky meets","Juhu beach is much sought after tourists attraction in Mumbai and corporation is doing everything possible to keep it clean.Evenings are pleasant and you may spot a celebrity or two. A walk along the beach is desirable but you may come across filth, stench and garbage as Mumbai throws its rubbish in sea.The place has no. of eateries but be careful as you gotta have strong immunity to withstand the bacteria. Mumbai has learnt to deal with it, seldom you hear falling sick of this food.With all that said, how can you not visit Juhu. This shows you the spirit of Bombay which lets you to be yourself in the maddening crowds, the sound of sea and breeze that lets your imagination fly higher and higher. "

Juhu,percyvakil,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Solo,Residential area by the sea,"Many years ago Juhu was different. Cottages and bungalows by the sea and relatively quiet.Now it's a crowded residential area. There are still a few of the old bungalows, though many have given way to apartment blocks.Juhu has a few good hotels and restaurants in the area and of course the popular Juhu beach (not the ideal swimming beach though). The beach and it's vicinity get very crowded on the weekends."

Juhu,David D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Couples,Great experience,"Have never been to Mumbai, except the airport and that was just to catch our connecting flight home. We were in Goa from 28th October to 30th November, so we arranged a 3 night stop over in Mumbai staying in Emerald Hotel in Juhu. We chose this because of a recommendation and it was close to the airport.The hotel was comfortable and friendly and we enjoyed our stay, the staff were helpful and friendly.We were a bit nervous about everything but decided to  regard this as an adventure.  We had no problem getting a taxi from the airport to Juhu, just before the exit of the terminal there is a prepaid taxi booth, where you order and pay for your cab. Our fare to Juhu was RS240  (£2.40) this was in a cool cab, which are air conditioned. Our journey time took about 20 minutes.On approaching Juhu our initial impressions and thoughts were what have we let ourselves in for here. However, thankfully this was short lived, once we checked into our hotel, The Emerald,  it was  about 4.30 in the afternoon  so we went out exploring. The first port of call was the beach which was a hive of activity  (reviewed separately) with its famous street food stalls.We also discovered the Beach Side Patio Bar/Citizen Hotel - also reviewed. Within 5 minutes walk of the hotel there are 2 Pharmacys,  virtually across the road,  an off licence and money exchange. Get a better rate of exchange at the bureau rather than in the hotel.The next morning we picked up a taxi outside the hotel which took us to Mumbai, journey time can vary due to  traffic, it took us about 1 hour and 20 minutes, we used the Bandra Worli Sea Link, toll road, it saved a lot of time and is worth a visit. We had had the taxi all day for an agreed rate of RS1,600 including the toll, the taxi man was so good we gave him RS2,000  (£20). We had a full day in Mumbai sight seeing including a visit to Elephanta Island/Caves.That evening we had a sundowner at the Patio Beach Bar and had dinner in the Aroma Restaurant  (reviewed) just down the road from hotel.The next morning we took a tuk tuk from outside the hotel to Santa Cruz - RS50  (50p), had a wander around and then caught the train to Mumbai. This was a journey time of about 45 minutes and normal fare was RS10 or 1st class RS110  (£1.10). It was a real adventure. We caught the train back to Santa Cruz and another tuk tuk back to the hotel. Sundowner at the Patio Bar and dinner again at Aroma.The next morning we had to check out and head for the airport and then home. We picked up a taxi outside of the hotel, it was the same guy that took us to Mumbai the other day, the fare to the Airport was RS450, roughly.Despite our initial worries and fears we really enjoyed our stay in Juhu, there is more to do than our first impressions. It is very handy for the airport, not too far from Mumbai, about 35 Kilometres, and plenty of taxis and tuk tuk to get you where you want to go. We enjoyed so much we have already arranged to stay here again in March 2016, on our way home again from Goa. Can't give a better recommendation than that, looking forward to going back."
