If you ever wondered what a cross between Dilli Haat, Delhi and Ingo's Saturday Night Bazaar, Goa would feel like then the Kala Ghoda festival is the place to come to. Usually hosted in the second week of Febrary, this festival is the time when the entire art fraternity of Mumbai comes alive. Spread over the entire city centre of downtown Mumbai, you can expect to find a lot of things happening all at once in various venues including movies, workshops, music, art, food, etc. The principal venue being the Kala Ghoda Art Precinct itself. The festival itself is held on a road, which is blocked off for this very express purpose annually. This year was all about being the environment, recycling and eco friendliness and sustainable development and yes - quit smoking. There were enough and more quirky installations like trees made of bicycle rims, strips of fabric; knights and wild animals fabricated from scrap metal, etc. You can expect the venue to be choc-a-block full at all times so be prepared to jostle for space with selfie clicking Mumbaikars and you'll be lucky to get a clear shot of the art work."

It is like a mini exhibition cum sale gallery with artisans and entrepreneurs from across the country.  But if you are hunting for goodies and bargains; then this is not the venue. Some stuff is really good; some expensive, quiet expensive.A few are unique and creative; but honestly I did not find any VFM. Maybe , I am not as mush arty and philanthropic. Yes the motto and cause is that one. A selfies paradise. we found almost most crowd huddling up and vying for selfies and photographs.Some local restauranteurs, some pheri wals dis vend nice delicacies."
