Kamala_Nehru_Park,AceRoadie,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Good park with scenic view over queen necklace (Marine Drive),Mumbai is short of open space and among available open park it has to make it most of it. It is loacted in the posh area of Mumbai Malabar Hills. This is among the most visited place by tourist and is one of key attractions for Mumbai Darshan (Mumbai local tour). A well maintained park with walk area and kids playstation (Kompan playstation). It has open rain dance shower for kids (though may not be operational many times). Amphitheatre for short play by kids. Amazing scenic view over marine drive. Its on our list for periodic visit and kids enjoy a lot. Good thing is it is part of cluster of garden 'Hanging Garden' so have ample of green open space around. In short Hanging Garden or Kamla Nehru park is one and same for us.

Kamala_Nehru_Park,Shatakshi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Kamla Nehru Park/Hanging Garden,Recently I have been searching some place to visit with my family in Mumbai . Since I was done with all famous places so was looking for something left unexplored.So decided to check out Kamla Nehru Park and Hanging Garden at Malabar Hills. I was knowing about this place but wasn't sure if its that worth a visit.HOW TO REACH-I travelled Kamla Nehru Park from Malad. The nearest station for Hanging garden is charni road. From there we hired the taxi which costed around 60 Rs. Taxi will drop exactly at the gate of the Garden.It took us one hour to reach Charni road from Malad west.And then another 30 mins from station to Hanging Garden.Right in front of the Hanging Garden we have Kamla nehru park with famous Boot house. Which is pretty interesting I must say but only kids below 12 years are allowed to enter into the house..which is sad :(

This garden is part of the Hanging Gardens.This garden is one of Mumbai's premier gardens. It has many plants, trees and lush greenery. It also has abacus railings. This garden has a view point that offers sunset views and a panoramic view of Marine Drive and Arabian Sea. The main attraction of this garden is the Old Woman's Shoe which is very popular for children to climb the shoe. It also serves as a picnic spot for children. Had enjoyed and roamed around in this garden as a school going child during the Mumbai Darshan trip.This garden is an ideal place for families, couples, senior citizens, children as well as friends."

Kamala_Nehru_Park,Nigel G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Business,Splendid views of Mumbai ,Kamala Nehru Park offers outstanding views over the city of Mumbai and especially the expansive Chowpatty Beach below. It is always a welcome place to take a stroll.There are several viewing vistas which look over the city at different angles. Two children’s play areas - one the usual sort whilst the other is in the form of a massive boot that they can climb inside and pop out and the top. Good examples of Indian flora - not exactly sure what some plants are but others quite colourful such as the sunflowers. If you are visiting Mumbai for the first time and want a panoramic birds eye view or you are simply looking for somewhere to take a stroll this is for you. 
Kamala_Nehru_Park,G A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Solo,Nicely Maintained,"The Kamla Nehru Garden is better known for its Giant Shoe or rather giant boot.  When I was a kid some decades ago, it would be a treat to be brought here to see the giant shoe.  In those days there were hardly any gardens to speak of in Bombay (as it was known then).  I went there this morning for a short while as I had time to pass in the area.  The shoe has been renovated and repainted, but still looks quaint.Tourist buses always stop here for visitors to see this garden and the Hanging Gardens opposite.  From the KN garden, you can get a nice view of the Queens Necklace   of Marine Drive, passing the Girgaum Chowpatty beach, going all the way to Colaba.  There is also a higher viewing platform just next to the KN garden.The pathways are nicely laid out with a couple of pergolas and benches, several lawn areas and lots of trees and shrubs.  I was delighted to see the fairly rare Aristolochia grandiflora vine in full bloom.    This is the Dutchman's Pipe or Bathak Phool in common parlance.   There is a nice new Jungle Book themed wall painting which looks rather cute.I wouldn't say that the KN or the Hanging Gardens are a must see for a tourist, but if you are in the area its a nice place to spend some time.  Very popular obviously with the neighbourhood residents,with adequate play areas for kids.It's getting warmer these days and a hat helps!"

Kamala_Nehru_Park,savio_pinto12,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Couples,Old Lady's Shoe,"It serves as a great picnic spot named after Jawaharlal Nehru's wife, Kamala Nehru.Since it is on top of a hill the temperature is quite humid comparatively.Located at Malabar Hill and is easily accessible to this place by means of public transport closest railway station being Chirni Road.The park is quite famous for its Boot House or more commonly know as the Old Lady's Shoe and has been the point of attractions for kids.Apart from this there is no major attractions to this place.Yes if you decide to stay over untill sunset you can enjoy the spectacular view of the city and also you can overlook the Girgaon Chowpatty Beach along with Marine Drive or the Queens Necklace from here as well.Lastly there is lush of greenary here where you can just sit and relax with the nature."
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Rit_Ram,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Family,Avoid unless your kid is eager to see shoe house,When we went the show house was closed and non functional. Not sure whether it is  usually like this . nothing else apart from this . one view point is also there . 
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Veenago,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Friends,Walk in a lovely garden,"I had meant to visit this garden on earlier visits (I used to live in Bombay in the past) and finally made it for an all-too-brief visit this time. The main garden is large, well maintained and beautiful, with colourful flowerbeds and a couple of fountains. There were people walking around but it was not too crowded. In a dense and overcrowded city this garden comes as a refreshing delight, especially as it is on a hill and all you see is the sky, tops of some skyscrapers in a distance and you can look down on the city from some points. There's a feeling of getting away for sure. There's a lovely night view of the Marine drive. Definitely worth a visit."
Kamala_Nehru_Park,KhalidNavigator,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Friends,Average park with hardly anything to offer,Visit only if you have ample time. This place is an average park. The view is reasonable and there is nothing out of the ordinary.

Kamala_Nehru_Park,Avinash,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,A green garden in south Mumbai,It is a place one can visit when in South Mumbai. It offers a panoramic view of Chowpaty and Marine Drive. There is a shoe shaped structure in the park and kids can climb the shoe using staircase. One can also visit Hanging garden and Priyadarshini park that are near by. Timing for this place is 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Richard_in_England,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,A people’s park with a giant shoe,"Kamala Nehru Park is just across the road from the more ‘famous’ hanging garden.  It is much more welcoming with a huge shoe structure that the children can climb up into.There are several lawns and plenty of shady stopping places you can sit and unwind.  Down one end there is a fenced off children’s playground with plenty of apparatus to play on.From the opposite side to the  road you can look down over Chowpatty beach and Marine Drive.My Tip: You can get a cup of Chia, snack or taxi from just outside the park"

Kamala_Nehru_Park,Aartichand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Family,Sweet spot,"The Kamala Nehru park is a quiet little garden with a giant shoe. The shoe is popular with children as they enjoy climbing in it. The garden itself is quiet, shady and has a superb view of the queens necklace from a height.It is a perfect little spot to take a breather on a sunny afternoon."

Kamala_Nehru_Park,ushabanerji,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015,Old time favourite,The Kamala Nehru Park has been an iconic landmark of Bombay. Now there are other attractions in the city for visitors but this still remains a place to visit for its topiary garden pf various animal shapes and view of Marine Drive and beyond. It is a favourite with morning and evening walkers who have bonded over the years as 'walking friends'
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Balram Sharma,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Couples,some greenery in such a vast city,suprised to know that this whole area was fitted with water tanks to collect rain water for city's usages then these tanks were covered with mud to form ground then a garden and it became hanging gardeen as it is hanging on water tanks and finally bacame kamala nehru park.
Kamala_Nehru_Park,JBuckel,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Family,A park with a view,In addition to some nice vegetation this park provides a panoramic view of Marine Drive and Chowpatty Beach. Kids enjoy the Woman Who Lived in a Shoe structure.
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Billythefish1,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Couples,Plenty to do and see and great for kids,Just over from Hanging gardens a very popular place for tourists and locals. Play area for kids and lots of street cafes and sellers of everything you don't need. Got the shoe shine whilst waiting for our taxi. Great job and only 50p
Kamala_Nehru_Park,shivurmi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015,Nice park,"We used to visit this park,in our childhood, so this time, when i was in Mumbai, i made it a  point  to go there, I felt nostalgic.I was happy that , even after so many years , it is maintained well."
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Ram H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015,Best Place to View Sunrise,"This is one of the twin parks on top of malabar hill (The Hanging Gardens or Ferozshah Mehta garden is across the road). This one scores over the Hanging gardens because the view of the city is more expansive and wider especially beautiful is the chowpatty bay area and the view of south mumbai. In olden days before the skyscrapers dotted the skyline one could even see the tops of the cranes in the docks on the eastern coast. A early morning visit to view the sunrise is a must. This park is better than hanging gardens as it doesn't have  too many walkways for joggers or regular walkers. The main attraction for children (and for me too when i visitied as a child) has been the ""Old maids shoe"" or the ""Old Ladys shoe"" a concrete model of a shoe which children could enter inside."
Kamala_Nehru_Park,DilrukshiH,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Couples,A nice park.,"It was great walking in the Kamala Nehru park with our tour Guide Mrs Lakshmi Kishore.She made the tour interesting with her knowledge & humour, which made us relaxed after a tiring tour of the city due to the heat.Unfortunately there were not much flowers as this is not the season.There were shapes of animals made with plants, but the place looked neglected.Lots of elderly people were relaxing & having a great time.Visit  this place if you can find the time."
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Enthusiastraveller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 • Solo,Picnic Time!,"This garden is just opposite to the hanging gardens and is also a very good place to hangout, relax and go for a picnic. Its also very nicely maintained with adequate lighting as well. The garden is hardly 10 mins walk from the Babulnath mandir and the nearest railway station is charni road."
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Tejram N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015,Peace between Noise,"very peaceful area in the heart of busy city. After the noise and traffic pollution of the Mumbai, you will feel releaved from all such tension. One side it has beautiful sea view. you will love to see it. "
Kamala_Nehru_Park,jojo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 • Family,Beautiful Park,"Made in 1952,Kamla Nehru,wife of P.Jawaharlal Nehru the park has characterized by old woman shoe. This is  well maintained  park with beautiful garden and  scenery  from the top of Malabar Hill"
Kamala_Nehru_Park,allspice502016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Couples,Lovely Terraced Gardens,"We enjoyed our stroll through Kamala Nehru Park, the terraced gardens are lovely and well maintained. The Hanging  Gardens which is across the road was somewhat disappointing. From Nehru Park one has panoramic views of the city (through the smog!), and of Marine Drive which is a 3km long, six lane road which stretches north along the coastline, forming a natural bay. Also referred to as the 'Queen's necklace', because the street lights make the road look like a string of pearls."
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Kamshab,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Kamshab,"I was disappointed to see that animals made out of trimming hedges were not recognisable due to poor maintenance. Hope that after monsoon, they are maintained properly as it is a big hit with children."

Kamala_Nehru_Park,HEMANT SINGH NEGI,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014,Niice Picnic Spot,A good place to visit within the city of Mumbai. The view from the Hanging Garden adjacent to the Kamla Nehru Park is awesome as one can view the Girgaum Chowpatty from here. The Necklace road also looks very beautiful especially when it starts turning dark and lights come upon.
Kamala_Nehru_Park,Ravindra V,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Couples,Nice views,Located just opposite to hanging gardens. You can get really great views of Mumbai City. Situated on the top of posh Malabar Hills. Great place for photographs.
