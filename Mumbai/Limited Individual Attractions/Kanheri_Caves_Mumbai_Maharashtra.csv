Kanheri_Caves,Juliette Z,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023 • Couples,"Beautiful, inspiring, ancient Buddhist caves (find Pawan for tour)","We had the most AMAZING morning at Kanheri Caves. We took Uber both ways from Mumbai (worked really well) & rented bikes for the road up to the base of the caves. Just after the entrance to the caves we met a security guard named Pawan. He has worked at Kanheri for 20 years and is super knowledgeable about the caves’ history, explaining how the caves were used, pointing out Pali script & explaining different buddhas & carved figures. He really was fantastic and we highly recommend him. Again, he is not a guide, but a security guard who has made it his personal mission to learn and teach about these extraordinary caves.As there is no tree cover around the mountain caves, it’s best to visit in the AM. We arrived at park ~8:15 & got to the cave trail base as it opened at 9am (closed on Mondays)."
Kanheri_Caves,BalkrishnaShroff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Amazing !!,"Kanheri Caves are located within Sanjay Gandhi National Park about 6 km from main gate. Kanheri word is derived from Sanskrit word Krishnagiri which means 'Black Mountain'. There are about 109 caves and about 2000 years old. It used to be Buddhist Monastery where people used to study, worship and meditate. It has got many Buddha statues , sculptures and paintings beside many streams and waterfall. If you like history and culture then this is THE place for you. Worth seeing..."
Kanheri_Caves,JourneyToParadise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Worth it,"Definitely worth it. Wear good shoes and be ready to walk but great seeing both the park, the monkies, and the caves"
Kanheri_Caves,Peter H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Friends,Certainly worth a visit,"This is an amazing attraction but difficult in hot weather. One of our group walked (nearly) to the top, but the rest of us settled for seeing about 30 of the caves.You certainly need to take the shuttle bus (very cheap) as it is about 5km from the entrance to the caves."
Kanheri_Caves,NZBLR,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Average Place,"Good place, its inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park, once you purchase a ticket for the national park & go inside you have an option to board a bus or travel in an OMNI car, (private cars are not allowed beyond ticket counter), the bus fare is Rs 20 per head, the omni fare depends on the clothes you are wearing ;-) might range from Rs 100 per person to Rs 500 depending on how rich or poor you are looking, the distance is covered in 20 mins, don't attempt to walk unless you are super fit. The caves have a separate ticket counter & that closes by 5 PM, ensure that you reach before that & the last return bus is at 6:15 PM, if you miss that then you are again at the mercy of the OMNI cab drivers who can demand any amount they wish, from the bus to the caves there are 120 odd steps to climb, the entire place needs at least 3 hours to cover, its not too good or bad, can be visited if you have day at leisure."
Kanheri_Caves,Venkatesh P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,Its a blessing to visit this place,2300-year-old meditation centre.  More than 100 caves are carved out of a single mountain. Midst of a forest. You get to relax totally...without you getting noticed.
Kanheri_Caves,D M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2021,Ancient place; aggressive monkeys,Unique historical site steeped in ancient Indian culture. Watch out for monkeys and make sure to bring water with you.
Kanheri_Caves,AparnaSharma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2021,Incredibly beautiful !!! Most glorious experience !,"Despite having lived in Mumbai all my life, I had never ever visited Kanheri Caves. It took a few European friends of mine who were on their very first visit to India who got a strong recommendation for Kanheri Caves from a German tourist to have me explore the idea.  Nestled in Borivali East is a world that seems unexplored, untouched. Blanketed in green, enveloped on all sides by Mother Nature, these caves are perhaps the most untouched part of this crazy chaotic city of Mumbai. You'll find it difficult to believe that we five were the ONLY tourists in this entire Kanheri zone. These Buddhist caves are archaeological heritage monuments dating back to the period between 1st&10th century AD. A total of 110 caves including some that are inaccessible have the most aweinspiring carvings, frescoes & ancient paintings & engravings that one can ever imagine. The access to these caves is from brilliantly maintained stairways that are as ancient as the caves themselves. The acoustics of some of the caves are phenomenal with perfect echoing that lends a mystic aura to the site. One of the security guards offered to share his knowledge about the caves, precious information on their history, especially the different mudras of the Buddhist statues & the various components of the sculptures.Make it a point to visit the topmost point which is a table-top part of the hillock.Impossible to believe that such a serene verdant slice of land is a part of the cacophonic city of Mumbai."

Kanheri_Caves,Melsy1,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Business,Cool caves,Really enjoyed my visit here. I spent around 2-3 hours here. (This included spending time watching the monkeys near the car park)There's lots of caves. Suggest taking a photo of the plan as you walk in so you can refer back to it as you walk round. Some of the caves are much and much alike but there's some stunning caves as you walk round. These have amazing images of buddah carved into  the stone and large Pillars. It's set on a hillside and will involve lots of steps. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes. Suggest having plenty of water with you. At the top there's a good view across the national park. 
Kanheri_Caves,markb120,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Unique,"If you decide between the Elefanta Caves and Kanheru Caves, I would recommend you the last ones. Great very interesting historic and religious site."
Kanheri_Caves,ACharlotte19,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great Half-day activity!,"I loved going to see the Kanheri caves while I was in Mumbai.  It's amazing to see the way that they carved the caves into the side of the cliffs.  I decided to go on my own & do the biking trip, but I didn't get a ton of the history while I was there.  I would recommend getting a tour guide to go with you, because it's clear this place is full of fascinating information!"
Kanheri_Caves,Meg,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Great mix of Greenery and History,"it is located in SGNP in Borivali. Easily accessible through Buses and Rickshaws. It is about 5-6 kms from the main gate and you can either take your own vehicle or local govt. bus. There about 107 clusters of caves of various sizes. They have different formats where some are plane square rooms with gates and then there are some with elaborate sculptures. Govt has tried to get the caves to be in best shape as much as it can. If you climb high enough , you'll get birds eye view of the city."
Kanheri_Caves,abhuts,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Divine Experience,Its a Heaven in the city. An uphill climb which takes you to the top most point of mumbai giving a spectacular view of the city high rise along with the forest. Sitting in the beautiful caves built centuries back still gives you a divine experience away from the mad rush of everyday city life.  A trip atleast twice a month is a must to get fresh pure oxygen for the mind and soul.
Kanheri_Caves,Ashvin S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Excellent historical site of Budhist Statues,I visited by car. You enter from the gate of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and drive 6km inside to reach the caves. There is adequate parking inside. There are several caves and you have to climb steps to reach all the caves. Some of the caves have statues and there is one cave which contains two large statues of Budha. If you like historical sites then you will enjoy the visit. I use a walking stick and I held the rails to climb the steps. There is a small cafe which sells sodas and some snacks. Be careful of the monkeys who snatched my bag of crisps and soda as soon as I placed them on the table!
Kanheri_Caves,Sourabh D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Can't miss it for anything,"Kanheri caves in Sanjay Gandhi National park is a hidden gem; within the city limits of Mumbai. Extraordinary vegetation and clean environment. There are many activities (Lion/Tiger Safaris, Forest trails, Toy train etc etc.) that one could do here. However a day may not be enough if you want to do all. So prioritize.One could take a car or rent a bike inside the entrance gate. There have been some recent rate hikes, but they all seem reasonable, looking at the improved upkeep and cleanliness of the place and also a lot of new infrastructure being put in.1.	Kanheri caves reside in midst of this vast forest. You need a separate ticket for this at nominal cost. The caves are much more cleaner now and securely locked up during off hours. There are new railings put in and a new complex coming up with public utilities and cafeteria etc.2.	It is wise to be there early to beat the sun and heat. Carry water a snacks along. Wear comfortable sports shoes and clothes.3.	It would be always a good idea to read up a bit about the caves and make a few notes before; like we did. This will make things easier to spot and one would not roam about aimlessly. Afterall there are 109 caves scattered over a wide area. The caves otherwise look the same, so its best to know the background and nuances a bit.4.	The caves are largely ‘Viharas” (Buddhist Monastery) and are stone cut, more than 2200 years old. The rocks are black basaltic.5.	Caves 1, 2, 3 (Chaitya hall with a large stupa, similar to Karla caves but smaller), 4 are notably the most talked about and interesting. So are 5 and 6 (Water cistern),  11 (Darbar hall),  34 (has an unfinished paining of Buddha on the ceiling), 41, 67, 81, 90. Cave 41 has a unique sculpture of Buddha with several small heads over the main head.6.	You will find inscriptions at various places in 3 different ancient scripts: Brahmi, Devanagari and Pahlavi.7.	Once you are done with the caves, don’t forget to climb on the topmost part of the caves to take a panoramic view of the forest and farther into the city, almost upto Powai. Beautiful sight.8.	On the way back, there is a small canteen for cold drinks and snacks. Further down you have fruit shops too. Beware of the monkeys who are all to eager to partake your food.Highly recommended trek anytime of the year but mostly winter months or early morning in summers. Monsoons are also great if you are careful and avoid slippery tracks."
Kanheri_Caves,Deepak Mallyk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Good picnic spot,"Located amidst thick forest, this place is a good picnic spot in Mumbai and a good place to spend your day (entire day). The caves are vast and portray the craftsmanship of those of made them. On reaching the top spot near the caves, you would be surprised to see the natural treasure Mumbai possesses. If you don't have a personal car, you can also take an Ola or Uber inside the forest to the caves. The local cars operating at the gate are not recommended and are expensive."
Kanheri_Caves,manoj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,it is great place,"-It is best to come early in the morning if you want to beat the crowds -If you are travelling in the summer months, do not forget a proper hat and sunscreen -Beware of the monkeys that sit along the entrance walls and might snatch food if you are carrying it in your hands -Wear comfortable shoes and avoid wearing heels or beach slippers -If you are travelling during the winter months, do not forget a raincoat -There is a restaurant at the top where you can buy food and water -There is a small entry fee that you have to pay in order to enter the cave complex-Although there are no strict rules but it is a place of great religious importance for the Buddhists and therefore the sanctity of the place must be maintained at all times"
Kanheri_Caves,Sandy J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Worth the trip,"If you aren't seeing any other Buddhist caves while in India, it is worth a trip to visit these.  They just give a hint of how glorious the ones at Ellora or Elephant Island are, but, that is worth it.  The Park is also interesting and nice to see so many people out and enjoying it.  "
Kanheri_Caves,Maresa G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,The Green Lung of Mumbai,"This was a well-worth it 5 hour trip away from the hustle and bustle of polluted, noisy Mumbai central, when we had some time to spare while waiting for a late night flight out to Hyderabad.I was determined to use the local metro and train services since experiencing the daily gridlocked traffic while being in Mumbai for the past few days.And we proved how cheaply one can actually travel here with the very reliable and efficient local transport services provided.  Our hotel was fortunately situated close to the Airport Station metro, and for INR40 we went to the Andheri Station.  From there we caught the local train for INR20 to Boliwari station.From there we took a tuk tuk for INR60 to the entrance of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park.Entrance fees at the gate is INR 64 each.We opted to walk the 7km to the entrance to the caves, a long languid stroll in the heat, which took us about 1.5 hrs.  It is a welcome relief to be away from the city traffic noise, and to just hear the occasional bird or the rustle of a deer or a few monkeys.The city is still pretty close by, as one can still see buildings to the right of your pathway much of the walk towards the caves, and the air still hangs heavily with city pollution, but it is a mild breath of fresh(er) air here in the ""lung of Mumbai"".The walk becomes slightly more uphill closer to the entrance to the caves, but not exceptionally steep.The entrance fee to the caves is INR300 for foreigners.These 3rd century Buddhist caves are quite a marvel as the over 100 caves are carved out of a single rock. There is also evidence of the earliest rain-water harvesting system they had going in that era.There is a fair bit of climbing up and down stairs for a few hours, and one has a panaromic view of Mumbai's smoggy skyline once at the top.We took the bus back down to the entrance (for INR20) which was fortunately full when we got to it, so we could leave fairly immediately.We went back via local transport the same way we came.A most pleasant day trip to ""clear"" the mind from daily Mumbai madness!! "
Kanheri_Caves,Sheethal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Interesting and well kept,I loved my trip to the caves! If you're like me and like doing some physical activity for nice views you'll like this too. Pretty caves on one side and panoramic views of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park on the other side. There are a total of 109 caves here with 5-6 more important caves (didn't get to go to all of these caves but they tend to be bigger or have more inscriptions). Recommended to set aside around 2-3 hours if you're planning to see all 109 caves (excluding the time required to travel here).
Kanheri_Caves,Megamagelen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Solo,Historical place in the heart of a green park in Mumbai,"A nice escape from the city, I took Uber and paid park entrance 300 rupees .You can walk in the park to the caves about 7 k if you prefer.Entrance fee to the caves  for foreigners is 300 rupees.There are 109 caves, but nobody give you a map, so just explore the place.The architectures is amazing, very impressive.There were only 2 tourists and the rest were locals.The place is about 1.5 km walk."
Kanheri_Caves,NANANDSHAH,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends, Historic treasure with beautiful sculptures ,This indeed was a historic marvel.. absolutely beautiful caves dating back to the 1st century .. shows how good Indians were at art and planning. Its better to wear trekking shoes as it does involve a lit of climbing.. do check out all caves and some have intricate art work..
Kanheri_Caves,Aadhes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Forest caves with ancient history.,We went here on Invitation it is a nice place to visit in the evening. There are many caves there with statues and murals. All these have lots of history date back to hundreds of years. I am told that wild animals roam in the late evening.
Kanheri_Caves,Jeff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Visit to the famous Kanheri caves,"Most of you would agree with me when I say  that Mumbai has the ingredients for a hill station as well as a tourist place. It has greenery, sea shores and urban jungle. But other than a commercial center, Mumbai is never considered as a hill station. But if you want to feel like you are in a hill station, then you must visit Kanheri Caves. I know it has been around Mumbai for a really long time, but we never bother to visit it and some of us would not have even heard of it. So if you do hear about it, then plan to visit it and make it happen. I don't have the exact knowledge of how the caves were built and when it happened, but you can get all that information from the local guides over there. The entry to the caves is ₹25 (for Indian Citizens) and ₹300(for foreign nationals). The journey from the bottom to top is a good 1 hour trek, although there are steps to make life easier. For those who are not prepared to hike or those who are lazy, the walk to the top may be a bit tiring. But once you get to the top, the view is amazing. You get a nice panoramic view of the greenery of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park which spans over a wide expanse. If it is isn't quite sunny then it is quite pleasant at the top. Weekends may be a bit crowded, but the crowd is generally concentrated at the lower levels, after that it gets filtered. Its a good half a day outing for a family and a must visit if you are a localite, because we often ignore the things that are most closer and obvious to us. "
Kanheri_Caves,Charley44,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"1,000 years of Buddhist history in Mumbai","The 100+ caves were a Buddhist monastery carved out of basalt rock more than 1,000 years ago.  The caves are located in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, located in the northern part of Mumbai.  Considerable climbing over rock is required to visit the site.  Proper shoes are necessary.  Not accessible to those requiring mobility assistance (wheelchairs, crutches, walkers).  A local guide isn't essential, but would be very helpful."
Kanheri_Caves,sactokw,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,"Buddhist caves, good to see","Hired a driver who drove us to Sanjay Gandhi park and to Kanheri Caves entrance; there are entrance fees for both. There were >100 caves or rooms formed by caves of varying sizes with interesting Buddhist carvings. Wear athletic shoes as there are some rocky stairs to climb of varying sizes and shapes, so beware of footing. Not wheelchair accessible. Duration of visit is 1-2 hours."
Kanheri_Caves,Soumyajit Saha,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Kanheri Caves,Kanheri Caves is located in Mumbai in Maharastra in India. Here one will find many ancient caves of Buddhist era.
Kanheri_Caves,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Buddhist cave temples,"The Kanheri Caves are Buddhist cave temples and fine examples of the rock-cut architecture of India. Most of the caves are relatively simple and largely undecorated. The main exceptions are caves 1 to 4, which are all near the entrance. Cave 3 is the Chaitya and probably the most impressive of all the cave temples as it has a pillared hall with a stupa at the end of the hall. All the pillars have richly decorated capitals depicting scenes featuring elephants.Cave no. 11 is also worth visiting and spending some time as it’s the Darbar Hall. Although the hall is simple, it is one of the few examples of ancient Buddhist Darbar halls and shows how the congregation would’ve assembled.Most of the remainder of the temples are very simple one room caves with no decorations.Overall, the temples are simple compared to the Elephanta Caves. It’s worth visiting for see earlier examples of Buddhist rock-cut temples and trace the evolution of the architecture prior to Elephanta. The views from high up on the hills of the surrounding area are fantastic and you can also just about see metropolitan MumbaiFor the more adventurous, you can visit the temples using local transport by getting a train to Borivali Railway Station, walk 15 minutes to the entrance of Sanjay Gandhi National Park, then the 188 bus from inside the park for the 15 minute bus ride to the foothills of the caves."
Kanheri_Caves,KANCHANA NANAYAKKARA,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Must visit in Mumbai.,"These caves are located in Sanjay Gandhi National park in Mumbai. A perfect place to get away from Mumbai's dusty & hectic environment. The trip can be done with in a day and by public transport too.(read for tips below)Caves & surrounding were breathtaking and it says they were once buddhist monastery. There are 109 caves and the area is vast & rocky. It is advisable to visit as early as possible as by noon rocks can be very hot. wear some comfortable clothes & shoes!How to get there & Tips - # We took the Mumbai local train from Churchgate station to Borivali. # We got one day tourist pass on Mumbai local trains - (Ask for First class Fast train pass INR 275 as of Nov.2019) Local trains are with 12-15 coaches & first class portion is marked by red stripes & No-1 and on platforms as well.# From Borivali station exit to east side & we got a trishaw (tuk-tuk) to the National park entrance. (INR 50 something only) # At the park entrance you need to pay for the park but this is not for caves. * Do not declare your cameras or pay for Camera there unless you are planning to do activities in the national park. * This is a rip off! # Once entered, proceed & ask for Kanheri caves Bus. (mostly red colour old bus parked close to the entrance of the park) Ride is INR 10 & 5km to go. # You will pay again at caves entrance for entry ticket (Foreign - INR 300) & there you can get a pass for camera costing INR 25."
Kanheri_Caves,Rajagopalan R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Kanheri Caves,There is an option to cycle down or drive or walk it out. Its 7.5 kms from the gate. Very serene place. History well kept. Too many monkeys though. You will be able to spend a whole day in there. Good for children and adults too. Challenges your fitness level though...
Kanheri_Caves,Brit_travellerUK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Amazing caves,"We spent a very enjoyable couple of hours visiting Kanheri Caves. We were surprised at how big the complex was and the number of different carvings.Whilst it was tricky to get to the caves, we really loved how quiet is was. We felt that we were able to explore the caves and take photos without being surrounded by lots of other people.It would be great if there were a few more information boards so that you can learn more about the history of the caves themselves."
Kanheri_Caves,Ben R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Ancient caves in basalt dome,"To be clear, overall I thought the caves were great - some of them were in fact spectacular, with rock carvings in good condition after hundreds of years. I spent 2 hours walking around, taking in the sights. Definitely worth visiting, and should arguably have UNESCO designation. I wasn’t as impressed with the 12x entry cost vs locals (RP300 for foreigners), and much more should be done within the National Park to clear up the litter.Getting there and back could be a challenge: I travelled there by Taxi for RP400 and back to Andheri railway station by train for RP10. Getting around the Park best done by bicycle. I used #Harrybicyclerental outside the main gate."
Kanheri_Caves,SaveyFLTraveler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Outstanding Buddhist monastery caves,"I took a private tour of these caves with a knowledgeable guide. There are 109 cave, hand dug and carved, for monks. The history, carvings, location, scale and hilly surroundings were awesome. It should be a UNESCO site really. Well worth the visit. Outstanding with a good guide. "
Kanheri_Caves,Jinit Satra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Never miss a chance,A place which is inside Sanjay gandhi national park. Best time to visit Monsoon and winter. Specially for Vada pav and missal pav in kanheri Caves. Chana masala kachi kairi cucumber star fruit are also available here. Water fall has a great Back massage. Recommended here in monsoon specially with cycle yes Cycle.
Kanheri_Caves,P S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Another surprise of Amchi Mumbai,These caves are in Sanjay Gandhi Park & the lush green forest is as beautiful as the caves. Students can also take away few lessons from these ancient caves. Group trips to this place will surely be a great fun
Kanheri_Caves,Navtej G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,A haven from the busy streets of Mumbai,"Located in the Sanjay Gandhi park, this is a calm and green area away from the busy streets and concrete of Mumbai. In fact, you get some wonderful views of Mumbai as you climb higher exploring the caves. This ancient Buddhism monastery is extremely beautiful. The caves were wonderful to explore. Monkeys can be a nuisance. Lots of walking so wear suitable clothing."
Kanheri_Caves,G A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Ancient Kanheri Caves :  The Best Attraction Of Mumbai,"The  Kanheri Caves are my favourite heritage site in Mumbai.  I can never get enough of that ancient ambience in the midst of the forest,  and there is no such thing as a visit too many.  My most recent visit was last Saturday at 0900 sharp when the caves ticket counter opened.  The undergrowth was pretty and green but the rocks and pathways were now dry and unslippery so I decided to cross to the grassy plateau above the ruined caves  on the other side of the little bridge.  I found the easiest way up and there I was all alone except for a troop of shy golden langurs minding their own business.  I walked a bit along the rocky plateau enjoying the vistas of the vast forest and the city towers in the background on one side and the main group of caves on the other.  The langurs let me come fairly near, though not quite close enough for a Selfie :-)))  They were very very cute.  There are remnants of ruined stupas on this plateau as well but it was rather warm in the open and I did not venture too far beyond.   If only the ASI would allow visitors from sunrise, it would be so much more pleasant.   I crossed back by a rough hewn stone staircase to  the main caves on the other side.I have explored the caves many times so on this visit, I was more just ambling along taking in the atmosphere of this ancient site (2000+ years old).   A rather grumpy looking big brown monkey suddenly jumped off the rock face and bounded near, it wasn't me he was looking for .. a man in front of me had just  given a biscuit to his little girl whom the mother was holding on her shoulder.  In the blink of an eyelid, the monkey jumped up behind the woman and snatched the biscuit from the baby's hand.  The child started howling but fortunately had not been scratched and a few moments and some pacifying later, the little girl said ""Bye Monkey"" ... it was both terrifying and sweet.  I decided not to eat my  Vada Pao from my backpack, in any case I was sweating profusely with the heightened humidity by then and was not hungry at all.  I had a sip of water, later my water bottle was missing from the pouch on the side of my bag, maybe Bad Monkey stole it???      Definitely not a good idea to display food in front of the monkeys.  They will see it, no matter where they are and they will come to demand their fair share.  I experienced this in Shimla and in Badami where the monkeys were even more bold than their cousins here.Making my way uphill, I chose to wander past the lesser seen caves which dont have any impressive carvings.   I found some crumbling carvings in a pitch black cave interior which I doubt I had ever seen before and I thought I had seen the caves comprehensively including the rarely visited necropolis.  Forgot unfortunately to note the cave numbers.  The path here was narrow and seemed damaged, perhaps by the unprecedented heavy monsoons this year.  It led nowhere or rather to the forest edge, an adventurous person may have been able to skirt the rock edge and clamber up to the next level but not me, the last I needed was to fall and that too with no one around.  I found my way up an uneven staircase to another level near the carved Caves 89 & 90 and then to the rock hewn steps going steeply all the way down to the main cluster of Caves 4 to 1.  By this time it was very warm, I was perspiring even more, grateful for my hat but discovered that my water bottle was lost.  It was barely 11am and so warm!  October is ofcourse the second summer in Mumbai, this year we had extended rains so got used to the pleasant monsoon weather and the rather hot day was a  bit of a shock.Cave 4 is small with a  stupa and carvings all around the wall, always worth a look see.  Cave 3 is the main Chaitya hall with the two massive Buddha statues just outside.  They are suitably impressive, every time!  Eventually I made my way back to the car park and pushed off home.  Fortunately being after 12noon the highway traffic was moving and not the nightmare it would have been an hour earlier.Kanheri Caves are within the SGNP.  BEST buses ply at certain intervals from Borivili East station all the way to the caves which is a convenient way to come and of course coming by train to Borivili East is the quickest and cheapest ... provided you can handle Mumbai's local train travel.  Early in the morning is not a problem.  Avoid peak hours which tend to extend till around 11.30.Cave entry is INR25 per head for Indians and an exorbitant INR300 p/h for foreigners.  You also need to buy an entry ticket to the National Park.  Kanheri Caves managed by the ASI are closed Mondays.  The Adivasis set up food stalls at the base at the car parking area and there is also a small restaurant as well as toilets.Comfortable walking footwear is a must and a hat will give you respite from the unmerciful sun.  The caves are not really suitable for the disabled, for small children or for anyone who is inclined to fall.  Be very careful of monkeys if you have food with you, make sure it is well hidden in your bag and take it out only if the coast is clear ... or suffer the monkey consequences!An entire day can be spent at the Kanheri Caves if you can handle the weather.  The ASI security guards are all over the place so it is quite safe unlike in the past.  The guards also double up as guides for a negotiable fee and are happy to show visitors the significant caves, some of which are locked to prevent vandalism and to deter lovers from making  it their nest.  The guards have the keys so it makes eminent sense to engage them as guides should you need a guide.Read up about the caves a little bit before you go, it will make your trip that much more rewarding.As I said earlier, the Kanheri Caves are my favourite place for an outing in Mumbai.  Nature and ancient heritage combined."
Kanheri_Caves,Nikhil Shah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,This? In Mumbai?,"Can't believe such beautiful caves in the city! Located literally inside the forest, about 8km from entry gate. Takes about 3 hours walking all the way, through the forest. can take car till almost there. Few places to eat around. Carry plenty of water. "
Kanheri_Caves,World Traveler,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Good experience for family,"Fascinating place that's open for all to see, touch, and experience.  Very nice to have such a place so close to the busy streets of Mumbai.  Relaxing to feel so far away and be so close.Recommend this as a stop for anyone but be aware it is not elderly or handicap friendly."

So relaxing and great views, small stream of rivers flowing giving life to the place, very ideal for meditation or when one is looking for inner peace"
Kanheri_Caves,Pumiann,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,I loved the caves and the park is truly awesome,"For me I was lucky, I met somebody that took me around the caves as a friend. I have no idea what the guide situation might be here. I suspect non-existent. I was quoted US$120 by a company wanting to show me round this place before I went when I was enquiring from TripAdvisor. You can certainly visit the caves themselves by yourself, although there isn’t any specific information at each cave which I felt was lacking, but it might actually not be known. And I suspect any ‘professional‘ company advertising such a tour probably wouldn’t know either. Who knows how these people lived way back in the first century and what the purpose was of all these dwellings.Really great fun to wander around and see each cave and Wonder a bit further up to the top and over the other side a little bit. Kind of off the beaten track. Great fun getting lost.The park itself is really lovely, beautiful in a busy area of Mumbai.  Stunning views over Mumbai the higher up you get.A complete nightmare trying to get from the park gates to the caves which is 7 km. Okay if you want to walk then fine, it’s on made Road Way. Or there was a guy trying to rent out to very very old what he described as ‘bicycles‘ at the gate I didn’t enquire as to the cost. The vehicles that will take you from the park gates to the caves, I’m quite happy to rip you off as much as they can, particularly if you are a foreigner so beware. Coming back as well same problem. You can wait for the bus of course, but I suspect (I didn’t do this) could you could be waiting a couple of hours for the bus to fill up before it would go off, and on a quiet day, which it was when I went there you could be sitting for hours.  That’s where the management of this park is really seriously lacking. How much does it cost to vehicle, a small vehicle that would hold six people to travel 6 km??? And the time of the driver, well if he’s not doing anything else???You have to pay to get into the park, which was quite minimal, but when you get to the caves, the entrance fee is Rs.25 Indians… Rs.300 foreigners. Where did they get this figure from I wonder???  Okay maybe we don’t mind paying a little bit more, but that sort of percentage ‘tourist Tax’ is a joke. I would’ve given the caves themselves a five star rating has someone interested in nature, Buddhism and a little bit of tracking. And the park itself will also five stars for being where it is I’m doing what it does.But you can read above the reason why it only has three stars."

Kanheri_Caves,Piyush A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,Old Buddhist caves  with temples and quarters to live,"Tucked inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, you have to buy tickets, first for the National Park and later for the Caves. The Park entry tickets are expensive now and more too if you get your personal car in. The caves are at the end of a road of the park, where, after buying tickets, you have to keep on climbing uphill. Not good for old people who can't walk much. Once inside the cave complex, keep on exploring them which are scattered all over. Keep on climbing uphill and at one point you will find yourself at the hilltop from where you can see most of the western suburbs around Borivali on one side and jungle on the other side."

I had an excellent experience with one of the guards that spoke english and took me to the best caves, I was exhausted going through all of them when some of them were not worth it.

Kanheri_Caves,Karthik R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,109 caves and only 5 have sculptures,"Around 20 kms from Juhu is SGNP - Sanjay Gandhi National Park at Borivalli. The plan was to visit Kanheri Caves and then if time permits, visit the zoo at SGNP. The Kanheri caves are located deep inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park - around 7 kms from the SGNP entrance area. A fee is collected as entrance to the SGNP - Rs.58 per adult, Rs.31 per child and Rs.195 for a car. We had pay for the driver as well. Quite high for an entry to an area and again, we need to buy ASI site entry fee (Rs.25 per adult) to enter Kanheri caves. The Kanheri caves are dated back to 1 BC and are believed to be one of the oldest cave formations of India. There are 109 caves in the location. The road to Kanheri caves is well laid and the whole place is a forest.The caves are Buddhist shrines and an important place of prominence during the Buddhist settlement. Out of the 109, hardly 5 caves have the sculptures. Rest of the caves have a plinth like structure where people can sit and meditate or take rest. The caves with sculptures are Cave 3, 11, 34, 41, 67 and 87. The cave with sculptures are not so ornamental, however couple of them have big Buddhist sculptures and stupa. Cave 3 has a large Avalokiteshvara sculpture. One of the caves has a magnificent meditation centre - very good acoustics. The sun was quite harsh on the day and we made a quick walk around the caves. Rest of the caves are all very near to each other and almost all have a plinth like structure and nothing more. The pathway is maintained really well and at places quite steep for elders. One can cover all caves in 90 minutes, however, apart from the mentioned numbers nothing really holds any sculptures.We spent around 45 minutes and turned back after seeing most of the sculpted caves. There is nice local canteen selling hot bhajjis, aloo vada and samosas. The snack was very good after the walk around. Beware of monkeys all along the caves."

They are a group of caves and rock-cut monuments cut into a massive basalt outcrop. We visited the caves along with the friends of my wife during our recent trip to Mumbai. These caves contain Buddhist sculptures, relief carvings, paintings and inscriptions, dating back to 1 BC to 10 CE. The site is on a hillside and is accessed via rock-cut steps. There are a total of 109 caves. Each cave has a stone plinth that functioned as a bed. There is a congregation hall with huge stone pillars containing a Stupa. There are rock-cut channels above the caves which fed rainwater into cisterns, to provide the complex with water. The walls of the caves are carved with intricate reliefs of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas. Most of the caves were Viharas, meant to be used for living, studying, and meditating. The larger caves, functioned as Chaityas, or halls for worship. These are lined with intricately carved Buddhist sculptures, reliefs, pillars and rock-cut stupas. I was surprised seeing these caves, which are right in the heart of Mumbai. An eye opener, thanks to my wife's friends. A revisit is on the cards."

There are many steps and there are so very many caves. So you may not be able to see them all.For a foreigner its 300 Rs to get into the cave complex.

Also the sheer magnitude and effort in creating this marvel.The national park is s great green lung and teeming with bird and wild life too. Can spot deer grazing or walking along the roads. That said, the plastic and waste thrown by visitors dirties the place.

Kanheri_Caves,Dave,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Kanheri Caves,"This morning I took an Uber from Goregaon East to the entrance gates to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. Taxis, Ubers and the like are not allowed into the park. So, after paying an entrance fee of 58 rupees to enter the park, I had to negotiate for a driver to take me up to the entrance to the Kanheri Caves. We settled on a fee of 1 000 rupees for the round trip of 14km.The driver proved to be very knowledgable. He was born in the reserve and lives in one of its villages. He waited for me for while I spent an hour walking around the caves.Before proceeding, I had to pay the foreigner's entry fee, which has increased to 300 rupees - more than ten times what Indian citizens pay. I do think the authorities should consider a reduced fee for citizens of BRICS countries. Our currencies are not strong and visas for us to enter India are free.Anyway, my visit to the caves was most interesting. If you read up beforehand, there's no reason for a guide. The driver suggested that I restrict myself to 5 of the 109 caves: Numbers 2,3,11, 34 and 67. A very helpful security guard, who gave me an extensive free tour of Cave 3, suggested that I add Number 41 to the list and this proved to be good advice.There is quite a lot of clambering up steps hewn into the basalt rock so stout, closed walking shoes are recommended in addition to a bottle of drinking water.It is mind-boggling to think that Buddhist monks carved these caves and the magnificent sculptures in them by hand.An hour was just sufficient to see the six caves. After that, I met the driver who drove me back to the park gates. Rather than Uber back to Goregaon, I took an automated rickshaw (tuk-tuk) to Borevali Station (18 rupees) and then travelled from there to Goregaon Station (5 rupees second class). As it was just after midday, the train was relatively uncrowded.The caves are well worth a visit."

Kanheri_Caves,Ekta N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Treasure in amidst a City like Mumbai,"This one is located inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park. It’s a 7 kms walk from the Park entry. There are cars available to transport you from the gate where they charge per person. One can hire a cycle too at Rs.80 per hour or per two hours depending on whether you take it from a private vendor or the park authorities. A cycle/ two wheeler/car can go upto the area from where the steps to the caves start. Walking the 7 kms stretch does get little boring by the end and might be tiring for those who do not walk or run regularly, specially the long ramp that leads to the steps. It’s a nice road surrounded by trees and few reindeers on the way and a lot of monkeys..The caves are maintained very well and kept very clean. There is one restaurant at the foot of the caves which serves basic dishes but beware of monkeys. There are about 109 caves altogether. Above the caves is a spot which is the highest point there and the view of the forest all around is worth the climbing up.Please note that the park opens to public at 7.30 am. Before that only those with a pass are allowed to go. It’s best to spend time there before the sun heat rises. A DSLR camera or lens with a zoom of more than 35 x is chargeable to take inside. The charges are around 3000 Rs. which is pretty ridiculous for non professional photographers. Wear comfortable shoes and carry water."

Kanheri_Caves,TripTipr,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Mid-forest delight!,"Ancient caves, with stone carvings...set in lush green 'forest' area withing the surrounds of Sanjay Gandhi National Park. It's a day-getaway from the city snarl. Sundays can be crawling with fellow-trippers, but any other day, would be much better. A short 20min bus-ride in from the main gate, it's a set of over 50 big n small caves spread over an approx 20-acre core area...which you can cover on foot, in about 2 hours, or a leisurely 3 hours, Do not carry snacks/tetrapack drinks as monkeys can be a menace. Do any eating within the designated cafe area...and then proceed. Or, grab a bite just before you exit. The scale of the beautiful carvings, and the living spaces carved out of sheer rock by monks of yore, are a genuine awe-inspiring wonder. If you are a birder or butterfly enthusiast, come early...and meander into the surrounding pathways.  A definite day-trip!"

Kanheri_Caves,nick p,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018,Was hoping for more ,I was excited to start this journey and was pretty let down due to logistics..The main gate very long line to enter park and cost 53 INR then there was supposed to be a bus running but of course it was not operational so you have to pay for a ride or walk 7km uphill. When you finally get to the top get ready to pay again 300 INR for foreigners and 25 INR for Indians. The caves are cool and statues are detailed and craft is very nice. You then have to pay again to hitch a ride back to the main gate. P.S watch for the monkeys they are pretty bold.
