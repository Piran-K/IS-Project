KidZania_Mumbai,Vratin Shah,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,An Adult experience for Kids,"A great experience for kids. They can role play & learn about a lot of professions/jobs, while earning & spending dummy currency. They have different plans, a full day plan is worth the experience.  It can be tiring day for parents, but kids will enjoy. Lots of foods options available inside. The only concern is that during holidays or when there are school participations, the wait time for an activity will go beyond half an hour, specifically for popular activities like fire fighter, DHL, etc. And since there is no management outside the activity room, people in groups will block the slots although the rules don't allow that."
KidZania_Mumbai,Nitara Bhambhani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Best indoor theme entertainment for Kids,"With 100+ real life role playing adventures they have amazingly combined learning with fun. Very well maintained, hygienic and safe :) The staff is very helpful too. Many food options as well available inside.Plan for a full day outing as there are many activities to do.Thank you Kidzania for such memorable times. Super Fun Place:) I visited Kidzania Mumbai at R City Mall, Ghatkopar on 26th Jan 2023 and must say Kidzania lets you be whoever you want to be."
KidZania_Mumbai,MarziyaHashmani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family,An amazing experience ,"Kidzania is an enriching experience for kids. This place not only allows them to be whatever they want but also allows them to understand the importance of these professions in the lives of other people. They are taught important skills like money management, importance of money, work equality and also enhances their creativity. Whenever we take them to Kidzania it's always like taking them to a world full of opportunities. They enjoy themselves and we are content that they're learning too. Thank you kidzania for another amazing experience."

It will give kids exposure to all their favourite things from ambulance, police car, donuts etc. Etc. to courier delivery, wall climbing. They get to know about a lot of brands, community helpers and also feel new skills such as music, art, radio jockey etc. For us it is a must visit every few months however if you are visiting from outside, it should be on your bucket list. It takes almost a day to cover the entire place."

We had a super amazing, engaging time visiting kidzania, the place is super awesome and our 5 hours went flying. The activities there are super engaging and so much of variety is out there. Since children has varied interest, they have tried including as much as possible for everyone to find something of their interest or can explore something they have never done before. The best bit is that the children gets to understand the concept of earning the money and then spending it on the things/activity they like (just like the real life) , even saving so that they can do something that interest them more. Is not this amazing? The food is amazing, and they do have very kid friendly menu too.

The set up they have created covers so many practical professions (like Fire Fighter, Dabbawala, Dentist), Making process of Brands like Frooti, Laughing Cow Cheese, kinderjoy. They have arts, craft, painting activities. Separate playhouse with Puzzles & games for 2-4 yr olds. Kids drive this city where they earn & spend in Kidzo currency. I liked the concept of Kidzania. Kids learn about managing money, take up responsibilities & get to perform lot of fun activities independently. They have a separate parents lounge. However we didn't opt for it as we wanted to spend family time. Good food, Clean City, Plenty of Washrooms. All in all a good experience."

Located within R city Mall, Ghatkopar, Mumbai. Adequately staffed, CCTV all over, good food, toilet, sitting area, parking available within mall, child safety ensured.

KidZania_Mumbai,Mayura Amarkant,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Lovely kids area,"Visited with my 6 yrs old kid and he enjoyed a lot there. A must visit place for the kids with age around 5 yrs to 10 yrs.Few tips for the persons visiting Kidzania :1. Book for the full day pass. You will get tired but your kids will surely enjoy whole day.2. Try to go early morning by 10 AM. Early morning it's less rush and you can complete the major activities by noon time.3. Parents can make revisits. But an adult should be present with kid below 8 yr. Kids are not allowed to make re-entries.4. Food over here is little bit pricy. Like Pav Bhaji, Chole Bhature around 200, Sada Dosa around 160. Which is quite ok.5. Kids will get multiple food item to eat which they prepare during activities. Like Pizza Slice, Donut, Kinder Joy, Nutella Sandwich, Parle G biscuit.6. Here they give kids cash in form of Kidzos which kids needs to manage.I suggest to keep cash with Kids instead of debit card as they will learn counting the cash amount.7. There are few activities which requires to spend Kidzos and few activities where kids will earn Kidzos. Please note that activities and try to do activities based on that so that you won't run out of money.8. Don't involve kids only in earnings. The gifts they give from the remaining Kidzos are quite ok types. Instead ask them also to involve in sending activities. We saw few kids only doing activities to earn Kidzos. I feel there should be balance.9. Few activities like burger making are closed.10. Do visit the maps online if you are visiting for the first time.11. Certain activities are age specific. Like car driving session and others have height restrictions. Amity University u can visit if above 812. Few activities can be done with parents like RJ. 13. They don't allow parents to enter activity areas as they wants kids to take the decisions and participate.Overall a good place to enjoy with your kid. They actually learn while playing. They treat each kid with respect calling them Sir and Madam which is really appreciated."

KidZania_Mumbai,KidZania Mumbai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Thrilling experience for kids!,"Must visit for kids!! One of the most memorable afternoons with my daughter Sanskriti and her friends, Nysa and Mahima! We visited Kidzania, the kid's haven! They offer a holistic experience for the children. There were so many learning activities, opportunities to earn kidzos and chances to spend their earnings. At Kidzania, children are at the epicentre of everything and that is why the kids had a BLAST!! They got an opportunity to play fire women, doctors, policewomen, reality show participants, dubbing artistes, and even manufacturers of sweets and beverages! There's a saying that goes:Tell me and I will forget,Teach me and I will remember,INVOLVE me and I will understand!!Kidzania is a perfect example of immersive, experiential learning for kids.I was so happy to meet my former teacher and current mentor of Top Scholars, Dr. Sanjay Salunkhe. The Top Scholars app is now at Kidzania and the kids loved exploring the same. The activities were fun and challenging.Overall, a fantastic experience!"

KidZania_Mumbai,Pearl M,,,,"Had the best experience at Kidzania. Kids had the most amazing time. Everything is so realistic that kids get to learn the best way. They can get themselves a job ne earn money they can try a new hobby, they can get creative, they can ride in a mini fire engine. Sessions last for 3-4 hours and that‚Äôs plenty of time. Adults are not allowed to go inside the activities but can easily see what the kids are doing."

KidZania_Mumbai,KidZania Mumbai,,,,"It was our first time visit to Kidzania, Mumbai and the first thing I felt after entering was that why did we not have anything like this during our childhood times. The space is amazing, the hygiene is too good.The activities created are age appropriate and gives them a great exposure about different professions that exists and makes the child feel to try atleAst once that particular profession. The concept of not letting the parents allow is something really appreciable as the child learns to listen to what a particular person needs to say regarding that profession. I am awaiting again and going to plan soon for my daughter‚Äôs visit again to Kidzania and I would actually put across to each and every parent to make the child visit Kidzania not only for their betterment but you might recherish your few childhood memories as well if what you as child would have thought."
