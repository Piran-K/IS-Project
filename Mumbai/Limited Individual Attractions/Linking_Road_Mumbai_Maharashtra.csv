Linking_Road,vaibhavaero,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Street shopper's paradise,Clothes and footwear (children and adults) available at great prices. Learn to bargain if you want to visit this place.

Quality is not the best but the products are certainly value for money.

Linking_Road,Chubb,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Disappointing for me,"When I first visited India circa 6 years ago my first stop was the Linking Road market on a Sunday.  The sounds and smells were amazing, it was vibrant and charmingly chaotic.  All that has mostly gone.  The market stalls are just a few seeming to only sell clothes and shoes and the rest of the Linking Road is a mixture of low, medium and high end retailers with a few hawkers thrown into the mix.  I was disappointed and felt this was a step back from the traditional market that was such an attraction."

Some may say that quality of the items are not good but I would oppose that because I was able to buy a purse and a pair of slippers that I was able to use for more than a year. You only need to have a good eye to check which ones are of good quality.   Haggling is very much welcome and if you are not an Indian and people start to think you are from another area in India, smile at them and pretend you can understand. Of course, better to visit this place with Indian friends to help you in bargaining the price. Very colorful road and there are some small stalls that you can go to have some sugarcane drink or falooda.  "

Have to say there is something for everything. There is a line that starts from casuals to party wear to shoes to makeup to accessories and much more. You'll find first copy and second copy shoes although obviously the quality won't be the best. If you know how to bargain you can get amazing deals in this place. Shopkeepers are generally very keen to sell things so they'll take the price you give them, as long as it's reasonable. There are a few fast food chains near the market for you to visit if you get tired of shopping. All in all the linking road market is amazing for things you wouldn't generally spend a lot on, but again quality will be an issue."

Quality is Good, however for the price you pay you wear it couple of times also is fine. But the latest in Fashion is sold. The Road is full of Shops and vendors. Bargain Hard and it will work."
Linking_Road,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Test your bargaining skills,"I had visited this long narrow stretch of road located in western suburbs of Bandra many times with family as well as friends for shopping. This place is popular for vendors selling all types of regular as well as fashionable clothing like t-shirts, jeans, shoes, bags, other accessories etc in their small street side stalls. One needs to bargain hard and get it at the cheapest price possible since quality is on your luck. In my experience items purchased here are good for short term use only. There are many branded stores also from national as well as international brands all along this street. To satisfy our hunger during shopping there are many cheap as well as expensive eateries. I would suggest that avoid visiting during weekend evenings since it gets extremely crowded."

Linking_Road,paragjoshi3020,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Friends,Good place for shopping for girls but Boys be careful,Variety of clothes and similar goods are available at this road at cheaper rate but quality of goods is also poor. I had very troublesome experience in mini mall which is near KFC. I just asked the price of jeans and the vendor and nearby vendors started compelling me to buy it. And they were not leaving me but by god's grace few policemen passed by and I went out of there.Place is good but shops are not so safe for boys.

Linking_Road,Navya J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016,Nice place for street shopping,It is one of the best places in Mumbai to street shop. Just be careful about the things you buy - I think the accessories are the safest bet. Quite budget friendly and mostly apt for the young crowd.
Linking_Road,Jeffster89,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,Low Quality Merchandise,"This is a very busy street, a bargained with no doubt enjoy the haggling here but the quality of the good here are inferior. More for short term use. Lots of ladies sandals for various occasions and small items such as scarves and also clothing, and general items. Next time in Mumbai, would definitely skip this place."
Linking_Road,ArshitaSethiya,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Fashion trend style on street,If you want to change your clothes very frequently but in low budget. you can come here and shop very fashionable and newly trendy clothes.

Linking_Road,HCShah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Solo,Good Variety of Fashionable items ,"This is a place where you get Indian ladies dresses, children clothing, hand bags and sandals and very reasonable prices from the stalls besides the roads.Alternatively if you want to buy from shops and in small malls, it's there. So the choice is yours and you will definitely come home buying something.Avoid evenings or weekends as it gets very busy."

Linking_Road,Manasi S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016,"Don't know why this figures so low in the list, suburban Mumbai Street shopper's heaven: Addictive!","I have been shopping at Linking Road in Bandra West for Donkey's years now and have seen it grow from a tiny sub street to a full fledged blown shopping extravaganza. There are couple of many colleges on the Linking Road stretch and hence the area grew with the young, posh college going crowd around. Its mind boggling, the whole range of items you get there. Once you get addicted to the street shopping on Linking Road, every time you enter a Mall you will feel swindled and your mind flies back to what would a similar item on Linking Road cost. And the sweet kick of bargaining and making a fortune of all the 'savings' is tremendous. There are three categories in sale offering the same product, different quality as well: a) air conditioned shops b) Road side shacks c) On the blanket on the footpath hawker or street peddlers (cheap imitations) .The road became famous to such an extent that all the fast food eateries like KFC, Dunkin, McDonalds, etc were vying for an eye on the famous stretch and then there were Malls built in and around to accommodate the growing ""Shoppers"".Let me list out some of the few stuff the Road has to offer (anything from Rs. 10 to Rs. 20000 for all ranges):1) Footwear 2) Cosmetics3) Artificial Jewellery & Accessories4) Handbags5) Lingerie & Socks6) Fast Food (recommended Jai Jawan Kababs, opens after 7pm)7) Western wear (Ladies & Gents)8) Ethnic wear (ladies)9) Sun glasses & hats10) Upholstery & dress materialsThe thrill of shopping on Linking Road can get you busy for hours together and maybe its a good idea to wear a Fitness tracker to gather the amount of calories lost in this delightful exercise of shopping. Visit this place with extra bags to fit your shopping into and avoid plastic. And lots of time on hand...... :)And then turn into a relaxer foot spa for those tired feet as you rejoice in your new procurements. Coz shopping is pure Retail Therapy."
