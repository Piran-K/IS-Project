Madh_Island,Traveller,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Friends,Madh Island dirtiest beach of Mumbai,"This is the most dirtiest beach in Mumbai, where public property (beach) is used to dry fish on sand over plastic... Big no no. Politicians give permission for such business for the sake of votes. Here BMC ignores the beach cleanliness. Plz don't visit. Recommend places are manori & gorai beaches."
Madh_Island,Shivani72,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Madh Island .... Far off from the bustle of the main city,Nice place to spend few days ...a kind of village area and fingers crossed still holds the old city ...old building  ethos.... narrow lanes .....and  greenery ... ...trees which seem to have witnessed.. many eras gone by .....
Madh_Island,Sushant Khera,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,A small beach surrounded by a local village,"Usually visitors don’t go to this beach as aksa beach is a good spot on this line which is near. But if you want to take a good healthy run then this place is ideal, nobody bothers you here.Remember there are no shops nearby or on the beach, you have to get stuff from the main road or nearest village."
Madh_Island,Cedric N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,A good place for a one day outing,"Had been to this island in Madh a long back ago. This island is located off the coast of Mumbai.This island has small fishing villages and farmlands. It has beaches, a fort, churches, bungalows etc. This island is predominantly Christian. Serial shooting and elite parties takes place on this island. The most famous beach is Madh beach. This beach is visited by local tourists. It gets filthy and dirty due to locals littering on the beach. It also offers sunset views. Near the beach, there are vendors selling Golas and cotton candy. Had enjoyed having fun in this beach and also stayed for a day in one of the cottages. The beach on this island is ideal for families, couples as well as friends. "

Madh_Island,Anil Kakad,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016,Weekend ,Mumbai 's beaches are very congested .In the sense people don't go for swimming but to enjoying for morning or evening walks or family outing. This Madh Island is a little away from the main city and is difficult to reach without your own vehicle hence less crowded . But the sea is rough and many people while swimming have drowned and died.

View of sunset is quite amazing"
Madh_Island,arsenalsavio,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Couples,A perfect evening getaway,"There's no better place to spend a random evening than on Madh Island beach. One gets a perfect sunset view, kids playing football or cricket and waves gushing onto you. There are many resorts and bungalows which can be rented, one of which is Samara Gardens. The beach however is infamous for it's sinking sand, which has caused many cases of drowning over the years."
Madh_Island,Sid J,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Friends,Hire a bungalow for a weekend get away,Wouldn't recommend it to a non-Mumbaikar. This place is alright for a weekend get away if you book a bungalow. Most of the resorts are shady. Definitely not for the families.
Madh_Island,anushie,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,Weekend getaway ,A wonderful place close to Mumbai for a quick weekend getaway. I would suggest staying at Manisha bungalow or the retreat if budget allows. The beach is in good condition but the water is not safe to swim. The currents are very strong.

Madh_Island,sunnyahuja4586,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Couples,Love the madh,The moment you set your eyes on the beach its gives you a feeling of relaxation. This beach is not as commercial as some of the other beaches in Mumbai like Juhu beach. Have a property just overlooking the beach so head over there on weekends. Absolutely refreshing love it.
Madh_Island,the Phantom,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Friends,a trash beach in a trash place,"I am really surprised that many reviews (but written by indians in that funny SMS like english) are describing this locality as a ""paradise""; even googling you will find such outdated info.Maybe once, this place was looking better, but nowdays (I spent Easter day there) no more. The small city seems one pictured in one of those movies like MadMax, full of trash, intense dried fish smell and dirty as much as possible; talking about the beach (see pictures), even Juhu beach in central Mumbai is more clean! so, avoid if you do not want to be disappointed: nothing to see or do there."
Madh_Island,Azy S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Friends,Great resorts in dis place,"Madh island is almost in mumbai reachable by road but just 10 mins by boats, its a good getaway fr d weekend. Lots of resorts n beaches all around. Great to hangout with friends n comebck refreshed."
Madh_Island,Traveller20202014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,An Underrated Jewel!,"If you are blue or if you need time with yourself or simply if you love nature, this is the place to be to spend your entire day in the lap of scenic beauty and natural excellence! With seamless waters, sand and sky to wrap you from all around, Madh Island is  every peace-lover’s fantasy. The breeze from the sea and the touch of sand will allow you to unwind and relax right from the rise to the set.Being situated off Malad, Madh Island is one of the instant getaways from the city’s hustle and bustle. I happened to plan it @1 pm on a lovely Saturday afternoon of January as I was looking for a hideout alone with myself. I quickly checked on net and came to know that the place is well connected through road (taxi, rickshaw, bus) – buses from Borivalli and Malad ply to the southernmost tip of that patch which is called Madh Jetty. On the way there is Aksa Beach and Dana Pani Beach also which are also important attractions. However, I had heard of Madh since my childhood and went straight for the target.After my spontaneous planning and quick action thereafter, I reached the place at around 2:30pm. Though on the way, the place smells a lot like fish!!! But trust me once you walk/sit/breathe/relax along the waters, it is all gone, though in the backdrop (at a great distance) you can see all yummy fishes being sun-dried.The beach was occupied only with a handful of fishermen preparing for fishing I believe. There were random empty boats bobbing in the sea. A couple of fishermen at distance trying their hand at some last fishing for the day. I had carried a spread, my camera and some music. And I think that is the best decision I made. I captured the place through my eyes and lens. I stayed there till around 7 pm relaxing on my spread with only the sound of waters to surround you from all around and realized that I was the last person to vacate the beach with the help of moonlight and the strength of my natural eyesight. This was the most beautiful day I had in the realms of Mumbai.All in all, everything was so distant to each other that no object – living or dead will come in your way of enjoying real beauty. This place will let you ponder, rediscover and rejuvenate at practically no cost. So just go there and earn the best moments with yourself."
Madh_Island,gammo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Friends,Relatively unspoilt.,Though not as picturesque as it was 30 years ago.... too much new development....this is still a nice getaway from Mumbai's teeming crowds. i stayed at a friend's beach home for a weekend which was very relaxing though the beach was dirty and the sea full of debris!

Madh_Island,RHTAKWANI,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2013 • Family,Not a great beach to stay!,Madh Island.. the name island makes it more sophisticated.. but its actually not! We stayed in a guest house in madh island near beach. It is very far from the city so yes the advantage is.. its peaceful but not so as there are local people staying in the village and I did not find it very safe. The beach is any way dirty and not so pleasant. It is definitely better to choose alibaug over madh island.

Madh_Island,Lazy Susan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2014 • Family,Nice beach,"The waves are lots of fun but there is a very strong undercurrent, so only go ankle-deep.  A little dirty but very nice sand and shells.  You can see the sun set over the water.Stay for a nice long time and dig lakes and rivers in the sand if you want.  Dig one big enough to sit in and then sit in it.  That way there won't be much undercurrent. ;)(Written by daughter, age 10.)"
Madh_Island,Sanjy66,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2013 • Family,My shooting schedules I cherish a lot!!,"My husband produced some of the chart toppers for dd national and for some of that we used Mach island bungalows as locations. We shot a Marathi daily soap, an action based social drama in which I played a cop.this island is really charming with its quite magic and surrounding sea beaches give it a thumbs up for one of the best tourist attraction. From gorai beach nearby you may travel to the theme park of India.have coconut water,local snacks and play around  the sandy beach of Mach island.bunglows nearby are booked almost always for shootings.you may by chance have a glimpse of a film star or telestar.the same sun sets gets rised so be there to witness the movement of the powerful star.dont forget to take your lil kids to makes sand castles and have them giggling around!!!"

Ideal place to have a quiet stroll in the evenings any day of the week, rocks to sit on.  Hotels are available nearby, a good one is ""The Retreat"".  Best to verify the timings for the high-low tides and go according to your requirement.  Low tide is best for walking, high tide is best for photography.See the photos taken by my son at:http://www.anshulmanaktala.com/gallery/landscapes/content/DSC_2287_large.html"

Others being Erangal with grey-black sand and soil, and Madh with golden sand but fully occupied with fisherfolk and drying fish. 130 kms south of Mumbai is Kashid unspoilt beach.  Lot fo similarity in the flora and structure of Aksa with Kashid.  Cottages are available along with two prominent 5 star hotels for stay and meals.
