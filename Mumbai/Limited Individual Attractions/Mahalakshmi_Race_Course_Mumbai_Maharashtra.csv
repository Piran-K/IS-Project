Mahalakshmi_Race_Course,Heliana Mano,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2021,Beautiful wide open air green space!,"We started going to the race course last year in 2020 post 1st lockdown. It was amazing. It felt so good to be out in such a wide open air environment. It's so spacious and green. It is really a beautiful place to be and just enjoy company of friends.We went with couple friends and their dogs and met plenty of people with their kids etc. Everyone was just enjoying playing or chatting or walking. There are few smaller parks within to walk and so lots of options.The only annoying thing was that the horses have their polo games at the field hence we had to wait till that was over in order to step on the grass and enjoy. Sometimes games ran late and because we drove from Khar it started to become late for us since our daughter sleeps early...But it was worth it nonetheless. Just being able to be out in such a big space made all the difference to our physical, emotional and mental health during the pandemic.I don't think there are any bathrooms which is another point of concern actually but the restaurant is just a 10min walk from the race course so could be an option.Absolutely recommend to any adult or child."

Mahalakshmi_Race_Course,MumbaiRiders,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Solo,Mahalaxmi Racecourse in Mumbai.,"Mahalaxmi race-course is situated in central Mumbai, next to the ""Mahalaxmi Railway Station"" and facing the Arabian sea, one of the World's most scenic race-courses.. The track is oval shaped with a 2400 m straight chute, spread over open land in the heart of Mumbai city.The common Mumbaikar has access to the racecourse in the mornings and evenings during specified timings for exercising, walking or jogging in the inner lane of the main horse race track. Yoga sessions akin to Tai-chi are conducted in the garden situated within the race-track during the common permissible timings, akin to ""Happy Valley racecourse"" in Hongkong. Hence, as often projected, the Mahalaxmi racecourse is not a totally elitist gambling sports venue but also one of the rare public accessible natural forested environments in polluted and congested Mumbai. During the monsoon season, the centre of the racecourse consisting of the ""Polo Ground"" and its adjoining area is transformed into a ""Bird Watchers"" paradise as it is totally inaccessible by humans and gets overgrown with grass, hence attracting numerous aquatic birds..The Horse racing season is usually from November to May  while ""Off-Course"" betting on horse races in other centres of India is a regular feature after the end of the ""Mumbai Horse racing season"".Hence gambling on ""RACE HORSES"" is a 365 day  affair at the race-course. The Racecourse grounds also have some elite restaurants that are expensive and cater to the wealthier class of Mumbaikars.""Night Racing"" was conducted for the first time at the Racecourse in May-2015 and should be a regular affair henceforth.The ""McDowell Indian Derby"" held every year in the first week of Februasry is one of the most important social events of Mumbai."

Mahalakshmi_Race_Course,Rshukla51,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Family,Politics is killing it...,"It is a lovely heritage. The vast racing track and greens overlooking the sea and Haji Ali is a vital lung to the surroundings dotted with furious construction activity. The main viewing gallery should be a protected site. In the mornings and evenings, you find common citizens walking, jogging, doing yoga, laughing clubs, etc. The betting arena gives you a feel of yester years. You have committed young and the very, very old racing enthusiasts always around. But there is one problem. Politicians want to appropriate the land to build a park. The club committee is dysfunctional. Various rival groups spend more time writing anonymous letters about the misdeeds of each other than doing something productive.  The government is unclear whether to extend the lease or keep the threat alive of pushing the club out to another area. All of this is stilting the club's development. A lovely heritage of Mumbai, but one wonders for how long. "

Mahalakshmi_Race_Course,AlpahrettaTraveller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2013 • Couples,Great Place to Have Fun,"My wife and I went on Saturday of the Indian Derby week.  You get to see all the hoopla that goes with the Derby without the Derby day crowd.  I did not know that you need a tie to get into the Members enclosure.  But they sold ties there (because of the Derby week, I think) for Rs 100 and I got one.  The entry fee to Members enclosure was Rs 160 per person, but it is worth it if you want to spend a special day and willing to splurge a little.   The members enclosure is very nice and it was not crowded on that day.  Plenty of seats, especially in the special temporary stand they had set up for Derby day.  Horse racing was very nice to see, even though I did not win much money.  You can bet as little as 10 rupees at the tote or play the bookies with the big boys (minimum Rs 100 bet with Rs 30 tax on bet).   Plenty of good food, beer and mixed drinks.  Nice way to have a relaxing day.  You can not take your cell (mobile) phone inside.  But there is a place for you to check it in and pick it up later.  Towards the end of the day we walked to Gallops Restaurant to have snacks and drinks.   I will definitely go there if I am in Mumbai during racing season."

Both are excellent places & one can find spiritual bliss & calmness inside the sanctum sanctorum at both the places. The CISF & police personnel outside Shri Mahalakshmi mandir do not allow personal baggage with devotees & they have not aranged even a cloak room to keep...when ask they bluntly say...'we have got orders'.....don't know which fool has given what orders but seems that it is a trick of temple administration to benefit the hawkers outside who offer to keep ur bags if u buy something...and as ususal police will get their share (hafta) just by making a new rule of their own...

Got a form book (giving details of all races, horses, their handicaps etc. The bookie odds were displayed on the Tote and in addition to placing bets on the tote, there were mobile Point of Sale machines that allowed you to place bets till about 30 secs before the start of the race. Before every race, one can go the the Parade enclosure to see the horses with their jockeys. I must tell you, the care the owners take to groom their horses is just amazing. Those horses looked so beautiful. There is a provision to go upto the fence that guards the race track and watch the magnificent beasts make a dash to the finish line. Their power is just amazing- one can feel it. The mahalakshmi race course is a lovely course. Decent food and a spacious layout makes for a lovely outing to the races... a Must visit. "

Mahalakshmi_Race_Course,TravlAdvisor,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2012,Run Run Run,"A place for Marathon runners, amatures and strollers as well. Very fresh and one of the few places in Mumbai where you can get this close to nature. The entire circle is about 2.4 Kms, so the only bad part is you cant really decide to quit walking once you are half way. Race course also has a couple of good restaurants including Olive, Gallops. Worth a Jog."
Mahalakshmi_Race_Course,Sal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,Walker's paradise,"In an island city of concrete structures, the Race Course is one of the few lungs of south Bombay. I go for a walk 3-4 times a week and in addition to being amidst greenery, one can actually breathe without coughing or sputtering!"
Mahalakshmi_Race_Course,Emily M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2012,A day with the horses,The sights and sounds on  race day have to be experienced to be  believed.Reasonably priced tickets for entry  the race course can be accessed via the Haji |Ali sea face road or the Mahalaxmi station road. Ample parking space makes it convenient to travel  to.The enclosures  are clean and the  bookie  stalls easy to  access. Do  beware of   pickpockets though. A great place  to spend a Sunday afternoon
