Maharashtra_Nature_Park,SudhirAcharekar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"Good Place for Nature Lovers, Morning Walkers & Budding Macro Photographs....","Last Sunday, 5th Jan 2020 I visited this place in the event 'A walk into Green Lungs of Mumbai' arranged by Maharashtra Nature Park (MNP) at 8.30 AM. Our group was of about 15 people from the age group 20 to 66yrs under young Botony Expert Mr. Sadanand Gupta. Incidentally this was my second visit in a gap of about `month. Last time my visit was solo, mainly to click Butterflies, Insects, Flowers & Birds. Hence I covered only 3/4th Nature Trail as I was scared in the last part of trail after Nursery. This time we covered complete trail. Mr. Sadanand shared lot of information about trees, common as well as medicinal, with mythological stories also. In the both the visits I captured lot of photos specially some waders (like Stilt, Waterhen, Sandpipers, Seagulls, Lapwings etc.) in the Mithi River which is behind the park. Also Perching birds like Koel, Coppersmith Barbet, Rose-ringed parakeet, Indian Jungle Crow, Kingfisher, Black Kite etc. I thoroughly enjoyed the trail as I was benefited with knowledge about trees, birds with good walk with addition of bird's photos in my kitty. I love to visit again."
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,meena1981,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,for nature lovers it is a nice place,"Maharashtra Nature Park is a children park where many varieties of flora and fauna are present.There is a nursery inside the Park.It is a good peaceful place.Really a good place to take kids.It is a great spot for picnics and bird watching.The park is located at Dharavi.Here one can see varieties of birds such as Laughing Dove, Shikara, Black kite, Greater Coucal, Eurasian Wryneck, Great Egret, Purple Sunbird, Little Green Bee Eater,Ring Necked parakeets, Greater spotted eagle, Mahratta Woodpeckers etc.Here kids can enjoy a nature trail here."

Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Payal G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Couples,Best nursery in Mumbai,"One of the best kept secrets of Mumbai, it's a must visit for all nature lovers and particularly people thinking of starting their own gardens. This place has a huge nursery where a variety of plants and herbs are available for throwaway prices ranging from ₹5-20 - the same are available outside at prices in multiples of 10s and online in multiples for 100s. For example, a Bougainville costs only ₹5. Natural manure is also available at ₹30 per kilo.That said, the administration probably wants to dissuade visitors with their weird rules. An extremely bureaucratically run place - the nature park and the nursery have separate entrances with separate set of staff and one cannot be accessed from the other. Timings are most restrictive and both places close at 3:30 pm sharp. The nursery entrance is bang opposite the exit of the Best bus depot. While entry is free, one has to take passes from the entrance.People going for plants should carry their own bags. Ask for the lady in charge of the nursery who will point out all the variety of plants available along with tips for maintaining the same."

Its so quite inside that you will feel you are not in Mumbai. You can spot a lot of species of birds, insects, butterflies and trees too. Good to educate your children and it aslo have a museum and camps are  arranged by various groups. "
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Tutunu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017,An wonderful journey for knowledge gaining and worth remembering,"We travelled to Maharastra Nature Park, a manmade park situated between Dharavi and the Mithi river, which is full of greenery. We visited educational center building, which has 7 different sections. These are (i) Forest section (ii) Vegetable section (iii)  Spice section (iv) Pam trees section (v) Nursery area (vi) medicinal plant section, and (vii) Vermicompost section.We have seen many butterfly species, such as Blue tiger, common jay, common emigrant, common crow, gray pansy, common grass yellow, commander butterfly, common caster, chocolate pancy, spiker butterfly, common mormon, common wonderer, stripe tiger, common baron, plain tiger, common lime, Samlon arab, red pira, psyche. We saw eggs of many butterflies and a variety of Caterpillers. We also saw a special type of caterpillar, which has self-protection mechanism involving throwing of a dirty chemical. We came to know that Butterflies taste buds lies on their feet. Also, we must avoid catching butterflies, as they will die after sometime, as we unknowingly hurt their blood vessels. We also saw many dragonflies. Apart from these wonderful butterflies, we saw a kingfisher and a group of egrets, and there were about 26 different types of snakes including cobra. There is also a member of grasshopper family, which can go for two-step jumping. We also saw mother-in-law plant, also called snake plant. We saw a dog, which was very friendly. The view of the nearby pond was mesmerizing.Interestingly, people planted trees and vegetables here, but all the fauna like birds and animals and insects came and stay here. It is no-plastic zone, without any noise pollution. Interestingly, Mithi river passes through the jungle, where it is very clean because of animals, but unfortunately when it comes into the city, we people make it dirty, which eventually goes to Arabian sea."
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Sonika A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Friends,Green and beautiful,I went to Maharashtra Nature Park for a photo walk. I photographed so many butterflies and insects. The park opens after 8.30 am. So could not find many birds. But there are many birds near the pond. Entry fee is Rs 10 only. There are no restrictions on cameras. Very good for nature lovers.
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Deba_Nandy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Solo,Excellent for nature lovers,"This place opens as early as 7.30 in the morning. Be there during weekdays to avoid the crowd,November is butterfly season and they have excellent and colorful visitors during that time. It is a photographer's delight to be here,"
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Ashwin Kumar R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,Breath of fresh air in deep inside the concrete jungle.,"But for my friend, I would have never known that such a green corner existed right in the heart of Mumbai! Nestled between Dharavi and the Mithi river, this island of greenery comes as a refreshing change with its shrub jungle and long nature walk trail. the sight of BKC across Mithi is another scenic thing, but if you are not interested in the concrete structures, the nature park provides enough sights and sounds to keep us occupied.  The Nature park is also home to some of the bird species that are not easily seen in the city as well as some insects that are hard to find in Mumbai. Children will particularly enjoy it. Good for a small picnic. There is an auditorium for conducting events too."
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,sbgholse,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,Not well maintained park,"I was disappointed when I visited this park by travelling long distance by taxy from airport area.This is a dry jungle ,nothing attractive.It may be hunt house for nature and wildlife specialist but nothing interesting for a common man.Even local gardens are well maintained and attractive.Not worth visiting specially."
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Menulone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Didn't Know Such a beautiful Place is there in Sion,"This is place is not known by many i am sure, further I feel disappointed that such a green and beautiful place located in busy streets of Sion goes un noticed. This is basically a garden where people can go to see different birds, plant, flowers and colorful butterflies. Now many people go with many purpose such as spending time, enjoying nature etc. I went for photography here and found that this place has everything to learn photography. This place can be considered for short tracking as well. I believe this place should be made popular among the people who loves photography and those who love to explore new places.This place makes you see both parts of Mumbai, busy streets and Calm Nature.I have been in Mumbai for more than 15 year yet i didn't know such a beautiful place is there. And the strangest part, it is not crowded. I should recommend you all to visit once at least if you are nearby Sion. Make sure you go till the end of the garden where you can see the panoramic view of BKC and off course not so soothing view of Meethi River. Nevertheless it is worth visiting for sure."
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Jagruti C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Family,a surprise green land within the concrete jungle,I took the kids from my building on a nature trail. I was surprised to see that it was such a well organized set up. The botanical garden had amazing collection of rare plants and insects. the best was when our guide came across a non poisonous snake and the kids got an opportunity to study it and get to touch it as well. Also spotted a cobra...that was amazing. Importance of green and interaction with the creepy crawlies gave the children a lot of confidence and sense of responsibility towards nature.You can directly go or contact wild life adventure guides to organize a trip for you.
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Sonam K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Friends,Peaceful ,This is a wonderful location. The park is large and peaceful. We had gathered there for the ceremony for my brother Lt.

Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Himanshu U,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Something New,"Went for a nature walk at Maharashtra Nature Park  its approx 5.5 Km from Trident BKC  , Unfortunately we were told not to venture much in the wilderness as during rains the Snakes are also out for their stroll . But saw lots of flora and butterfliesKids had great fun"
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Sh00nya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Friends,A forest in the middle of Mumbai City!,"Maharashtra Nature Park (MNP) is a not a hidden secret. It’s been there for 22 years now. Enough has been written about it. What’s sad is, not many people know about it.MNP, once called Mahim Nature Park, is a forest right in the center of Mumbai city, right opposite Dharavi slums and next to Mahim Creek. When you step inside the forest, you will never realize that this 37 acre (yes!!! – for those who only know in square feet – 1 acre = 43, 560 sq. ft.) forest used to be a garbage dump till 1977! Around 1980, representatives from World Wildlife Fund and the famous naturalist Dr. Salim Ali got together with a vision of creating a nature park, which could be home to different plants, trees, insects, and birds. Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) then ecologically restored and developed this land, as a botanical garden, by filling up the garbage dump with soil. The entire exercise was definitely more complex than what it sounds in this post.Finally on Earth Day, 22nd April 1994, MNP was declared open to people.I have read that MNP is home to 14 thousand trees, 300 varieties of plants, hundreds of varieties of migrant and local birds, insects and butterflies. Has to be true! There are trails for you to follow and cover the entire forest and should take you about 3 hours to finish with stopping in between for photographs and just soaking in nature.It’s interesting to know that experts from around the world are known to visit the MNP to study the flora that grows on this ground. In fact, it’s a great achievement for a forest to thrive on a land, which has been eroded over decades of being used as a dumping ground. This forest is so much more than a nature park or a botanical garden – it helps us understand the importance of conserving our environment.I think the state government needs to promote this place more. When more people start coming in, more word will spread. This will also push the government to focus more on the upkeep of the park. I feel that because of lack of enough attention and management, the forest will slowly lose its charm. Right now most people who come here are naturalists, bird watchers, and photographers. It has still not reached a level where regular people like you and me would go and spend some time in solitude in the midst of nature. This forest needs the attention and importance it so much deserves. Address: Maharashtra Nature Park, Next to Dharavi Bus Depot, Dharavi, Bandra Sion Link Road, Mumbai – 400017Land Mark: Opposite PMGP Colony.Parking: You can park on road adjacent to MNP. It’s quite safe there.What to Carry: Fresh drinking water.Outside Food Allowed: Yes, but please, please, don’t litter. Don’t feed potato wafers to the birds. Don’t throw those wrappers and plastic bottles into the creek. When to Visit: Try and avoid peak summer heat, so that you are physically prepared to spend more time in the forest rather than just finish the trail. Best time for birdwatchers to visit this park is between October and March. Timings: Open in weekdays between 9:30 am to 6 pm and the entry fees is Rs.10/- per head. If you are planning to visit on Sundays or national holidays, take prior permission.Getting there: It is walking distance from Sion (Central Railway Station). Dharavi Bus Depot is the nearest bus station. If you are coming by train, from the Western line, get down at Bandra (East) station, take the Eastern Skywalk and exit at Kala Nagar Junction. Take an auto rickshaw to MNP.Phone: 022-24077641 / 022-24079939Email: mnps@bom7.vsnl.net.in"
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,RAMESH K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Cover of greenery in the heart of Mumbai,"Can you believe in the heart of Mumbai city, close to Sion, Dharavi & BKC is a nature park spread over 37 acres? Known as Maharastra Nature Park, it is located on the banks of river Mithi and is formed by converting a dumping ground into a botanical garden in 1994 and today is home to a variety of plants, trees, flowers,birds, reptiles & butterflies. I & my son spent more than a hour & half this morning exploring the park through the various trails. As with many other places in India, the park is definitely in need of better maintenance. The park opens at 7.30 am on weekends and 8.30 am on weekdays and has an entrance fee of ten rupees. "
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,NIR006,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Friends,An oasis for nature lovers,"Located at Dharavi, at the edge of one of India's biggest slums, and on the banks of the degraded Mithi river, is small forest called the Maharashtra Nature Park. Entry is almost free. The park has the following broad areas:- Dense woods where a variety of snakes (including cobras) can be spotted- A fresh-water lake with snakes, turtles and birds- A butterfly garden with a good variety of flowers and butterfliesAs usual, you need to be early and lucky to spot the snakes. They would retreat into the dense vegetation or the lake as soon as they sense you! Spotting the turtles needs patience; you may need to hang out near the lake for long. Spotting the butterflies and birds is much simpler.Unfortunately...you cannot go too close to the Mithi river..the stench keeps you away...Recommended only for nature lovers. Be early and quietly find a good spot near the lake to test your luck."
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Dr_Sarvesh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015,Badly Maintained!!,This awesome park..once like a green lung ..is unfortunately dying off due to bad maintainance..recently went there but found most of the trees dying 
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,G A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Not a tourist attraction but hat's off to the forest created on an erstwhile dump,"This man made forest is opposite the Dharavi Bus Depot, very near the Sion suburban railway station.  Entry is from the main gate for the park.  The nursery gate is separate.  No parking is allowed within though you can park your car on the road outside.  Visitors must register at the entry gate then purchase a ticket (Rs10) from the counter in the building inside.  When you leave you need to show your registration slip to the security guard at the gate.  Somewhat convoluted but everyone is very pleasant. It is not really a tourist attraction except for those who want to see how a former dump has transformed into a decent patch of jungle in the middle of a bustling metropolis.   School kids are usually brought here on study trips.  Photographers and nature enthusiasts come regularly.   Local residents should make the effort to go at least once to appreciate the transformation ... but do watch where you tread ..... find out why below :(I used to visit the Mahim Nature Park  very frequently in its early years, and have literally seen the forest take shape and grow.  This   used to be a dump surrounded by slums on the filthy banks of the filthier  Mithi river where it meets the Mahim estuary.  The MMRDA took over and with a lot of dedicated effort, created and nurture what is now a full fledged forest with a freshwater lake on the site.   We went again a couple of days ago after a gap of a few years.   Now let's run through the good and the bad:The forest is undoubtedly thriving.   Wildflowers and the butterflies and other insects they attract are out in force.  I was so happy to see some  karvy bushes in bloom.  A path goes through the forest up to the nursery with another parallel path nearer the main road going back to the main gate.   These can be slippery in the rains so do wear proper walking footwear.  There used to be a path alongside the creek - there still is but I do not recommend this .... read why below.   Another shorter path goes around the man made lake.  Avoidable, again ... read why below.The   nursery section at the further end, is now well established and is an excellent source for plants that you will not easily find elsewhere, and at very reasonable prices.  If you want to go to the nursery alone, there is a separate gate and no need to pay the entrance fee or go via the main gate.The lake  was clogged with water hyacinth, however   I am sure they will remove these sooner or later.  99.99% of the birds you will see - and hear - are crows.  That is because of the garbage in the creek and in the surrounding areas. There are other birds undoubtedly but you could be excused for believing that this is crow land.  Depending on the wind direction, expect a stench from the creek.The path along the lake on the eastern side was heavily overgrown.  When we attempted to go through, we discovered why - to our horror.  The path is now used as an  open air latrine by the surrounding slum dwellers who sneak in to do their job, and is covered with excrement.   It was also full of wildflowers but there was a noxious stench due to the disgustingly obvious.  I almost threw up.  It never used to be like this previously, and I seriously doubt I will come here again except to the nursery section.They do have security guards but I guess they are not enough to tackle groups of slumdwellers.  The people at the nursery section also mentioned the slumdwellers stealing some of their stock.Nonetheless, the transformation of a once filthy dump into a thriving forest needs to be appreciated, along with the conscientious efforts of all the staff involved.  It is not an easy task at all, given the circumstances.As mentioned before, this is not really what a typical tourist with limited time would want on the itinerary."
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,intz3007,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Not in a best shape, but a good place for nature photography","Maharashtra Nature Park (earlier known as Mahim Nature Park) is situated on the banks of Mithi river at Dharavi, opposite the Dharavi Bus depot. Travel from western and eastern suburbs of Mumbai is well-connected via road.The place is not in best of shape, but school trips are quite regular for educational purpose and frequent spot for couples. The entry fees are quite nominal and the timings are from morning till late-afternoons.The best time of the year is to go around October-November as its the butterfly season. As an amateur photographer, clicking a butterfly is difficult, but if you spend 1-2 hours just clicking butterflies, I am sure it would improve your skills of breathing, posture and timing the click. It was a good learning experience.The park does have other creature life - Monkeys, mongoose, reptiles, bats, squirrels, and birds. At the other end of the park, various birds are seen on the banks of Mithi river. If you have a good zoom, you can find good shots if you are lucky.Lastly, do carry a bottle of water to keep yourself rehydrated, full clothing attire to avoid unwanted insect bites, and snacks to keep you refreshed! Happy exploring :D"

Its a very good place to visit for all nature enthusiasts. Different seasons offers different forms of nature. During rainy season one can see different species of insects, fungus, etc. Innumerable species of trees in different sections adds to the excitement. During winter season one can see different species of birds."

Maharashtra_Nature_Park,EktaPange,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,Garbage to Green Gold... Amazing Transformation.,"When you drive along the Bandra-Sion Link Road, it seems difficult at first to imagine that amid all the slums, stench and general chaos could exist a veritable forest. Perhaps it was only appropriate that MNP (as it is generally called) was to be born in the midst of such an area. For, the contrast it offers is too thought provoking to wither ignore or pass by. It is a symbol of hope. Opened for public on 22nd April 1994 this park is an excellent example of Green Gold. One cannot believe when they tell you that Way back in 70's this area was nothing but encroached slums and a dumping ground. Today it a green lung to Mumbai. More than 15,000 trees, 115+ species of Birds, 24 Spcs of Reptiles and over 80 species of Butterflies. What else does one need in a Nature Park which is spread over 37 acres. A Superb Place to Click Photographs and spend quality time with family."
