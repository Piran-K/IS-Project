The crowded streets of people were not the problem as one might expect - I have been to Istanbul and looooooved the market experience with crowded streets. It was however the motorcycles which were constantly honking their horns on the streets which in my opinion should be used only by pedestrians. Using a rhetorical and colloquial form... ‚Äúlike, surely there is someplace else you could ride???‚Äù. I wanted to stop by some of the stalls to look but having to constantly watch your back for motorcycles made me not bother. Let‚Äôs hope markets in other Indian cities I will visit this month are more structures taking pedestrians into greater consideration. "

This area is often called the City as opposed the newer part which is referred to as the Camp.The Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Merketwas the primary wholesale fruit and vegetable Centre until lack of access,traffic and change in buying habits compelled the business to be relocated elsewhere to Gultekdi or Market Yard in the Camp.Yet some buying and selling transpires surrounding the Market with a plethora of trades - temple offerings at Tulsibagh, cast iron implements and cooking dishes,brass antiques, daily ingredients - jostling for space.A couple of famous sweet meat shops are also a draw.Yet despite all this competition for attention Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Market goes its own way and comes into its own when the environs light up in the narrow lanes festooned with buntings and lamps celebrating festivals like Dahi Handiand Ganesh Chaturthi. These are well worth a saunter to catch the local flavor.An ode to Continuity and Change."

Mahatma_Jyotiba_Phule_Market,Katie B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,,The Indian food market at its best.,"This is the place to go to if you want tosee the true colours of India. Originally named Crawford Market, its a sheltered place to buy all your vegetables, fruits and tioletries. There is even a small area where birds and animals are sold often illegally. Its the cheapest place to buy all your everyday items. "

Mahatma_Jyotiba_Phule_Market,Johann&Sandra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,,A Little Insight into Daily Indian Life,"Formerly called Crawford Market, and still is for all practical purposes, this is the wholesale market.  We went there in search of some supplies for a local orphanage and found everything we needed.  Really inexpensive and plenty of selection.  This is a local market - we didn't see any other tourists - fruits, veggies, supplies of all kinds.  Outside the market there are lots of shops to look in if you want, some excellent local shoe stores and textiles.  If you've never been to a ""local marketplace"" in India that sells things other than tourist junk, you might check it out.   Not a must-see but if you're interested in the marketplace, there is also a fish market that is open only in mornings and afternoons, fun to watch the locals go on about their daily business."
