At most 15 minutes is enough to look at the ""Queen's necklace"" - Mumbai locals boast about this famous site. When you compare it to the skyline of Hong Kong - you say ""what that's it! Beyond the busy street, there is a public park, which has been created on a filled lake. At the edge of a pink-painted building, there are deceased Parsis prepared for burial on the tall towers by Vultures. Whether this place can be regarded as an attraction is a matter of opinion.
