Mangaldas_Market,gitanjali m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Solo,Wholesale cloth market,"You really need to look for the entrance to this market as you might cross it thinking its a by-lane. Several crammed shops next to each other require a lot of patience as the variety is humongous. The sourcing of the cloth is usually from gujarat and you need to carefully look at the fabric/ dress material. Had an unfortunate experience of finding a hole next to an embroidered portion in a cloth piece after purchasing it, The stuff gets repetitive from shop to shop with minimal variation in colour or design. Need half a day or more here."
