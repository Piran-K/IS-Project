Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,2torontotraveller,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Busy Very Crowded Museum,"Gandhi lived in this house for about 17 years, from 1917 to 1934.  I visited this museum as part of a shore excursion from my cruise ship.  We were given 20 minutes to see the entire building which is not enough.Because I came on a shore excursion, the building was very crowded and it was difficult to see anything with this large number of people.  The house itself was not very big.  I found the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi was so much better than this museum.  It has a lot more space with more information on Gandhi's life  and was the site where he was killed.  To be able to see the levels of the house you will need to be able to climb stairs so the museum is not accessible for people in wheelchairs or people with baby strollers."

Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,MayankR,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,The place deserves more attention ! ,"The visit to Mani Bhavan was an eye opening experience. It‚Äôs like a quick tour covering the Mahatma‚Äôs entire life and events. Very informative and an absolutely must for our kids. I especially appreciated the first and the second floors of the building where they have displayed a lot of  pictures , letters, coins and a depiction of various events. I though have a few issues with the place. (1) they sell books and I asked for a copy of a particular book in Hindi and the guy at the counter laughed and said ‚Äú we don‚Äôt keep Hindi versions‚Äù, that was a shame ! . (2) they don‚Äôt comply with accessibility guidelines and hence not easy for the old and handicapped. (3) there needs to be audio visual tools in the building for people who don‚Äôt come with a guide. Ideally you are left on your own to figure the place out. It‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of historical importance however like most historical places in India, with an exception of Rajasthan, this place too doesn‚Äôt know how to display the importance of a location and how to make it attractive for people who are visiting the place. As of today is just another old building with a lot of historical importance . The importance which you will have to try and figure out on your own. Lastly, I asked a lot of people who were born in Mumbai about Mani Bhavan and mostly all of them thought I was talking about some place in Gujarat ! "

With Gandhi being the de facto leader of the Indian struggle for independence from the 1920s, events with monumental impact on Indian history had been planned and executed from this very building. It is a great learning place for people and particularly children who want to know about Gandhi as well as the story of Indian independence. Almost an entire floor has been dedicated to dioramas or miniature recreations on major events of his life as well as big events in the Indian struggle for independence. His room has been   preserved as it would have been when he was in residence there.Its also a paradise for book lovers as there is a massive collection of reading material as well as his personal collection of books covering a variety of subjects. There are large reading rooms on two floors where people can sit without time limits. It is also a rarity among Indian museum where there were no restrictions on the visitors taking pictures. The premises are very well maintained with clean toilets.Probably the place gets crowded around specific dates like Gandhi's birth or death anniversary, but was near empty even on a Saturday afternoon/evening and most of the visitors were foreigners. Overall a must visit when in Mumbai.PS: For bollywood fans, it is the place in Lage Raho Munnabhai "

The house has been turned into a museum that explains what he achieved and gives some insight into India's history.  It is very cheap to enter (less than a pound I think) and is absolutely fascinating.  It doesn't look much from the outside but it is really good.  Also free public European toilets inside that are clean enough to use!  You don't need a guide, they give you all the information you need whilst there and included in the entrance fee."
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,Simon L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Fascinating place,Really worth a visit when in Mumbai. You can imagine Ghandi addressing the crowds fro the balcony in this old colonial-feeling building. The encased models enhanced the telling of his story.
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,Nigel G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Business,Immensely significant historical building ,Mani Bhavan- once the residence of the Mahatma in Mumbai. He lived in simplicity and his room is there still arranged as when he lived there between 1917 and 1934.It has a wonderful diarama of the life of Gandhi with scenes that changed his life. His life was one of peaceful struggle and one that was more effective than war or violence. There are many photos of the life of Gandhi and the causes he championed. Spinning wheels. A wonderful and informative tribute to a great man. There is a philatelic display of first day covers related to stamps commemorating Gandhi.There is a reference library on Gandhi on the ground floor - not sure what the requirements are to use. Admission to the house is free but you may leave a donation. Small bookstore selling Gandhi‚Äôs biography and related material. This is most definitely a must see in Mumbai. 
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,01tw1969,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Worth visiting,"On a beautiful quiet residential street in Mumbai is a colonial house where Gandhi was once based. To stand on the very same balcony he did when he spoke to the crowds below was amazing. The museum is clearly laid out, lots of information, photos and quotes. The library is quite extensive and impressive. An unexpected gem in Mumbai"
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,sophia27,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Interesting,3 floors to visit. Top floor with clothing and other articles to view. Middle floor is the most interesting with an explanation of his life and various letters written by him at key historical points.
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,Stephane Z,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Good outline of Gandhi's life,Simple museum type house with lots of history related to Ghandi's life.  I especially liked the papier mache mock up of important events in Ghandi's life.

Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,jim m,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,small house/museum,A small place the is dark on the outside.  A popular place for tourists = a popular place for street sellers.  When we went there were bus loads coming that made dominated the place.
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,varunchills,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Musuem to be visited ,Mani bhavan is one of the oldest musuem in the city and us revered for its artefacts and historical values. It has been kept very safely and carefully and looks like the same when it was made. A must visit for all the tourist.
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,TEAMSHARK2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Gandhi Lifestory,Small museum where Gandhi lived with a good friend for about 15 years.  The museum tells Gandhi's life story and provides good history of India's struggle for independence and of religious persecution.
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,venkanna482,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018,The visit to Mani bhavan is as good as going back to memory lane of 1942 and connected events faced by Gandhiji's India,"Every foreigner has made it a point to visit Mani bhavan and listed in his itinarary. Children yong and old of all ages love to visit this place. I went to see the Visitors book, where  President  Obama and wife gave their  opinion. Gandhiji and vision of free India from the shackles of foreign powers is documented in a magnificent  way. Hats off to Bapuji's legacy.."
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,DonnamjCan,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Ok,This site was ok to visit however you must really be interested in the history of Ghandi etc to make it worth your while. We found it was not really that different from another site we visited in Another city  so would not have gone to it and actually spent very little time here. If it‚Äôs your only stop for anything Ghandi-related than it‚Äôs fine. It was added onto our tour and we did not realize or we would‚Äôve bypassed it. 
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,SKKBmouth,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Quick visit,Worth doing - just wish I had had a little more time to look at the exhibition. Clever use of dolls in display boxes to illustrate key events in Ghandi's life. We got in and out just as a large tour from a cruise ship arrived....thank goodness we didn't have to compete with a big crowd.  
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,STEWY88,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Fascinating ‚Äî if you can fathom which way to walk round,Our Mumbai driver brought us here - a treasure house of historic photos documents and information . I covered the downstairs area ( seemed to be constantly bumping into people ) and followed the chronological order of displays . Then I went to the first floor when I could get past groups who seemed to have stopped on the stairs . In desperation and frustration I declined the next floor ‚Äî probably missing some fascinating display .A priceless gem of history ‚Äî I gave generously into the ‚Äú donation box‚Äù and would really have liked to stay longer .‚Äîwill go back when it‚Äôs a bit less crowded .
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,ATTILA B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,interesting,It was interesting to see the Gandhi Memorial Museum. What we learned at school here came alive and got even closer to me. Yet the exhibition was an important point for Mumbai Day.

Lots of letters, artefacts and pictures which bring Gandhi's life and trials to the fore. Characterful building with restrooms. Well worth a visit"
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,batool_hindal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Ghandi's house ,"The museum is practically Ghandi's house, his room, office, books. The Museum contains many historical photos for Ghandi and hus family.  The house is so beautiful, most of the information is written in English.  "

Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,Jason B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,A surprise!,"Fantastically done museum and house of Ghandi. It was a surprise as I must have overlooked this in researching what to do in the city but was an incredibly pleasant surprise. Situated on a small street with limited access, our guide found a spot and got us in with ease. Absolutely recommended and I attribute it to seeing the Anne Franke house in Amsterdam in terms of historical tourism significance."
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,wacotom,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,DO NOT miss this Museum,I thought this was the most fitting tribute to a great humble man. A humble museum yet in a very brief period you get a sense of Gandhi's character. I learned many things about Gandhi during our stop here. It is a self guided museum and it is a great experience to see his writing and get a sense of his personality. For such an unassuming place you get a glimpse of greatness.
Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum,Marta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Liked the most in New Delhi,"The house of Gandhi was the highlight of our visit to New Delhi. It was very peaceful, well-maintained and extremely informative! Highly recommend!"
