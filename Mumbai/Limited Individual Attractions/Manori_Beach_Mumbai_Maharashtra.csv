Manori_Beach,Bruno R,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Couples,Marve-Manori Jetty Service,"I had a worst experience with these stupid Jetty people while returning back at night. These idiots left us on wet sand that would make our scooter get stuck in it. We had no help for minutes. we had to request a man and pay extra for help. Me and two more scooters were left in open sinking sand very far away from the actual docking location. Dragging our scooter out of the wet sinking sand was hell of experience. I was breathless, weak person Candie or attack and panic.. It was scary and dark with no lights, no person to hear you. The jetty boat left people deep inside due to low tide. There were enough workers and yet they ran in jetty again. I had paid for jetty tickets and also for bike. Yet they refused to get my bike out of wet sand. This is stupidity and risky service specially at night. The Marve - Manori Jetty service providers should be considered responsible for each and every passengers safety. Hope this feed back makes a difference and a tight slap on their face for stupid disgusting wicked Jetty service providers."
Manori_Beach,Sanjib S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Place to rewind, for a quite day out.","Somewhat quite place within Mumbai suburb. There are decently clean places to stay near beach. One resort on the beach and little expensive. You will find all regular run of the mill popular dishes on the menu. If you like seafood, local fresh catch is available, please talk to the resort manager of chef.Good place to laze around on quite beach. Water is not so clear & seashore is rocky and dangerous to venture into the water. No life guard is available. "

Manori_Beach,Paddyrao,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Calm and clean beach,"We went on a Sunday afternoon to Manori beach in Gorai. It was a 1.5 hour drive from Goregaon. There is lot of greenery all along the drive to the beach, after crossing Mira road area. Not much directions available to reach Manori beach, but we just followed Google maps, and asked around a few times. Manori beach is a refreshing change compared to the crowded juhu beach. There are a few resorts in this area where you could stay. Food options are available outside the beach. "

Manori_Beach,BomiPardiwalla,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Family,Peaceful,"One of the few peaceful beaches, only cos its far from the City. It can get irritating if a noisy group present. The sands can be black and dirty."
Manori_Beach,meena1981,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Friends,not much crowded beach,"The beach is clean and not very crowded with food stalls.The food available was okay but I suggest you to bring it with you. Its a good place for picnic with friends and family.It is located in malad. If you want to see sunset with their loved one then it is a nice place. Manori beach is good option for family one trip, also for couples and hang out with your best buddies. The beach is also dangerous because it is the part of Arabian sea and the waves are too high and forcefully hit the beach."

Although the locals do guide you.There is no public toilet available, we noticed one being constructed. We used the restrooms of the nearby hotels.  It would be better if you have your own food because there's not much options around."

Manori_Beach,cool_satchmo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Couples,Secluded beach for a nice stroll or swim,"The beach is around 1KM long and normally not very crowded. So it's a nice place for an evening stroll if you are staying overnight in one of the hotels in the neighbourhood. Parts of the beach are safe for swimming since it is a cove, but the sea water can be polluted"

Manori_Beach,matin22,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,A mini goa within 2 hours from mumbai,Manori is a small village rather a small island sandwiched between the creek of Malad to goraiIts rougly 27kms by road from andheri or shorter if  u takerhe ferry from Marve or GoraiReplete with christian goathans of colourful wooden bungalows with christ statues and  fisherfolk the look and feel is like goaMisty mornings with the chirp of birds and bullock carts to  cycles ferrying of fresh baked paos and buns you get transported to a different  worldThe beach is a white sand flat hard beach with s good hillock from where u can view the panorama of the arabian sea and watch the brahminy kites soaring with the thermalsWith a large number of small huts and bungalows turnrd into overnight stays it provides a refreshing weekend in winter.

Manori_Beach,Sireesh L,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,Top 5 weekend getaways in Mumbai,"I went during summertime in April end. The garbage on the beach might discourage you at first (I recommend your first beach experience be at night, it will be beautiful anyway). But, the cool sea breeze, starry night and the rocky hillocks few yards away will more than compensate for it. Manoribel restaurant (and hotel) nearby serves an amazing range of seafood (even veg food as per my friends). I suggest you a scrumptious lunch followed by a nap in the hammocks and finally head for the rocky hillocks for a breathtaking sunset. I recommend taking along speakers and a playlist of mellow songs (beer too). Overall most importantly don't forget to take cash, the closest (and the only) Axis bank ATM is far from the beach (near Gorai crossover) and is usually empty."
Manori_Beach,irfan544,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Cool and serene beach in kandiwali,The Monori beach is one of the beach in mumbai is too serene and cool place. Lack of people are there. I love to visit again.
Manori_Beach,Anson_Cabral,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Friends,Calm and Serene Beach in Mumbai!!,One of the good beaches in Mumbai which is yet to get commercialized. A brisk walk along the shores will take away all the frustrations and tensions of hectic work life.
Manori_Beach,Akhil1702,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016,Serene beach,Can't believe such a clean & nice beach is located within mumbai. Travel time depends on your location but worth the visit....

Manori_Beach,sandeepjainrocks,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Couples,Good Beach,"The beach can be reached by taking the ferry from Malad. The beach is nice and clean,but not so safe to venture into waters as it is rocky. Better to visit the beach only on weekend evenings as there is some family crowd during that time. "
Manori_Beach,saninsalewala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016,Amazing place for a weekend getaway,Peaceful and Enchanting away from the hustle of the City. Definitely a relaxing place for a small getaway. Clean Beaches and lesser crowd as compared to other mumbai beaches.
Manori_Beach,HEMANT SINGH NEGI,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016,Beautiful Calm Beach,"I had been to this beach as it was highly recommended by one of my friend. It was a two hour drive to reach the peaceful calm secluded beach. As I had been only for a few hours, during day time, hence there were very few people at that hour. A couple of local vendors were there selling coconut, ice gola, nimbu pani. They told us that there is enough crowd on the weekends n holidays.I also felt that it will be a good place to hang out in evening and morning. There are a number of resorts where one can stay and enjoy the natural beauty and the clean beach. But as told to us by vendor there are no water sports available, hence we can say it's not that much commercialised as Goa beaches hence one can enjoy roaming on the long beach with your friends or family. Nearby attractions include another beach named Gorai and one of the Mumbai's best amusement park called Essel World.It will be better to be there by your own vehicle or taxi, as I felt that there are not enough public transportation.Hence I will be surely visiting it again with a night stay plan, hence highly recommended."

Manori_Beach,Indraneel G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Feel of goa,Not a good time during rains. Close to kandivali.  Roads are narrow and you like goa. Avoid monsoon time.
Manori_Beach,rajibk95,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Family,Manori Beach a quick getaway within Mumbai,"The popular beaches of Mumbai are the Chowpati in the town or at Santacruz in the suburb which are so crowded you can hardly see the sand between the feet. In contrast there is one, nestled in the Manori island (though it is connected at a point). This whole area, thankfully, is out of reach of the greedy and unscrupulous reality developers hence, has retained its isolated and relaxing feel. It can be reached through public transport though it may be a bit time consuming. One needs to reach the Marwe Jetty which is in Malad West. From there a short ferry ride (which is available every 30 minutes) will take you across the narrow creek. On the other side one can take an auto-rickshaw or a tanga (horse cart) to the beach. The beach is not crowded and is perfect for a leisurely walk or for the children to play freely while you soak the evening sun or just laze on the beach. At times you will get ample sea shells on the beach which may bring back childhood memories. If one plans to stay over, there are a few resorts there which are decent and very close to the beach or on the beach itself. One of the good resort is Manoribel, the food is also good. This can be a good short trip during the week or on weekend."
Manori_Beach,Shiv Kumar M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Couples,My special day.,"I usually used to visit Manori, it is very good place for relaxation with your friends and your beloved. Nice  clean and calm area. After completed my internal training we came for outdoor activity and enjoyed lots."

Manori_Beach,RavinSadh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,"a good, peaceful, clean beach, so close to mumbai","you dont have to go to goa.. to enjoy a decent beach in our over crowded city.. the manori beach is hardly 5 minutes from marve jetty.. and due to its inaccessible location. as there is no car park , etc around.. does not find many takers.. we reached in exactly 40 minutes on to the beach.. from andheri lokhandwala.. the ferry from marve jetty is fun.. and then you have to take a rickshaw to beach, through lovely winding small lanes around the beach.. the ferries operate from as early as 6 am and charge, 10 rs a passanger, the rickshaw between 40 - 60 for the ride.. the beach has clean sand.. and no crowd.. we happened to see a photo shoot in progress with women in bikinis.. there are many cliffis around the area.. suitable for a good climb.. there are lots of shells to be found around.. and do look out for many crabs.. the beach is very peaceful and the sound of the waves and the foam is very relaxing.. however do watch out for couples making out.. we went very early in the morning.. so did not experience this.. but the later part of the day, post 11 am is . kind of frisky. almost all the rooms around the beach. are used for these kind of activities.."
Manori_Beach,Satheesh Kumar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Better than other beaches in Mumbai,"Connected with public transport(Local train-Bus-Ferry). Having high tide in the afternoon.Near by elevated land(Small mountain) is good to make a tent for day trip and spend time. Beach sand is better than other ""beaches!!"" of Mumbai. Tides are also ok.  The beach is spoiled by public now. So no more tag as ""clean beach of Mumbai!!!"""

Real quiet place as compared to the hustle and bustle of the city. Nice beach (though water is not clean), sand and rocks to have a good time. Awesome place for photography. Clean & Uncrowded Beach, very short distance from Mumbai. The beach is quite quiet during weekdays and perfect spot for a family gathering and activities. You can even explore the northern part of beach which is lot more cleaner. Or if you are just in need of a idle break ,laze off on the beach shore during sunset to experience celestial beauty."

It slopes very gently into the sea, and non-swimmers wont find themselves suddenly thrust into the deep. This was quite deserted a few decades ago, but nowadays there seems to be quite a it too many people. There are shacks / houses along the beach available for rent, but it would be advisable to either book ahead, or get there very early in the morning to secure one."
