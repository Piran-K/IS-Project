There are people everywhere and the atmosphere is good. I'm sure on a clearer day the view would be worth it.We took a stroll.. people will approach you to take your photo as you walk along..we just politely said no.. but some people still tried and secretly tried to take our photo.

Marine_Drive,Jimpat500,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nice evening ocean walk in big city,A very long curving promenade adjacent to the Arabian Sea that is a very popular evening stroll for thousands of locals and tourists. Many locals sit on the wall to watch the sunset. There are very few commercial enterprises to spoil the view.

Marine_Drive,Setting Sun,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Calm place with a good view but..,"Marine drive possesses a nice view of the city's bay area and sunsets over the sea. It's normally, pleasantly windy in the evenings although crowded and if you can find a nice spot, a good place to read a book. Great place to watch the full moon and its effect on the waves. What's changed over the years is the kind of crowd which comes here, some of whom are loud or lacking basic public decency/ civility. Tobacco spit inscriptions can be found in many places meant for sitting. This is the biggest con. Other than that, a part of marine drive has a foul smell to it and pollution makes it an unlikely spot to frequent. I normally get here to escape construction noise elsewhere in the city. Cops can be seen patrolling. Garbage bins around."
