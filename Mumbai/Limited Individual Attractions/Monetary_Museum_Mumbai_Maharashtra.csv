Monetary_Museum,Nikhil P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Best for kids,"This is a unique museum devoted to evolution of currency . It has got nice but small collection of centuries old coins, artifacts about currency. There are old currency notes on display which are no  longer in circulation. The museum has small collection but it has been nicely put. It will have more appeal to kids as compared to adults. Certain part of museum is still left for updation e.g. there is no mention of the old rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes which were banned last year.  The best part is the entry is free of cost. One can spend  upto 1 hr for the visit"

Monetary_Museum,Sandeep M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Family,A very good museum in Mumbai,"The Monetary Museum is located near the Reserve Bank of India. The Museum is located on a single floor of a high-security building. Mobile phones, cameras, etc. are not allowed in the museum.There are 6 major rooms in the Museum. The first introduces us to the concept of money. We see some old materials of exchange, as well as plastic currency and paper currency. Among the paper currency is a set of 3 notes - a Rs. 1000, 5000 and 10000 notes - all of which were demonetized in 1978. The next room features a collection of the coinage history of India. From coins, we move on to paper money, Bills of Exchange, Cheques, Banking, etc. until we finally arrive to things that the RBI does (aside from the obvious).On the whole, the museum is extremely well-curated. Entry is FREE! Since there is no photography allowed on the premises, one can purchase a set of 6 information brochures for Rs. 25 (or about 40 cents)!"

Monetary_Museum,ASocial N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Couples,Best curated museum in 5 months of India,"We stumbled across this museum by accident and its a GREAT find.  First of all it has fantastic air conditioning, which was worth its weight in gold in May in Mumbai.  There's a back check with security in the building next door, the security was a little lax and we took our valuables with us.  It's free to get in and while there are a couple of security folks in there, no one is going to follow you around and watch your every move.It contains a fantastically displayed history of money, currency and India's role in it.  Well written displays, well laid out, with both the ability to skim through or go into incredible detail.Sadly no photos are allowed, as this would make a great write up with pictures.There are examples of coinage, notes and checks from years and years ago, all placed where you can actually see them.  This is possibly the best curated museum I've seen in India in 5 months of travel."

Monetary_Museum,dangrad,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2013 • Couples,"Excellent free museum, great if you're interested in money","Stopped by here with spouse. There is a locker to place your bags and camera (no photos allowed) and restrooms and water. For 5 rupees each you can purchase three very interesting brochures (in English for foreigners): India's Comtemporary Currency, Indian Coinage, and Precious Signatures. the Story of Money in India comes with your entry. Museum is free for all. Walk next door and go through the history of money, then follow the progression of the economy in India.

Monetary_Museum,gas0,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2013,A must!,"Even if you're not into the history of coins and notes or money in general, do check it out. You would have to leave your bag a few units down at a safe locker before you go into the museum. The museum doesn't look like its part of Mumbai. Its as if, it was plucked out somewhere from western europe. The interpretives, displays and rich history of India that has been put up for display is really intriguing and informative. Kudos to the government on a brilliant project!"
