Mount_Mary_Basilica,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Old church with beautiful architecture,"I had visited this beautiful old church located at a height from the ground level in Bandra. I had gone on auspicious Christmas day and the place was crowded with devotees. I liked the Gothic style architecture of the giant church building and the beautiful decor inside the church on the occasion of Christmas. Liked the beautifully decorated idol of Mother Mary with little Jesus in her arms. There are beautiful paintings all over the inner walls of the church depicting events from the life of Jesus Christ. Many small vendors have set up their shops on the street outside the church selling candles, Christmas trees and other items."

Highly recommend it to anyone wanting those two minutes of peace and spiritual connection with God. My favourite thing to do is lighting the candle before the Mother Mary statue on the opposite side of the road.
Mount_Mary_Basilica,chintan girish modi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,An oasis of calm in a crazy city,"My last visit to this church was with a friend from the United States of America who is a pastor and a religious studies scholar. Apart from the peace and serenity we fould at this place, it was interesting for him to see practices that would be unusual for churches in his home country. What I am referring to are the various kinds of wax objects that people buy from stalls outside the church as offerings they place in front of Mother Mary because they want to fulfill their wish to get married, have a child, find a job, travel abroad, etc. "
