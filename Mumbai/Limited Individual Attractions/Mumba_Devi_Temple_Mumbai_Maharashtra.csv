Mumba_Devi_Temple,Jayan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Couples,"Though you will be trapped in traffic jam, this trip will not be a waste.","Mumba Devi is the Goddess of City Mumbai and this name derived from the name of Mumba Devi. First of all let me to warn you on a mis leading link. By depending a location in Google map, we reached a narrow street in Malad where all the garages accumulated. A very very  small temple available there. We escaped from there and travelled all the routes back and proceeded further an equal distance in the opposite direction. However, on getting the darsan of the Deity, all our despair vanished. The temple is situated in a thickly crowded  area. You will suffer a lot to reach there by vehicle. I think it is better to park vehicles at a distance more than a kilometres or so and walk towards the temple. Otherwise you will be trapped in jam. Common man's vehicle Auto rickshaw is not avaible here.േ You have to pass through the security check. Can keep foot wear in the counter available just inside the gate. Surrounding Mumba Devi some other Deities are also there and all are with in few metres apart. It is a very old temple. You will get flowers and other items for offering. Small shops serving common food like bass pav etc available near by.  Just oppsite  to Mumba Devi. One Sri Krishna temple is there. Devotees used to feed two cows there a kind of laddu prepared and placed there."

The original temple was first built in former Bori Bandar area near the Victoria terminus in 1675. But it was destroyed in 1737. Another temple was built in Bhuleshwar in 1739.  Mumba devi was the patron Goddess of Agri (salt collectors) and Kolis (Fishermen), the original inhabitants of the seven islands of Bombay. The word “Mumba” was derived from two words “Maha” and “Amba”, which means “great mother.” The fisher men regarded her as their protector and as ‘Maha Shakti”. The temple is located in Mumba Devi Road near Zaveri Bazaar. It is a narrow street with many stalls selling pooja material like flowers, fruits, copper bracelets, brass lingams, rings etc. The temple is open on all days except Monday. In the sanctum one can see shrines for Ganesh, Hanuman, Shanishwara, Krishna with Radha and Annapurna. The main Goddess is a 3.5 foot high red sandstone idol smeared with sindur. She is decked with a silver crown, a nose stud and a gold necklace. In front of her, a lion made of stone is seen. According to legend, Brahma created Mumba devi (an eight-armed goddess) to fight and vanquish a demon called “Mumbaraka who harassed pious people. The defeated demon requested her to stay here and have the name of “Mumba Devi.” The Goddess agreed and stayed there. Mumbaraka constructed a temple there and worshipped her. The temple timings are from 6.00 a.m to 9.00 a.m and from 12.00 to 9.00 p.m. Aarti is given both in the morning and evening. The nearby tourist places are Zaveri Bazaar, Crawford Market, and Chowpatty Beach at the northern end of the Marine Drive. One can go to the temple by auto from Bhuleshwar or from Charni Road station.  Many devotees come here as they believe in the great power of the Goddess who gives protection and fulfill their desires."

Mumba_Devi_Temple,prannnn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,Mumbai's Origin but very crowded,"This is one of the prominent temples located in Mumbai and in case you happen to be in Mumbai, then this is a must must visit place for you. Its said that the name Mumbai is derived from this temple and that is one of the reason that this is an iconic place. The place is very popular among the locals and that's why one would always find this place to be extremely crowded during darshan hours. The place is located in such an area that there is only one entry and exit point. as a result one would end up standing in a very long queue and it would take hours to have a glimpse of the deity inside the temple. Outside the temple there is always a heavy deployment of police personals due to security reasons and photography is strictly prohibited inside the temple. One can easily reach the place via road or train as this is just a walking distance away from the masjid railway station in the central line. for those coming from western suburb, one needs to get alight at charni road station.The visiting hours are during morning and evening"

Mumba_Devi_Temple,Shubhalaxmi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Solo,"The  homely, warm, ambience  of the place","I visited this place on 26 th of May, 2016 in the afternoon. The entrance of the temple is quite narrow as if you are entering  a friend's house.  Shops   in plenty at the entrance  and the lane going towards temple  is full of hawkers selling all the ritualistic stuff. The place can be reached from the M Ali Rd, Bhendi Bazar and also from Kalbadevi. It gives the old Mumbai ambience around. As we reached exactly at 12' noon ,we had to wait for 15 minutes as the rituals were going around inside the closed door.After that the doors were open and we saw Goddess Jagadamba, with all her glory, sitting on a lion, wearing glittering gold ornaments, blessing her devotees. The Goddess indeed looks like Mother Goddess, ever ready to offer her bounty to her children. As soon as the door opened , we were showered with holy water  by the priest. Besides the Jagdamba and Annapurna idols, the Mumbadevi,( original deity worshiped by fishermen ) is established, in a separate chamber.The temple itself is very old almost more than 200 years , established in British, India, however its cleanliness is remarkable. Also the carvings on the silver doors, paintings amd borders around the doors are class by itself .It resembles somewhat like Jain Mandir , but has its own unique presence. The marble flooring and the  golden sheets above the doors depicting scenes from Shiv Puran add beauty to the temple.For all these  reasons, the temple gives you a very pleasant, personal experience."
