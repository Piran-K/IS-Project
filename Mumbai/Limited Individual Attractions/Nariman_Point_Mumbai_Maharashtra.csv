Best place for a walk any time of the day. Well guarded by police at all hours and there are some eateries at every turn.

You have beautiful high rise structures and fast cars on one side and the vast sea on the other. You can sit here for hours and never go bored. It may be out of bounds during the monsoon. Also the cars move here with high speed, so be careful while crossing the road."
