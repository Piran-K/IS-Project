National_Centre_for_the_Performing_Arts,Ronak S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,One of the best places in Bombay for the performing arts.,"NCPA is one of Bombay's premier destination for the performing arts - music, theatre, dances. It is located at the tip of South Bombay, at Nariman Point, next to the sea and the Trident Hotel. It has 5 theatres. The Jamshed Bhabha Theatre (It's largest theatre with 1109 seats is ideal for orchestras, and is the only place in Bombay that has hosted operas and ballets. It's entrance is a beautiful ornate marble staircase. I've seen some of the best musicals (Disney's Aladdin, Mughal-e-Azam), operas (Pagliacci, Cavalerina Rusticana), concerts (Verdi's Requiem, Carmina Burana), plays (Merchant of Venice) and many others here.The Tata Theatre, with 1010 seats is laid out like an amphitheatre and has amazing acoustics and a foyer with a scenic view of the sea. It is often used for chamber concerts and talks. Dan Brown's talk after the launch of his book Inferno was held here.Experimental Theatre has a more intimate setting and 300 movable seats which allow it to be configured to suit a range of events. It's a great place for new age plays, like Motley's Father, which I saw here.Godrej Dance Theatre is a small theatre with a capacity of 200 for dance performances.Little Theatre has seating only 114. It is used to promote new talent, such as poets, dancers and musicians, and for film screenings. I've seen many Met Operas screenings here, and also the screening of Danny Boyle's Frankenstein starring Benedict Cumberbatch an Johnny Lee Miller.You'll often see some of the post residents of Bombay here, especially at events at the JBT. While there isn't a dress code, at operas and concerts, you'll see many people in suits and gowns and fine saris. Many of the popular plays get booked by members in advance, so for non-members bookings get over soon. Book in advance. All theatres have a cafe with good subsidised food. The venue is strict and won't allow food inside, and sometimes, once the performance starts, they won't allow you inside till the interval, so be on time. The NCPA Café has wonderful food (their khao sueys are really good!). They also host weddings and parties. There are toilets and ample parking, though for blockbusters, parking gets full."

The scenic beauty adds up to the beauty of the place. There are 4 auditoriums in NCPA. The Auditoriums are named after the Tatas. All sorts of performances and events, from singing to dancing to wine testing take place here. It is meant for niche segment of people. The membership fee is also quite high. Not all can become members here. We visited the place to see the SEL COUTH presented by Shiamak Davar. The place is frequently visited by celebrities. Don't miss if you get a chance to visit the place."

National_Centre_for_the_Performing_Arts,Mucharooni,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 • Friends,A Cultural Gem in the heart of South Bombay,"In a city that is obsessed about cinema and business, the NCPA is a testament to the diverse minds and energies of this dynamic megapolis. Situated on the seashore with a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea, this cultural complex boasts of 5 theatres of various sizes.. many conference and lecture rooms, two restaurants.. one casual and one more formal. parking facilities for a limited number of vehicles.. NCPA is a CSR intitative of the TATA GROUP and what a boon it has turned out to be for BOmbay. It has a dizzying number of shows, opera, cinema, dance, music, folk theatre, lectures, talks. foyer presentations.. the annual calendar is a treat for rasikas of the old and the new. I have performed and spoken several times at the NCPA and each time the professionalism of the staff and the organisers have struck a positive chord wth me and several artistes. The stages are very clean as are the green rooms and the in house cafe always has interesting fare depending on the season. I envy Bombay citizens who have an opportunity to become members and frequent the NCPA. I wish there were more centres with this vision in other parts of India."
National_Centre_for_the_Performing_Arts,Sid,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2014 • Friends,Good place for Theatre + Live Talks of great Artists.,"I have been to NCPA so many times to attend the TATA Lit Live festival. The festival is good and if you like books - one should not miss it. The worst part of this place is the staff and the arrangement, they wouldnt guide you properly as to which theatre which talk is playing, no reception ?? One person doing the registration and theres a big queue !!!! Need to improve it. I have attended some talks where the theatre was so packed that the audience had to go back. Its great place to meet talented Artists / Writers."
