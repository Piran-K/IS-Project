Nehru_Centre,jojo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Promoting Talents,"Promoting the young talents  the art gallery was  contributing much to the development of Scince and Art. The prestigious bulding  with huge size and premises standing tall having history of art, culture and  painting was utilised by many. Photgraphy was not allowed. The vision of Modern India by Nehruji  being appreciated . But the  employees needed to be more diligent and alet by guiding the visitors since noticed some not  not helpful. Need supervvision and checklist."
Nehru_Centre,Cedric N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,The Discovery of India at Nehru Center,"Had visited this memorial building in Worli a long back ago. This center has many floors and is designed as a cylinder.This memorial building houses the planetarium as well as the Discovery of India museum. Had gone to see the Discovery of India museum on the first floor. This museum showcases the history of India from the Indus Valley civilization till it's independence from British rule. It also has a Nehru gallery, British era soldier's uniform etc. Had also seen a depressing video of how Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on a TV screen. Had observed this museum as a school student as part of an educational trip. Please do not touch the exhibits inside the museum. It was great to learn about the history of India.This museum inside the memorial building is an ideal place for families, school & college students as well as history lovers. It is a must visit and should not be missed."

Nehru_Centre,DMitra,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Like this place,"I visited this place along with my family of young children. This is a good place. Actually I booked the tickets online which cost me 100/- per person. There are different show timing in different languages. I have choosen English, which was a 3 o' clock show. It started with a small demo and than we went to sky theatre to see a movie for 1 hr. Like the movie a lot. Quite interesting and knowledge building. But rush is high and sometimes too many people actually mar the full enjoyment of it. Also I feel they lack no of staff to guide all"
Nehru_Centre,592abck,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Nothing much to see,This place does not offer anything specific.There is a planetorium which is good but it is closed on Monday.

Great place for children to fall in love with science
Nehru_Centre,travel0814,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Best place for kids,Kids around 8 to 10 years old enjoyed the show as well as Discovery of India. But it is also a good place for adults. The Discovery of India is not very long so it is more enjoyable compared to other museums which can be tiring. You will also find other exhibitions in the same building. Overall a world class place for sight seeing.
Nehru_Centre,Vivek Dhadha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Educate yourself here!,Nehru Science Centre is very informative and realIt provides you with a lot of knowledge about what exists and what needs to be done for the environment. Everything here is quite practical.The best part about NSC is it has a 3D and 120 degrees theatre hall in which they play short videos and clips!Truly loved the virtual creativity of dinosaurs here!
Nehru_Centre,mkhaki2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Excellent performance venue,"This is one of the best venues for music performance. Concerts of Indian classical music are of the highest caliber, the sound is superb, AND performances generally begin on time. Which is rare in India!"

Nehru_Centre,Deb,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Visit if you have ample time,"The museum, designed by the Nations Institute of Design, is a treat to watch but you need time and inclination to appreciate it in entirety. Its based on Nehru's Discovery of India. The place strangely lack in proper navigation (in fact they had to put people inside to guide you to turn here & there). Another issues I saw were with the fonts used, some of them were so small you would need a magnifying lens to read them. You can buy a set of postcards related to the museum at Rs 3 each."
Nehru_Centre,aniket91,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Friends,Great Experience ,"It has a lot of exhibits ranging from the Mohenjo Daro, Maurayan era, Mughal empire, British rule and struggle for Independence. Great experience overall and the entry is free."

There is a lovely exhibition based on the history of India and the Nehru Centre also houses an auditorium, exhibition halls and art gallery space on hire. The Nehru Planetarium which is one of the largest capacity planetariums in the country is also a part of the Nehru Centre just across the lane dividing the two. Well worth visiting both these places on your visit to Mumbai."
Nehru_Centre,sagarsawarkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Business,Amazing auditorium ,Nehru center is perhaps one of the best auditoriums in Mumbai. The green rooms are well maintained and clean. Backstage area is quite spacious. They have ample parking for the audience as well as artists. We need more of such auditoriums I say in Mumbai.
Nehru_Centre,Ashish G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,All About Universe and stars,One of the most happening places in Mumbai for art exhibition and cultural exhibition and display centres.

Totally love and recommend this place. If I were staying nearby, I would spend most of my time here."
Nehru_Centre,vinitha v,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Family,V good infrastructure-wish it was used effectively,"We combined it with a visit to nehru planetarium (planetarium has been reviewed separately)..the place shares parking space (on the road and paid) with the planetarium but we went by uber and would recommend the same..we went for the 3pm show at the planetarium and by 4pm we were walking towards the nehru centre (which closed by 5pm)..first of all, the structure itself is awe inspiring..the interiors are also awesome and huge and reminded me of the museums in washington dc..alas, the similarity stops there..although the place has a plethora of information laid out in its 'discovery of India' exhibit (with seating benches aplenty to let u take it all in), there seems to be a general apathy towards it..but i wound recommend spending half a day here just to soak it all in and read through the explanations attached with the various exhibits..its not specifically an attraction for small kids (mine was only 3 and was pretty tired by 4)..but i guess older ones should be brought here for a definite peak into the making of India..i would recommend getting ur own food and water (the security had let us in with ours in a backpack after screening) as the ground floor canteen serves lousy stuff..the rest rooms are clean..there is no entry fee"
Nehru_Centre,SAJIDNOW,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,Cultural epicentre,"Nehru Centre has it all. The complex has Art-exhibition hall, state-of-art Auditoriums for holding Theatre and other shows, a digital library and a planetarium. But, the best part is the Discovery of India exposition. Such majestic is that permanent exposition displaying India from ancient ages till Independence, that one would seem lost in that labyrinth"

Nehru_Centre,ARUN G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Laid out of indian history from harappa till independence,"NEHRU centre is a Art gallery with 2 floors. Ground floor is nothing much when i visited. There was a painting exhibition going on and cafeteria. First floor is where  the all setup is. It starts with all about Nehru, from his childhood till his last breath. Then a display of stone age cave. Next is the civilization of India - harappa, then morya's and other establishments, muguals, East india company and finally the fight and hero's of independence.You can visit this along with Planetarium."
Nehru_Centre,GauravChand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Couples,Parking available at Nehru Centre,Nehru Centre is located next to the Nehru Planetarium and NSCI club in Mumbai.  The building has a number of conference and exhibition halls and wedding halls.  It also has a few art galleries.  The coffee shop is not well stocket.  It does have some reasonable amount of parking which is a boon in Mumbai.
Nehru_Centre,Aartichand,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,A large space with no proper planning,This is not the best laid out space. It has a large central place which is open but not much else.There are smaller rooms which hold art exhibitions and have conference rooms. The largest room is used for bigger exhibitions. However a lot of space in the center being left open makes the other rooms cramped and one feels like one is spending time maneuvering the area. The coffee shop too is below par.Avoidable.

Nehru_Centre,Pallavi K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Discovery Of India,"The Nehru Centre at Worli has a permanent Discovery Of India exhibit on the first floor which is free for entry for all. On one side, there is a life history of Jawaharlal Nehru from his birth, education, return to India, participation in the freedom struggle, etc. There are some unique photographs including one with George Bernard Shaw and Albert Einstein.The other side has India's history right from the pre-historic era to the Mauryan, Mughal, Maratha Empire and ending with India's Independence. The exhibits are quite detailed and there is so much to read and learn that one can easily spend 3-4 hours just going through everything. I loved the little tidbits mentioned against most items and recreation of Akbar's court, the jails where the freedom fighters were imprisoned, the costumes and jewellery of each era.Visiting it is like time travelling back into the past and enriching one's knowledge immensely. I hope more and more people visit this exhibit and take away something from it."
Nehru_Centre,AnilBabita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Business,History of India on 2nd floor,"beautiful museum that talks about the country pre & post independence. Anyone keen to understand the legacy of pandit Nehru, this is the place to go. The experience is worth carrying with you. remember it is not one of those museums where you could just walk around. you will have to spare 3-4 hours to see through the entire place. Photography inside the museum is strictly prohibited. there are hourly shows that talk about India & are exhibited in the theatre inside the Nehru centre. The entire experience is created for visitors/tourists at the expense of nehru centre and no one is charged a single penny!"
Nehru_Centre,Jayantpai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Family,Don't miss it...,"I consider this a hidden gem, as many are unaware of it. They often visit the Nehru Planetarium, without walking up to the first floor to visit the India Discovery Centre located just adjacent to it. This is truly a place where you either discover things you never knew about or know more about things you just knew fleetingly. India's history and culture is superbly documented over here. It is like walking into a history book. School children will really relate to a lot of the stuff out here. The environs are very pleasant and soothing. It is never crowded as such. Besides...It is 'Free'."
