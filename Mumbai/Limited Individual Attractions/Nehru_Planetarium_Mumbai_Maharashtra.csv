Nehru_Planetarium,Sani V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Must visit!,"Amazing place, well maintained and well presented. Must take your kids at least once if not regularly (they keep updating the shows). The guides are very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions beyond the regular script. The information and visuals provided in the show makes us realise how overwhelming the universe is. Indeed a thought provoking place not only for kids but also for adults. Shows are available in multiple languages and can be booked online or on the spot (they only offer limited seats online, rest is on the spot but you may see a long queue there.)"
Nehru_Planetarium,AM,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,It was truly an out-of-the-world experience for just 150rs !!,"*It's going to be a long review. Visited the Mumbai Planetarium with my 4.5-year-old daughter. It was the first time for both of us. It started with me calling the inquiry number to confirm the timings, the person who attended the call and the gentleman at the ticket counter was really considerate and even helped us understand how to use the time we spent inside the auditorium well.He even guided us to visit the museum situated right opposite, till it was time for the show. It was amazing, so massive and gorgeous but we couldn't cover it entirely and had to leave midway for the show.The show presented by Mr. Rathore was impressive from the very beginning, he knew very well how to keep his audience enthralled throughout the show and his calm voice just made the show perfect. The main show is just exceptional from the way it was structured to the way it was presented using gorgeous high-quality videos and slides that were the best, making the audience go ""wow' almost every 5 mins.Trust me, if it's your first visit you won't remember much of what you hear informatively but you will most certainly keep visiting it visually and maybe be lucky enough to revisit it in dreams just as my daughter did. We came home with tons of pictures.It was beyond words!! My daughter is already planning her next visit and has started reading more about space ever since.All the staff, including the security guards, and the attendant at the canteen were polite and helpful and the place is very clean and well equipped with all the necessary facilities. Eagerly waiting to plan another visit on a Sunday soon for planet viewing through a telescope. A single visit is just not enough :)It was truly an out-of-the-world experience just for 150rs !!"

Nehru_Planetarium,Sunny Butalia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Visit to Nehru planetarium,"Had been with kids, kids below 5 years are not requiring a ticket for the show. Also note that the tickets are booked in advance. The show is informative but small kids won't understand much. The models of satellites rockets or planets on display can be seen before you enter the dome theater."
Nehru_Planetarium,YPS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Learning about planets,"The planetarium has been making learning Astronomy a pleasant experience. The programmes are aimed at inspiring students. These includes Science quiz contest, Astro-painting, Science elocution, Astro-poetry and Astro-quiz competitions. Must visit to this nice place."
Nehru_Planetarium,trip planner,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Need to be upgrade content,"Show does not found worth as there many things to show, but there is no change in content from my childhood, Quality of sitting is also not improved from many years"
Nehru_Planetarium,Radha I,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Good place to visit,"It is a very good experience especially for children of all ages. The exhibits in the adjoining building are very good. The sky theater is a fantastic experience. They have shows in various languages, including English. It is an incredible experience for younger kids. The wieght machines corresponding to weights on various planets is a big hit with children."
Nehru_Planetarium,KeKu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Could have been much better,"This was my 3rd visit to the Planetarium. The first two were in my childhood and this one was with my son. I had fond memories from the childhood visits but this time, it was tad boring. In fact, I felt like sleeping while watching. My son also got bored after the initial enthusiasm. With such a good setup, the show can be made more interesting and informative, is what I felt at the end of the show. Apart from the show, there are few interesting things to see in the planetarium. But, it is usually crowded. And the parents, these days, are interesting in taking photos and selfies of their kids rather than reading the information, so you lose the interest and patience after some time."
Nehru_Planetarium,Himanshu Bhatt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,very interesting for science lovers,if your are interested in scientific exploration than its a perfect place for both kids and adults where you can explore the various instruments with lots of fun learning activities. 
Nehru_Planetarium,Riteshdelhi,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Family,"Faulty equipment, sub standard projection","We visited and purchased entry ticket only to be finding on door that 20% of projection is not working. Actually only half of the projection area was having video, apparently 1 projector was not working. The projection quality was bad, the projection was not even focused, looking blurry. Not expected in this age. Overall there service deserved not more than 20-30 bucks. Poor not worth a visit."
Nehru_Planetarium,Naresh1936,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019,Very interesting for star gazers,"The planetarium, situated in the heart of South Mumbai in Worli, is ideal for astronomy enthusiasts. It provides excellent opportunities for both serious students as well as hobbyists."

Nehru_Planetarium,Cedric N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,One of the 5 planetariums of India,"Had visited this planetarium in Worli a long back ago. This planetarium was named after Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.This planetarium is a popular tourist attraction. The interior of this planetarium has a dome and a projector. This show explained about the journey from the earth to space. It showed the solar system, constellations, galaxies etc. It was great to learn about space and the entire universe. Had enjoyed this show as a school student as part of an educational trip. Outside the planetarium, there is a lawn where people can relax before entering.This planetarium is an ideal place for families, school and college students. It is a must visit and should not be missed."
Nehru_Planetarium,Jeff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,Fun kind of science,"So finally I got to the planetarium this weekend, and I must say my knowledge about the things beyond earth is a little more than what I went in with. Its a great place to take your kids and educate them, with all the illustrations and live panoramas of the moon and the Mars, it is very intriguing and many of the questions regarding how it looks and how it is will definitely be clear after a visit. There is a short introduction of the solar system before the movie, which is quite well explained. The movie is well projected, the dome is quite realistic. A lot of stuff is shown in the movie and well narrated. If you are a space geek or even if you are not, you can still visit, what's the harm in learning something more right?? Hope you have fun. Oh ya the tickets are very decently priced at 100 per person, and there are timing for the movies in various languages, which is about 1 hour long. There is a small canteen inside. The staff is helpful and guiding. Have fun with the solar system. "
Nehru_Planetarium,Radha Taralekar,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019,Summer Hideout for Kids in mumbai,"With Summer breaks round the corner, this place is  certainly recommended for an educational field visit for children with friends and family. 2 hrs is sufficient for visiting and please see the Show timings and plan accordingly."

Nehru_Planetarium,Er umesh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019,Its beautiful and just good for kids,The building and land scaping is really good but when we visited the education after the visit was not working after the tour.The system of giving the headphones and history is good and is on charged basis but its bit hot.A lot many things can be added though.The entry is free of cost but you have to pay for the show and as it was a sunday it was very busy.

Nehru_Planetarium,Manish K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Decent place to take kids to learn about the cosmos,"The Nehru Planetarium forms part of the Nehru Centre in Worli in Mumbai. The planetarium may not be as impressive as the ones in Delhi or Calcutta, but offers a decent educational experience, particularly for school children to get them interested in the world of astronomy.We sat in the auditorium with a dome, where a show was played. We enjoyed the show, though after a while, it got a bit boring. Apart from the show, however, there is little to do here. There are certain space-related exhibits, but some of them were not working at the time. One can spend around 1 hr here, including the show, but if one is not interested in the show, one can give the place a skip."
Nehru_Planetarium,Sumitkumar_13,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Planetarium,Nehru Planetarium is a great place to learn about the space. Space shows and exhibits make this place attractive for children.

There are shows in English, Hindi and Marathi so do check the timings. Tickets are available but do get them in advance as most shows go full on weekends and holidays.Located at Worli there is parking around the place.

Nehru_Planetarium,Hungrymumbaiwale,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Nehru Platenarium,"Nehru Planetarium is one of the best place for kids to visit. There are so many ingeresting things there and that will help the kids to understand and to generate interest in universe or you can say geography. They have fixed show for everyday. Timings are the same. they have different timing for hindi, english and marathi. Yes the show is featured in 3 launguages. In the fhoir area they have weighting machine which show us the weight according to moon, earth, different planet, etc. The sky threate featured is show which is approximatlt 45mins and the best part about the sky threate is the screen is on the ceiling and the chairs are around the screen. It can occupy 500 people."
Nehru_Planetarium,Nikhil G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Science?,"There isnt anything new here since my first visit in 1986.

Nehru_Planetarium,Aditya K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Dull and boring,Probably they havent updated their show contents since decades. No updates about recent developments and even basic info for kids lacking. The exhibits are vintage. Only thing to do is measure your weight if you were on moon and a few planets. The display inside show is dull and causes headache. All you will keep hearing is that there are a billion gazillion stars. No real closeups or views. Please skip this one. Had been there with daughter. She found it so boring.
Nehru_Planetarium,Nikita G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Worth your time and money,"I had pre-booked a planetarium show at 12 in the afternoon a day before. It is also recommended on their website to pre-book at least a day in advance. If you want an English show (once per day at 3pm) specifically, it is better to book 2 days in advance, especially during holidays and vacations. We went with the Hindi show since the English one was almost fully booked when I checked. It is very easy to book on their website and the ticket can be shown on the phone.They give around 10-15 minutes to click pictures and look at the displays.When the show starts, initially one of the planetarium employees shows and describes how the night sky is going to look that particular night. After that, the biography of the universe show is played. The show was sufficiently interesting and the seating was also good. We were towards the middle of the planetarium."
Nehru_Planetarium,ajit patil,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018,Good informative place.,"Good informative place about our past history, culture etc. Very Good for students.Wee Managed, Free of cost entryNicely maintained. Clean & neat."
Nehru_Planetarium,Deb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Worth a visit,"I was foolish not to to know that online booking was possible, we were looking for the English show at 3PM (there is only 1 English show each day) but it was housefull when we reached at around 2:30PM, even the latter Hindi show went full while I was in queue. SO I booked for 12Pm next day online. Amazing show and lots of things to look at (and get pictures clicked) inside the gallery while you wait for the show, won't spoil the fun by detailing them here. Don't miss it, especially if you are with kids."
Nehru_Planetarium,virenblogs,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Average experience,"Only place in Mumbai which has shows on solar system. It has dome to get the real effect. However, the chairs spoils everything. They are not at all comfortable. Also, the kids (who are the real target audience) find it difficult to push the chair back to get the actual sitting position to view the dome. In spite of being a government run facility, staff was not rude. Visit this place with no great expectations and you will be fine."
Nehru_Planetarium,Hridyanand Gupta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Great planterium,Nehru planterium is a one of the best planterium in india .Peaple can se planet and star as like as orignal from this planterium.

Nehru_Planetarium,Rupinder Oberoi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,A Fun with Science,"I was tired of Mumbai's hot and humid weather of Mumbai. My 10 year old son had heard of a movie being played in Nehru Planetarium. He insisted and we went. The place is spacious, well lit and cool. The movie about stars in 3Dstyle is amazing. You will feel like you are in the sky. big stars, stones, planets, the difficult story of universe is told in minutes. Amazing experience.But don't take little toddlers for they will not be able to appreciate such a movie in dark.canteen is not good . clean and secure place. There's pictures, lovely studio."

Nehru_Planetarium,AmolMathur,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Could be soo much more,"We visited with our 4 yr old daughter and she being interested in start and planets did not connect with the show one bit. Kids above 12 yrs or so will enjoy better and this is purely information exchange based session. Graphics are extremely dated as one wld expect with a typical indian gov. Based setup. Has not changed since I was a kid. Did not make me nostalgic in any way, just ticked me off even more. Seating is not as comfy as one wld expect. Personally I wld not recommend it as a specific spot to visit in Mumbai.  "

Nehru_Planetarium,Priti1313,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Place for kids,"It's a place to be visited with young kids. Its well maintained and it's quite informative. Various shows are conducted within interval of time in english, hindi and marathi language. For kids its a nice place to know and get more insights about different planets, stars. Requires more information about the constellations and should include more about space."
Nehru_Planetarium,Pinkesh J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Place visited by most Kids,"It is one of those places which almost every kid in Mumbai must have visited. It was a thrilling experience when I went there almost 3 decades back. However it seems that the place has not kept pace with the changing technologies and kids appetite for knowledge. For new generation kids the experience might not be as thrilling as they are already exposed to more presentable content through other channels. Still a good place for kids to get first hand knowledge on astronomy. Note that there are some special sessions that happen only during predefined days and time slots, so make sure you book for those sessions in advance (preferably online) so that you don't miss out."
Nehru_Planetarium,iSeePlaces,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Family,History repeats itself ,"Having grown up in Mumbai,  every child remembers their first visit to the Nehru planetarium.  So we took our daughter to her first show at the dome this Sunday and were so pleasantly surprised by how current it still is. There is so much that has changed and still so much is the same.... I would highly recommend this activity for anyone with kids and 1 hour to spare."
Nehru_Planetarium,Vasudev S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,Kids these days won't like it.,"Bare minimum of what makes it planetarium.It starts with one person giving introduction about our solar system then waiting then moving for the dome show which last about 30 min and then done.I was there with my son and he wasn't even a bit happy, I remember going there when I was a kid and it was exciting but with new age cinema and youtube this literally feels outdated.I wouldn't recommend this to my friend."

Nehru_Planetarium,Cassi D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Good place to introduce the solar system to kids,"This place is really good. The exhibits are nice and if time is available do check your weight on earth and compare it to your weight on the Sun and other planets like Mars etc. The solar system is explained well by Jatin, and the children too like to hear about it. Then after checking the other exhibits we enter the sky theatre which is dome shaped and the seats can be adjusted to see the whole place. This gave a knowledgeable insight to the whole galaxy. Must do with the kids. Something different"
Nehru_Planetarium,KapilDwivedi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Family,Nice place to learn science.,"Nice place where you can learn a lot on science having 4different shows based on planets in various languages English, Hindi and Marathi. good learning place for students."
Nehru_Planetarium,Masher16,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Good experience but short duration,"I visited the planetarium with my teenage son, and the experience was good. You need to book tickets online at least one day prior to the show. The dome accommodates nearly 500 people so you can expect long queues. However, it was well managed, and we got inside in no time. Before you enter the auditorium, there is a gallery which displays large pictures of the planets and the Milky Way galaxy. A presentation on the solar system is made in the gallery before people are asked to enter the dome shaped auditorium. Children can also get themselves clicked behind an astronaut's suit. The auditorium is beautiful and well maintained with silhouettes of all major & important structures of Mumbai gracing the complete circle of the structure. The actual show is interesting but lasts for just about 30 minutes which is disappointing. With the help of projectors,the entire dome is lit up to give a virtual view of the night sky and the galaxy. Seats are adjustable to enjoy the view. Good experience but could have been better."
Nehru_Planetarium,sushila hariharan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,A delightful insight into our solar system,The Nehru Planetarium is one of the very few places in our country which builds a scientific temperament in children and enthuses them to study about space. The show at 3.30 p.m in English is very well conducted with in depth explanations given by enthusiastic staff. Children understand concepts of gravity by checking their body weight on machines assuming they were in Jupiter and on the moon. Please visit this amazing scientific educational initiative.
