Nehru_Science_Center,Sani V,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Family,Lovely place to get kids attracted to science.,"Loads of knowledge presented in an entertaining manner. Kids just love this place,  one can spend whole day here. If you want to watch all shows etc. then plan it well at start of the day. Tips to overcome drawbacks - 1) it gets crowded ins second half especially during holidays, so be there early 2) washrooms are decent overall but the one near canteen is best 3) food here is not great, better to bring something and eat in the open space provided for doing so."
Nehru_Science_Center,Mariya C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,A must see!,My family and I loved our visit to the science centre.  The kids couldn't get enough of the hands on exhibits and the staff were very helpful.  We would definitely like to return!
Nehru_Science_Center,keshwanand kaushik,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 • Family,Mumbai Darshan ,"Nice place to visit with family specially for the children. Here there's 3 types of show other than the scientific corner like sound, light, machine, photography and many other. It is 4 to 5 hours taking place even more time when childrens are science interested."
Nehru_Science_Center,Experienced comments,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 • Solo,un necessary waiting,first up all at the main entrance gate ticket counter was closed during working hours.ticket counter employee went to eat lunch during working hours when i askes to watchman he said. watchman was also rude with behaviour. management seems no control over such employee. i guaranteed this employee recruited through reference not by merit. these emplyee doesnt have vaue for job they keep visitors on waiting. actually nehru science center management itself seems lazy and fool. oddessy show watchman was very rude he insulted me with shouting when i asked him for show exact location. this incident was taken placed on 5 th oct 2022 you can check video recording at nehru center at around 12 pm
Nehru_Science_Center,jojo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,Very Informative,"Science Center is very useful having Science Park, Science Centre, Science Odyssey,Science Park Auditorium, Library, Exhibitions,Picnic areas etc being utilised by many especially children being arranged by Schools and Colleges as part of study programmes. Shows were availble. The employees needed to be more helpful and diligent."
Nehru_Science_Center,vinay k,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Altime best,"Dear people my advice to you is take your children's to this place instead of movies and all,this place is best to explore many science and its project , more practical approach is here to know how stuff works  I used to go here since 20 years"
Nehru_Science_Center,Youngest_traveler_,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Solo,Good place to visit kids .,"Nehru science center is located at Mumbai one of the must visit place in mumbai.  The structure of the science center is awesome. Many knowledge you gain when you visit there and you can also try the things practically too . Awesome place to visit.  You should visit this place. With regards , Youngest_traveller_ "
Nehru_Science_Center,Gautam Pendharkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Science for all,"A must visit place with children and adults alike. Lot of scientific laws in physics, atmosphere, liquids etc explained very well through games, consoles and apparatus. It has not only section on science, but also India's culture, human and animal history, nuclear science, sounds and music, a dome theater for various educational shows and a park. It better if you take a whole day for seeing the entire center. While returning back at night, we also got a chance to view planet Venus through one of the telescope which was operated by a lady, kind enough to let children get a glimpse of it. All in all a wonderful experience, in a nominal fee of Rs. 70 pp only. For any shows at the theater extra Rs. 75 pp. We need more such centers all over to spark interest in science for general public."
Nehru_Science_Center,Radha I,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,The show on Pacific Rim was good,"Overall good experience. Kids loved it especially the exhibits on natural phenomena, Physics and biology. The model of heart is beautiful. Overall maintenance should be improved. Also need for better signs/indicators. Children had a great time in the play area also."
Nehru_Science_Center,Mohammad Kamran Arvi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2019,Great place for kids to learn about Science,Needs a whole day to explore with kid. It has something for all age groups. Needs some up-keeping of the equipment but nonetheless a lovely experience.
Nehru_Science_Center,Cedric N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,The largest interactive science center in India,"Had visited this science center in Worli a long back ago. This science center was named after Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.This science center is a popular tourist attraction. It showcases many scientific artifacts, interactive experiments, innovative inventions etc. It has a garden with plants, shrubs and trees. It also covers various aspects of science & technology. It hosts events like science competition, science exhibition etc. Had visited this science center as a school student as part of an educational trip. It was great to learn about different aspects of science & technology in an interactive manner.This science center is an ideal place for families, school as well as college students. It is a must visit and should not be missed."
Nehru_Science_Center,BomiPardiwalla,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Great.,"Great for ALL students. introduction to the world of Astronomy. The main fun is in the sky theatre where the planetarium is world-class, superb and entertaining. meant for all ages, and a must-see place."

Nehru_Science_Center,meena1981,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 • Friends,largest science centre of India,"It is India’s largest science center. It has a magnificent collection of plant, shrubs and science exhibit..The centre have a variety of science exhibits ranging from the lazy see-saw to planetary Motion.The center also has a library which has over 10,000 books on various disciplines.3D shows is shown here related to science.screened here.One can see and understand complex principals and working of any model or theory."
Nehru_Science_Center,Shubham,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Family,Nehru Science Center,"It is a must visit place located in Worli. It has many activities and science experiments to learn and enjoy. It also has video show. Nehru Science Centre has more than 500 hands-on and interactive science exhibits on energy, sound, kinematics, mechanics, transport, etc. installed in the science park and different gallaries. Children should definitely visit. "
Nehru_Science_Center,Hitesh S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,"if you love science, this is must","SCIENCE centre, where you can see , feel the  various type of science, physics,bio,chemistry,enginerring, kids will definetly love, mustSEE."
Nehru_Science_Center,Enjoy P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Fake information about Nehru !!,"Great place to be with kids and families. wonderful place for school, day trips etc . Nehru has shown to taken JANEYU, and photos of him are displayed as him being Hindu batuk for bhiksha. These are fake and there is no proof of their original religious faith as they were seen following different religious faiths with various back grounds. Our children are informed wrongly.Other than that, science information is well written and great hands on strategies incorporated on displays. During my visit some kids of other schools especially youths , tempered with the artifacts and tried to break it . kids should be very well informed that it is not exceptable and should never attempt to do so , as it creates lack of positive information to other kids and sets bad example ."
Nehru_Science_Center,Vasim,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Fun filled learning,This is nice place to spend a day with kids. Lot of things for the kids to do and learn practically.Be ready to walk.
Nehru_Science_Center,KhalidNavigator,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Excellent,The science center has a lot to offer. Right from the kids to the grown ups there is something interesting for everyone.
Nehru_Science_Center,MANCHIMASTER,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Nehru science centre,Nehru science centre at Moses road is worth the visit .if you have children this visit is a.must as very educative
Nehru_Science_Center,Nikita G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Lots of fun for young children above 7 years.,"The science center is crowded on holidays but not unreasonably so considering it is Mumbai. Inspite of the huge volume it sees, I would say it is well maintained.Right opposite the ticket counter is a park with science-related experiments in a play setting. We spent almost an hour there and the daughter had a lot of fun. There are different sections in the centre like science for kids, light and sound, biology etc. There are also a couple of shows which you can see there. Although I think the Science Odyssey show was a waste of time. We reached around 3 and the center closes at 6. So we were not able to cover everything. Plan to spend atleast 4 hours there."
Nehru_Science_Center,tushar_pai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Crowded but really nice,"Reading the earlier comments, was a bit worried about taking our 8 yo to the Science Centre. But she thoroughly enjoyed the day and it turned out to be much better than expected. Yes it is slightly ill maintained but there’s so much to do and see. Some of the exhibits were definitely updated with time like the one about Nobel Prize winners which had the 2018 winners.When you pay your entry fee at the entrance you are also given a choice of attending a timed show at the Science Odyssey, which is a dome theatre. My daughter quite liked the show about naval ships and warfare. The 3D show for which tickets are available separately near the other theatre is really not worth it. The mirror maze and many other exhibits provide a lot of entertainment and learning.The canteen provides some good food and it was sufficient for a lunch break. Although we had plans of visiting the Planetarium nearby, we ended up spending almost 4 hours at the Science Centre itself.There were hundreds of school kids as well as Mumbai Darshan tours although it was a weekday. The centre was really crowded although it did not hamper our experience.It was a day very well spent."
Nehru_Science_Center,virenblogs,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Excellent place for children,"Although not exactly a well maintained place, it is still nice to spend around half day here. The show (on submarines and navy) was absolutely fantastic. The models were great too. Children can actually touch these scientific experimental models and see how it works. Also, time this such that you visit nehru planetarium on the same day. They both are 2 kms apart. Taxis are easily available. Bus (BEST - 154) from Byculla or Mahalaxmi is there too."
Nehru_Science_Center,KeshavChakraborty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Couples,A must visit place for Science lovers,You have to spend at least 2-3 hours if you are interested in science matters and if you want to have good exposure for your child.You can enjoy photography also as there are many halls including the prehistoric Jurassic age.You can also satisfy your hunger in the canteen situated at ground floor.
Nehru_Science_Center,tarique73,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,FAMILY VISIT,Worth Visiting  Atleast once a Good Place For Knowledge and entertainment..Timing for Odyssey show should be kept in mind to enjoy the thrill of the show.. FOR ODYSSEY ..ALTHOUGH STILL SHOULD BE MAINTAINED PROPERLY..
Nehru_Science_Center,ddg70,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Superb Science museum,"I visited this place as part of Mumbai Darshan tour and I'm really impressed with all the exhibits. All of the exhibits were working and pretty good information was given to understand the reason for each of the experiments. The museum is vast and you should keep at least 3 to 4 hours if you want to look at each of the exhibits and learn with your kids. There is a show also, make sure to go at least 15 minutes before the show to get seats as it's very popular and the seats get filled fast."
Nehru_Science_Center,amithem,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Family,Average,For kids around 10 or above as the science based kiosks should be understandable to enjoy . It’s in one was knowledgable and amazing provided you really understand the science behind everything . Otherwise it’s just like a magic show for kids and adults.
Nehru_Science_Center,Laxman G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,Visit to Nehru Science center,"Good for kids , but needs proper maintenance by authorities . We enjoyed the visit  and recommend it for all . "
Nehru_Science_Center,Kaustubh J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018,"Excellent exhibition halls, a great way to arouse interest of kids in science",There are multiple exhibition halls that show various science experiments. The best part of the center are the courses conducted during vacations. The facilities and infrastructure is great.
Nehru_Science_Center,pratiknruparel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Not well maintained but still good!,"From this place, probably millions of kids and visitors have learned many science facts and other stuff but the place is not maintained nicely. But still it is a good place to visit."
Nehru_Science_Center,devenigma,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Family,Good science intro for kids in a fun way,"We had an enjoyable time when we visited the Nehru Science Center (NSC) which is the largest interactive science centre in India. The park area has lovely archaic models of a railway engine, a tram car, an aircraft and other fascinating artefacts. The main building contains many attractive and interactive exhibits based on scientific principles. Every floor/section has a different theme; for example, there are sections like ""Sound and Hearing"", ""Light and Sight"", ""Climate Change"", ""Prehistoric Life"", ""Mirrors"", etc. There are also 3D shows and science shows playing at certain intervals of time. NSC provides a great platform to showcase concepts of science to kids through practical applications.The Energy Model is the most popular exhibit at the science museum. This mini roller coaster that takes a ball for a thrilling ride: down slopes, in concentric circles and on a ride on roller skates showcases how energy is converted from one form to another.We also saw the 30 minute documentary titled ""America Wild: National Parks Adventure"" in the Science Odyssey dome theatre.My only criticism would be that the concerned authorities should pay serious attention towards maintaining and upgrading the facility and repairing the non-functional exhibits; especially, the ones in the outdoor area.Overall, it's a enjoyable place to spend a few hours with kids and also to acquaint them with science in a fun way."
Nehru_Science_Center,J Chand,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Old glory...Now poorly maintained,"Nehru science center, worli, is very good place for science lovers. Its good place to learn basics of science with exhibits. But now it looks very poorly maintained. Major exhibits are not working properly. Shows are running in which they show old documentaries, which in ths era of internet looks outdated and useless. If management takes initiative to maintain it properly we may have great centre to encourage children towards science ."
Nehru_Science_Center,coolreena,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Loved it .... ,"I just loved everything about this place. My son was super duper happy to see the old engines and the trams that were kept on display. We also waited at the canteen - loved it , there were so many beautiful trees, birds and butterflies around us.Then we saw the science show and it was really conducted very well. It had a lot of practical application of science to day to day life activities.Then we saw the the science on sphere. The pictures were breathtakingly beautiful and we learnt a lot about the solar system.I am a mother was another beautiful show. My son had fun with so many beautiful things that explain concepts of science so very well. However, some of them were not working. Last, we saw the science odyssey. We spent more than 5 hours here and still feel that there was so much still left to be seen. Will definitely visit this place again. "
Nehru_Science_Center,Sudip R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,If u r a science enthusiast and if u have a young children then this place is great,"Lots of science experiments ( fundamental principles of physics and chemistry ), a 3 d show in the dome theatre, sound and light experiments, quiz online tests, only issue is that this place doesnt have airconditioning and most ceiling fans are not working, very tough to sustain in summer. My daughter was very curious but due to heat and suffocation she lost interest after an hour. Also the maintenance standards of the place is very very poor. Looks like a state govt office. Its sad how we maintain this marvellous place which ignites millions. Govt must have a relook, even the kolkata museum and science city is much better in terms of upkeep. I visited on 29th April. "
Nehru_Science_Center,Ashish G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,A must visit for science lovers,"It is a great place to take your kids. A lot of exhibits to spark their imagination. One star less for the lack of ventilation and the fact that many exhibits are in disrepair. But, it has to be said that it is more than value for the price of admittance."
Nehru_Science_Center,Gaurav Verma,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Good place to spend half day.,We been here with out teen daughter. The place is in average condition. Most of the models kept in garden are not working. The steam and electric engine here are best time pieces.The odissy is also good to see a movie in dome for 25 minutes was a good experience.It needs a facelift now.
Nehru_Science_Center,Bharat Gupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,Nehru Science Centre Review,"It is a good place to take children to for one full day. However, it is not a great place as the models are quite old, not with time. It needs continuous upgradation. The ticket charges can be increased so that the money earned could be spent to upgrade the centre."
Nehru_Science_Center,Sumant S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Fun with science !!,"The centre needs to come up exhibits and move with time. However, overall its good where children can learn concepts of science in a fun way..Sound section was good and my son had a really good time in the mirrors section."
Nehru_Science_Center,kvli,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Solo,Outdated,"The centre is outdated and needs renovation. Many items don't work. However, the entrance fee is low so it is worth the money. "
Nehru_Science_Center,Anup M,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Not well maintained ,"I remember my child hood memories and how I loved to go there. Sadly, all the display is still the same. Would have expected the science center to upgrade themselves with today’s world. All the stuff is now very old ."
Nehru_Science_Center,Khushroo B,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Science and fun,"It was the Christmas vacations and wanted to spend time with family, had to do something which my son would enjoy.We decided to go to Nehru Science Center. Fairly good experience, good learning. He place improved by leaps and bounds since had visited it a decade ago. There is a dome theatre which showed a wild life documentary. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Must visit for kids. We meet several schools bringing their children there for the field trip. "
Nehru_Science_Center,Robert F,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Fun for kids,"This spacious indoor/outdoor center is full of interesting gadgets and displays for children and adults. It has suffered somewhat over the years and not all the exhibits function properly but there are plenty of things to touch and examine. If you are taking a very young child be careful as it is not really ""child proof"" and there are places that children could fall and get hurt."
Nehru_Science_Center,592abck,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,Good place with kids but some exhibitions not working,"Good place with kids but some exhibitions not working. However, whatever is available, it is worth visiting."
Nehru_Science_Center,SKB,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Needs proper management ,"Hi, I had visited Nehru Science center last month with my son and wife. I have already visited science center in Kolkata and Bangalore and found most of he things similar. The bad thing is most of the exhibits are not working. Being in Mumbai such things must be taken care of. If you are going first time in a science center you may find some of the things interesting. Kids will defenitely enjoy. Planetarium is good. You can enjoy science odyssey. This show has separate ticket. Overall you can go there with children one time. "
Nehru_Science_Center,Footprints727663,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Friends,Amazing Place,"I went to Nehru Science Centre. Nehru Science Centre has more than 500 hands-on and interactive science exhibits on energy, sound, kinematics, mechanics, transport, etc. installed in the science park & different galleries. It is great place to go."
Nehru_Science_Center,Shailesh N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Nice place for kids.,"Nehru science centre is a day well spent with kids and for kids.There are lot of science experiments which demonstrates science laws.Science centre covers Biology,Physics and Chemistry.One section is dedicated to mirrors reflection refraction and tricks.Though some sections needs to be maintained well but basic science could be cleared by children first hand.There is a planetarium which has shows on space and animal.please check subject and show timings at entry point.The place shuts down at 6pm so it is advised to go in morning hours as the tour takes almost 2 hours.   "
Nehru_Science_Center,Praveen D,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Very poor management,This is my third time and found that the center is decaying gradually. 80% of the experimental setup not functional. Over crowded and you may not even think about science at that place. Food in canteen is worse..
Nehru_Science_Center,rao-ash,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2017,Inspiring activities and engagement for children/teenagers,"this science centre requires a whole day or two for exploring the activities. at the time we visited, the tickets were INR50. the exhibits are somewhat similar to the science centres abroad.there's a garden to play and few short movies you can opt to watch but the tickets are extra. please ensure that your timings do not clash. there are clean toilets, canteen and a science toys store within the premises."
Nehru_Science_Center,vinayraichur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 • Couples,Good fun,"Good place to have fun & learn at the same time, Must visit place for kids.Nice evening outing option"
Nehru_Science_Center,Akansha P,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 • Couples,In dire need of a make over,"So I was confused between Nehru Science Center and Nehru Planetarium. Went here...read about the 3D Alaska film etc. It was good to have a 180 degree dome viewing experience.However it can be so much more... it can be such a good museum, but it is painfully lost in some bygone era. Everything is worn out, or broken .. it has dust and grime everywhere. The dinosaurs in the open garden are also broken and full of dust. It is an important museum and I really hope this place gets funding to do a complete facelift."
Nehru_Science_Center,Shreyansh182,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Science Museum from 1940s!,"I have visited 6 science museums in 6 different countries, and had no major expectations from the one in mumbai as I kind of expected it to not measure up. But being a fan of science museums in general, I wanted to see what do we have in my own city.What I found wasn't something that just doesn't measure up, it was shocking and horribly inadequate. Most of the equipment on displays dont work (not joking on ""most""). Most displays are also very tired and dated. Also, a highly annoying feature is no air conditioning almost everywhere - in a few places where you might want to stay, the heat drives you away. Many of the models of dinosaurs, or the planetarium etc seemed like a laughably cheap concoction of some hollywood movie. An embarrassment for Indians to have such a science museum in their financial capital. Every other place I saw maintains its museums to a very high standard and those are the things that not only gets tourists, but also sparks scientific curiosity - and this one fails miserably here.Neither you, nor the govt should not waste its time here, and sell this prime real estate to raise money which can finance a reduction of 0.5% income tax for all Indians for a year."
Nehru_Science_Center,ravi_j_shah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Family,Invaluable source of knowledge,"I've been twice to Nehru Science Center with my two nephews of 10 and 5 years of age. There is so much to see, read and understand from this place. Every floor has a different theme based collection of models, facts, experiments.Definitely worth a visit for kids and science/history explorers."
Nehru_Science_Center,Sumithran,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Family,Great place to visit with kids,"This place is a must see attraction if you have school going kids. The children can definitely learn a lot of scientific concepts by various experiments shown in the centre. The centre has various sections such as aerospace, climate change, pre-historic, house of mirrors, nuclear science etc. There are also regular shows on various topics. The entire tour would take about 3 hours. Some exhibits are definitely in need of maintenance. A small park and picnic spot with lots of tress and plants is there in the compound. Sufficient parking is also available."
Nehru_Science_Center,prannnn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Good place for kids for once in a lifetime visit,"The place is very prominent within the city and the main purpose of this place is to inculcate an interest for science but unfortunately, they hardly have anything new in this place. The exhibits and experiments displayed needs to be changed regularly with time but that doesn't seems to be happening. It would be a good experience for kids as they would be able to get a glimpse of the various concepts and displays related to science. most of the concepts are displayed through puzzles and games which would be loved by children. So in case you need to show the various concepts of science to your kids then this would be a good choice but for a once in a lifetime visit as frequent visit would be very boring and they don't have anything new here.as far as reaching this place is concerned one can do so via public and private transportation and given the prominence of this place, one wouldn't have any difficulty in reaching the place at all."
Nehru_Science_Center,karanp406,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Family,Nice place,I just loved this place... Really going to this place with your children's is great... One of the best place ever I loved it.. I enjoyed a lot here ... Just visit this place one time you will love it...
Nehru_Science_Center,venkateshkini,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Family,"Disappointed, nothing changed in 30yrs",I was disappointed as the exhibits have neither been changed or new added. Just about bring maintained but the dinosaur exhibits outside are in serious need of maintenance. Is really not maintained much other than the drive way where repair seems to be underway. The exhibits haven't changed in 30 years. The only visitors seem to be the Mumbai darshan visitors. Even the science odessy show is dated with the hindi version of Alaska in a small done.  Nothing special or interesting .
Nehru_Science_Center,umesh kumar sha... r,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Business,I was at this place for a two day conference,"I travelled to this place to attend a two day conference with a lot of international delegates. This place is so lovely. It has a museum as well. The conference hall was also so spacious and well lighted. Whoever comes to Mumbai, please do visit this."
Nehru_Science_Center,pramilacastelino,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Friends,Good place for science lovers,I have been here to attend quizzes and seminars and must say that it is the most appropriate place for people who love science as you attain lots of knowledge here.

Nehru_Science_Center,Moiz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,"Good place, but need facility needs update and maintenance","This is a good place to go with family. The exhibition are for all ages and even my 4 years old had a great time. He went completely gaga over the dinosaurs display.Tickets, including movie which is of around 35 mins, is 100 bucks per head. No discount for kids. Above 2 years it's full ticketHowever, the facility really needs maintenance and upgrade. Some dinosaurs were broken. 30% of exhibits  were not working. The 3d shows was not operational and in the odyssey theatre the screen was clogged with dirt. However, saying all this too the place is really worth visiting one time. It's a good learning place for all ages. I just wish that the management would keep it up to date and maintain all the exhibits. "
Nehru_Science_Center,Muguncjb,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Solo,Not much impressing,"Visited this science center as part of one day Mumbai tour. The science center is small actually which has displays to understand various fields of science and engineering. If you have visited Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum in Bangalore, then this Science center will look so small to visit. Also the building needs renovation.  it has a cafeteria and our bus has chosen this attraction point to couple with lunch. The lunch was not expensive but neither it tasted good but an average food we can have. Outside the center there is a mini park like area with trees and benches to rest.  There are some mud/plaster sculptures which includes dinosaurs can be seen in bad state. This attraction needs about an hour or so."
Nehru_Science_Center,Harshad Panchal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,Wonderful place for youngsters.,"This is a wonderful place specially for youngsters. All children enjoying the experiments. When you are in the compound you realize that there is a seperate place for picnic, where you can sit under the trees to relax and have some food. There is an ongoing exhibition about pulses now.Some children were looking at the exhibits as if it was magic. It has various exhibits related to physics.I have been at this place after around 10years and I had  a flashback of my memories.The only concern is that this place needs some renovation to be done now. Some new exhibits should be introduced now as per todays technology.Overall it is a fun time place for family and specially for children."
Nehru_Science_Center,Amitabh Gupta,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,Good exhibits... ,Nice place with pretty decent exhibits related to basic science concepts. The problem is that most people come and use them as toys... no one reads what the notes and it can be a ruckus. The show in the globe theatre is complete waste. Please go on odd days like weekdays or if you are off but not on holidays. 
Nehru_Science_Center,Sarbajit G,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 • Couples,Nice place. Needs better maintenance ,"I have been to Science Centers in other parts of the country and there are similar issues elsewhere as well. There is no denying that in today's day and age of smart phones and internet, it is extremely difficult to keep pace and be relevant. The primary objective, I believe,  for a Science Centre is to get the young excited about science. This place does it well. They have various exhibits of physics,  chemistry, natural history etc across multiple levels. Further, an auditorium is also there for educational videos.  However,  the format has remained unchanged in almost a decade. Maybe I have visited too many but I also feel that new additions have not been done. Also,  many of them need urgent repair "

Nehru_Science_Center,jjrao2011,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Family,Treasure of Knowledge,"We visited this on 5th Oct2016. Good for kids. They will certainly enjoy and understand the physics and chemistry. There are science shows including 3D shows. However, if you have visited other science centres in India  viz. Kolkotta, this will be an old one and not updated to the recent developments. In comparison, this is not worth to visit.There is parking available inside. Cafeteria is there but food is so so. Good greenery around. To reach here, the nearest local railway stations is Mahalaxmi."
