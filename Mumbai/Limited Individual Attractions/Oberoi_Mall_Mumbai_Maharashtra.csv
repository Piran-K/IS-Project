Oberoi_Mall,GEETANJALI,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Unprofessional staff,"Worst Mall Worst Security system. The security people are not at all professional, they don‚Äôt have proper briefing and basic etiqoettes.. not at all trained properly .. I was taking my picture and this security person named Rakesh comes up with this information that taking pictures in Oberoi mall is not allowed, and we have to take written permission, I asked when this started? And where is it written so after spoiling my mood he quickly vanished coz he didn‚Äôt have any answer .. wow so unprofessional.. heard this for the first time in my life that you can‚Äôt even take a picture in a mall as if we‚Äôre breaching some national security. Firstly the movie which we went to watch was so bad the sound system was too loud at the time of playing ads and when the movie started it was extremely low.. then this kind of staff in security system to ruin customer‚Äôs mood. Not at all acceptable. Even after complaining to the management they went on escape mode.. very unprofessional staff"

Oberoi_Mall,Vijeta,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Pathetic Customer Service,"I am highly disappointed with the service from Oberoi. I left my card there and nobody bothered to inform me for the same. You guys take contact number, send the OTP and then do the billing but still.  Poor lady from a brand called me to inform me about the new stock and I called her back to confirm for the same. You should highly work on your lost and found department and your "" Customer Service"" Department, which has staff who are not ready to do any service."

The mall is not the largest in Mumbai or even in Malad for that matter, but is a good place to hang out for residents of this and neighbouring suburbs.The mall has a premium multiplex and a relatively small, but nice Namco Gaming centre for the little ones. Among the places here of note are the British Brewing Company and Goregaon Social. The mall has a nice collection of fast food options in its food court and regularly holds movie themed events in its main atrium.

At times we also come here for lunch. The places we visit are Maharaja Bhai, Asia Kitchen and Farzi Cafe. It also has a large food court. The other place is of course the Star bucksThus the mail has been a melting pot to eat out for me.While there are lot of retail outlets I have not visited them much. There is however something unique about this mall. The lift from Basement only comes to Ground floor and from there you can take a respective elevator/escalator to any floor of your choice. Thus its a good idea to force you to go around the mall and activate your buying instincts. A nice place to hang out."

Oberoi_Mall,2016_NAS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good place to spend some time,"Went here for lunch with a friend. We had coffee at the Starbucks first. The Starbucks is sort of open seating on both sides of the coffee bar. The service is fast and the coffee was the usual Starbucks quality. We then tried to get into the Farzi Cafe restaurant but found it to have a long waiting time. We instead went to the food court to try fast food. It has multiple options such as McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, etc. The service at KFC was quite slow, but the food was the usual quality.There are also shopping options such as lifestyle and other branded stores to try. A good way to spend an afternoon. There is also a PVR multiplex for watching movies"

Oberoi_Mall,Lisa B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Good carpet shopping!,"We were looking for Kashmiri carpets for our home and the Oberoi Mall was recommended. We happened in to a shop that has been in the Khazir family for several generations, and is now run by cousins Javed and Suhil. They were patient and exceedingly gracious and we really enjoyed our shopping experience. Do not be fooled by the tiny storefront - they have lots of stock stored nearby. We have done a lot of rug shopping around the world, and these guys were exceptional. Their prices were fair and quality excellent."
