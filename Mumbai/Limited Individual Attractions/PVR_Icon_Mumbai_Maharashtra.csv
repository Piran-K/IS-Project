Wonderful movie watching experience, but the prices are too expensive."

PVR_Icon,Shaheen K,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 â€¢ Solo,Beware of PVR,"Was disgusted with my experience this evening. After checking the availability and price of ticket (Rs. 280/-), I decided to watch Hobbes and Shaw, but on arriving at PVR,  was told to cough up Rs.600/- per ticket!! This is fraudulence at its best. The cinema hall was empty according to book my show,  PVR just decided to rob me in complete daylight and this is unacceptable!!  They are cheats and deserve to be boycotted. It's no wonder majority of public choose to view movies online (pirated versions)"

PVR_Icon,Ashok T,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 â€¢ Family,Newly Renovated Screens 5 and 6 3rd floor Phoenix Lower Parel.,Yesterday went with family to watch Zero. First impressions was amazed at the quick revamp and new look. But watching full movie was horrifying experience. The New Seats were though looking cozy were most uncomfortable. Bo reclining or sliding facilities like previous ones. Resulting less leg space when others passing through your seat. Within 15 minutes your upper back starts troubling as upper neck rest is bulging. Literally had to sit on the edge of my seat to save by back. Was literally waiting for the movie to get over. Hope the management realise had rectfy at the earliest morever as the ground floor Screens are under renovation and if they have the same new Seats I am afraid majority of regular patrons will have to look for an alternative.
PVR_Icon,1Jayanthi,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 â€¢ Couples,Renovated plush multiplex,We went to PVR icon in Oberoi mall to watch 2.0 of Rajanikanth in 3D. Fantastic experience. The seats are plush and new. The sound system super. The snacks in food court is of wide variety. Enjoyed

PVR_Icon,JASJIT S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 â€¢ Friends,Food prices are a rip off,"I know we live in a democracy. And if you find something steep or of poor quality, you can always not eat. But I think the PVR food prices are a rip off. When you are stuck with a fait accompli, then buying food here really bothers me. Itâ€™s not even value for money.Secondly, their online booking charges are a unnecessary. Who in this day and age charges so exhorbitantly? It almost appears that they want you to come and manually book your tickets"
PVR_Icon,Zykamumbai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 â€¢ Friends,Lovely experience ,"Watched the movie Padmavati at the PVR ICON Versova and it was a lovely experience. The seats, menu, and the service is fab. You are made to feel like your at an exclusive place. The crumbed chicken nuggets was really yummy and so was the coffee. Definitely worth the experience where you can eat and watch the movie like you are at home. Cosy and very comfy. "

It provides one of the finest cinema viewing experience. They  have various customer-friendly features including kids play section, huge variety of eating options, lovely seating area outside the screens, etc. The kids screen was the best. It has a huge slide and nice play area with soft balls. My son loved the experience overall including the 3D movie watching and sound effects. Popcorn was super yummy and we loved the new variety of meals. The Pixel screen was also superb !!! We have taken the PVR membership where one can eran points everytime we watch movie here and buy anything inside which can be later redeemed for tickets and other stuff.Overall awesome movie going experience for entire family !!!"

I was totally Wowed...never had such an experience. They had a selection of food, snacks and drinks I have never experienced anywhere.....and I have been to cinemas all over the world. The seats were extremely comfortable, like business class seats on flights, only better. At the point f ordering we were given the option of having it on the numerous sitting places there or having them delivered to our seat...which we did. An outstanding experience."
PVR_Icon,Shaziya Shaikh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017,Great experience ,I'm really happy and satisfied with this it's like my go to for the the movies I love the gold class it's amazing. But if your wondering y 4* than it's just bcz of the price range it's way too high and initially it was only gold class now they have changed the rates of top seat and lower seats which is like fooling the crowd and only making money plus they need to get down on their cost of food and confectioners bcz it's way too expensive few things if changed it's gonna be enjoyable for all the type of people

PVR_Icon,Sunny04_11,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,Modern Movie Theatre,"Watched movie at this theater. Good place for the movie goers and entertainment seekers. Different classes of seating. Top class provides recliners and blankets, so one can relax and watch the movie.  The inclination of the screen is good and does not strain the sight. Pop corn and refreshments available in the food section. Food court also available. Lifts available to proceed to different screens. Online bookings also facilitated. A small play facility was available for kids, not sure it was permanent or occasional. Toilets are clean and hygienic. Branded outlets are open for a shopping delight.. One of the posh multiplexes.."

PVR_Icon,Shrutii2089,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 â€¢ Couples,Truly enjoyable movie-watching experience,"PVR has pretty much taken over the movie screens in Mumbai, but PVR Icon is in a different league altogether. The Gold Class is highly recommended, but even the normal audis are great! The theatre also has great eating options.. from chaat to popcorn to waffles to the wide menu in the gold class!"
PVR_Icon,sneha c,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016,Awestruck Experience!!!,"After hearing a lot about this place while its fit-out, was anxiously waiting for its opening...with PVR , you can expect something larger than life experience...but due to some odd reasons couldn't make it immediately post renovation. Finally a day came, when tickets were booked. But for me my excitement lied in the decor , being a designer... which made me roam the foyer for nearly half n hour before the movie...was thrilled looking at each n every wall treatment, the sparkling chandeliers, the led screens all over...the warm compositions muted with sober tones of browns, ochre's and gold. Concession with its savouries...some one would find me weired..but that's the way the designers are. Much appreciated property...And one must go for its ambience...in short full too paisa wasool... :)"
PVR_Icon,ManishMax,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 â€¢ Family,Wow.  What a theatre ,"The most luxurious cinema I have experienced.  The Gold Class is wow with leather automatic recliners, menu and serving , blankets etc.The lounge is wow . No words can explain . A must visit to Golding Class "
PVR_Icon,Jagruti C,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 â€¢ Family,PVR Icon Gold is the best in the world. The regular PVR icon screen is also Nice.,"If you are watching a movie in the Gold screens, you feel royal. And get treated like one too...a menu you can order from, a bottle of water, anattendant you can call with a click of a button. Blankets ofcourse is a done thing. You have access to a special cafeteria and can either order from their or go out and sit there and eat. But sadly if you are watching in the regular screens, then you do not get to buy food from this cafeteria and take it out to your regular seats. So you want momos? buy Gold screen tkts to buy one and eat at your seat. That's terrible. I gave feedback to the manager that they can either close the cafeteria and let it be accessable to gold screen viewers but you cannot distinguish and say you can buy but sit here and eat as not allowed to take it to your regular screens. But if you are a gold class then you can take it along with you.!Get momos counter out for the commoner pleaseeeee."
PVR_Icon,Kamshab,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Family,Kamshab,One of the best movie theatre in the western suburbs. Excellent sound & picture quality .Well maintained and therefore deserves the higher pricing.
PVR_Icon,Jeetchowhan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Friends,Nicely Done,"I like this place. Its near to my residence. Earlier named Cinemax, I like the new avatar. I have a huge grievance though. If you book tickets online, they charge you an internet handling fee? This is totally unjustified and unfair. The PVR group should encourage online bookings not try to subtly fleece them."
PVR_Icon,Milan S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Couples,PVR ICON GOLD CLASS... Beats all cinema experience hands down.,"PVR ICON and ICON Gold Class is creme de la creme of Bollywood movie going experience. The standard ICON cinema is a good experience, but if you want to feel the cinema going experience of another level, you got to try the ICON GOLD CLASS.Great interiors, quick services, and good amount of luck to see some stars on new release."
PVR_Icon,Pranav_A_Pandya,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 â€¢ Couples,Possibly one of the best multiplexes in Mumbai's western suburbs,"PVR ICON - Versova at the Infinity Mall, 3rd floor, New Link Road, Versova Andheri (W), Mumbai, Maharashtra is possibly one of the best multiplexes in Mumbai's western suburbs with its spectacular (see photo) interiors with video walls on all sides, an outstanding chandelier and a nice food court. The Cinemas themselves are excellent, with the latest in display/ screen technology and dolby atmos sound, the seats are comfortably and nicely spaced and the the Gold Class is opulence itself."
