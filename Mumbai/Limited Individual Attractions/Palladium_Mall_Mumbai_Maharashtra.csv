Now days they connected it internally with adjoining High Street Phoenix mall. There is also a multiplex in the complex.A place not to be missed if you like shopping, entertainment and food."
Palladium_Mall,Melina Devi Seeam,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Best Mall in Mumbai,"My favourite mall in Mumbai with most international brands available. The mall design and decor is amazing and gives a luxurious feel in the main building block. There are different blocks in the mall, whereby you have to leave the building to access another - the only downside. There is also one grocery store available. Avoid mall during peak days and times to get the best shopping experience. There are also many great food options available to grab a bite."
Palladium_Mall,Kuben P,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Good Mall in Mumbai,"I have been visiting this mall for the past few years , and got the opportunity to visit again in January 2023 after 3 years due to Covid .Much has changed since Covid .You will  find virtually anything that you would be looking for, especially clothing stores .My only gripe is that there are too few toilets to service the mall .There is free WI-FI but you need a SIM card , the problem is that if you are a tourist you don‚Äôt have a SIM card (local ) where you‚Äôll be able to retrieve an OTP to start using Wi-Fi , you will not be able to access free WI-FI should you not have a SIM card that can get an OTP."

Palladium_Mall,chow69,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,MALL WITH HIGH END INTERNATIONAL BRANDS,"We visited this Mall during our recent visit to Mumbai as my wife wanted to buy something urgently. The Mall is huge with adequate parking from the fourth floor to the seventh. The brands on displace are majorly international brands, though there are a few local Indian ones too. But do not expect any great bargains. Quality rules and the Mall exudes money. Overall a very interesting Mall, worth a visit any time."
Palladium_Mall,MNSB,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Good,Good high end mall lot of glamour and hyped .Full of shopping and cafes but parking entery and exit is nightmare.Shopping as usual and resturant and cafe and restaurant as others .Decor is very good .

Palladium_Mall,Indradeep R,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Definitely for high income group ,"Please note for the faint hearted middle& low income group that this is a mall for you to see with your hearts content and probably not gather enough courage to come back again. On a serious note this is really a high end mall where top brands across Retail are available. The prices are definitely premium & thus not many can afford & thus the mall is sparsely populated. Even I observed that I couldn‚Äôt gather courage to get in to some of the shops I liked knowing well that the prices would be beyond my means. But , if you have the means this is definitely the best place to splurge some of the money. I did have a meal here at Bayroute & boy it was a splendid experience to taste Middle Eastern food in Mumbai. Overall a place which you should visit to know what all you are missing & thus will probably help you focus in making some more money in life üòù"

The staff is rude and unhelpful. They don‚Äôt seem concerned with helping foreigners and have a don‚Äôt care attitude. In December 2017-I was told that sizes were not available however they were on the rails. This time. I wished to make use of my Birthday reward,which is (less 20% off the purchase price) When I made mentioned that I was glad to be able to use it. He said to the other sales consultant ‚Äúchor‚Äù which means thief. I wasn‚Äôt amused at this and won‚Äôt ever visit the Palladium Mall Store again.

Palladium_Mall,497harpreetk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,Luxury under one roof!,"I usually come here every trip I make to Mumbai because of its convenience of having so many designer labels under one roof. You'll be able to find the likes of Ritu Kumar, Rohit Bal, Anita Dongre, Masaba, Tribe by Amrapali and Satya Paul among the Indian designers and also the likes of Gucci, Jimmy Choo and Mont Blanc amongst the international designer wear. The boutiques are smaller than the flagship stores though so items may be limited in variety.Alongside luxury you also have more high street fashion as well like Zara and Steve Madden and a good variety of food options in the form of cafes and restaurants as a well as fast food."

Palladium_Mall,Ellaram25,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Poor service at W For Women,I am utterly disgusted at the service at W For Women Grand Galleria Palladium. On the 23rd and the 25th December I attempted to walk into the store at 21:35pm and 21:40 pm respectively and the person at the counter didn't greet meSpoke to me rudely and said that the store is closed. However all the stores are opened till 10pm and it states that online for W For Women Specifically. On the second day I wouldn't take no for an answer. I am a South African and service delivery is very important to us. The helper then said no leave mam leave the store is closed. To which I said it's my last night in mumbai I was already sent away and I expect to be helped otherwise I will speak to higher management so she walked away and the person at the cash counter then approached me however he said that I need to purchase what's on the floor. Having shopped there previously I know that stock is stored at the back. This team was highly lazy and idiotic and I cannot believe these people are the face of a brand such as W. Shameful.

Palladium_Mall,Eyekaytoo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 ‚Ä¢ Business,"Large, modern luxurious shopping mall on the site of an old cotton textile mill","My local colleagues brought me to the Palladium shopping mall one Monday evening recently mainly to enjoy an evening dinner out together. I was impressed with the Art Deco design inspiration, with a glass domed atrium, Italian marble, onyx and sheer feeling of space. At the grand main entrance, you will find a liveried doorman with turban and belted long coat.I learned that this modern place was developed from the Phoenix Mills which were originally started in 1905 to manufacture cotton textiles. Indeed when you descend into the lower, underground parts you can still see the vestiges of a bye gone textile factory era. And they have left a large chimney stack standing as a tribute to a very different past.  Indeed, this mall is located in the industrial zone of Lower Parel, south Mumbai where the sound of factory machinery has long been silenced. I was surprised to see so many famous international brand named shops here. I also found a branch of the London ""Comedy Store"" and apparently there is also a Manchester United Caf√© Bar with a Wall of Fame, Skybox, Dugout area plus the Manager‚Äôs Bench. It's just a pity that it's Manchester United...Pity that I had only come here for dinner and didn't have more time to explore this place further. Maybe next time..."

Some of the department stores have their entries in the open area and so, to be able to walk across, you need to walk in the open(non ac). The childrens play area is really small and in the outdoor as well. As there are not many options for malls in this side of Mumbai, this may seem to be the only option left."
