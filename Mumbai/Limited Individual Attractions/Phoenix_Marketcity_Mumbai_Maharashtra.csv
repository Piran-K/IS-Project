Phoenix_Marketcity,srinivast5,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Upto the expectations,We have been to this place on 15th Jan 2020.  I thought it was like any other mall but when we go inside you feel it's better than any other malls in India.  I liked the live music and mild music which always played.  All the shops are like any other shops of the malls.  But the decor is very modern and some brands which we don't have in Hyderabad is available here.  Glitch side the food court should have more seating capacity and multi cuisine available should be more.  The rest rooms needs more cleaning.  Parking is adequate.  You can enjoy this mall if you love to roam in the malls...

In Mumbai, it's maybe not the largest but packs quite a punch. Located in Kurla, the mall has a selection of large brands which is among the best in the city.In terms of attractions, the mall is probably second to the R-City Mall a short distance away. It has a Timezone play area and a snow park named Snow World, but nothing more. However, one thing that I liked was the various art installations which were all over the mall. From Elephants to Wings and many more, this mall is in effect, a sculpture/art gallery in its own right! The mall can be easily reached by auto or public transport."

There was a great range and if we'd been a bit better prepared we'd have woken up early and got here as soon as it opened, had lunch at one of the many food outlets and then gone home slightly earlier to miss the crazy traffic. However, interestingly, my husband and I have never been to a shopping centre like this as neither of us like mooching around shops, yet here we spent 4 hours doing just that. Got some great bargains, too!"

I have shoulder length curly, frizzy hair which looks unkempt most of the time. Gels, conditioners and hair creams give temporary relief and was looking for something that would give me a solution atleast for a few months. Met Sunil @ JUICE, Phoenix Mall and he recommended Cysteine treatment. Went for a short trim to straighten out my splits (yes, that too was a bother) and then went for Cysteine. The whole procedure lasted for about 3 hours, from hair wash to cut to treatment. The gel/ cream is left on overnight and had to go back for a wash the next day (no inconvenience here as hair looks wet, washed and oiled). Post hair wash on Day 2, also opted for hair colour and yes, walked out of the saloon feeling like a new person.Now, after 3 weeks am still enjoying frizz free hair. Was told the effect last for 3 to 4 months. A big thank you to Sunil and team for the right recommendation and good service!"

Phoenix_Marketcity,Jagmohan Singh D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Couples,Awesome Shopping Experience ,"On our daughter’s recommendation we decided to visit Phoenix Market City,in Kurla Mumbai,during our recent visit to the metropolis. On enquiringly learnt that  it has 4.1 million sq ft commercial space,housing around 700 brand showrooms,services,70 eateries/restaurants,all housed on 4 floors. This information was mind boggling. Our shopping in the most clean,slick & span ambience was indeed pleasurable and satiating our hunger pangs too was extremely satisfying. A worthwhile & memorable four hours spent. We experienced hospitality,courtesy & friendliness at its utmost best."

Phoenix_Marketcity,Srinivas K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,"Entry is congested, narrow and takes a whle for parking","Entry is congested, narrow and takes a while for parking. All branded shops are there in the mall and there is a good collection in almost all the shops. We had food in Pizza hut outlet, unfortunately it was very awful service, in almost all tables, waiter comes after 15 minutes, water comes after 30 minutes, order after more than a hour, even in some tables kids were there, the situation is same. Everyone was shouting and take away looks little better. One should take away and eat in the food court."

Lots of shopping options, with nearly every brand having presence in the mall. Food options are plenty with food court and individual restaurants. For entertainment you could go for cinema, or go through some fun activities like gaming, snow world, flight simulation, 9-D cinema etc. Parking space is plenty, and very economically priced at Rs 40 for a day when we visited. Can easily spend a fun filled day with kids here."

So along with good food you can also enjoy the Live concert without having to pay for the ticket. Also you could run into the celebraties since the entry for the performers is through this outlet. The food is also great.

Phoenix_Marketcity,Sid,1.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,One of the worst malls.,The staff specially security was very bad and very rude. We came to the mall as  volunteers and later decided to stay for some refreshments upon which the security told us off the first floor washroom and directed us to the 4th floor. I'm very disappointed to say this like of attitude was not expected by a mall of such a reputed mall and would advise people against such amateur policies.

Phoenix_Marketcity,MayurArora,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Very good mall but the worst is Ghost House.,Overall the mall is very huge and beautiful but hated one particular thing in the mall which was the ghost house. Where in the name of ghost house they are just looting people by having real people inside the place in a pitch dark room who holds and throws weird things on u in a dark room. And it does feel yucky. Have visited many Ghost Houses but this one is far the worst from all.
