Powai_Lake,RAJENDRA884 PRASAD,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021,Visit only if you are a keen environmentalist.,"This is an artificial lake, having rich history from Biritish era, when it was built in 1799 and used to get drinking water from Mithi River for city of Bombay (now Mumbai).  But complete neglect by the local government and local residents who polluted this river so much that it's water was declared as unfit to drink.  Tourists must be made aware that there are crocodiles in this lake and they should not venture close to waters.Encroachments by religious places have further polluted the serene environment.

For luxury travellers my recommendation be to view the lake from Renaissance hotel having a good dinner
Powai_Lake,Shonali79,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Friends,Lake is unclean and infested with crocodiles,"Powai is known only for 3 things- IIT, Hiranandani Gardens and the Powai Lake. If you take these 3 landmarks out, Powai would just be a non-descript suburb of Mumbai in a missable corner.This lake is right next to IIT, so imaginably, its the favoured hanging spot for IIT students. Incidents of drug abuse along the lake and it's adjoining garden is on the rise. This lake is infested with crocodiles and there have been frequent incidents of crocodile attacks here. A few months back, a boat was attacked by the ferocious reptile and a man is said to have lost his life. Intriguingly, there is no warning posted about the crocodiles along the lake, not one I have ever seen, despite the threat of crocodiles. Lake is not maintained well, so a good part is covered under algae and other vegetation to the detriment of its look. There's also litter strewn around its periphery, which makes it so disgusting. In a concrete jungle, such natural resources are few and far in between. If they are not maintained well, they lose all their charm and appeal."

Powai_Lake,cool_satchmo,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Couples,Nice walking promenade but poorly maintained lake,Unfortunately not much is being done to preserve this wonderful lake and it is full of sea weeds and people throw garbage in it all the time. Only good thing about is the wonderful walking promenade alongside the lake and parallel to JVLR. Good place for exercise
Powai_Lake,Deepak1503,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2017 • Family,Good place to chill,"After the promenade was renovated at the Powai lake, it has become a pleasurable experience to sit beside the lake. Many people even opt to jog here in the mornings. The lake is a much needed open space in the urbanized area of Powai.

It is peaceful early in the morning.It was mentioned to me that crocodiles have been spotted at the lake but I have no first hand experience of this.It is a nice place to go early in the morning or late evening as during the day the Mumbai heat would make the lake a less enjoyable experience.The water is probably a little dirty. The sunset view is also great as I had passed the lake in the evening. You can easily be lost in your thoughts at the park/lake while you are not very far from the hustle and bustle of the city."
Powai_Lake,Monika G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Solo,Nice,"I stayed in Reinassance hotel for a couple of days and i really enjoyed tj view on the lake.

Powai_Lake,Neha Agarwal Haria,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 • Couples,Nothing very special about it,"Powai Lake is located overlooking one of the most busiest roads connecting to JVLR / Seepz. The walkthrough is long enough but you hardly have any place to park or to sit. Late night though if you like to have a quiet time with yourself or with your partner, it's a good place to sit and chat or just look at the gazing sky. There is nothing else about the lake. The area is not well lit as well. Though, on new years eve or special occasions, you can witness fireworks, light decor from the Renaissance Hotel that is on the other side of the lake. It is definitely not a tourist spot."

I was staying in a hotel in hiranandani  and so went to the lake area by walking west on main street, right on orchard and left on lake boluevard. Take a right on JVLR and immediately you would find a overbridge walk way to the lake side. Took that and went down. You can walk along the lake to go to the visarjan place. Along the lake you will find people sitting and you can see lots of vendors selling food, toys. Walk along towards the lake and as you aproach closer you will find people walking in with small and large ganesha idols. I waited to see  one of the large ganeshas being immersed. At the very end (where they imerse) the crowd is too much.  It was a geat experience."

Powai_Lake,ChinmayHota,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Solo,Paradise Lost,"This place has all the qualities of becoming a top-notch tourist paradise, amid the hustle bustle of the mega city. This is a huge lake of glistening water, surrounded by IIT, Bombay on one side, and eye catching buildings on the other sides. The far skyline offers breathtaking view of hotel fronts. The atmosphere is cool on the most torrid days.The lake draws hordes of morning walkers to its shores in the mornings and lovers in the evenings.  The visitors sit on the low protective wall that encircles the lake facing the water, their legs dangling only few feet away from the edge of the lake deeply covered with hyacinth. As the lake is home to crocodiles this is certainly a dangerous proposition, especially for the preoccupied lovers. There are a few signs that warn visitors of lurking crocs."

Powai_Lake,Pooja_D291187,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Family,Nice view in a busy city,Powai lake is actually a nice place to hang out but it requires more maintenance.But it provides a nice view while travelling. the lake itself is not clean at all with water hyscinths and garbage in the water. this also should be taken care of and it would be one of the good places to visit on a hot summer evening!
Powai_Lake,analytic10,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Solo,Beautiful but not looked after,"Massive silting, growth of hyacinths, and sewerage let out into it (from massive development in Powai) is strangling this pristine lake now. Still beautiful. Fishing club there. Use a method of fishing which is illegal in most developed countries ie fould hooking-- hook fish anywhere in the body when it approaches near the bait (balls)."
