Prithvi_Theatre,JD,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Very bad experience.,"Allow at least 15 mins for people to enter after the show starts. We pay for the play and they don‚Äôt even allow you to enter if you‚Äôre 5 mins late, but allow people to go to the washroom in a 1.5 hours play? Ridiculous. So we have to wait outside for so long with no place to sit, and we see people going in and out throughout the play to use the washroom, but we can‚Äôt even go in and sit in our seats if we are 5-10 mins late. Some logic here!"
Prithvi_Theatre,Seema,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Bad experience,"Though we reached 15 minutes late , they did not allow late entry and strictly not allowing it to exchange with next show .it was delay on our part because of traffic jam but there is no consideration and human element to situation  . I can not review the show but surely experience of visiting theatre was bad."

Prithvi_Theatre,MumbaiRiders,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2021 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Saw "" DANCE LIKE A MAN "" .Excellent.","If a tourist in Mumbai and having ample time in the city then a mandatory visit to Prithvi Theatre is a must do activity.A small cost theatre having a seating capacity of 200 + viewing a concert in this theatre is akin to being a part of the play as the stage is in close proximity to the viewing audience unlike large auditoriums.The theater also has a excellent outdoor cafe that is a watering hole of wannabe actors, established actors as well as common theatre audience.Please book your tickets online in advance if wanting to view a popular play as accomodation is less due to small capacity of this iconic cute homely theatre.A landmark of Mumbai's cultural scene.Ahoy !"

Prithvi_Theatre,SalimM,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Worth it,We were keen to watch a play while in Mumbai. So when we saw a comedy play advertised we jumped at the chance and booked our tickets. Staying at Nariman Point meant a long drive on New Years Eve all the way to Juhu. We had been warned that you do not get allocated seat numbers so get there early. The drive was nearly ninety minutes and when we got there there was already a long queue. We joined in and after some time the doors opened and we slowly made our way in. The theatre is small and seating is circular and such that it's up-close to the performance stage. We were lucky to see some empty space on the benches at the far end and we rushed over. Seats are usually sold out as most of the plays/performances are popular. Within minutes the theatre was packed. After a few minutes the play started. It was funny and a real experience. All in all well worth it. The journey back to Nariman Point at about midnight with new years celebrations in full swing was quite something.There is a cafe outside which seems to be the hang out place to be seen. It was packed with young people. They have a nice line in parathas and shakes. Give them a try if you can find a space to sit.

He took theatre to the people. His theatre company staged plays across the length n breadth of this vast country and then one day his legacy got a permenant address called the Prithvi Theatre.It's not just an experimental theatre but it's also a catalyst among actors, writers, artistes, onlookers just about everyone whose life it touches. Information about Prithvi theatre can be found from many online sources, whereas this review is to give a worm's eye view of this small location which has been a bedrock of an art movement.If you go to Prithvi you can watch a play, enjoy some coffee, eatables, strike up conversations with complete strangers.... In case no play is running you can still enjoy all of the above minus chaos of human turbulence, in one corner you might see a group heartedly arguing over something, another corner someone might be plucking some tunes, or playing a flute and people like me would just be sipping, soaking, enjoying in silence.Over last two decades it has changed a lot. Prithvi is now a lot lot more in fashion then it was earlier. It's difficult to get tickets now. Years back I remembers seeing plays by just walking in last minute. Now one has to book in advance. Now the place is crowded most of the times, earlier it was a quiet, secluded, shady, warm spot.Prithvi being an experimental theatre you can expect literally all formats of storytelling going on there. A performance, a monologue, song n dance, repertoire...list is endless. Seating is amphitheare types, so you better come 15 minutes before the play starts n get in the queue to enter the performance hall.In case you don't want to watch a play, meet strangers, have coffee etc you can just drop by and savour the history narrated on the walls of the foyer, anteroom... The old black n white pictures, historical tidbits of the theatre movements, it's a treat to the eyes and the soul!There are many players now, but the plays are every bit as great."

Prithvi_Theatre,Tyler P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Fun and intimate setting. ,I have been several times to the theatre and attached cafe. It is a thrust stage with proscenium arch with limited general seating. Many theatre groups in Mumbai utilize this space for productions. They often have plays in Manu different languages and sometimes in English only. I have thoroughly enjoyed every visit. 
Prithvi_Theatre,plpalani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Small, good but with indifferent staff","This famous theatre in Juhu is inside a housing society... Hence no parking available. The theatre is very small. We went to see Chinta Chod Chintamani, ahi di play. They had over sold the tickets and hence were asked to sit on steps... Very uncomfortable and the staff are very rude.  The theatre acoustics is excellent. The ambience is good."

Prithvi_Theatre,RAMESH K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Great place for morning concerts too! ,Prithvi theatre in Juhu has been my favourite haunt for watching quality plays in a wonderful ambience. I attended a morning concert today for the first time at this venue. It was Rudra Veena recital by Mohi Bhai'-ud-din Dagar. It was heartening to see a crowd of discerning classical music lovers so early in the morning. Listening to the pristine music at close quarters without the use of microphones was an unique experience. The programme was followed by breakfast at Prithvi Cafe consisting of warm fresh samosa and chilly cheese sandwich with tea. 
Prithvi_Theatre,Jannat S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great theatre experience.,"Visited the theatre to watch a contemporary play, and it was excellent. The amphitheatre is compact and the stage feels extremely close by, requiring no microphones due to the acoustics. A very authentic (and not Bollywood-ish) theatre experience.Do note that seats are not allocated so after having booked, I recommend queuing 45 minutes ahead of the start time if a front row seat is what you want. Though, any seat gives a great view."

Prithvi_Theatre,crossworlds,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016,For the love of all things theatrical...,"¬†If are a theatre buff, a visit to Mumbai would be incomplete without a stop at¬†Prithvi Theatre, so lovingly created by thespian Prithviraj Kapoor and nurtured by his son, Shashi Kapoor, and his family. There is a sense of romance in watching a play put up on the small, intimate stage where viewers in the front rows can actually reach out and touch the actors, who often incorporate impromptu lines about the here and now, talking directly to the audience in a way that makes you feel you're part of the action. But be sure to reach well in time because ticket rates are uniform, seating is free (you queue up and sit on a first-come-first-bag-a-place basis) and most players are sticklers for punctuality. And for silence, so beware if an errant mobile has not been muted before play time! You might be shamed into doing so by irate actors who are skilled enough to make the rebuke sound like a piece of dialogue.¬†The air-conditioning is very strong inside, so do carry something to shield againt the blast.¬†It helps to buy the tickets in advance, especially when popular groups or actors are scheduled to perform. But even if you can't catch a play - or drop in on a Monday or a rare day when none is scheduled - just soak in the sheer atmosphere, colour and character of the place. You could browse through the shelves of the charming onsite bookshop that can yield rare nuggets if you search persistently. Or settle down on one of the curious low seats at the Prithvi cafe, treat yourself to its famous Irish coffee and a plate of munchies... and gawk; this is a popular haunt of the famous, the almost-famous and the vaguely familiar wannabes. Especially during Prithvi theatre festival, a must-do on the cultural calendar of any lover of the performing arts."

Its famous among the theater patrons as well as the normal crowd because of Prithvi cafe. Amazing food and good ambience. But it is very crowded and sometimes there's a waiting time of over an hour.
