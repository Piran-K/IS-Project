R_City_Mall,m_j_s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Pleasant place to visit shopping for a visitor near airport,If you are looking for a good option for a few hours in one of the many hotels near the airport this is a manageable Uber ride away. Seemed interesting to see a middle-class mall with a good food court.

R_City_Mall,Munawar Karbelkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Friends,Best place for Chinese ,"Whenever I think of Chinese, I think of mainland China they also had an advertisement which said if it's Chinese it's mainland China today. I went there with my best friend it was a treat from my side to her so it had to be the best Chinese in town and I'm happier that I selected mainland China. We ordered the following dishes and we had a ball : AppetizerJiang's chilly cottage cheese (veg) : This was the most creamiest and soft pioneer I've had in some time and the pairing of chilly with the paneer was to die for. This has been by far my favorite appetizer post the lock down Diced chicken with assorted pepper (nonveg) : Being a hardcore non vegetarian had to try a non veg appetizer and the diced chicken with pepper gave us the perfect Bang of taste and flavor. Corn & water chestnut dumpling (veg) : Water chestnuts are my favorite vegetables when I'm dining outside and finding any dumpling with water Chestnut in it my reviews will be biased. Loved it to the core. Go for itBasil flavored chicken dumplings (nonveg) : Great thin dumplings packed with flavor and gave a punch when we tried it with the chili oil sauce. Main courseSeasonal vegetables in smoked chilli sauce (veg) : This had the most exotic vegetables in it and the chili sauce was amazing I think this is the best veg main course I've had in an year at least this paired perfectly with the chicken fried rice was to die for. Chicken in roasted garlic sauce (non veg) : This was rich and creamy and had a great texture to it I loved every piece of the roasted garlic sauce that I had. Awesome. Rice & needlesBurnt garlic noodles with vegetables: These were soft and long noodles which worked perfect for a rainy day like we had today in Mumbai, the burnt garlic flavor was not overpowering, and it gave an amazing twist with the veggies. Chicken fried rice: Although it's a chicken fried rice but the taste it left dangling was out of the world and pairing it with the vegetables in chili sauce was a pair made in heaven. DessertHoney noodles with almond flakes : Not that I have never tried honey noodles before but if you are looking at the thinnest and the most crunchiest honey noodles give this one a shot. The almond flakes on top I did another element of crunch and was the perfect icing to the entire brilliant meal that I had Chocolate rolls : The chocolate lover in me had to order a chocolaty dessert and this ticked all boxes of being a perfect chocolate dessert. All in all if somebody had told me I this would be the entire menu and the taste I would have selected this without a second thought and so I would recommend each one of you to try this menu out. They maintain all the hygiene factors and ensure that safety is primarily during these covert times but at no point do they compromise on the taste definitely value for money and worth every penny that I spent My bestie had a big smile on her face.  Thank you mainland China .I thank the manager Pankaj for being extremely hospitable and this meal wouldn't have been complete without your suggestions and amazing attitude !"

R_City_Mall,Indradeep R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,My dream mall ,"The mall I frequent every weekend. My favourite place in the mall is Crossword where I sit endlessly and browse through books I want to read. Post that I end up at the ground floor CCD/ Starbucks to sip in freshly brewed coffee and finish the books I purchase. There is no more happiness to me than reading books leisurely and for this reason the mall is very dear to me. However there are lot of options here. For children you have Kidsjania, snow house etc etc. For eating you have all the restaurants you can think off across various budgets. The entire ground floor has eateries as well as one side of the top floor had the food court. For movie buffs you have the Inox which is quite neat, clean and well maintained. Importantly you have ample parking at just Rs 50/- for a 4 wheeler. The mall has reserved one day of my weekend & takes me to my dream world with my books and coffee. "

However, it is now showing its age and the crowd has transformed over the years to mere window shoppers. To keep with the times, there are now newer brands like H&M, Pantaloons, Decathlon, Hamley's etc and even an entertainment galleria like Smaash. However, overall footfalls are dropping and quality of service in some of the more popular outlets like Grandmama have seen a decline. "

R_City_Mall,Manish K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,A big mall with a galaxy of attractions,"The R City Mall in Ghatkopar in Mumbai is among the most vibrant malls in the Maximum City. It does not lack for branded stores (houses all the leading brands), food (has plenty of restaurants and a food court) or cinema (with a full-fledged multiplex). However, what sets it apart from other malls is the sheer number and variety of attractions it has to offer.India's first Kidzania centre is here, where kids can play any profession they wish to and so is the Click Art Museum, where people can click trick photographs of themselves in strange situations! There is also a Red Carpet Wax Museum, which is maybe not up to the level of Madam Tussaud's but is not too shabby either!Other attractions here include a Laser Tag arena, two or three Timezone areas for kids to play in as well as a snow park, called as Snow Kingdom. For a family, it has more than enough to offer to keep them occupied for an entire day and in that sense, is reminiscent of the mega-malls in Dubai."

R_City_Mall,Ganesh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Couples,City in itself,This mall is one of a kind with something for everybody.With the addition of the new wing(Which is far better than the old wing)the mall offers a variety of choices. From the essential grocery stuff to apparel to electronics and jewellery you will find all shops.A huge variety of food outlets both in the food court as well as sit down restaurants there  is a huge choice. The Inox multiplex rounds it off nicely. Now for the downsides....toilets are not maintained well specially in the old wing.Parking is an effort on weekends.The crowd on the week ends puts you off.The mall management adds to the congestion with the toy buses and trains.

R_City_Mall,Abhishek J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Family,Amazing mall!!!! Everything you will need.,This is a wonderful mall near Hiranandini. Everything you can think of is available here. Large brands to a grocery store (Big Bazaar) is in this mall. And like all modern malls it has even got a movie hall.It is a very large mall and you could literally drop till you shop. If you want to sip or eat something to recoup energy so that you can shop some more than there is a massive food court on the top floor.The ground floor has an open sitting area which has a few handicraft sellers too along with coffee and snack chains such as Star Bucks and Coffee Day.You can easily spend an entire day at the mall without getting bored (you may be tired though) and yet you would not have covered the entire mall!!!!!

R_City_Mall,Xerxes R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Loved the mall ,Had a nice time with friends. Lots of shopping. Do visit Decathalon for awesome deals. The mall is HUGE so maybe wear comfortable footwear. The only thing they should improve on is signs in the parking and in the mall. Maybe a few more maps with directions of shops and so forth. Liked the food court also. Enjoy yourselves.

R_City_Mall,Eyekaytoo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Business,Second visit to this modern shopping mall,"I recently made my second visit to this modern shopping mall, mainly to go to the cinema on one of the upper floors. I was interested to see so many international branded shops like Marks & Sparks, H & M etc. I didn't get a chance to compare prices with those in northern Europe but I guess they're more or less the same.    This is certainly a shoppers paradise with enough places to also get something to eat and drink."

R_City_Mall,danielgc205,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Friends,Fairly nice mall with a lot to do for an indoors India.,"This is a fairly nice, very clean, well located mall in the Ghatkopar area in Mumbai; with a lot to do for an indoors India experience.I'd recommend it for eating or shopping, for a quite relaxing time out of the buzz in town, and because it has all services and shops one can imagine -from fast food to top restaurants, and from clothing shops to camping/outdoors adventure.It's also good to experience the adaptability of humans to the capitalistic way of seeing the world, as, in the end, it is a mall like any North American or European mall that, as it could not be different, it has now spread to Mumbai and beyond."
