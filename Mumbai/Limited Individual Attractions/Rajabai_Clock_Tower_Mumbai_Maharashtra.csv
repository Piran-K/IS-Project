However, things like that are necessary at times for repair or cleaning. Our guide said this tower was reminiscent of Big Ben as it was built by the British. Very interesting architecture combining Gothic and French style. The tower stands tall at 250 feet. Worth a visit."

Rajabai_Clock_Tower,macedonboy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Magnificent tower, but shame I couldn't get closer","The Rajabai Clock Tower is another legacy of the British Empire in India. It's a Victorian era clock tower built in the store of Gothic revival, most evidently at the apex which is the epitome of a Gothic tower. This tower is close to several landmarks of Mumbai and it's worth a detour if in the area. There’s supposed to be a chime every 15 minutes, but there’s seems to be renovation working ongoing as there’s lots of scaffolding around the tower and I couldn’t get into the gated area of the clock tower. Magnificent tower, but shame I couldn't get closer. From the outside, the terraces and matching towers with the open staircases look beautiful."

Rajabai_Clock_Tower,Raymond W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 • Couples,Extraordinary  Clock Tower,"With this review, I have praise but also a gripe, which is why one star has been docked.First and foremost, this is a remarkable clock tower which is one of the most memorable of Mumbai's many colonial-era edifices. The carving on its exterior is extra ordinary and the whole thing is an elaborate Victorian Gothic fantasy. You can get a good look at it from outside the gate or anywhere around the Maidan and it's an impressive sight.Now to the gripe. You are no longer allowed to climb it or even take pictures from around the base. The security officers strictly  enforce this rule. In recent years India has been worried about stagnant tourist numbers and this sort of thing is part of the reason. As part of a World Heritage site, Rajabai should be open to world travellers."

The journey begins with great travel by Deccan Queen. The vast ocean of CST station sets the tone of the exploration. After meandering through the fountain area the helpful cabbie drops you at the Rajabhai Towers. The sentries at the gate throw disdainful look at you notwithstanding the innocence of the youngster. You have no place to sit. You have no choice but to move around and come near the Oval opposite the imposing tower. Suddenly there is a chime of the quarter hour. The youngster is deeply attracted. You find a bench at the oval though facing away from the tower. Vow, there is half hour chime.Your child is enthralled of the different tune of the cine. After a while three quarter chime takes all of you upwards. Some more wait & twelve hour Big Bennish dongs lift the whole family heavenwards. The beautiful music rings much better than Big Ben.The child is overjoyed and does not want to leave. With great effort you move out to take a cab to CST for quenching appetite at Shivala."
