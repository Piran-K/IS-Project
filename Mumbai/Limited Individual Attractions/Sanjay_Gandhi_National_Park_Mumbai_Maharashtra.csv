Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,BalkrishnaShroff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Worth seeing !!,"This beautiful national park spread over 103 square kilometers is the only one in the world located within a city. Geographically it is about 20% of entire Mumbai. It has got many recreational activities. One can go for jungle safari, trekking or see the historical Kanheri caves about 6 km from the main gate. It is advisable to take a guide which is provided by forest department who manages the national park. One has to park the cars outside and then can walk or take a bus or private taxi inside.Don't miss it if you have not seen it..."
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Venky63,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Sanjay Gandhi National Park-not easy to get into,"Today was my first visit to the Park, even though I have lived in Mumbai for many years. I planned to get Kanheri caves but overall it was a disappointing experience. a)It is easy to get to the Park itself on the WE Highway. b)But getting into the Park is another story! You have to park your car and either walk many kms inside or you have to take a BEST bus. Or you have to cycle your way. I couldn't do both with an injured foot.c)There not enough buses as the queue is a long one at all times. d)There is an alternative I found out later of taking some van taxis. Its not fair to allow them when passengers can't take their cars. e)The entry fee of 85/- and parking charges of 242/- are not reasonable.The park authorities must find another alternative of having multiple parking spaces at various points in the park. That way one can get to a point and then choose to walk around.Overall, unless you want to walk 6+ kms or cycle on a hot day(which it will be on most days in Mumbai) there are no easy options."
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Kirsty N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Private one day tour of the park,"So.... as a foreign visitor, there seem to be two ways to visit the park, and they are completely different experiences and require different levels of organisation. You can just turn up, in which case you can enjoy the large recreational area near the Borivali Gate, which has a pretty lake with boating, gardens, a Cat Orientation centre, an introductory Interpretation Centre, etc (quite good, especially for children). You can then get the local bus further into the park, for the 7km trip up to Kanheri caves, a complex of about 100 Buddhist caves in the hills. You don't need a private car to do this! At weekends however the bus queues are long, so go during the week. Or, you can hire a guide for a half day or day, in which case you can actually walk one of the several trails through the park. We would highly recommend this. You shouldn't do this without a guide. The crucial thing to understand is that the great majority of the park is truly a reserve, and it's large: about 100 sq km. There are about 50 adult leopards in residence, plus all the other usual residents, snaky and otherwise. They need peace, and the public needs to be kept safe.Hiring the guide was the real challenge, as the park's website was down, but we cracked it. You need to book through the NIC (Nature Information Centre): again the website didn't work (they make you work for this!) so we tracked them down on Facebook. We communicated with a gentleman called Samarth. who arranged our guide. For a full day, this cost 2,500 rupees per person, paid in cash on the day.We would highly recommend the full day. We met our guide Naman at 8am and spent the morning walking the Kanheri Trail: 8am is a little late for birds though we did see some, but Naman's knowledge of trees, plants, forest ecology, geology, animal scat (poo to you and me) and calls, was excellent. We found ourselves following a line of leopard scrapes up through the woods, and finally came out across from the caves. Just below the caves are pretty gardens and a ""canteen"" where we ate early lunch. Basic Indian snack/breakfast food, but delicious.In the afternoon, Naman turned from a nature guide to a cultural one, and did a fine job of guiding us around the cave complex. Well worth seeing, and go right to the top above the caves too, to get a view of the whole park. You will find yourself on the top of a huge lava dome, in the middle of the remains of a massive and ancient crater (approx 65 million years). Mumbai is on the edge of the Deccan Traps (look it up... remarkable)After the caves, we visited the recreational area, and then our day was done, by about 4.30. It's a long day and you need a certain amount of energy, but we're in our 60's/70's and did fine. Naman was the perfect guide, adapting to our pace, checking that we were ok, and entertaining us with stories: lovely company.SGNP is a remarkable phenomenon: a functioning very large  wildlife reserve in the middle of a megacity: it's beautiful and needs funding, so go!"

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Priyanka9987,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2021,Must visit with children,"We stay close to the National Park and celebrated our daughter's 5th birthday here one morning. Most of the activities are available only on weekends so do check out before you go there. The park opens for normal public only at 8am, so don’t go in too early. The weekly off is on Monday for SGNPPlan: Included a butterfly trail and Tiger & Lion Safari (added bonus was the boating activity)Butterfly Park: We started from our homes at 7-7.15am as the butterfly trail starts after 8am. The butterflies need sunlight to flutter and fly about. So, we reached SGNP to meet our intern who took us into the auditorium for a 30min info session on butterflies. Given, it was a winter morning – the sun still wasn’t bright and out, so we had our breakfast boxes first and then headed for our simple / short 1 hour trail across the park. We saw lots of butterflies on our trail, and they were so attracted to the rattlepod plants. We saw the common crow, common tiger, striped tiger, blue tiger, great orange tip, common emigrant, zebra blue, lots of moth caterpillars, ladybugs, Jerdon’s baza, etc. The children enjoyed walking in the small pathways and seeing so many butterflies. An easy route around the park that can be enjoyed by adults and kids. After finishing the trail at 10am, we cut the birthday cake and headed to the Lion and Tiger SafariLion and Tiger Safari – a  short bus ride to see caged Lions and tigers. While the lions were sleeping under the sun, the tiger came and gave us a majestic ramp walk before it went inside. Good for children to see animals 1st hand, but more a 1-time visitBoating – they have 2 seater and 4-seater boats that you can take out in the Dahisar River for a 15-20 minute ride. Its fun for the children to enjoy the boating activityOverall, we had a lot of fun and the children didn’t want to return home even at 12pmI would also recommend exploring the Shilonda Trail with children. It’s a trail for 1.5 hours with a break near a lovely stream. Such a lovely way to explore nature for them by looking at different plants, trees, bird calls, butterflies, crabs, spiders, ants and their hill formations, etc."

As I have to pay the entrance fee for the park to get to the caves anyway, I wandered around the park after visiting the caves. The parks is a surprisingly lovely area, clean and peaceful. Peaceful especially compared to the rest of the city. Lots of activities such as boating, safaris etc. There’s not much variety in terms of the trees and plants."

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Setting Sun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Solo,Jungle amidst the city,"Visited here because I was really bored and was seeking amusement without spending much money. The entry fee for a solo person without a vehicle is about 50 rupees if I remember correctly. They have a map of the park inside. I walked towards the Kanheri/ Buddhist caves although returned by bus which takes 10 rupees till end. The walk is about 8km alongside a tarred road. On the way I witnessed deers going about their day, a snake and birds which could be easily heard but not seen. There's a river flowing on the way. Stray dogs can be a nuisance and could attack but locals help out. People sell lime juice on the way. At the end of the road near the caves there are stalls selling food, refreshments however monkeys are a nuisance here and can snatch away the food.There is a main shallow cave which is majestic with carvings related to Buddha and stages of enlightenment with the mudras, etc from what I could figure out. Beyond this there are many other caves ahead and above where a settlement seems to have existed. Very very interesting. One can climb the rock that hosts all the caves without much difficulty. From the top of the rock buildings of Mumbai could be seen. I only realised I'm still in Mumbai after the climb to the top. Till then one is well hidden from the city. One can easily spend half a day in all this. There is occasional annoyance from 'untamed teenagers', other than that families, groups, solos and couples seem to visit here. Watchmen in and around the caves. A fruitful visit overall."
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Namrata K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,For Nature & Peace Lovers!,"If you want to be away from the crowd, noise & busy lifestyle of Mumbai but can't travel too far, this is the apt place! We spent couple of hours in this National park early February. Route to Gandhi tekdi is around a kilometer long. It was peaceful & destination had a beautiful view point. Further, we went on exploring random routes & could spot deers walking nearby. Deers roam like dogs there! We enjoyed feeding cucumbers to them. Later, we wanted to walk the Ashok Van trail, however you need to prebook it with guide. On the way, there was a lake having beautiful site. We didn't have time to visit Kanheri caves so would like to go there next time."

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,SagarSavla,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Something for all ages,"We visited with family and 2 young boys of 5 & 3. All of us had a very good time. Below are some of the highlights which will help you to plan your trip1. Lion/Tiger Safari - You have to take a bus ride for the Safari. Sit on the left side. They had a lion, lioness, tiger, tigress in individual cages. Go early morning and you will see them. You might also spot a few deers. You are not allowed to get off the bus. It is a 15-20 ride once the bus starts. You might have to wait for the bus to get a little full before they start. 2. Boating - They have 4 & 2 seater paddle boats. Again do this early in the morning. It is a small pond with very minimal shade. Kids loved it. They have life jackets for all to wear.3. Train Ride - When we visited the train was shut for some reason but we were able to walk on the tracks and reach the deer and peacock enclosures. As it was shut we were able to feed the deers cucumbers for the local vendors. 4. Kaneri Caves - It is a drive to reach the caves. We didn’t climb up but people who were completing their climb and returning said it took them 45 minutes to reach the top. 5. Other things - There are slides and play area for kids. There are lots of green spaces for kids to play freely. You can drive everywhere in the park. Car and each individual needs to buy ticket at the entrance. 6. Facilities - lots of restrooms in the park. Fairly clean. Lots of local vendors selling food for a quick bite. Overall a nice place for people of all ages. Would definitely recommend a visit. "

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Vishnu Vardhan,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Bad,"Sanjay Gandhi National park is located in Borivali, on the outskirts of Mumbai. Went to the place with high expectation but was disappointed.Firstly, I don't think this place must be called a biological park. It was not lush green, nor had much animals in it (even monkeys). We were charged an entry fee of Rs.77 per person for the ""so-called"" lion and tiger safari where we saw 2 lions and 3 tigers to be precise, that too locked up in a cage. We expected them to be roaming freely, coming near our vehicles etc. But were thoroughly disappointed. The only good thing was the kanheri caves located inside that was good. Nevertheless,visiting this park is simply a waste of time and money..."

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,RajendraSharda,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Couples,Visit to Sanjay Gandhi National park,"After almost 20 year of landing in Mumbai,I could plan to visit SGNP much awaited with lot of curiosity & Enthusiasm.It is a very nice place which I have missed all these years. Well maintained,quite neat and clean and having good facilities. The cave area is well maintained.However I found the rates for lion/Tiger safari quite high. The idea is to motivate the people to bring their children and show them which is more or less Like Zoo.The maintenance of Train is horrible. It seems the train has not gone under service for many years the way it makes the noise. Despite charging high why such things can't be maintained. The station in between is in depleted condition. Authorities should look into this.The parking lot near caves is not sufficient."

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,G A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Sylvan Forest In Urban Mumbai,"SGNP or Borivali NP is a 108sq.m. real forest in the urban limits of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.    I went there last Saturday, used to go almost every week in years past but with the ever increasing horrible traffic, the Metro road works and the overcrowded trains, it is a bit of a nightmare even thinking about travelling anywhere these days in Mumbai.  So now, its maybe 4 to 5 times a year if that.  I came mid September to see the wildflowers but the forest was shut then due to heavy flooding and damaged internal roads.   I hoped to see the wildflowers this visit but most of the colourful ones had dried out and the grasses were more predominant.  There also weren't as many butterflies as I had expected.  Anyway, a verdant forest is never disappointing and it was a good change from the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle.A herd of spotted deer was foraging in one of the Adivasi settlements within the national park.  I went nearer and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw a lady feeding them from a thali!  She was very friendly and said the deer came almost every day for some leftover food.  She told me I could come nearer, but not too close as they were wary of strangers.  The deer, not the lady haha...The Adivasi people have always been living in this forest, originally deeper in the core area.  The forest department has resettled them in the public area and plans are afoot to resettle them out of the park entirely, which the Adivasis are protesting.  That aside, it was quite a thrill to see domesticated deer which made up for the lack of wildflowers.I decided to spend more time at the Kanheri caves which I will review separately.The fastest and cheapest way to travel to SGNP is by local train to Borivali East from where auto rickshaws are available to the main gate.  BEST buses also run from Borivali E station to Kanheri Caves base at certain times of the day.   From the ticket counter, you can walk or hire a cycle or drive through the park.  There are no restaurants, so carry your own food (there is a conveniently located Udipi restaurant across the road from the main gate) or eat the food that the Adivasis offer from their makeshift stalls along the road through the forest and at the caves base.  This is usually fruit, cucumbers and corn/ chana snacks along with lemon juice and on weekends there may be tea.    Avoid Sundays if you are looking for a peaceful experience as it gets excessively crowded.Forgot to mention that the national parks most famous inhabitant are the leopards,not that they are roaming around in the daytime for selfie moments with visitors, but they are very much there.  I saw a family of leopards near the Tulsi Lake (restricted area) some 15 years ago.  Deers are fairly easy to spot around the Adivasi padas and monkeys and langurs are a given.  Birds are aplenty though you need patience to see them through the dense foliage.  Comfortable walking shoes make the trip easier :-)It got rather warm during my visit, I had a had but I was sweating profusely.  December to Feb is good in the dry season and of course the monsoon months are magical.  September has the best of the weather, the streams, the flowers and the butterflies.Entrance and other rates are on the SGNP official website which also has details of events, how to book guided treks to restricted parts of the forest and other information."

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Cedric N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,A very good place for wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers,"Had been to this national park in Borivli a long back ago. This park is one of the most visited parks in the world. This park is a popular tourist attraction. It is a vast park with caves and a big cat safari. There are 4 rivers originating from this park. There is a playground for children and a mini toy train. Also, there are a few shops inside the park and its forest is home to the Warli tribes. Had enjoyed the toy train ride to see the wild cats as a child. Earlier, the entry fees were less, but now they are a little on the higher side. One can visit the Kanheri Caves or go trekking on a small hill.This park is an ideal place for families, couples, school children, wildlife enthusiasts, nature lovers as well as friends. It is a must visit and should not be missed."
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Californian,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,As fake as Sanjay Gandhi,"Wikipedia description of this park is quite alluring and so is its website narrative. The “Park” is touted as having ‘rich flora and fauna’ attracting two million human visitors (suckers, I might add) a year.Well, it is a classical bait and switch operation. First, there is a sizable entrance fee. If you are driving, you end up paying 330 Rupees or so to enter the park. Then the first attraction is “Lion and Tiger” safari. Never, never, ever take this safari. You have to pay separately for this. Then, you can ride a rickety bus that goes through fake scenery. You can site an emaciated lion behind barbed wire, very much like what you see in a zoo. Just one lion, mind you.This is followed by a sighting of a single tiger. The same zoo setting. Wow! And, the tour ends. The worst safari experience ever for me.The Kanheri caves too charge an entry fee- Rs. 25 for Indians and, of course, a whopping Rs. 300 for non-Indians. The caves are old and can definitely be presented as a national treasure if it is managed by someone who has some imagination and drive. But they aren’t. No description or labels of anything you see. The pathway is rocky and uncomfortable with no maps or advice about what we should be looking for. There are about 70 or so these caves. You can see them without understanding what the heck you are seeing.The so called national park has a lot of residences with people at almost every corner of the roads. The whole thing is so underwhelming that I strongly recommend that you skip this fake park altogether."

Well accessable from western express highway and Boravali East station. It took me hour or so reach on a motorcycle from Mulund. Motorbikes and cars are allowed right up to Kanheri caves but its a bit too much to freedom. One can notice beautiful rocky out crops covered by varities of flora and birds. staff and rules need to be little more strict. Bit to expensive for forign visitors, but its nation wide. Entrance fee for private cars and motorcycles are too cheap."

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,240akp,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Couples,Too high car parking fees....!,1) The car parking charges of a Sanjay Gandhi national park is equivalent to the Mumbai Shivaji International Airport.....!Or a mall or a 5 star hotel....In Entire mumbai.....! 195 /- ....! which is way too high....! 2) Paying 195 /- one is allowed to drive his/her car any where in the park but there is no provision if some one just want to park the car at the entry & wish to have a green walk...!3) Entry fees per person is ok but it is on addition to the Car entry fees ...! That's where it becomes more than a reasonable fees...! I.e. for a couple it is 195+58+58= 311 /- for a 2 to 4 max picnic time....! Just for entry is a way too costly...! 4)They should instead increase fines for spreading garbage / after food / party & re duce car entry fees to a reasonable 100/- .5)Should have less rates for Monday to Saturday (mid week days) & comparatively higher at the week ends (Sunday) to control the crowd.
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Manish Jain,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Friends,Natural Beauty amidst chaos of Mumbai,"This National park is near borivali station. 10 Rs/- sharing auto easily available. Best way to visit this park is by cycling and best time to visit is rainy season. Park visiting fees is very nominal 58/- per person. Time to visit is around 7AM -5PM. As this place is very near to city so most of the wild animals are kept in zoo type safari hence no point of wasting time and money in safari. Cycling is amazing experience here you will see amazing greenery, water fall, river in entire national park. Only and biggest problem you will find that there is traffic jam inside park. People come by car bikes and ride them like normal roads which diminishes the beauty of park. Specially during weekends this places becomes very crowded. But yes still scenic beauty amaze you so well that you forget all these things. Cycling during rainy season might be little problematic for cloths but its more fun than problem. I went with four friends we enjoyed cycling took many photographs. Greenery gives you amazing background for photographs. Suggestion :- Carry spare cloths just in case you want to enjoy the waterfall. And carry some food also because it is difficult to find good food over there."

This spreads over a large span so you can go walking, jogging, cycling. Best time to visit is ofcourse the early hours of the day, apart from exercising, you can click lots of pictures. If you are lucky enough you can catch a glimpse of some animals too.A good place to hang out with your family as a bonding time. "

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Nida khan,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Disappointing,"It just has a tiger, 2 lion, couple of dear n just lots of monkeys! The van Rani train was very disappointing as it comprised small trip were one can just spot a dear or two just that’s it for 20 min trip, the lion/tiger safari was also not up to the mark as we had to wait in long queue for it just to see those 2lion and a tiger. And lastly, every thing requires tickets a entry of 50₹/ person + 50₹ for van Rani train + 77 for safari + 25₹ for Kaneri caves+ parking depending on vehicle. It was a pathetic experience!"
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,achoix,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Solo,"Nice, but adjust your expectations.","Likes:-low entry fee-very large area and plenty of places to explore-very green in the middle of Mumbai! Nice getaway from the hectic city-wild life! You’ll see deer, birds, monkeys. Meh:-caves close at 17:00! But park closes at 18:30. Be aware!-entry to caves and other tours have different prices for locals and tourists. So if you are a non-local you’ll pay about 7-8 times more. It’s not a major problem if you actually are a tourist since you probably have enough disposable income, but again, just be aware. Also, not sure how they really know if you are a tourist or not, especially if you’ve naturalised and can speak the language... anyways minor point-maps and signs are in the local language so don’t expect english or any other language.-they accept cash only! So plan ahead of time.-no public bathrooms except in specific spots ie caves and safari. So plan to take your break well ahead of time as well.Dislikes:-very dirty. Unfortunately there is a lot of trash everywhere, including things like plastic bags, bottles, shoes, paper, packaging, textiles, clothing and general rubbish. It’s really everywhere including areas where the wild animals roam. -there is a constant lingering odour of urine. After a half hour or so you get used to it, but in some places it’s much stronger.Thoughts:-Mumbai like much of India is a constrast of extremely wealthy and extremely poor living close together. Some areas of the park are also slums. So you’ll be confronted by this. It’s a part of Mumbai as a whole and the park is no exception-if you are expecting a national park in the same way you’d expect in Norway or France, you need to adjust your expectation. Despite this, it is a beautiful place with much diversity as Mumbai the city itself. See it in that light and you will enjoy it."
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Ankur T,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 • Family,Bad Experience,"Didn't like the place much..Went with high expectations. The place is not very well organized, the labels or boards are not in place to guide the tourists..It was very scattered..The train service was also very badly managed with long mismanaged queues. Same with the bus safari, even over the weekend the buses were very less and hence the waiting time was longer than expected. No proper food arrangements in the campus. In the bus safari it was more of a ride than seeing animals.. Just saw one tiger after waiting for an hr. I had been to banerghatta national park in Bangalore and thats very well managed and u see lot of animals in the safari.Would not recommend the place."
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Freddy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,Awesome and truly historic,"I have lived in Mumbai for several years but this is the first time I went to see this park. I never imagined how extensive the property is on the inside. I got to see wildlife in a little bus journey. The caves are absolutely amazing. There is a lot of walking involved so I would recommend not taking small children or very elderly people on the tour. If you have people of this age group in your party, there is plenty place for them to sit and relax while you go on the walking tour but please be advised that the walking tour will take more than a couple hours if you want to see all the caves. You can skip some part of it which could save you up to an hour. A lot of the caves are similar so if you see some of the smaller ones, you could typically skip most of the similar ones. There is one small restaurant but they don't serve a large variety of food so I would suggest carrying some light snacks if you want to eat."

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Karthik R,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Family,Caged animals and poor safari,"Around 20 kms from Juhu is SGNP - Sanjay Gandhi National Park at Borivalli. The plan was to visit Kanheri Caves and then if time permits, visit the zoo at SGNP. The Kanheri caves are located deep inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park - around 7 kms from the SGNP entrance area. A fee is collected as entrance to the SGNP - Rs.58 per adult, Rs.31 per child and Rs.195 for a car. We had pay for the driver as well.The lion and tiger safari comes at a charge of Rs.77 per person and every 30 minutes the safari vehicle operates. Surprisingly, the safari vehicle drive us into big areas of lion and tiger and shows them in the cages ! wow ... never ever one can imagine to take a safari and see the big cats in cages ! Enough and we came back in 30 minutes ! Not worth the time or spend !"
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Californian,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,As fake as Sanjay Gandhi,"Wikipedia description of this park is quite alluring and so is its website narrative. The “Park” is touted as having ‘rich flora and fauna’ attracting two million human visitors (suckers, I might add) a year.Well, it is a classical bait and switch operation. First, there is a sizable entrance fee. Then the first attraction is “Lion and Tiger” safari. Never, never, ever take this safari. You have to pay separately for this. Then, you can ride a rickety bus that goes through fake sceneries. You can site an emaciated lion behind barbed wire, very much like what you see in a zoo. Just one lion, mind you.This is followed by a sighting of a single tiger. The same zoo setting. Wow! And, the tour ends. The worst safari experience ever for me.The Kanheri caves too charge an entry fee- Rs. 25 for Indians and, of course, a whopping Rs. 300 for non-Indians. The caves are old and can definitely be presented as a national treasure if it is managed by someone who has some imagination and drive. But they aren’t. No description or labels of anything you see. The pathway is rocky and uncomfortable with no maps or advice about what we should be looking for. There are about 70 or so these caves. You can see them without understanding what the heck you are seeing.The so called national park has a lot of residences with people at almost every corner of the roads. The whole thing is so underwhelming that I strongly recommend that you skip this fake park altogether."
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,RKJ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,For enjoying peace and serenity with entertainment,"It is one of the national park, situated in any city. While area of the park is vast, access to general public is given to limited area. However, it's part open to public is maintained and visits are allowed only on road parts. For children, toy train ride and boating is available, which can be enjoyed. Safari is not worth of long queue and spending money, as it gives approx 15 minutes bus ride and few animals in cages. Instead enjoying nature and park is worth spending time."

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Sophie R,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"Good get away, that's all","It is a good 'get a-way' from the busy city life but as a tourist also a little bit disappointment. We read on internet and saw on google maps about the lake (with crocodiles?!). But the road towards it, is blocked. Also with a mountain bike steep uphill towards the cave was not a succes. Roads are quite good but to steep (last part to the cave everybody had to walk with bike). It was a surprise the entry fee for tourists is 300 RP, so much more then for locals (25). So we decide to turn back after a little break. Environment is a bit dusty and dry and in the beginning of the park is a whole (slobs)village, so not really fully nature but still some city feeling. However it was interesting to see all, also the 'wildlife': some deers searching for food near the houses. We skipped the tiger tour because it didn't seem like a big adventure but with kids it may be fun and exciting. A lot of fresh fruit venders and good areas to chill and have a pick nick or a cooling of from town near the water and under the trees was nice!"

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,travellingTOM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Friends,One day trip - nothing really special,"It is in the City so it is very convenient to get there. You have to pay at the gate and then you can be taken by bus up the mountain - or you can walk. We took a walk - at least there is a chance to see something and stretch your legs. You can rent bikes too if you want. At this time of year there is very little green in the forest so it doesnt look too fancy. Monkeys everyewhere. After you get to the top if you want to get to the Kanheri Caves you have to pay again. Price for locals 25 rupee, price for foreigners 300 rupee - everything official:) Caves are nothing really special but overall good trip for one day especially if you want to take a break from noisy Mumbai."
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,kalex15,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Couples,Dont waste your Time.,"This is a somewhat expansive forest area in Mumbai. If you have been to any other National parks, you could safely give this place a miss, as there is nothing much to see here, except a couple of lions and tigers, if you are lucky. Take the entry tickets to the park from the entry gate very near to Borivali train station. Local guides will offer to take you around in their car, with a visit to Kanheri caves thrown in, for a fee of around Rs.1300. But if you want to give this a miss, you could just take the lion/tiger safari for around Rs. 80 per person, with a ride in a mini bus."

The park opens at 7:30 AM and closes at 6:30 PM. If possible, book the tickets online.This will help one to beat the queue at the entrance. You are allowed to take your vehicle inside provided you buy ticket for the vehicle. Pro tips: Do the kanheri caves first. It feels good to do trek ae early hours. Take the toy train ride next. Kids will enjoy this. It becomes crowded later during the day.Lion safari is a joke. Ticket per head is Rs. 77 (child Rs 33), where taken by a bus to show 2 caged lions and 2 tigers. Avoid this if possible. There is a boat ride you can take. Again, nothing great but you may spend some time boating as. However, no life jackets provided. Plan to spend 3-4 hrs here. Carry foods as you get only cucumber and few other fruits inside."

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Mohd Iqbal,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Family,Better to call a worthless safari,"So, if you are going to visit this just because you've heard that hou can see tiger and other wild animals in their natural habitat, believe me you will be disappointed. First you need to get entry ticket for the park, then after walking a small distance you will meet the cab service provider and they will ask you to hire a cab or shared cab because this is the only way you can see the whole area. The fare can be somewhere between 1000-1500 if you don't take a shared cab.Then you will be dropped to other counter where you will pay 60 rs per head to see the caged tigers but to see them you need to wait for the park authority bus. You need to stand in queue and wait atleast 20 mins for your turn, then your pathetic experience will start, where you will see caged area everywhere and if you are very fortunate then you will be able to see the tiger drom 100 mtr distance. After this I returned from this place and dropped the idea to see rest of the places"

Not many things to eat inside the park but plenty at the entrance..It's fit for infants to senior citizens to visit..activities inside the park are chargeable and may vary depending on timing.

Only one lion was free, rest were in cages)3) Boating4) Mini Train ride5) Garden6) Cycling till CavesPreviously i only visit this park during monsoon as it gives perfect trekking and small lakes and revers while trekking to caves. Now there are multiple attractions in the Park but also at the same time you have to be ready to pay fees for each and every attraction. Entry fees is 55 Rs. Then tickets for caves is around 25. 30 for Bus tickets for travelling to and from caves to main gate. It costs 70 Rs for lion safari, 50 for boating, 50 for mini train.

You should enjoy the Lion Tiger Safari for which a bus takes you there. Lion and Tigers are kept in cage, when we went we saw around 7 to 8 of them in all, surprisingly you sometimes do not spot even in forests like Jim corbett, Sariska etc. sometimes. Overall view is good and you can see Deer and Monkeys easily there. Also, you will find a lot of birds there. There is a small train and boating as well, which are nice to have as well.
