Sassoon_Dock,luvships,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Colorful Early Morning with Amaza Tours,"Wonderful tour to Sasson Dock for fish auction and Dadar Floral market.  Great way to see the hidden gems of Mumbai that most tourists miss. My Guide & Driver spoke good English,  very professional, and helpful."
Sassoon_Dock,igolfCA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Interesting!,"We went here about noon, so all the action of the morning was over. Our guide explained what went on and how the whole process was handled. It was interesting. We could see all the boats anchored and waiting for the next day. The fish were gone, but the smell wasn’t! Be prepared to not breathe deeply!"
Sassoon_Dock,markb120,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Very authentic fish market,"I recommend you to visit this place and to be impressed by the views, colors, and smells. The place also has a historical value."
Sassoon_Dock,kamal0309,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Amazing place to see the fish catch.,This is one place worth going early morning to see the fisherfolk for bringing their catch to sell in Wholesale. One can see a little lobster to fish almost the size of Dolphin.
Sassoon_Dock,Beni S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Can be skipped if it's very hot,But early in the morning it's very unusual .It's nice to see the fisherman unloading the catch and the crows fighting over the remains.Should be careful from muddy holes in the sideways that has fish remains at the bottom. If you wear sandals you should consider every step. The smell will not be removed.
Sassoon_Dock,shaswati,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,The Business,"It is the best fish market I have ever seen in Five decades and more of living in Mumbai. We reached there before dawn that is around five-thirty in the morning.The Sasson dock was buzzing with activity. Fishermen were unloading their fresh catch into the markets. Anyone can visit this market but one has to wear shorts and a T-shirt, flipflops, carry a bag in case you wish to shop. You would get a push from the fisherwomen who are generally oblivious of people around them.Go ahead and try"
Sassoon_Dock,Elthamboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Amazing place to visit,"If you want to see Mumbai in the raw then I would recommend a visit to Sassoon Dock. The noise, colour, smell of this fish market is an experience I'll never forget. I didnt see another non-Indian the whole morning I was there which made the experience even better. I went to the end of the pier where the boats enter & exit the unloading docks, I was amazed at what I saw - fishing trawlers ramming into one another to get through the small laneway to unload their catch.BE WARY OF YOUR SHOES. On the morning I went to the docks there had been a bit of light rain creating puddles everywhere, the puddles were full of fish guts, blood, and bones. My shoes ended up soaked in all this so I ended up having to throw them out due to the smell."
Sassoon_Dock,Mehdi G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,"Old Mumbai Fish Dock, worth to visit",best time to visit this place strt at  6.30 AM. the location is end ot colaba area.  the sasson Dock is very good point for take morning picture from sea and people
Sassoon_Dock,Nikhil P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 • Solo,Fish market,"Located few kms away from Colaba,  this place is one of the famous whole sale fish markets in Mumbai. It gives glimpse of lives of fishing community. Though it was originally built for cotton trade by famous Sassoon family but very few people know about this fact. One can visit the place if they can withstand the smell of the fish."
Sassoon_Dock,Hitesh S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,dock,"bASICALLY FOR FISH shipping, boat go   from there catch the fish, coma back,  you can see by car , its ok."
Sassoon_Dock,tim1154,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019,Sassoon Dock,"Raj era dock in Mumbai, a pleasant 30min walk from The Gateway of India down Colaba Causway. Visited mid morning when admittedly things had quietened down after the 5.00am landings but still very busy with bags of (fishy) atmosphere. There's a naval base next door so photos at your own risk. The entrance arch and clock tower are impressive"
Sassoon_Dock,Skaramoosh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Thumbs Up!,It was a fascinating experience walking through and along Sassoon Docks watching the daily lives of the fishing community and their peripherals.Everything has it's designated place here at the docks. They're used to visitors ogling their way of life and taking snapshots. Remember to ask before taking any portrait shots or generally of people/faces as they can get annoyed and upset if you take without their consent.I was denied a few times and decided to dismiss the idea entirely and take shots from afar.Do dress for the occasion as it's wet and dirty.In my personal opinion this is a must-see/do when in Mumbai.Highly Recommended!
Sassoon_Dock,Mdep,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,very nice place,"A very special experience in the city of Mumbai, the source of the fish market, an area where the fishing boats and boats arrive with all the fishing, unloading the spoils they obtained, the fish are sorted and weighed, and immediately transported to the local market for sale, the place stinks of fish stench, , But for those who love photography and authentic things, the place is a must visit sites"
Sassoon_Dock,BomiPardiwalla,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Family,Chaos,"Its early morming chaos with massive stink of rotting fish. Not a tourist item for sure. its for the fisherfolk who bargain, argue, and make a mess of the area."
Sassoon_Dock,MANCHIMASTER,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,SASOON DOCK,SASSON Dock is more than a wholesale fish market. where the boats come with their catch of fish and auction it. also processing of fish for export
Sassoon_Dock,ArisRoma,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,"Smelly, dirty & wonderful fish market","Huge, wholesale fish market, directly on the dock where the fishing boats arrive.You can smell it from a mile distance, it is crowded and dirty, yet it is one of the most fascinating places you can see in Mumbai. Unfortunately, taking photos is forbidden.Go before dawn, stay out of the quickly moving merchants' way, wear shoes you can easily clean afterwards. Not to be missed."
Sassoon_Dock,Shalini Digvijay,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Friends,Fish market,"I went to sassoon docks a few time with a friend to buy fish because I don't really know how to buy fish. the best time to go is early in the morning as early as you can go and remember you have to buy a whole lot of fish so make sure freezer is empty or you have a party that night.You need to bargain and it helps you can speak Marathi or Konkani, also you must carry your own bag to carry the fish home.Make sure to where old shoes and not to flowing clothes you don't want any muck on your clothes.You must go back and have a bath as soon as possible and leave your shoes outside the house and make sure you wash them well because rotting fish and dropping fish in real liquid really smells very bad. The Other times I have been to sassoon docks was at the sassoon dock art project... The art displayed was amazing and I was able to take some beautiful pictures."
Sassoon_Dock,NissimKrispin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Solo,Fascinating place,"The stench in some parts of Mumbai is so bad that in certain parts of the city I had to cover my nose and mouth not to choke. For example, Sassoon Dock, where the newly caught fish are sorted out by the fishermen's nets who returned by boat to the pier. The smell in the air is a smell of rotten fish mixes with the smell of sewage which sometimes you do not know what is worse... But if I’ll have only one hour to tour Mumbai again, this is definitely the place I’ll come visit!!!People selling and buying fish and sea-food everybody’s busy, very crowded, creating crazy action. Fascinating place.It is recommended to arrive to Sassoon Dock early in the morning when it is still cool and pleasant, and the main activity is at its peak."
Sassoon_Dock,Padmini15,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,A different Sassoon Dock!!,"I had never imagined in my wildest dreams that Sassoon Docks could look so beautiful.The whole place had turned into an art gallery, where 30 artists from around the world had painted on the walls of the dockyard.Inside Out, The Ugly  Truth and Plastic Ocean were some of my favourites!!"

Sassoon_Dock,Mohammed Kadiyani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Friends,Fish Market,This one is for the early morning buying activity .Fishes getting unloaded from the boats and come to you as fresh as they can be.The dock is quite old and rusty.Place sees a lot of influx from all class and society as fish is the local favourite meat here.Quality and quantities can outrank any other market in Mumbai .You just need to know what and where to negotiate.You can just zoom around here to enjoy the hustle and bustle of the morning market.The trade gets wrapped up pretty quickly and you need to ensure that you get your catch as early as possible 
Sassoon_Dock,nitsj76,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Fishing dock in South Mumbai,"Sassoon dock was one of the earliest fishing hubs in Mumbai.Even today, one can see the fishing boats come in early morning and the fisher men & women indulge in wholesale and retailing of the fresh catch from the seas. As one can imagine, the whole place breathes fish and one can find all the different fish varieties including shrimps,prawns and lobsters at the place.Great to go once to get a feel of the ancient fishing practice of the Koli fisherfolk."

Sassoon_Dock,Lisa B,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Solo,Fascinating,"Sassoon dock houses one of the original industries of Mumbai, that of the fishing. I went on a morning private tour with Freni Avari with Magic Tours. It was great to see all of the activity, both wholesale and retail, to watch the fishing boats come in, to see the fish unloaded, the women shelling shrimp (wearing their jewelry and beautifully colored saris, and to know that all of the possible recycling that can be done, is done, including styrofoam. "
Sassoon_Dock,David D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Impressive gateway and clock tower to the Docks,"Tuesday 6th March we were walking about the area and we arrived at the Gateway of the DocksIt was rather obvious from the smell that there was a fish market or something to do with fishing being undertaken inside the Docks.Were very unsure if tourists were allowed to go in, it all looked unwelcoming. Having said that we were impressed with the Gateway and it's impressive clock tower."
Sassoon_Dock,Ton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Couples,Wonderful sensory experience,"This is a place to go if you like local bustling atmosphere, beautiful colors and …  can stand the smell of fish.

Sassoon_Dock,gautamic,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Family,Wonderfully Fishy!!!,"142 year old heritage dock in Mumbai open to the public - come explorer the fish market! We did miss the art installations but the walk through the fishy lane with the view beyond was truly worth it!!O'course to buy the best sea food worth the noise,pushing,smell and feet stomping one really has to put their haggling skills to test.In case fish buying is the agenda....then the best deals come through when you visit in large groups. Also to get the freshest and the most reasonable fish - reach early and bargain hard!!"
Sassoon_Dock,Ruchika G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 • Friends,Stunning Art Installations during Art Featival,"Sassoon dock has become home to some stunning street art. And the St+Art festival only took it to another level (happens for 2-3 weeks in Dec). Raw vibe of the docks mixed with myriad expressions of various artists - pretty esoteric and beyond the canvas frames (all installations, no paintings). "
Sassoon_Dock,Indrani C,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017,ST+ART,It was an impressive venture but I wanted to know more about the natives of the area.  The murals were amazing.  
Sassoon_Dock,SJLD2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Family,Sassoon Dock art project. ,Surprised art exhibition in the old fishing port. Great paintings and sculptures in four floors. Many visitors showing Mumbai need more. Well to be recommend. Great view from the roof. 
Sassoon_Dock,KevzBhavsar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 • Friends,Attractive artfest for unlocking,"“Everyone in Mumbai knows Sassoon Dock Art Project but very few have ever stepped in. The aim of the Sassoon Dock Art Project is to unlock an area, which is ready to be discovered, enlightening its narratives through art inventions of international and unique Indian artists.- For more: Keval Bhavsar Photography | Instagram"
Sassoon_Dock,Pulkita,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Nice StArt exhibition,"We went to see the Street Art Exhibition that took us throught the life of the people living at Sassoon Dock. it was interesting.. starting with the smell that hits you even before you reach. the strong smell of fish which can be quite a check for how tolerant you are as a vegetarian. nice exhibits walking us through the lives of the women who work together as friends... the way everyone lives there, their lifestyle, music, what they eat, what they do... and then we went to the docks which felt like a little world in its own self. there were endless people peeling shrimps. i didnt know there was so much shrimp in the sea. hundreds of workwomen peeling piles and piles of shrimp. as we walked on our way out there was the ice store where they would make huge blocks of ice and run it through the crusher... the ice crusher must be such a mean machine.. such hard ice it crushes to little little pieces. ouch!"
Sassoon_Dock,Roopa K,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 • Friends,Vibrant sight,A vibrant place that exhibits the daily routine of mariners - you can visit this place to choose and buy from a variety of fish stock that is made available at a reasonable price than that from the main market. Be careful with your belongings because the place is jam-packed. Avoid going to the Sassoon Dock if you resent from the peculiar smell of fishes!
Sassoon_Dock,Marcus W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2017 • Solo,OLD TOWN FISH MARKET,"Great place to visit and see how fishing boats in India work, good friendly atmosphere, seems to be working the same way it has for decades or more.Everything done by hand, no automation here."
Sassoon_Dock,jeremy s,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,Amazing insight into lives of fishing fleet ,Amazing to visit even in the afternoon when the fishermen are restocking their fishing vessels with ice fuel and equipment. 
Sassoon_Dock,Gauthamkundapur,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Solo,The smell ,"The smell of decaying fish carcass,  dried fish and collective drainage combine to produce a cocktail that tests your ability to sustain sensory over dose on nasal neurons. That apart,  visit at right time would be rewarding as fresh fish is available at right price. "
Sassoon_Dock,thatzamit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Friends,Nice,You will see lots of fishes here. Best thing to do here is the dawn tour which can be booked in advance.
Sassoon_Dock,Steve T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,A MUST see for me !!,Full of historic colonnial overtones but a real part of Indian culture and everyday real life living. A colourful working dogs replete with abounding colour as the boats come in with their catch of the day and allow the preparation to be progressed seemingly by myriads of families who undertake such both for a meal and their livelihood. A nice way to spend an hour or so BUT it's a longish walk from the Gateway to India (but worth it) .... and it does smell somewhat !
Sassoon_Dock,doctor-indyeah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,FISH FISH AND FISH EVERYWHERE,"It is a ""ritual"" for fish lovers on Sundays to visit Sassoon Dock, early morning just by dawn break. I really mean when I say ritual, as there are lots of things to look into and adhere to before entering the dock to buy fish.- Wear Chappals / Sandals, WASHABLES. They will get wet and that too with Fish Ice Water which stinks like hell in a few hours.- Wear 3/4ths or Shorts. Avoid full trousers unless you are not planning to throw it away!-Keep a bucket of water in your car trunk. You need that to wash your feet before entering the car post purchase of fish.- Keep adequate change. Pay to the change. Because if they give change in return will result in a stink in your wallet- Be there early in the morning,preferably by 0530-0600. That's when boats are being unloaded. Freshest of the fish, cheapest of the price.- DO NOT buy from the first vendor you see. There are lot more inside and the more you go in, more fresh and cheap fishes are. Go until you see boats next you.-Bargain hard. Give 50% of what they quote. Still you will be paying him more than what he gets from middlemen. So, no guilty conscience.- Check the fish before you buy. Some may be crushed and is of no use.-Try going in group, buy a big fish. That will be cheap. The cutting women at entrance will divide the cut fish perfectly.-Park your car at a distance. The fish lorries are reckless.It's a full fledged unit by itself, a unique one giving daily bread to thousand families. The fishermen, the middlemen, Fisher women who sells in retail, tea vendors, breakfast vendors, polythene vendors, taxis, head load workers, packers and movers so on... Worth a visit to buy fish. NB: Avoid going with kids."
Sassoon_Dock,Phil G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Couples,Dawn Tour - Sassoon Dock + vegetable + flower and fruit markets,"Booked a tour through our hotel for a dawn tour. What an absolutely amazing experience. A complete assault on your senses. The sights, sounds and smells will stay with you for a long time... Knowledge and delivery by Aditya Pai made it well worth the effort to start at 0515. The boats, the fish, the auctions and the Koli women are mind blowing - all sweetened later with the smell of fruit, veg and flower ...PS Don't wear best shoes or over long trousers, the dock is wet."
Sassoon_Dock,Srikkanth B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Business,Fresh fish cheap rates ,"If you are a fish lover then the only place to satisfy your needs is saloon dock. You get to buy  fresh fish for the cheapest price in mumbai. You need to bargain to strike a good deal. If you are looking for a small quantity for a micro families daily need, then you will have difficulty. The dealers in here prefer bulk buying. The solution is to combine with few friends and share."
Sassoon_Dock,SEs,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Friends,Boats,This is a boat yard here. Nothing special. Not a tourist attraction. The area is not clean. You can give it a miss. 
Sassoon_Dock,AnaPhylaxis2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Couples,A Must See,"This historic place is fascinating if you like fishing boats and docks. We watched them shred ice and load it into the hulls of these ancient wooden boats, mend nets, and work on engines. Supposedly it is best to see it early in the morning when the boats come in loaded with fish but we didn't make it there earlier enough. It was still pretty entertaining."
Sassoon_Dock,percyvakil,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Solo,Fishing trawler docks,"Sassoon Dock is not what it used to be. In the old days it was full of fishing trawlers, which used to arrive full of fish and other seafood and people used to go there to pick out the best seafood from there.Today there are still some trawlers coming in though not as much seafood. The dock area has a nice but not well maintained gateway."
Sassoon_Dock,aarjay,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,One of our Mumbai highlights . Fabulously fascinating,"When we travel we like to experience that which makes a city tick. The Sassoon Dock is such a placeWe arrived just after 7am and it wasn't long before we were right in the thick of the activities of the fisherfolk. It was amazing. Heaps of people, loads of fish, hustling and bustling, loads of color and of course fishy smells. It was amazing sensory overload.  Don't let this put you off. If you enjoy experiencing the guts of a city, you will love it. Just make sure you wear shoes that you don't mind getting dirty and you're in for a treat. Keep your wits about you as the ground can be slippery and the fisherfolk are are extremely busy doing their days work. Fascinating to see how they bring the fish onto shore, clean them, sell them etc etcWe were advised not to take photos but managed to sneak a few with permission. The temptation was too great and the material too inviting.We went with a guide and perhaps this made the experience better, as he was pointing things out to us along the way - making it more meaningful, looking out for us and giving it all context.I would unhesitatingly recommend a visit."
Sassoon_Dock,K K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Crazy!,"We visited the docks around 6am when things were just... absolutely nuts. We stayed for around 10 minutes and left. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely worth seeing, but  people are hustling all around you and will push you out of the way. There really isn't anywhere to stand and watch everything, you have to walk into the madness, just expect to get shoved. We had no problems taking pictures, it seemed everyone was too busy buying and selling to care what we were doing.  Also as a warning you WILL smell heavily of fish afterwards and will need a shower with lots of soap. We had to wash our clothes and shoes immediately after returning."
Sassoon_Dock,Polished Mitra,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 • Couples,Colorful dock,"The Sassoon Docks, in the Colaba area of Mumbai, is a very colorful experience. It is one of the oldest docks in Dubai and despite being open to the public please know that it is not really well regarded to make pictures there. I took a few and was soon advised not to repeat the triumph!The place bursts a strong typical smell. As expected. You can see the different production stages as you walk through the dock.I’m sure that if you get a guide you’ll have a much higher rate of success on visiting, making pictures and not being harassed.It is a nice experience. Not to be missed."
