Shree_Siddhivinayak,muthu1956,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Lost its sanctity and divinity,"Between 16thDecember to 22nf Dec,2022,I visited five times for morning 5.30aarthi.The temple like most well visited temples have become very commercial and money minded.If you have money power and tip the temple security staff,you can jump the line and get darshan close to Lord Vinayaka.Ladies  and gents in shorts are allowed to enter the sanctum.If you have political or police influence,you can jump the line on Tuesdays.All in all, it has lost its divinity and it has become hype"
Shree_Siddhivinayak,Ellis Karenterina,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Breath taking!,"Heard about the temple being very popular and so visited with my friends from work. Taxis are crazy and won't pick you up from nearby areas. Share taxis are the ones you need to take. Sign boards inside the temple could be better. Close-up darshan is at the back side of the temple but Doordarshan is at the entrance so people (first timers) get confused. Flower stalls are a loot. Overall the display of idols is vast/wide and the view to the devotees is good. Rush is a huge thing though. Photography is not allowed so no pics. The veg restaurant outside the temple is good for food. Chappal stand is free but will be available only another devotee returns their chappals. Have to wait in line. Prasad counters are spread across and so are teeth prasad counters. Free laddu prasad is set up outside the main temple and people coming out of the temple or people already outside can stand in line to collect, which is tedious. Laddu prasad can be directly provided inside the temple premise so that people need not stand in line. There should be a barricade in the center of the path so that it is convenient for people walking in both directions."

Shree_Siddhivinayak,Family Traveler,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Must visit if you are in Mumbai,"This Ganesha temple is a must-visit if you are in Mumbai. There are a bunch of shopkeepers inside who will try to make money by selling flowers and sweets at a higher price but you can buy them from outside at a better price. If you have a laptop or electronic items, they have a locker outside where you can deposit it for Rs 50. Also, after the puja, if you want to try traditional Maharashtrian snacks/foods, there are several shops there. I tried in a shop called Modakam and the taste was amazing."
Shree_Siddhivinayak,Saumil,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2022,Excellent,"Hey, Recently i visited Siidhivinayak temple in my car from Ahmedabad, I was also worried for the same reason for Parking - being Mumbai so congested. I tried googling for parking spaces and even tried calling temple but of no use. Then my wife came across this app called ‚ÄúPark+‚Äù which allows you to pre-book parking spots. And lo and behold they had Siddhivinak temple parking listed. I booked it from that app and also got a discount on my next Fastag recharge on the same app. It was a very convenient parking experience for me.I am not an Apple user so i don't have a link to their iOS app.Hope this helps.Ganpati Bappa Moriya!"

Our driver dropped us off outside and warned us not to buy anything from outside. As we walked out people came to crowd us to buy flowers and leave your shoes it was not a nice experience.We walked in and same thing all the flower vendors come to you to go to their stall to buy. We went to the queue which was very long (we went on a sat) and it was too hot to stand outside. So we decided to do Darshan from far, it was absolutely manic in front people in crowds pushing and shoving to see Lord Ganesh for a second and be pushed forward. You could go through the fast track but again it‚Äôs all to do with money and I don‚Äôt agree that going to a temple you have to pay at every point you go to. This was not our idea of a peaceful time at a temple and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it we were out within 15 minutes. There are many beautiful temples in India to visit without this hassle."

Shree_Siddhivinayak,Sgoel,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,"Nice architecture and beautiful temple, however exit management of gates is not good","Nice architecture and beautiful temple, however exit management of gates is not good. The Exit gates do not co-incide with where you have kept your shoes taken down making the whole experience cumbersome. it took us lot of struggle to reach to entry point where we had taken off our shoes. Also after standing in queue for 1 hour, when we finally made entry to temple for darshan, policemen and staff just push you away and not let you stand for more than 10 seconds there !"
Shree_Siddhivinayak,mukesh p,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Not worth it,Whether it is God's worship or just for appreciation of architecture a wait of 1.5-2 hrs in line makes it unworthy. Going on weekend is not suggested due to heavy crowd.
Shree_Siddhivinayak,Jaideelion,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Prayer place and devotion,"The temple appearance from outside is very nice. Stepped in to see the ambience and sense of devotion. I am a very very strong devotee of Sanatan Dharma but the only thing I saw was money making street inside the temple area. The sellers push you to accept their product and the more you buy the better devotee you are. Secondly, the officials of the temple have two channel for Darshan. One where you pay 1001 Rupees for escorted prayer visit or the other is normal everyday person access. I walked around the area inside and the only thing I saw and felt was money money money. I did not feel the presence of Siddhi Vinayak. The readers will find my view upsetting but the fact is that the temples have become income generating farce in India. The poor have very good and sincere faith but these temples are taking advantage by minting money.One thing I enquired about was if the temple had a charitable organisation as part of service. No one present could tell if there is one. I bought a beautiful Mala(galand) and gave it to wife for the prayer idols we had in the hotel room. They travel with us everywhere."
Shree_Siddhivinayak,Deepak Rana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,All about faith ,It structure itself is majestic and can be seen from far off. They say all your problems are resolved once you visit this holy place.
Shree_Siddhivinayak,shishir,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Visit ,"The temple is good, they give priority access to Senior Citizens which is good. Paid access is also available as donation tickets. What I don't like is some people don't move and the care takers keep on pushing people to move. So if you think o for the first time you might not even be able to pray and get a darshan properly. My time was spent in managing my mother and son. "
Shree_Siddhivinayak,Kaushik G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Very popular Lord Ganesha temple,We had visited this popular Lord Ganesha temple located in Dadar area in Mumbai on a Thursday morning with family. Luckily there were not many devotees at the time of our visit and we had a very peaceful darshan of the Lord. There is heavy security in the temple premises and we had to enter through metal detector gates followed by manual checking by police personnel. We kept our shoes at one of the many vendors selling flowers and coconuts for offering to the Lord. We watched the Lord from a podium offering our prayers while the priest offered flowers to the Lord. It was a divine spiritual experience.

Several times, I tried but only fruitful in the year 2017. Dhanyavaadh. One should visit Siddhi Vinayak, CUTE Vinayaka. Most beautiful. When you are in front of Lord Vinayaka, it is damn sure, you will forget everything by just seeing the beauty of Cute siddhi Vinayaka. I feel very graceful once, I visited temple.

I visited April 2017, but in TripAdvisor, there is no option to provide my visit date except the current year position only they shown. It has to be modified for option like ""Other Date"""
Shree_Siddhivinayak,kc j,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Very crowded on Sunday ,The family decided to worship lord Siddhi vinayak on Sunday. We had been planning and suddenly decided to go there. I thought Sunday morning would be a nice time. We reached at 8.10 am and even by then the place was very crowded. We took the serpentine queue and finally went inside. Even there it was crowded but we managed to get inside and offer our prayers. The temple has become quite enthusiastic about the queue and its management . This makes things nice and orderly. It's clean and well maintained. That helps.

Shree_Siddhivinayak,Vijay Jotwani,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Calming Effect! A must visit in Mumbai,Shree Ganeshji is a one of the highly popular Hindu Gods. It's true that all work/projects etc started after the blessings of Lord Ganesh are more likely to be successful. This ancient temple over the years has gathered so much of pious and positive energy that entering the premises has a very calming and 'feel good' effect. The darshan of Lord Ganesha and blessings are a great way to begin the Mumbai trip.
