Snow_Kingdom,Manikanda,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Very worst experience,"We had very bad experience after visiting snow Kingdom.1. Quality of adult winter gears are very poor( Velcro in jackets were gone; socks were very loose and old; ice can easily enter throgh the boots)2. WINTER GEARS ARE VERY POOR FOR KIDS (BOOTS WERE VERY SMALL)3.MY ADVICE IS DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS INSIDE.4. No proper instructions from the employees 5. Our kids literally cried because of the cold(ice easily entered to their feet).6.Cost is too high.7. Staffs are very rude and behaving irresponsible A REQUEST TO SNOW KINGDOM MANAGEMENT, PLEASE PROVIDE GOOD QUALITY GEARS"

Snow_Kingdom,rggg,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good time pass!! ,"It's much more hygienic than the other snow world's i have visited so far. Size is relatively small but then it wasn't that crowded when we visited... Hardly 15-20 people on Saturday 1.15 slot. Inside is also well maintained. Slide is relatively short but still fun.Ticket price at 650 for 30-40 mins is bit on higher side but given that you are going to visit it once it's kinda OK. Overall, one time visit if you have time to kill. Your kids are going to enjoy it. "

Snow_Kingdom,karishmashah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Snowfall,"Good opportunity to experience what it feels in a place that's covered with snow. 650 adults and 600 kids reasonable for a 45mins slot with 15mins prep to change into the required thermal clothing of jacket, thick socks, boots and gloves. Compact place with two opportunities to sledge and slide.The temperature isn't very comfortable for those not used to snow and most people exit after 20-25mins so dress up accordingly if you want to last till the end.They provide place to keep bags and shoes too.There is a tattoo place and a cafe inside too."

Snow_Kingdom,FoodieFun,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Cold, entertaining and fun","ofcource if it is snow kingdom, it would be very cold, and the jackets etc provided by snow kingdom is not of our size(obviously) so if u find snow fun, go for it. my 2yo, couldn;t stay long so i had to come out within 30min. Otherwise it was good fun!"
Snow_Kingdom,Dheeraj2308,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Forget the word 'hot',"I came here on a hot sunny day, perspiring all the way. The feelings were completely turned upside down, when my sweat froze, literally. What an amazing place to have fun, with friends & family. Helps to have an enjoying time with your best pals. You can do snow-fun activities like skating, snow rides, create snowman etc.Keep in mind the temperatures are really low, though they provide you the appropriate gear, if you are cautious of winters or cold, avoid. A good place to have fun for an hour throwing snow all around. Sure you will come out and have a warm drink. Enjoy!"

It's an awesome place enjoyed by both kids and adults equally. We had a super fun time at the place, though due to the cold, we couldn't stay for a long duration. On weekends, it's quite crowded, so better to keep some time at hand. Tip: They provide snow suits to go inside, so you should wear comfortable clothing over which you can put the snow suit."

Lots of families are there in mass having a complete blast (escaping from the heat outside). However, with small kids, it is difficult to stay in there as long because they get really really cold. We ended up getting out of there in 20 minutes because the kids were freezing but it was still a very good time. "
