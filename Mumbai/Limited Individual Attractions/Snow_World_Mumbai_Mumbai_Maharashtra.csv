Snow_World_Mumbai,snowridr,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2021 â€¢ Family,Currently Closed,Unfortunately Snow World is closed for the time being. They are performing renovations and at least in the entrance way everything is pretty much torn up and a strong smell of chemicals in the air.  There were no signs outside saying they were closed.  Their website has a notice about being closed until the end of the month but due to the Covid outbreak.  
Snow_World_Mumbai,Menka Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 â€¢ Friends,Refreshing in Summer.,"Snowworld is in Phoenix Mall at ground floor. They provide u with shoes, jacket and socks, they charge rupees 600/- per person for 1 hour. Inside u will feel relaxing and cold like Kashmir. They allow u to click picture and there are several games like sketching, slides and many others. The staff is very good and cooperative and polite. Atmosphere is very cool and refreshing specially in summer. Overall it is a good place to spend time with love onces,  family and friends. "

Snow_World_Mumbai,Sandeep J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Nice experience with enough activities,"Nice experience in the centre of Mumbai (Phoenix Market City Mall). Lasts for an hour and costs 600 rs per person. They provide jackets with head cover, boots and gloves. Socks are not provided so if you are not wearing them, need to buy from them (40 rs). There's quite a few fun activities for people of all ages (slide, basketball rink, sledges, snow boards etc.). Few nice spots for selfies (igloo, wooden cabin etc.). For the more adventurous kind, there's a snow rink and they provide skates for snow skating. Finally, you just have plain snow to play with your friends and families. Overall a nice experience. Tip - Don't stay too long inside, if your socks get wet (they provide good quality gum boots but snow can enter if you slip and fall and/or while playing in the snow) and your feet are hurting."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Ayesha L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 â€¢ Family,Family Fun ,"Family Fun and Entertainment!It has never snowed in Mumbai but we can definitely experience thrilling snow activities at @snowworldmumbai At @marketcitykurla An Indoor Snow themed park.This place is open for 365 days and one session of one hour is enough to enjoy the snow activities. The temperature is -10 and it's freezing cold. My son enjoyed Ice Sliding the most they also have Snow boarding, Snow Sledging, Ice Skating, igloos, penguin setup etc.They provide jackets, gum boots and gloves at the entrance. Snow cafe has hot beverages available like soups,  tea, coffee which is must have after playing at snow area. Staff here is very cordial and helpful, extremely caring and quick at the same time.  Weekends are totally pack here so it is advisable to book your slots online on their website. The charges are very minimal and absolutely worth every penny spent here. It was altogether very unique experience for my family and super fun as well as we got relief from Mumbai's scorching heat for sometime â˜ºðŸ˜„Rate - 600/- per person.."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Deepa1234,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 â€¢ Family,Needs improvisation,"We had been to snow world in April. Since it was weekend, it was very crowded and had to wait for an hour for our time slot. They provided jackets and gloves which were cold n humid. The boots were regular gum boots which were completely wet from inside. The floor was covered with thin layer of ice.there were few sledge compared to the number of people in the snow city. The slope is not slippery n we were pushing ourselves in some area to go downwards. we were not feeling much cold but the boots and socks were completely soaked in water that was making us freeze.overall the experience was not worthy. They should manage and maintain the accessories properly. place to is also small. There is a small area for skating. Overall time provided is 1 hr - 15 mins for wearing accessories that they provide and handling our baggage and 45 minutes in snow world. It would be fun if visiting in large groups."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Prakash K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 â€¢ Family,Feel Kashmir in Mumbai,One can enjoy Kashmir cold for one hour just by paying Rs 600/-.During snow fall they are using smoke in place of snow.

Snow_World_Mumbai,vinay,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 â€¢ Family,Snow world at phoenix market city,"It's nice place to spend time with family n kids for 45 minutes in summer. It is located inside phoenix market city mall at Kurla. Adequate skating, guiding, sliding activity.kids enjoy snow fall n snow area. The shows or sessions start at 11 every hour. Prefer early shows to avoid rush n queues. U can reach n purchase tickets. Ticket 575/- per person is little costly. Take your own pair of soxes. They r compulsory n if u don't  have them u have to purchase at 40/- each pair. Good thing is footwear, jackets etc are available in almost all  sizes for  kids n adults.

Snow_World_Mumbai,Ajay G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 â€¢ Couples,Good for spending some time... One time visit,"Visited the place in Feb 2019. Nice place for kids to enjoy for an hour. Adults might not find the place so catching. Initially, you would be charmed by the snow if you have not seen real snow. The set-up tries to recreate the likes of snowy places and is successful to a certain extent as well. After maybe 20-25 minutes, once you have completed your photo sessions across the place you would feel there's nothing left to do. Incase you want to take your kids for outing, this place can be considered. "
Snow_World_Mumbai,MANCHIMASTER,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 â€¢ Family,snow world,snow world is in phoenix mall at kurla. It is the largest snow park in mumbai where you can experience ice skating and other snow activities without going abroad
Snow_World_Mumbai,Santosh G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 â€¢ Friends,Best place at Market City,This is the Best place at Phoenix Market City for Kids.  Very cold place and would be great experience for Kids wanting to enjoy ice.
Snow_World_Mumbai,Ashish V,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 â€¢ Family,Not worth it,Concept is good but tickets are expensive. Quality of ice is pathetic feels like it's more of mud. jackets provided are of low quality. And not much useful inside. I had to come out quickly as it made my kid shiver like anything.
Snow_World_Mumbai,HF112,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018,nice place,not much activity there for children. and very small only snow we can enjoy. price high for only 45 mins.
Snow_World_Mumbai,Gautam Pendharkar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2017 â€¢ Friends,Great Escape from Indian Summer,"It is a great place to visit if you are thinking of escaping from the Mumbai heat. Since it is the first of a kind attraction, its fun for entire family. Though the equipment not maintained, some stinky gloves and boots. Overall it was a very good experience. Go in the weekdays in summers. Great cost cutting option, you can visit if you do not want to go on trip to hill station ;)"
Snow_World_Mumbai,Pinkesh J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 â€¢ Family,"Nice break from summer, but not worth more than one visit","It's a good place to go in summers to break from the heat, as its conveniently located in Phoenix market city mall, so you can easily plan half/full day of activities along with Snow World. The temperature was comfortable. There are a not a lot of activities in there to keep you busy for 45 mins. Worth a visit once."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Anitraveller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 â€¢ Couples,Refereshing activity in summners,"I went there last week, we enjoyed it bcoz it was very hot. Its just a very big area with lot of Snow and -8 degree temperature. They provide Winter jackets, gloves and shoes. On the whole experience was nice."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Some1stranger,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 â€¢ Family,Worth One Visit Max,"It was my daughterâ€™s birthday and we decided to surprise her by planning a visit to Snow World. We had pre-booked the tickets and because of the time slot chosen didnâ€™t face much que.Immediately upon entering we were given the jackets, gloves, rubber shoes and then we entered the snow zone.Well it was really chilled with inside but the rather than snow it was crushed ice. The kid enjoyed a lot in the slides, sledge and the models of penguins. However not much of activity for the adults. We were disappointed as we couldnâ€™t make snowman. The snow was not clean either. Couldnâ€™t find any attendant in the snow cafe.Overall it was a ok type experience "
Snow_World_Mumbai,Prabhat Jain,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 â€¢ Family,Not great but not bad too..,"Its an experience of -10 degree in Mumbai. Its an hour activity in all including changing of winter cloths and inside fun.They provide jacket , shoes and gloves. Socks are mandatory - either you can get it yours or buy on the spot. Full lowers are highly recommended else ice may hurt u specially kids. They don't provide lowers so plan accordingly. 1 hour is more than enough as its extremely chilled to be inside beyond that. Artificial ice do not give feel of hill station but understandable.Its a flat place so skating or other activities are a let down.One time go with kids."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Vivek Dhadha,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018 â€¢ Family,Not bad for a couple of hours,Snow world in Marketcity at Kurla is an attempt to replicate the various snow parks around the world. The best ones we have been to are in Dubai and this one falls woefully short of it. Yet this is the best option within city limits if wish to visit a snow park in Mumbai.
Snow_World_Mumbai,Atri_Mandal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 â€¢ Family,Experience snow in summer,"This place is located within the Phoenix mall in Kurla and a nice place to take small kids to. The entry fee is a bit high considering the size of the place. Nevertheless it's fun packed with igloos, reindeers, seals etc. It also has snow slides where u can slide down using snow boards; and sledges and laser light shoes and foot tapping music. All in all a good place to experience for the kids."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Preeti S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 â€¢ Family,Disappointed,It was a real letdown. After seeing the description i had expected a lot more but was really disappointed came out in 15 mins.
Snow_World_Mumbai,jaygaglani937,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 â€¢ Friends,Ice world,it was nice to visit this and it was far better experience than the snow world in Essel world and also was not expecting such a good thing.
Snow_World_Mumbai,TKuldeep,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 â€¢ Family,Great Place... Worth to visit atleast once,"Snow World is situated in Phoenix Market City , Kurla, Mumbai...Visited first time and found worth place to visit family....Snow World provides Snow theme based games in snow area like ice skating, sledging, sliding, ball games,sleeping etc.Place gives natural feeling of hill station surrounded by snow and entire family members will enjoy playing with snow to various snow games...Snow World allows one hour tour including 15minutes for wearing snow shoes,gloves,Jackets provided by them and rest 45 minutes to play and enjoy with snow.Socks is must and in case u are not wearing u can purchase inside only...A chargeable Hot Tea/Coffee/Soup at zeo to minus 10degree temperature adds more enjoyment inside snow world...Worth to visit with Friends/Family members..."

Snow_World_Mumbai,Avinash2184,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 â€¢ Couples,Not a Snow World... Its Ice,"First of all, there is NO SNOW, its just crushed Ice. Place is also small. There has to be a lot of snow if one has to Ski but there was hardly anything on the surface and one had to literally drag him/her but it was also not working. Was expecting the snowfall to be good but there was no snowfall. Checked with one of the staff members and he said that it will begin in few minutes but it didn't happen even after waiting. Disappointing experience :("
Snow_World_Mumbai,Anshru8,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 â€¢ Family,Its a letdown,Anyone who visited Ski Dubai in Mall of Emirates in UAE will definitely say the same thing as title of this review. I can understand it cannot be recreated in such a scale however a decent effort is also not made to make it attractive.Its really not a worth of money spent.
Snow_World_Mumbai,Atharva1234,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2017 â€¢ Friends,Snow World Mumbai ,This is one of the Mumbai tourist attractions.It is nice for all and the temperature is below 0 degree. So we should be prepared  for it. The area of the place is small.You should experience it.
Snow_World_Mumbai,John_Doe1011,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2017 â€¢ Couples,An one time experience,"Price is 575 for one person for one hour. However, if you go on a weekday, when the crowd is less, even if you spent more than an hour, no one bothers. The ticket includes- one hour entry in the ice zone; ice boots, jacket and gloves. One gets multiple things to do inside - it includes- ice skating; sledging; slides etc. This place is more for kids especially school going kids. It can provide them with a decent picnic experience."

They give you boots and clothes required to enter the premises. Later you have to return it. Inside there is a ride,igloo, ice skating and snow dance and many fun things to do. "

There is a slippery slide where u actually sit on a tyre and slide down my son really had a good time place they have a small ice skating ring.

Snow_World_Mumbai,Ashraf4916,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2017 â€¢ Family,Small yet Fun packed ,"Kids enjoyed it like anything, thought the place is small but yet it is fun for city residents. Overall a good experience "
Snow_World_Mumbai,Sumithran,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2017 â€¢ Family,A really cold outing,"The place is maintained at -10 degC. Boots, jackets and gloves are provided and you have to take socks with you or you can buy it from there. The place is a novel experience maybe good for one visit. You can stay for about 45 min. Activities include skating, sledge riding and some slides for children. The snow is slippery at some places and so older persons have to be careful. You can have a snow fight, but by 30 min you start feeling that you have had too much. The boots are also wet and eventually your feet starts freezing inside. Anyway, you can leave earlier if you want."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Dr.Y,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 â€¢ Family,Worth a visit... worth the money,"Awesome place to enjoy...especially with kids and family... worth money... safe ... has sledge riding, skiing, ice skating ,etc. artificial snow fall.. they provide proper protective clothing and there are guards inside to guide and protect"
Snow_World_Mumbai,Hiral_Desai,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Friends,Artificial snow at small place,"Been there in summer March, 2015 & then time limit was not reasonable.Be careful with ice skating as it's risky for first timers or those who do not know how to do it. Though you will just walk holding side supports provided at skating zone, chances are there to fall down on thick and solid ice floor. I experienced it and what disappointed me is no attention to help person who fell down or having injury but showing his own stunts that how awesome he can do skating!!! Second disgusting experience was when getting back to snow shoes after removal of skating shoes. Being last person to get out of skating zone, had only pair of snow shoes which was not of my size!!! Lady who was in charge of managing those shoes was forcing me to wear those shoes!!! How one can deal with knee injury and smaller size of shoes at same time, & height is time limit was running to make exit from such snow world. She kept telling me and forcing me to wear those snow shoes fast as it is compulsory and time is over. Finally I left those snow shoes there itself and walked out with socks only.Pros:Good for summertime to get chilled artificial climateCan have some good photographs cherishing moments with snow balls, walls and other wooden things.Cons:Improper and careless Management/ Supervisor/ Helper located inside Snow World(play zone)Small area (Not enough space for Snow Boarding) and limited things to do with high number of people."
Snow_World_Mumbai,TaxÃ­di T,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017,Freezin fun!!,"The place offers a wonderful experience at -10`c experience. The place provides an experience of variety of exiting things like: Ice sliding, skiing, sledge riding, ice skating..Its a enjoyable place and the time limit of one hour will fall short.. but its a worth visit :)  "
Snow_World_Mumbai,gazellegazala,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 â€¢ Family,Worth a visit!,I visited Snow World with my nieces last month. The kids really enjoyed the unique experience. It doesn't ever get so cold in this part of the country so this was the next best thing. I am not personally fond of the cold so I wanted to flee in half an hour but the children were thoroughly into it. Special thanks to Pawan who helped us to recover our photographs from their database even after the download window had lapsed.
Snow_World_Mumbai,Ashwin K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 â€¢ Family,Family Fun Time at SnowWorld,"Place for real snow fun, lots of activities to go around. Worth the amount you spend on entry ticket. Good option for quick refreshing break in the city."

Snow_World_Mumbai,Payal S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 â€¢ Family,"Good, cld be better","Good place to go with family specially kids. The duration is 1hour and they provide you jacket,  boots and gloves are included in tickets which cost 575 Rs per person irrespective of age. Kids below 2 go free. SOCKS ARE MANDATORY, carry thick socks else you will have to buy it there. Be careful as few areas inside are slippery. Pre book or else slots get full. Book online as per your convenience and reach 20 mins before time get ideal size of jackets etc for you. The place is small and the snow is hard, not really like actual snow. I think they should have more snow and larger area. "
Snow_World_Mumbai,shankystud19,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 â€¢ Family,Snow,"Nice place among Mumbaikars , Artificial Snow Fall you can enjoy over there , lots of snow activities. Favourite among children. One time Go"
Snow_World_Mumbai,VishalD,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016,Average place and too costly in comparison of what you get,This a place to go if you want to give your loved ones the experience of being in snow. thou it no where closer to be being really smooth snow...Wear thick socks and take a extra pair or else you will get frost bites and the 1st pair will get wet thou not sure how water sips in the boots provided.the sledges are not in get condition or maintained properly... no one to coach on snow boarding or skifor cost you pay certainly seems to lack a lot of things
Snow_World_Mumbai,Srikkanth B,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 â€¢ Family,A place for people to enjoy snow. If you are lazy to travel to find some......,"A small place, it gives an idea of how snow feels and to experience sick low temperature.  The charges are 575 per person and this includes rental of  jacket, boots and gloves ( children above 2 are charged). Be early to get fitting dress and pls do carry a good pair of extra socks. Nice place to have photographed. The administration has arranged photographers and they would click photos which you can select and get printed at the exit with  a charge of 200 rupees."
Snow_World_Mumbai,devarshsaraf,2.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 â€¢ Family,Very Tacky,"My experience at snow world was not very good. The jackets provided to us to keep us warm were stinking of sweat. Further, the cold feels too artificial and the snow does not provide too much fun since it is synthetic. "
Snow_World_Mumbai,kishangupta_21,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 â€¢ Family,"To get frrezed, an Ok experience",I have hared about this place and in Diwali vacation went with family. As per the name this place gives you experience of ice world with -10 degree Celsius.But area wise it is very small and having most option for small children. If you are all are adults then you might get disappointment.You have to get the ticket online (at least 3 hours before the slot) or you can purchase it from there it self. All slots of 1 hour only.
Snow_World_Mumbai,rakhi77,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 â€¢ Family,A chilling experience,Had been on Nov 2016 with hubby n five year old son enjoyed very much. But it's very  very cold inside  jackets n all doesn't help much. My son enjoyed alot
Snow_World_Mumbai,Aartichand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Family,A cold experience,"Snow world in Pheonix market city, Kurla will give you a feeling of snow. If one has never experienced it it is ok to visit. But the temperatures inside are extremely cold and one should be warmly dressed. For Rs. 500 they rent you a coat and boots. Also the snow is very hard unlike real snow."
Snow_World_Mumbai,thrilladventure,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Friends,Small Snow World,Have visited a better snow world aboard so didnt like this one...You can visit if u want to have the snow world experience but its really very very cold to be there for one complete hour...
Snow_World_Mumbai,GauravChand,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Family,OK but nothing great,This Snow World is located in Phoenix Market City mall in Kurla.  Its is quite a big mall.  Snow World gives people an experience of show and cold weather which many people in Mumbai have not experienced.  It costs Rs 500 an they provide the jackets and snow shoes. Socks are a must.  They also have a photographer to capture your photo which can be purchased.  For those who have experienced real snow this will not be comparable.  This snow/ice is packed much harder and its quite slippery.  OK for children to go down a slide or go to the skating rink.  April/May or October will give you a chill from the hot weather outside.
Snow_World_Mumbai,Gaurav S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Friends,Cool place to visit,Have been to snow world in april.. its an awesome place to visit... the whole set up is awesome and offers a very different experience of what you can never feel in the hot climate of mumbai.. good place to go with family and friends too.
Snow_World_Mumbai,rikhavshah,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 â€¢ Family,Too chilled to complete an hour ,"I visited snow world with my 7 years old son last week. Ticket price is 500 per person. There was waiting for the entry and we were given next time slot after 1 hour. They provide jacket with hood, handgloves, and rubber shoes to wear. Socks are compulsory and can be purchased at 30rs per pair if not worn. Staff was very helpful and agile. Temperature inside was very low and chilling. Snow was hard in consistancy and cannot be throwed as in hill station. Surface was very slippery and lots of people keeps on falling during the play. There are lots of artifacts which are good for taking selfies. My son was not tolerating the chilling temperature so we left the area after around 20 minutes. Although there was resting area with normal temperature if you want to come back. "
Snow_World_Mumbai,sunil79_2u,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2016 â€¢ Family,I was expecting something more...,"When I heard about this place, I was having some sort of expectations about the snow world. But when I was visited this with my family, I was not that much impressed with the experience we had inside.There are only 4 activities and lacks experience attendants. Yes, people who wants to experience the snow, they should visit.Tips: Be careful if you are going with your kids or old parents, it is very slippery inside.  Overall its an average place."
Snow_World_Mumbai,NIR006,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 â€¢ Family,Worth one visit,"Its a good experience. may not be as good as the ones found in the Middle East, but definitely wort a visit. It can get crowded on weekends, but the staff restricts entry to a specific number of people during a particular time slot.Decently maintained, well-organised.Good place to visit during the super-humid summers in Mumbai"
Snow_World_Mumbai,ChanchalKaur,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 â€¢ Family,Decent..,"For people who want to experience some kind of snow, this is a place to try. We went there with family. Kids will like it. Their ""snow"" is kind of OK. if you have seen real snow, you might know the difference. But with a group and kids, its worth the time."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Balpreet Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 â€¢ Family,Gives some feel of Snow,"For people in city away from Snow, this gives a bit of an experience. Kids will like it, and so will adults... The snow though is not like the ""real Snow"". It does get slippery inside.. so be careful."
Snow_World_Mumbai,darshbjain,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 â€¢ Family,Its better than Hyderabad bad ,The place is good. The ice Skating is the best. The coffee and tea outside is great. The slide is also very good you will love it. The mall is also very good. 
Snow_World_Mumbai,thatzamit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Family,Adventurous,"Very nice adventurous place to visit. As the name suggest, one can feel the real mountain snow weather here. Carry the socks as it is chargeable here."
Snow_World_Mumbai,vinitha v,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 â€¢ Family,Different experience,"Its at phoenix mall kurla...the entry price (500 INR per person-kid below 2 is free) includes jacket, shoes n gloves (u got to purchase the socks though)...they have clothes/shoes etc. to suit all ages (i gt one for my 2 year old)...u can store all ur bag/ stroller at their baggage counter..u can purchase ur photo frm them which they capture at the entrance (better than u taking ur own photo)...there is a cafe too (outside the snow-dorm though)once inside, mind the slippery surface and of course the cold..its got an ice rink, sledges, one carved out space (like a cottage), etc....good for the experience"
Snow_World_Mumbai,trinayani,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 â€¢ Family,Snow Escapade :),"As the title suggests... it covers all... excitement, daring, adventure and more. Its a relief outing in hot summers for 45 mins. The ticket includes jackets, gloves and boots though I wonder why did they leave the socks out (socks are charged extra). Once you enter the snow world it feels yeaaa ! Chilled to a bearable cold. They have photographers to catch your memories and save them for you at a steep price of 200 Rs per copy.. Hmm! You are not forced to buy the pics. Mobiles are allowed but the pics wont be tht gud bcoz of low light. Only 2 slides, one for kids and one for adults. Skating rink was gud. Even the igloos, wooden cottage n penguins were cute for photo ops. Def a fun time place with family. Though not so apt for lil kids. Would be a much better experience if they had bigger place with more slides added or lil bit of snowfall."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Raajesh P,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 â€¢ Family,The cold Snow World in Mumbai,"Good attraction venue.The snow world, placed in Pheonix mall at Kurla is a nice place to visit with family and kids.Since had not been to any snowy place was a unique and interesting experience, especially with kids.It is a one hour cold time costing 550 per person. Socks are compulsory to carry, rest of the warm clothing is provided by them within the entry fees. The place is kind of small and not too much activities, but the staff is prompt and a good one time experience."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Parth_Pandya,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 â€¢ Family,snowy for kids,"Its hot summer in Mumbai , so its worth visiting such places with kids and have lot of fun. Overall it is a small place, however it is must and good to have in the city.We are avoiding our visit with kids in this summer as its very much crowded and feel it to be challenging in maintain hygiene."

Snow_World_Mumbai,SumitTurakhia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 â€¢ Family,Absolutely Snowy ... a must visit in Mumbai,"Wow, -10 degrees experience in Mumbai ??? Well outside its absolutely not possible but in Snow World, its possible. Super experience of Snow World, located inside the Phoenix Market City Mall, Kurla. Its a 1 hour slots starting from morning till late evening.   All clothings and boots are been provided by them except the socks, so either buy it from them directly or carry on your own. Inside there are skiing, sledging and slopes for fun. Artificial snowing happens for about 5 mins while enjoying your 1 hour slot. Staff are courteous and helpful. Overall the experience is nice and a unique visit."
Snow_World_Mumbai,TouristLuv,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 â€¢ Family,Nice Experience!,"We visited Mumbai for a trip this February, and planned a trip to Snow World Mumbai. The place is really nice and enjoyable for kids. They have actually maintained the temperature and snow inside. Also some of the ice/snow rides. The way they are maintaining the temperature inside, with such hot weather of Mumbai is really commendable. Overall, we really enjoyed the 1 hour experience in snow world."
Snow_World_Mumbai,meee2016,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 â€¢ Couples,Disapppointing,"it isnt as good as they advertise. the games - snow boarding and sledging are uselss. iceskating rink is too small and they dont have proper gear. gloves were torn, and shoes didnt fit properly. The place is worth only 100 rupees."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Rahul G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 â€¢ Couples,Fun and Expensive,"There will be a lot of people who will end up calling this place a big freezer. And indeed it is a big freezer. The temperature inside is pretty low and by low I mean discomforting. But for people who want to take a feel of snow in a humid place like Mumbai, this might just be the oasis they are looking for. It is no where close to the real deal (natural snow) but they have done a great job in creating and maintaining the place. The entry tickets costs Rs. 500/- per head for one hour. Though being inside it for one full hour is a challenge in itself. Having said that its a must go for people who haven't experienced snow and want to in your very own Mumbai.Pros:The staff is extremely friendly and nice. Its very clean.Cons:The powdery snow is not very thick and there will be quite a few patches where the exposed ice is quite slippery. The souvenir photographs are very costly. At Rs.200/- a piece, its one of the most expensive ones I have ever some across.NB: Carry your own woollen socks. Else you will have to buy a pair for Rs. 30/-. They provide jackets and boots for free but socks are to be bought."

Snow_World_Mumbai,Himanshu S,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 â€¢ Family,Not for very small kids,"while the concept maybe fine, its very expensive and not for kids under eight years I would say. Also could be slippery and very cold. "
Snow_World_Mumbai,Anand R,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015,Stay cool,"Artificial ice in mumbai , probably the only one around. Its a small place and there is a slide and some other rides. They can do good if the slide is from a higher elevation as in other indoor snow parks around the world . 1 hour is more than enough for freezing there, we were a bunch of friends with kids and they had a nice time, though we rushed out in abt 40 mins i think. Price is reasonable though would want to see more games and a bigger area for playing"
Snow_World_Mumbai,jimit63,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 â€¢ Friends,nicely maintained,a different experience for mumbaikars. though the charge are a bit on higher side but the experience is good.
Snow_World_Mumbai,Sheetal9,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015,Ok not great,"Snowworld is a nice place but not as good as expected. The images shown on the website and description given makes one feel the place is huge and has a lot of games etc. But unfortunately that isnt the case. The place is small, and there are 5-6 games of which some arent working. Also all of them arent for kids so if you going with kids be prepared coz they cant go sking or skating coz they small. The good part ofcourse is that they have a slide for the small kids, and its really cold so you do feel like you are in a snow world. I must also mention that the staff is extremely courteous and helpful. "
Snow_World_Mumbai,kunal k,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 â€¢ Couples,"""So Cold & well maintain""","Amazing place and had too much fun. well maintain. we went in summer and feel so cold in side. They provide jacket, shoes & gloves. their staff are very coperative."
Snow_World_Mumbai,RMARU,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015,Overall a good experience. Take your own woolen socks/gloves with you,We went on Monday so there were very few people. My 4.5 years old kids enjoyed it. The staff was good. It's really cold inside so it's better to take your own woolen socks and gloves along with you so you can withstand the cold. [They provide jackets and gloves]. We came out within 30 minutes as it was very cold for my kids. 
Snow_World_Mumbai,Sulochana S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2015 â€¢ Family,Snow and the experience,"1. Suggested place for kids, specially if there is a limitation to travel and see places of snow falls.2. Chilled, beautiful, Romantic my derivation about this place. But for me 1/2 hr was also fine coz i don't like much chilled weather.3. Its not too big or there are not too many things to ride in so its fine for a short visit.4. Ticket costs are high but its understood as to manage that atmosphere it will surely need money. Still if they can think of discounting it for weekdays. 5. Professional photographers are available but the cost of clicks is high, hope they can come down in near future."
Snow_World_Mumbai,rachana l,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2015 â€¢ Family,Kashmir at mumbai,Snow world is very well maintained.  Service by staff is really very good . They r very corporative. Good place o enjoy with family n friends specially in summers. 
Snow_World_Mumbai,Nasser Khan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 â€¢ Family,Best and Bestest.,"No words to say as it was beautiful for all age people, my 3 children was not willing to come out when they went for the first time even our 1 hour time was over. though we had a nice time in Kashmir with ices this year only, but still artificial ice was great. The entry fee of Rs. 500 is worth and I highly recommend to every body to go once."
Snow_World_Mumbai,atsona,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2015 â€¢ Family,GOOD FOR a child in u....,Find Snow in Mumbai.....One hour duration is enough for the fun...has less rides but its ok.....They storm the room in between the visit....Mind u it is ultracool..so be careful not keeping urself out of gloves...it is also slippery as hell...i fell twice..so dont do too much jumping or else u might end up injuring urself or others....

I enjoyed a lot. (N u may also) ....."
Snow_World_Mumbai,Sushil262,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 â€¢ Family,Nice place for people who have never seen snow,"A one time visit place for those who have never seen snow. It costs Rs.500 per person which includes gloves, jacket and boots. Wear your own socks as I think they charge for it. Also don't forget to get an extra pair of socks as the one you are wearing might get wet. The place is not very big in terms of space and there are not many activities too inside, but as I said before, it is a good place to experience sub- zero temperatures and artificial snow especially in the Mumbai heat. The artificial snow fall starts after some time and is pretty ordinary(done via a nozzle). The staff is very polite and cooperative. They also take pictures and display them on screen while you exit. You have a choice to pay and take a copy for your memories. Overall nice place to visit with young children or people who have not seen snow."
Snow_World_Mumbai,NVR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 â€¢ Family,Snow In My Neighbourhood,"The place is located at the lower ground level in Phoenix Market City. Online booking provides you with a reservation (through sms) and not a confirmed booking. No online payment (or option) to confirm the booking available as such. In case of reservation, you need to reach one hour prior to your slot timings to make payments and confirm your booking. Opt for this option only on weekends or holidays. On weekdays, booking slots are readily available. Any which ways, reach the access point 15 minutes before, as you tend to lose valuable time collecting the protective gear and putting it on. Protective gear includes jackets with hoods, gloves and boots, it does not include socks. You either need to carry them or need to buy it from the counter (not sure but Rs.30 a pair). For males, if wearing your own socks do bring an alternate pair as they are bound to get wet. Please note that you can only pleasure your stay not more than 45 minutes and not 60 minutes as mentioned by them. As in the last 15 minutes, the staff will ask you, politely, to move towards the exit so you can return the protective gear, to get it ready for the next patrons. If you have entered late then your stay is even less than 45 minutes. You have a baggage counter at the entrance.As far as place is concerned, an amazing place to be in. We have been to places of extreme cold climate but this place is worth experiencing, at least once. If you go with not much of expectations, you will enjoy it. The temperatures are sub zero, as claimed to be, i.e., -10Â°C.  Enjoy the chilling temperatures and your photo op. There are sledges, slides, skiing equipment, etc., available but still nothing much of an activity to do. You need pull the sledge all by yourself (as no reindeer is available, lol). The snow fall, sort of, starts at 15 minutes after the slot timings. For Mumbaikars, it is an opportunity not to be missed. Read in some previous reviews where comparisons were made to the one in Hyderabad. I would rather say that when it is locally available why would someone go to Hyderabad just to experience 'Snow World', they would rather book a trip to Kashmir, Himachal or Uttarakhand to experience the real one. So, feel happy that there is a place like this in your city too. As far as the cost of Rs.500/- per person is concerned, which seems to be on a higher side, it's your call whether you find it worth it or not.There are definitely a few drawbacks of this place. The snow is not evenly or I would rather say it is scarcely placed. Should have been a bit deeper as you can see the kota flooring at few places which is annoying. The ice skating arena is bit on a smaller side. The slope is not at all ideal for skiing. Activities not up to the mark as compared to what they have mentioned on their website or advertisements. Time slots are too small to enjoy, need to increase them. Igloos on display can't be called the same, seems more of a den than igloo.Note:- Do watch out your footing. Walk slowly & carefully as at some places the snow is slippery, as it is to be. You might end up hurting yourself. I fell thrice and hurt my palm but still enjoyed the place. Please take care of your valuables, mobiles while returning your jackets as sometimes you unknowingly place your stuff in the jackets. When the temperatures become unbearable for you, you can take a break in a room near the exit and rejoin back.Do visit this place with kids or friends, at least once, you will have a blast of a time. No matter what people say, it is worth trying. For Mumbaikars, feel happy there is such a place (besides the one in Esselworld), in your city, where you can enjoy snow as and when you wish."
Snow_World_Mumbai,HARI_RAMADAS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 â€¢ Family,Nice to see & play on Ice,"Good place for one visit, particularly to those who haven't seen or walked on ice/ snow fall. Activities listed in their site/ brochure are to excite customers. Snow guides inside the area seems to be less in number. Should be careful about the snow boards and things like that on the slippery floor."
Snow_World_Mumbai,paresh_shruti,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 â€¢ Friends,Snowilicious...................,"Very nice themed world full of  snow.. though not as the real freshh ones but brilliantly maintained temperature inside its very freezing but in mumbai where outside temperature is usually maximum thi sis best for a shortt chilling outing, Entry fee is 500 which includes your jackets gloves & gum boots and all the activities inside . Though not feel as the real snow i have visited but very good for mumbaikars and must try atleast once."
Snow_World_Mumbai,ThisIsBadax,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2014 â€¢ Family,Brrr... Nice! But one time only.,"Really nice and cold! They have sleds, a really fun ice slide, igloos and much more. Only thing is, they really need to make their ""snowfall"" better. Right now it just seems like a cold soggy mist. Other than that, the whole experience is worth it. For one time though."
