Sri_Sri_Radha_Gopinath_Temple,Sandy S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,A window into the Hare Krishnas,"The façade was a lacy buff confection of scalloped arches and floral bas relief. The interior was even sweeter. At one end of the main hall a flower-festooned diorama in vivid pastels featured Krishna and his consort gazing in saccharine benevolence at worshipers prostrating themselves on the inlaid marble floor.  We learned that the diorama changed daily. Draped in a saffron sheet, a tonsured young man from Oregon described his daily life as a monk."

However, the whole scheme of affairs is such that one can question the merit of such huge investment for a worship place, given the state of desolate affairs of the subjects in the country of its existence. An example is the money spent on the gold used in the decor within the temple precincts, could easily have been used to feed hundreds of hungry stomachs. After all, haven't we been taught that service to the poor is service to the almighty."

Hi Govind P

Thanks for your concern and observations.
We believe that spirituality is a deeper science. 
Our rituals and worship help us to realize something higher and connect to the divine spiritual.
Temple is a place of God where everyone is allowed to come 'closer' to him.

Worshiping the Supreme God is like watering the root of the tree.When a tree is watered at the root, the water reaches to all branches, leaves, fruits and flowers.
Similarly, all living entities, the environment is part of the Supreme Lord.

When Supreme God is worshiped in proper consciousness, that service attitude extends toward His creation.We also have many social causes associated with our temple.

One of that is Mid-Day Meals program where almost 1.2 million underprivileged children are given one meal at their school everyday, in India.
Everyone is welcome to become part of our projects.

I hope this is all right with you."
