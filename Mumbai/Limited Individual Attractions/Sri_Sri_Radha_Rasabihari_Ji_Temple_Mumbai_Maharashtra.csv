Sri_Sri_Radha_Rasabihari_Ji_Temple,Avinash,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,A temple near Juhu beach,This temple is located near Juhu beach. We visited this place on Saturday morning. One plus point is availability of parking space within the premises - something that is very important here considering small lanes in this area. The temple is different from other temples in the sense that it focuses on Krishna consciousness and has a number of sketches on events in Krishna's life. There is a counter where a lot of books are available. It also has a good restaurant 'Govinda' where one can have food.

Inside is a large and unique temple - the shines, lighting, and flowers are unlike anything I'd seen before...combined with the chanting it was a cool place to see and experience."
Sri_Sri_Radha_Rasabihari_Ji_Temple,prannnn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Nice Temple,"The temple is spread over a vast area and like other temples, this one is also dedicated to lord Krishna and very crowded as well. One of the prime reason is its close proximity to juhu beach. Many of the visitors tend to visit the temple before going for a stroll in the beach which is just walking distance away. As far as parking is concerned, the temple has space for that but the roads leading to the temple is very narrow and very congested. The temple opens during morning and evening (around 4:30 pm) and is very peaceful compared to outside city life. In case want to get peace of mind, then this would be a good choice. inside the temple, they even have snack counters as well and one restaurant (Govinda) and all of them server only vegetation foods. The best time to visit the temple would be during janmashtami wherein they conduct a lot of pujas and the place would be decorated very beautifully."
