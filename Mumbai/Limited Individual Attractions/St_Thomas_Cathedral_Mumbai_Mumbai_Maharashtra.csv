St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,MWandAW,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,A place of reverence and peace,"My wife an I visited St Thomas Anglican Cathedral (Built in 1718), as part of a city guided tour. We were shown the important features of the church, rather than just allowing us to look around, take photos and leave. The visit by the King George V and Queen Mary of England to the Cathedral on 3 November 1911 was an important event in its history, but surely the visit by a living Saint is just as important. Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu of India (Saint Teresa of Calcutta) also visited for a service on 8 January 1993 and there is a brass plate where she sat. The pews inside the Cathedral are a really beautiful place of tranquility on weekdays, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The other claim to fame is the Cathedral marks colonial Bombay's point zero, the exact centre of the city. A visit to this city's Anglican Cathedral to see these items, is certainly recommended."

St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,macedonboy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Nice looking church filled with bas-relied memorial,"St. Thomas Cathedral is an Anglican Church built in British Empire era, first ever Anglican Church to be built in Mumbai and dedicated to the first apostle of India. The building is a mix of Neo-Classical and Gothic Revival styles. The latter only obvious from the high altar both in the interior and exterior by walking around to the back of the church, as it looks like there was some restoration worked with a different design from the nave up tot he high altar. The exterior is predominantly white with bands of yellow. Inside the church is well maintained and very Protestant, that is, there's not that much in the way of decorations. However,  there are many bas relief sculptures of memorials and a few stained glass windows behind the high altar worth a look.The church is located in the historic area of Mumbai and there's many landmark buildings around the stars, so it's worth a detour."

St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,Ethelberga H,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Stunning Building,We went to a communion service at St Thomas's cathedral as we knew it would be in English. This Anglican cathedral was the first built in Bombay -now Mumbai- in 1718 and was in the English settlement area. It is on Horniman Circle and is easily found. The interior is mostly painted white with many memorials on the walls. The choir were impressive when they came in and walked down the long nave before sitting down. we were surprised that no-one spoke to us at all either before or after the service.

Many interesting memorial tablets and carvings to mostly British military or notable families of the day over the last few centuries.

St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,prannnn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Solo,Nice Church,"This is one of the oldest cathedrals that you would witness within the by lanes of south Mumbai. This church is located slightly inside and away from the main road but the best part is, its accessible via private transportation or one can even get here by walking from the nearest station (CST) or via taxi. But i would not suggest coming via own vehicle as parking would be a problem and the streets in this area are very narrow and extremely crowded. Although the building is quite old but during my visit they were undertaking some renovation/ restoration work which should have been completed by now. The view of the main entrance from the street right in front of this monuments is very beautiful and very much resembles the old architecture style of  building. The church is open during all days from 7 am to 6 pm and one does not need to pay any entry fees. The place is very beautiful from the inside and one can get peace of mind in the main hall. So, in case you happen to be in this part of the city, then i would recommend this place to be a must visit for everyone."

St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,Matthew C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 • Solo,Very moving,"The Protestant cathedral appears, judging by the memorials inside, to have been funded by the East India Company, and those commemorated seem to have been exclusively British. This regularly used cathedral church lacks a memorialized connection with the congregation it serves.  That aside, this beautifully built and preserved landmark is a powerful reminder of Bombay's past, and features some most beautifully worded 18th century inscriptions. It's definitely worth more than the 15 minutes I had available. I very much hope to return and see the cathedral in next time. "

St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,Ian D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Excellent Sunday Service,"As an Episcopalian, part of the worldwide Anglican Communion, it was nice to attend the Sunday Eucharist at St Thomas'. As is important to Anglicans, it was a common worship experience done in an indigenous manner. The vast majority of the congregation, choir and the priest were Indian. And to our surprise, my driver and the priest went to church together as children. It was a lovely reunion!"

St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,jaimit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Family,Gem of Mumbai History,"This place is hidden from everyone and I wonder why it's not firmly on the tourist map of India. There so much to learn about Mumbai history from all the brilliant  epitaphs that are on the walls of the church. I have been here on multiple locations and everytime I notice something new.Before u enter the church spare a minute for the fountain and read the inscription on it. Then enter the church and turn to your right. Amongst the first well sculpted one is of a governor of Mumbai on which you will see the Brahmin and the Titan of justice together. Walk around the walls and observe that so many Britishers died so young of war and of disease in India.Those before 1857 died in service of the company and later they died in service of the crown.In many of them, try this little test on yourself... See the sculpture and try and guess the professions of the people who are immortalized here. Doctors, governors, justice, generals and seamen.It's a tiny glimpse of the British Raj, their wars, conquests, victories and deaths; all in one lovely church. And yes... The stained glass is also extremely lovely."

Still a thriving church, now of the Church of North India, this cool, classical interior gives an illuminating history of the period of the British era, from the East India Company through to the more direct involvement of the British Government.

Sadness will envelop you as you read the ages of those who dies, under what circumstances and in many cases just the language that was used 100 - 200 years ago is education enough. It is not difficult to find and everybody in Mumbai will happily provide instructions to get their. Not entrance fee."

A few minutes on entering this place I am at peace with myself.  I love it there.  In the morning at times I have heard the choir practicing.
St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,RAMESH K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Solo,An oasis of absolute peace,St. Thomas Cathedral in Fort area of Mumbai is part of British history and is a beautiful heritage building. It was built as a church in 1718. Not many know that Churchgate station was named after this church bcoz the road from the station led to this church. It was converted into a Cathedral in 1837. In the bustling commercial district of Fort area it is an oasis of absolute peace. It is built in the gothic & classic style of architecture. The interiors of the cathedral are awesome. There is ample use of painted stained glasses. There r beautiful carved figures & sculptures in marble. This Cathedral was recipient of UNESCO award for heritage buildings. I spent nearly half an hour inside the cathedral today in absolute peace admiring the architectural wonder and being in communion with the Almighty. On your next visit to Fort area please do not forget to visit this place !!

St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,Mark D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015,A peaceful haven,"This cathedral was an amazing place to find in Mumbai, compared to many of the other buildings, this one is very plain inside, however this does give it a certain air of calmness and tranquility, especially with all the hussle and bussel outside. One feature of the interior is the number of fans to keep the congregation cool during the services. "

St_Thomas_Cathedral_Mumbai,CanisHan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Solo,Good Cathedral,"C1 ( 2014.12.10 ) This cathedral's structure was not harmonious with another building, I think, because this structure was Europe style. The cathedral was very calm and good. The atmosphere was reverant. This cathedral was not far from main attraction, so just 10 minutes walking, could go there."

The church is well maintained and they had a lot of parishioners inside. I usually look to see if they have a gift shop so I could send some items to my mother who is a devout Catholic, but I did not see one."
