With boating and 'tanga' rides (they even have AC tangas). Some eateries around the lake.We had visited during chaitra nawratri when they had decorated the entire lake by lightings and stuff. We went on paddle boating in the middle of lake and just relaxed there enjoying sunset and cool evening breeze. The noise from roads are subdued in the middle so you can enjoy a calm quietness.
