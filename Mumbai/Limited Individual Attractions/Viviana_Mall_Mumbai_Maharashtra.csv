Viviana_Mall,Alok Sahoo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 • Family,Very good mall with almost all shopping options ,"It's location is good. Bang on the eastern express way near Cadbury junction. You can spend whole day exploring various shopping options. Cinepolis is there on the second floor and all food options especially fast food is available in food section. Shoppers stop, hypercity, pentaloon and few of the anchor shops. Parking is ample. One more lesser known fact is you can get compost free of cost from there which is prepared from the waste generated over there!!! "

Viviana_Mall,Nishant Dangle,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,Poor service and delays,Visited with Family incl kids at Copper Chimney at Viviana Mall. I was disappointed to see delays in service and had to remind to Manager twice. To add the Mutton Boti Kabab was undone and had to be sent back. The food is non spicy and may not suit everyone's palate in my view. Overall average experience.
