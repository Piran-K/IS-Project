Wankhede_Stadium,Anwer Dhanji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,The best stadium in Mumbai for action and ambiance,This cricket stadium is the Indian version of THE THEATRE OF DREAMS.  Watched a cricket match. It is huge and the noise will make you get into action yourself even if you are an introvert especially if you are watching the IPL game. Can get very hot and humid
Wankhede_Stadium,TanD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Promises an incredible experience for cricket lovers!,"Overall experience: 5/5If you are in Mumbai and has the opportunity to watch a cricket match at Wankhede stadium, please do. It is sure to be an incredible memory! Things to know about the Wankhede stadium: Accessibility: 5/5 One of the most significant aspects of Wankhede stadium is its accessibility. You can reach the stadium via public transportation modes like local trains and cabs. Gate no.4, the entry for the Sachin Tendulkar Stand, is located just outside the Marine Lines local train station, making it the most convenient. Stands: 5/5Almost one-third of the seats are in the Sachin Tendulkar stand. This is one of the most exciting places to be if you want to experience the energy and enthusiasm of the cricket fans fully. As I have been here, I can vouch for the quality of the experience here. Also, most parts of this stand has a roof on top. This makes the heat tolerable during the summers in Mumbai for daytime matches.Avoid the Divecha stand and some front rows of the Vengsarkar stand if you are going for a daytime match as you would be in direct sunlight, and it can be an uncomfortable experience for you. Seats: 3/5The seats are just fine in comfort and are well-maintained and tidy. The only con is that it might get uncomfortable for you and the people sitting next to you if you are a chubby person as the seats are close together.The spacing between two rows is quite a lot, which means that even if a six-foot person in the next row stands up, your view will not be blocked. Visibility: 5/5No matter where you book your tickets, you can clearly see the players, the bat, and the ball. This is worth mentioning because I thought the experience might not be great if you purchase a low-cost ticket and sit in L3 or at the end seats. The videos and photographs online do not do justice to the actual experience. Pricing: 4/5The ticket pricing varies based on the demand, placement of the seats, and other facilities. It is up to you how much you want to spend. On weekdays, you will come across tickets starting at Rs.800 for IPL matches. Weekends will always be slightly more expensive than weekdays and would start around Rs.1200.Food and drinks: 4/5Any outside food and drinks are an absolute no-no at the stadium. You get free water in the stadium in small paper cups. You can carry them onto the seating area. But the chances of you spilling that and making a mess are pretty high. The food and drinks sold at the match area are reasonably priced. You get around 200ml cool drink for Rs.50, cold coffee for Rs.100, popcorn for Rs.100, etc. While they cannot be called ""affordable"", they are way cheaper than what you find in cinemas and other entertainment facilities in Mumbai. They are also decent quality. Washroom Cleanliness: 2/5The washrooms were neat and clean before the commencement of the match. But it gets dirty over a period as hundreds of people use it. There is no one to clean and it and can be a terrible situation for you if you are in the stadium for a long-form cricket match."

Many of the reception staff were the same and gave us a friendly return welcome. The rooms are still well maintained and food ever so tasty and superb value. The Club has a good caf√© which offers a range of delicacies and three different restaurants on site, all of good value and offering a range of dishes that you never really feel you need to venture out of the club to eat. There is an outdoor pool available for residents and guests of the club.  The club has a good hair salon on the 3rd floor that offers a range of services, which was good to use.  The club remains a favourite of ours and is excellently located just off Marine Drive. My only disappointment was that the WIFI remains weak and after a few minutes connection is lost and you have to log in again.  If we return again time hopefully this would have improved.   Please note you can only stay at this club if you are a club member or a guest of a member.  It is not 5 star luxury but for the price, comfort, location and service, it is a pleasure to stay at.  We look forward to returning in the future!"

Have attended many matches here but the stadium is not worth the experience. During IPL matches, the stadium is over crowded and the seats are way too uncomfortable. Also, the distance between seats is extremely less making it uncomfortable to survive 4-6 hours. Also, there is no ventilation and gets even more warmer when there is excess crowd. Its better to watch the match at your home."

We watched a Mumbai Indians IPL match here and despite the zero tolerance towards alcohol, the locals did not stop cheering and chanting and creating a great buzz around the ground. Food vendors walk the terraces offering everything from Indian snacks to Subway sandwiches and Domino's pizzas so you don't need to miss a minute of the action. The infrastructure itself is impressive and there are merchandise stalls at regular intervals once inside the ground. The only thing to be wary of within the stadium is the state of the toilets, hold it in if you can.. Definitely worth a trip to watch some cricket for friends and family alike."

Wankhede_Stadium,Jon b,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Would not let us in to look around,"What a joke.  We just wanted to have a walk around the stadium and soak up some of Indias cricket history, but we were not allowed in. We were quite prepared to pay - and who knows, if there was a shop, we would probably have bought something. Why do you not let people in for stadium tours - cant believe you are not capitalising on an opportunity to make money. Massive 0/5. "

Wankhede_Stadium,Pinkesh J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,For cricket lovers in Mumbai,"Place where Mumbai IPL matches are hosted, and most of the international cricket matches in Mumbai are hosted. Stadium is good, however not ventilated so you will feel the heat. Also the security is very strict so you can't carry any eatables or water inside, which you will need to buy inside, which is very inconvinient specially because the stadium is always crowded on match days. Better to plan to reach 2 hrs before start of play, as it takes that much time to queue and clear the security. Avoid taking car as you will not find parking space around the ground easily."
Wankhede_Stadium,Hanif C,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Cricket lovers,"Biggest stadium in mumbai and located in heart of city, parking is problem but can avoid it by taking a cab to reach there instead of taking your own car"

Wankhede_Stadium,RahulJain1987,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,An Iconic Place !!,"Visited Wankhede Stadium multiple times, the most cherished one being the last match of Sachin Tendulkar. The North stand is where I prefer watching the match from though the Grand Stand is even better (and more expensive). However, at times the stadium is shut for public and you may not be able to visit unless there is a match going on."
