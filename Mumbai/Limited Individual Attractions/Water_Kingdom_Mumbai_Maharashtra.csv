Water_Kingdom,Chandrashekhar shelar,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Worse experience,Bogus service they took 1650 rs and no dress no food no locker 70 % rides closed worse experience very bad no one should go there
Water_Kingdom,Santosh Mhadgut,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,The flaws of locker system at water kingdom,The slides are amazing but the lockers are very small and no proper information is provided about the size and the charges are too high of the locker and also there is no proper changing room in the mens locker room.
Water_Kingdom,Kshitij D,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022 ‚Ä¢ Business,Worst experience ,"We have travelled with company booking of total 15 people. 14 tickets had a booking ID & 1 ticket was booked on the same day( order ID was generated). However, staff of Water Kingdom claim that until booking ID mail is not received they won't allow him. My question is it customer problem that your systems are slow/ not able to trace payments/ don't have correct systems to take spontaneous bookings ??? We have been waiting for last couple of hours just for the entry of one person. Terrible management and worst experience ever. Never coming back nor recommending to anyone. "
Water_Kingdom,Keith,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family,Great first time experience...but lot of scope for improvement,"The rides were exciting. We enjoyed Adventure Amazonia the most. Since it was my kids first time, she was thoroughly entertained. Wave pool was also amazing....very crowded though.Note: those of you going first time....they say you have to leave all your belongings in the locker but here's what you can also do.....buy a mobile pouch at the venue which is almost waterproof if you want to carry mobile/cash with you advice don't carry very expensive mobiles...bring hats/caps if you like to protect from üåû.....Few things about the area that could be improved......The gents urinals stink..they should clean regularly and apply freshners...Many of the showers not workingThere were these annoying fruit flies that bite...I got bitten 4 times....some pest control should be implemented....The ride surfaces/water not very clean....Over experience was good but I have given 3 star due to above shortcomings"

Water_Kingdom,ADITYA,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,One of the few weekend hangout spots in Mumbai,One of the few weekend hangout spots in Mumbai. It's located on an island off the shore of malad and borivali. It's a water park with a sister amusement park called Essel World.

Water_Kingdom,Cedric N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Asia's largest theme waterpark,"Had been to this famous waterpark in Gorai a long back ago. This waterpark is located close to Essel World. This waterpark attracts a number of tourists. It is one of the most visited places in Mumbai. This waterpark offers over 30 attractions. It has the World's largest wave pool with blue cool waters. Its main attraction is the Lagoon which is India's largest water play park. Besides that, it has What-A-Coaster, Adventure Amazonia, Misphisly Hill, Black Demon, Lazy River etc. It also has food courts as well. Wear Nylon or Lycra swimwear. However, it gets crowded during the weekends. Had enjoyed the waterslides, wading through the wave pool and relaxing in the float on the Lazy River as a school going child.This waterpark is an ideal place for families, couples as well as friends."
Water_Kingdom,manoj,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,goood,t's one of the best water park in the city and around the city.Always go in groups. It's super fun.The water slides and rides are excellent.It's good for big and small both.They had good schemes too.

Water_Kingdom,Sunil Yadav,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019,Great Family Time (Naive),"Best Season to Visit WaterKingdom is in Rainy.I have visited this Place Twice, but I really Like Imagica More then WaterKingdom or Essel World"
Water_Kingdom,alpha08,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Adventure with full of Rides,"A fun place to visit with your friends , a place having multiple water rides and lots of water activities. "
Water_Kingdom,ashwin k,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Time for something new,Same old rides are getting monotonous. Rain dance could be better. Most of the shower were not working. Locker price are increased unnecessarily.
Water_Kingdom,mas00786,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Unexpected fun with great food options!!,"We visited the place on a Saturday, and that too on a public holiday. To get there we needed to reach the jetty at Borivali and take a boat ride(paid for separately). This boats can be modernized, but they manage to take you across the small creek to the island which is home to Water Kingdom and Essel world.We were pleasantly surprised that there were no crowds, and the place was relatively empty for a public holiday. The reason being it was a festival and many people were enjoying the same at home!.Once you buy the tickets, you are taken by a small train bus to the gates. Here you can hire the locker, access the changing rooms and take showers.Once you enter the water park, the joy of being in a water park takes over. The place has some very good rides, and many fantastic rides and a fabulous ""Wetlantic"" a large pool which also has waves at regular intervals. The park is divided into sections based on age and the children and adults can enjoy the day.The rides one must not miss are "" What a Coaster"", Black demon and the ""Bucket"" which empties once filled in the children's section, lazy river......There are many good food options in the park with the food being freshly prepared and served. There is also Fish Pedicure section (to be paid for additionally if required)Overall the park is a must visit and a great time to spend a day with family and friends. As we have visited Yas Waterpark in Abu Dhabi many times, I will say this park is on par with Yas Waterpark if not better. But always there is room for improvements and still can be worked on to be the Number One!!!"
Water_Kingdom,Mysuccessrulezz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Must visit,Had an amazing time at Water kingdom. Enjoyed the rides. A nice place to have a good time with family and friends.
Water_Kingdom,Piyush A,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good place to unwind yourself,"A boat ride takes you to this place and you don''t regret it being here the whole day. The water rides are good and so are the eating joints except for Dominos which is expensive here. The locker rent here is also expensive and the Men Shower and Changing Area is too ill-planned and too open. Proper attendants are posted all over the place to help or guide the guests. Drinking Water dispensers, toilets and First Aid room are well located."
Water_Kingdom,Fayaz Ahmed Sheikh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Best water park in Mumbai,It is one of the best water park in Mumbai. You can access it through Borivali or Marve beach by boat or by road through Bhayander. It is worth for the money.   
Water_Kingdom,Kim C,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Not Really for Westerners,"Unfortunately this was not a place that I would recommend.  It is situated in terrible location which is miles away from anywhere.  You have to catch a Ferry across which was very unreliable - depended on rain and tides.  We waited for two hours to get back across.  Very hard to communicate as we could not find a staff member that spoke decent English.  Rides are shabby and look like the need fixing,  water was absolutely filthy and Im talking brown!!!  Wave pool was slimy underfoot and very crowded.  So over all not a destination that I would recommend and is nothing like the water park in Bali called Water Bomb."
Water_Kingdom,dinesh kuntal,3.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Business,nice,this is so good place I love this place so much I want to come back again and again to visit this place this is so beautiful and nice place and also age staff is so beautiful

Water_Kingdom,Sheetal S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,good place to go with friends/family to beat the heat,My family and I went there on a Saturday. We got great deals on Little app which saved money. No food is allowed inside however there are multiple shops inside like Dominos and Thali shops which are much cheaper compared and better to ones they try and sell.Lockers are quite big so we bought only 1 and kept everything there.We got our own swimsuits. One can do only water kingdom or essel world in one day as both take time. Rides are awesome and totally safe! Washrooms and changing room are avialable so get shampoo etc to use before changing while return.

Water_Kingdom,MarcinJanD,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good fun,"We had a couple of days to spend in Mumbai with our 8 years old daughter, and to keep her entertained, we decided to go to this waterpark. I misread the map so it turned out to be a bit further away from our location than I thought (we stayed at a hotel close to the International Airport), but 1.5h spent on getting to the place was worth it. There was a decent amount of attractions to enjoy and we had a good fun. We weren't so sure about the food standards in the park, so decided to not eat in there, but there was a choice of restaurants in the park and a lot of people happily enjoyed their meals."
Water_Kingdom,Pinklilly,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Awesome,I have gone there a few times and its always the best experience going there. Not only it's affordable but also has a variety of slides and food stalls at a cheap price. The workers are too are very helpful there.

Super huge adjoining to theme park Essel World and now also adjoining to Bird park and Pagoda (Vipasana). Rides are amazing. My favorite is Amazone river ride. Just sit in ring and let the flow take you. Wave pool is also super huge with 3 pools. Best water park for Mumbaikar considering its connectivity to the city. Just take a ferry from Gorai or marve. Or you can go by road from MiraBhayandar. Soon you can go by road from marve (Marve - Manori bridge is under construction)

Water_Kingdom,vaibhavaero,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Business,Best for a reason,"I went here on a weekday with my office colleagues.This certainly is the best among the water parks I have been to. Clean water, decent crowd and nice ambiance.  But few things to take care (which made me give 1 less star).(1) Be very careful of the material you wear. I didnt exactly wear cotton as I knew most water parks do not allow cotton. But I was not allowed to take the slides. I had a bit of argument but that is ok. I do not consider it to be their fault. The material was not cotton but again, the topic was debatable. But what surprised me was that I was not allowed to take slides which use the big rubber tubes. It was annoying. When I asked about the reason, they could not explain. Obviously, it was a propaganda so that they could sell some stuff from their shops inside the park. I had to buy a synthetic pant to be able to take the slides.(b) We had pre-booked the food. The food was decent. But you could obviously get better stuff at the same price inside the park. I would suggest not to pre-book.Another suggestion would be to avoid going on weekends for 2 reasons (1) There is a lot of rush in the ferry and the park on weekends leading to a lot of wastage of time in waiting in queues for ferries and rides. (2) There are amazing offers on the weekdays, especially on tuesdays and fridays. You can visit a world class water park at less than the cost of visiting a local water park. In general, all the rides are amazing. Lot of options for food is available. You can even enjoy a drink or two as there is a bar available inside the water park."

My advice is avoid going on Friday, you won't be able to enjoy lots of ride because of the crowd.Cost: normally 1050‚ÇπTuesday:682‚ÇπFriday:525‚Çπ.Advisable: Book for Tuesday from cleartrip and apply promocode ""GOLOCAL"" which gives 10% off. I don't know whether the promocode will be valid when you use it.Total cost per person:Ticket cost+ 50‚Çπ for ferry + Lunch cost 200‚Çπ+Locker 150‚Çπ.They have two lockers mechanical and electronic. In mechanical lock you have to pay 300‚Çπ. they return 150‚Çπ when you give back the keys. In electronic there is no deposit fee. Just pay 150‚Çπ.Lockers can accommodate 1 back-bag and other small things like slippers and mobiles. water kingdom officially closes at 7pm.Advisable:Pack your things around 6pm. To avoid heavy crowd for ferry.If you reached gorai and now you are hungry. Go to humpty dumpty restaurant. It is a Indian, Chinese cuisine restaurant both veg and non-veg is available. Pocket friendly restaurant with good quantity and quality.Per person maybe 200‚Çπ will cost you. You will go with happy memories and happy tummy."

Water_Kingdom,loreta728,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Be careful of the crowd,Water Kingdom has always been a go-to picnic spots for most of the Mumbaikars. There are many water rides and pools here. Just be careful about the crowd. The safeguards are in place to save any one who are in need of help. 
Water_Kingdom,vidhi ketan shah,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Aqua lovers will love this place.,This place has got no ammusement park its based on aquatic rides and aqual lovers will surely have fun here and enjoy.
Water_Kingdom,RR0106,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Wheelchair access + Sun Protection,"If you ever want to visit and have someone on a wheelchair with you, not to worry. They provide you with a wheelchair too! Since we had our own car, we were able to get down right at the entrance. I only had to go back, park our vehicle and come back in the bus. The shower area before you enter the park needs some access features as there are small steps here and there which cannot be avoided. But the entire park is absolutely wheelchair friendly. We able able to move around many places with a wheelchair except some of the really big rides. What we really needed was a separate toilet which was big and access friendly like those found in malls.  But the medical staff accommodated us and gave us their room for changing into fresh clothes. Water Kingdom is a fantastic place and is great fun! Another important piece of advice: Wear fully covered swimsuit/costumes/clothes as you get tanned really bad. You get tshirts and clothes options in some of the shops there in case you forget to carry something."

Water_Kingdom,ali08101988,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good,Its the best water park in mumbai. U need to take ferry ride for reaching there and that is another good thing to enjoy. I think rates are little higher and secondly food inside the park is too costly so one shld plan accordingly while going there rest ride n everything is superb

Water_Kingdom,vinayak p,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family,Awesome Water kingdom,"I have visited many a times to Water kingdom. its a best place to visit and also budgeted for students. I will try to cover each and every pointstarting with how to reach. nearest station is borivali and bhayander, from bhayander there is a direct bus and from borivali you have to take a rikchaw and they charge Rs.50 per person and after that you have to take a boat that is of water kingdom only and they charge Rs.50Before entering into park have a good heavy breakfast so you can long last with it. inside park foods are costly, for lunch you can have a meal, there are many restaurants and the lowest price for meal is Rs.160 approx. try to take less things because that will increase the locker cost.    I will suggest you to go in weekdays if possible for you because in weekdays the park are less crowded so you can enjoy each and every ride again and again. try to go in Amazonia that is the best ride water kingdom. nylon dress is compulsory"

This is one of the better things to do in Mumbai on a hot day.
