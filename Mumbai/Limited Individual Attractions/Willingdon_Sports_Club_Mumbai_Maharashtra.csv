Willingdon_Sports_Club,Sarosh K,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022 • Friends,"Unhurried elegance, old world Colonial charm, and gracious living.","As a member since childhood, my memories of people, events and activities at the club cover the gamut of experiences and emotions. I learned how to swim, play tennis, badminton, golf (not very enthusiastically or well, at the behest of my golf-mad father), steal a kiss, and flirt with my pubescent playmates at the Willingdon, or as its known to its denizens, simply “The Club”.Its not that there are no other clubs in Bombay, but it’s the only one which does not require a qualifying proper noun to identify it. Going to the Club was a perfectly well understood and acceptable teenage activity as far as parents were concerned, and they probably thought it was solely for the sports and athletics. But it also served as cover for romantic adolescent endeavors. There was a bit more license to cavort with members of the opposite sex at the Club, than in the outside world, as it was understood that they were socially acceptable as girl friends or mates, that our parents and relatives knew each other. However, it also made for a small world, where everyone one met knew everyone else one knew. So this freedom did impose some behavioral restrictions. Nothing stayed secret from parents very long, but the experimentation was generally viewed somewhat benignly. On balance, a plus.The facilities are top notch, catering as it does to the elite of Bombay society, as it has done since it was established, over a century ago.  It continues to provide a serene oasis, a refuge from the cacophonous hustle and bustle of commerce in the undisputed hub of business life in India. The extremely large grounds, which encompass a golf course, numerous tennis, squash, and badminton courts, many buildings and facilities, a plethora of restaurants and cuisines, are unique in a city where each square foot of land is prized and rare. The demeanor of the service staff has lost some of the dignified bearing i remember from many decades ago. However, the food is simply the best, justly renowned, and is only rarely improved upon by any of the many restaurants in town. A meal on the verandah, overlooking the lawns and golf course is one of my pleasures while visiting Bombay. And an akoori on toast, accompanied by chocolate cream in a glass of Coca Cola (known to the staff as a coke float) is my de rigeur breakfast following a morning swim. Can’t be beat!The membership rolls, always exclusive, have been closed since 1985, except to the children of a member; so the only way to enter the Club is as the guest of a current member, or as a member of one of several reciprocal clubs around the world. If while in Bombay, you have an opportunity to visit the Club, you will be  glad you did, as it harks back to a bygone era of unhurried elegance, old world Colonial charm, and gracious living."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,antat88,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Great club,"The Willingdon is always classic, could be a bit more inclusive. Some unnecessary rules, but its home."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Yasmin Tavaria,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,Ms Yasmin Tavaria,Ambience is excellent. Starters are very nice. Food is also very good. Old world charm about the place and open air lawn seating is available. A good evening spent
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Naresh1936,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2019,Superb facilities,"The best of Mumbai’s scores of clubs, it is situated in the heart of South Mumbai. It has a swimming pool, a mini golf course and indoor games facilities, besides several dining facilities serving excellent food. However, the entry to club is restricted to its members and accompanying guests only. "
Willingdon_Sports_Club,marcusssydney2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,"If you can get in, do it!","The Royal Willingdon Sports Club is old India, to a tee. You can only get in through reciprocal membership of another club. I'm in Royal Over Seas League but I know other clubs have reciprocal rights. I think only the member can get it, ie.you can't bring guests who are not members of a reciprocal club. You would think it was about the early 40s. The Raj was in it's twilight, but nothing has changed here. It's kind of like watching a retro movie set in Eton or an Oxbridge college in the 1930s (I wish I could have photographed the dressing room the golfers use). The surroundings are exquisite. The verandah is a delightful place for drinks and snacks. The great and the good of Bombay are here (never use that M-word name, but especially not here). Lots of Parsee ladies in slacks and blouses with exquisite jewellery. Slightly spoilt little Bombay madams using Daddy-ji's card and sipping daintily from huge mugs of beer. Welsh rarebit, all-day breakfast (with BACON available) and all lovely Raj type food on the menu. Live music, nothing post 1948 was played. Great value drinks and food in a very relaxed, up-market atmosphere. Membership closed in the 1980s, only children of current members can get membership. I had Sunday lunch here and left feeling very relaxed. A classy blast-from-the-past with service par excellence at ridiculously cheap prices!"
Willingdon_Sports_Club,MNSB,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Business,Amazing club the best in Mumbai,Willingdon sports club is the best club in Mumbai.It's the only golf course in Mumbai City.Club is 100 year old Area is 120 Acres .It has acess by members or their guests .One can go there without a member of club . Good restaurant and bar .Gym and all sports facilities and a library.
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Peter M,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Solo,Nice place to relax in a retro atmosphere,As it is members only you will have to be invited as a guest by a member.Offers a nice renovated restaurant on the first floor with a view onto to the Golf Course and a relaxing tea-lounge on the ground floor. Great place to sit and chat with your Indian friends.
Willingdon_Sports_Club,lirus2014,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,Whoaaaaa the Parthenon rebuilt to its former glory,"This was a beautiful place treasured by many who respected the history and natural beauty of this oasis. But, unfortunately some well travelled committee members had other ideas, and so was born the Maratha-Greco monument , I'm sure to make good on the Persian destruction of the older Parthenon in the invasion of 480 BC.Cudos to the wisdom of these members to erect a monument that houses badminton and squash courts. I hope they see fit to install sculptures, some of which now reside in the British Museum, The Acropolis Museum and the Louvre ( if they need further inspiration, though my gut tells me they've figured this one out ).This is an example of how a group of people can collaborate to destroy the sanctity of a place in the misguided belief that building a monument to ones-self makes things better......an unfortunate new reality in Mumbai.Hopefully, our younger and clearly more sophisticated membership will be galvanized to take action and a leadership role on these committees so tragedies like this do not continue to befall this beautiful place  (e.g. a helipad on the golf course/ a zipline over the tennis courts/ a petting zoo on the front lawn/ bumper cars on the putting green etc. )And then there's the disaster affectionately referred to as the upstairs Dining Room. An impossible place. Wires protruding out of a stark wall. Reverberating noise. No sound dampening interventions at all ( they ....... "" the committee""......they have one for everything, actually paid someone to design this ). The food tumbles out of the kitchen in a random fashion ( our meat was uncooked and was sent back ), and perplexed wait staff trying to do their best.This club needs a major overhaul. The young, educated and progressive membership needs to get active and save this place before it becomes a jumbled mess. Maybe someone will have the courage to lead the club back to its former glory, rather than the garish monstrosity that's emerging from these hallowed grounds.Bruised egos' apart, I hope the collective membership in this bright future doesn't forget its past, and the Grande Olde Dame of Bombay is honoured in a way that is appropriate to her history."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Binnyagogo,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Couples,Stepping back in time.....,"The Willingdon Sports Club is a fascinating glimpse into Mumbai's colonial past.  We were lucky enough to be taken by members and I'm not sure that the public are allowed access. But if you can get in, you are encased in a world that time has forgotten. A time of ceiling fans and wicker chairs, portraits of the famous and Ladies powder rooms with coaches and flounces! Fascinating but I fear very exclusive."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Vivek Dhadha,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Mumbais most exclusive sports club and gold course,"This has to be Mumbais most exclusive sports club. It has one of the best gold courses in Mumbai and the whose's who of Mumbai are members of this Richie rich club.It is extremely difficult to get a membership here, irespective of the money one is willing to spend"
Willingdon_Sports_Club,646harishc,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Best Country Club in Mumbai,"Being a member myself, I know every nook and cranny of Willingdon having grown up here since I was a child.  I learnt how to walk, swim, play tennis and golf all at Willingdon.  And what a fabulous time I've had where I've built some fantastic friends.If you ever get a chance to go visit Willingdon Club with a member, don't miss the chance.  No restaurant or Taj Mahal hotel holds a candle to a lovely afternoon tea or lunch or dinner or perhaps even breakfast.  A dish called ""Kejriwal"" can only be found at Willingdon...a great breakfast or snack."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Vinod500,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Old Exclusive Club,"The history of this club is fascinating. It is one of the most exclusive clubs in Mumbai, with membership closed since 1985, and only children of existing members can apply for new membership.I met with a member over lunch at the club's 1st floor dining hall. The ambiance was  quiet and nice, with a good view of the grounds, totally unlike some of the restaurants with no views, and where carrying on a conversation over a meal becomes difficult because of the loud talking by other patrons.  The food was good and we had an unhurried meal."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,anandaroy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Old Money. Old World Charm. Old.,"An old, beautiful and inspiring tribute to the British Empire - this modern day British Saheb was pleased. In a manner as one is pleased by cucumber sandwiches and lemonade at the Gore Hotel In London overlooking the weather.   The old wicker and cushions ""Verandah"" cafe stands alongside a desultory 9 hole golf course. The food and service is delightfully old world, and tasty, the little bells at every table to call for service is quaint if a bit tasteless in this modern age. The library and restaurants can be very discreet and quiet on a week day so perfect to conduct a business meeting or a private tete-a-tete. Endless corridors between venues remind you of boarding school in Panchgani - walk tall, tread lightly, lots of old memsahibs about fitting into their weak tea.  The facilities are quite sumptuous- a good sized swimming pool, a lovely panelled bar, even a grocery shop. An air of old money and exclusivity hangs over the club that stopped taking in members in 1985, and only permitted female nominees in 2007. Honestly, it's getting a bit stale - hence the emergency cash infusions from corporate memberships and well-heeled expats. Expect an old and formal and robust admissions panel interview. Before they cash your generous cheque. Do visit. Do enjoy the old world hospitality. The last bastion of the Empire will die on the subcontinent."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,4Paw NoMad,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Friends,Good atmosphere and food,"I have visited the club several times for meals, swimming and golf. It is a well run club and the staff are mostly very friendly. Thoughthey tend to get a bit flustered if asked for something they are not familiar with . We had dinner there with some Indian friends who are members. They selected the dishes which they thought were the best and we liked everything we tried."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Falloyd,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Friends,Dinner at the club,"We had an excellent meal in the restaurant. It was all very civilised and very enjoyable.We had tea downstairs on the terrace,the decor was colonial and smacked of an era long gone but it was all very beautiful.If you ever get a chance to experience the Willingdon Sports Club then take it as it is well worth a visit."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Jay T,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2017 • Family,Easily the best poolside in Bombay !!,The most beautiful poolside in Bombay. The club house is also great for its old world charm. The restaurant upstairs needs a massive improvement in the good quality but still an excellent club with good sporting facilities
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Shyam A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Solo,Good enough - staff not that considerate,"Visited as a reciprocal member from London, but didn't feel very welcomed at all. It felt like I was putting the staff out, since they had to process my visit and issue me a card (which took upwards of 40 mins, and meant I couldn't order food or use any facilities. The food is okay, grounds are really nice, but the rules imposed by the staff made the place feel unwelcoming and stuffy."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Viraj S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016,Affluent,Great place to mingle with the affluent youngster crowd of Mumbai. Has a charm of its own and comparable to CCI.
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Rushdaru,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Friends,Traditional Club cannot complain !!!,Willingdon is a traditional club cannot be termed fancy but has good tradional ambience a feeling of British built up but good place to spend time with family & friends .Love the idea of ringing a bell to call for order .The lawns are good for small functions & good place to be in open grounds
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Ria Shroff Desai,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Business,Classic British-era clubhouse in the heart of South Mumbai,"If you can find a member at Willingdon, come for the afternoon tea and sit out and look over the well manicured lawns and spend an afternoon here. Not easy to enter otherwise, and still very much an old-school club, so lots of restrictions on attire and use of cellphones, etc. But worth it for the tranquility."

Willingdon_Sports_Club,GrabAsia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016,The Old World Charm of the Willingdon,"India had many clubs remaining from the British colonial era and most of them have an old world charm about them that I love. The Willingdon in Bombay is one of them. I visit Bombay about once a year, but always for short trips and one of the ways of meeting as many of my friends as possible to catching up with them one evening. Last year my buddy with whom I was staying arranged dinner here, and last week when I was back, we had an encore. The club is an oasis amid busy & crowded Bombay and of course one needs to be a member or a guest of one to visit. It is named after one of the Viceroys of India, and the whole place is in a wonderful time warp. The most amazing part is the mens loo, called the ""Gentlemans Dressing Room"" which can serve as a set for any film set a 100 years ago. There are some amusing sights you will see if you venture in!We ate at the bar which serves a wonderful version of  quintessential Indian club snack, masala peanuts, a concoction of peanuts, chills, tomatoes, onions, lime juice & salt. We also had chilli paneer, chill chicken, salt & pepper prawns and kathi kebabs. They serve the full board of drinks, but my favourite is what I call a ""Gautam"" Mary, which is a virgin mary, served in a whiskey glass, with the salt inside & not on the rim, made extra spicy.My wonderful buddy who arranged this paid the bill (!) so don't know exactly how much it was, but going by normal club fare in India, it would be U$15 per person,Cant wait to be back there again."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Dazza1955,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Friends,Old world charm in a hectic city,"This is a members club so you have to get signed by a member but once you're in it is an oasis of tranquillity. It has a swimming pool, Golf course tennis courts and various restaurants that are relatively cheap with good service. There is definitely an old world colonial charm, that is not found in the west.Yesterday we had dinner on the Veranda but there are various other restaurants serving different types of food.Definitely worth a visit if you can get in!"
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Steve Buckley,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016,Great Escape!,"As any visitor to Mumbai will tell you, it is a huge city where the opportunities to stretch one's legs are few and far between.In this regard - particularly, if one is a golfer (although it is also possible to 'walk the course') - a round of golf at the Willington comes as a most enjoyable experience.Not a huge golf course by any means (less than 5,000 yards and a par 64) but certainly not a pushover. Many testing holes and many players will struggle to play their handicap.There is also much bird life on display and - at times - it is easy to forget that you are still in Mumbai. Don't worry, reality is only a few hundreds yards away!"
Willingdon_Sports_Club,percyvakil,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,Members only,"Willingdon club is a very nice club near Haji Ali in the south of the city. The club has a vast area with very nice facilities. They have a golf course, swimming pool, tennis courts and an old colonial club building.It is a very nice club but here it is listed as a tourist attraction which strictly speaking it is not because entry is restricted to members of the club. I've visited the club as a guest and it is very nice."

Great place to get together and also lovely sports facilities. Library is so pleasant and overlooks the golf courses. Almost like an oasis in the desert. Only drawback other than having to be a member is the fact that children aren't allowed in most parts of the club."

Willingdon_Sports_Club,Noelle W,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Couples,Exclusivity of the Colonial Era.,"Willingdon really is a gem in the heart of Mumbai. I've played golf there many times. I always loved seeing the hawks on the golf course and seeing their feathers around. Halfway through play you exit the property and reenter through a street that runs between the holes. That's where you can pick up some extra balls that went into the water. The caddies are precious and take their job very seriously. I was coached ""Head down maam"" on several occasions. The club itself is just as previously described... a treasure in architecture and a preservation of time. The tables have bells on them to ring for the servants. There is a pastry shop, numerous places to eat and a very cozy pub tucked inside. If you have the chance at a invitation, don't decline you never know who you might meet."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Aartichand,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Family,Colonial,"The Willingdon Sports Club is a colonial clue from the days of the British Raj. The main building is still maintained in its original facade. The wooden stairs are of solid wood. \It now has an 18 hole Golf course for its members, a rarity in the middle of Mumbai. The club has a heated swimming pool,tennis courts and spacious lawns. Also available is ample parking. Among its members are the elite of Mumbai Society. If you are an egg lover must try the kejiwal at the willingdon."
Willingdon_Sports_Club,EnakshiC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2015 • Business,English era club with matching decor,"I have visited this club, mainly for lunch or evening meeting, as my boss was a member of the club. This club reminds one of the Victorian era, of aristocracy and their hobbies. It is so large, lush fields for golf, swimming pools...for the privileged few who can afford. The food is good, especially the chilly cheese toast among other items. Nice place that I was lucky to see from inside. "
Willingdon_Sports_Club,guru52,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014,Good old club....... Of Victorian era,Visiting this club takes back you to the Victorian era as most of the set up has been kept as it is including the furniture. The golf course has a wonderful view from the club. It's a delight for eyes to sit in the open lounge and enjoy snacks and tea. You need to be a member or his guest to get an entry to the club.
Willingdon_Sports_Club,Vinod500,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,A leisurely meal,"I met with friends at this club for a leisurely lunch. The club and restaurant are spacious . The restaurant overlooks the golf course, which is green and well kept. The food was good, but surprisingly, there were no Indian dishes in the menu. No curds, no dal. A hangover of the British days !"

Willingdon_Sports_Club,Rakesh K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Family,Great ambience with elderly members,"The driveway into the club has to be one of the longest in Mumbai, at least. The reception and its vintage chandelier give the opulence to the place. The verandah at the back of the reception give it a majestic look. The golf greens beyond are the lungs of this part of the city. The swimming pool on the side is spacious. The place is virtually empty except for the verandah, as the members are all almost senior citizens. "

Willingdon_Sports_Club,Lindsay P,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Solo,The Swankiest Club in the city !,"Club culture in Mumbai city is thriving. You have to qualify to be a member though and the rules and conditions are many and varied. Once you get past those, then you're king ! You have to be in the upper economic bracket though and after you've paid your life membership amount, which could be anything from 50,000 to 10 lakhs, you have a plethora of benefits open to you, be it food and beverage, sports, banquet facilities, libraries, etc. all at ridiculously low prices. Popular clubs around Mumbai city are CCI club, Bombay Gymkhana, WIAA club, Breach Candy Club, Bandra Gymkhana, Khar Gymkhana, Willingdon Gymkhana, Chembur Golf Club, etc. Of all these, I consider the Willingdon Sports Club at Mahalaxmi to be the swankiest, most exclusive, best dressed club in the city. This place is a second home to Mumbai's crème-de-la-crème. You'll find the city's millionaires, top level CEO's, film stars and other notable socialites frequenting this club to maybe play some golf, catch up with friends, shop, have a meeting, play a game of bridge, get a haircut or spa treatment or simply to lounge around and do nothing in a safe, exclusive environment. The food and drink here is wholesome, exquisitely prepared and so very cheap and affordable. The club has a huge, well manicured golf course which is rare to find in the middle of this bustling city of Mumbai. It also has 3 bars and 3 restaurants serving up the best alcohol and food choices you could think of. Bridge is the game of choice for the elderly here among other card and board games and there a large area assigned for this purpose. There is also ample parking and a valet service. One cannot however walk into the club and avail of any service if not a member. I f you are a non-member then you may enter the club Only accompanied by a member who will have to sign you in. Any items bought in the club premises will have to paid for by the member using the member's card. A guest cannot order or pay for anything using cash or credit card. The club. on the whole, has a very relaxed, old-world charm. Lovely place to be in !"
