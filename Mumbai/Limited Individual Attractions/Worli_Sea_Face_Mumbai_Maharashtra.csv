Worli_Sea_Face,Rubina S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Friends,Perfect for long walks,"One of the longest seaside promenade of Mumbai next to Marine drive. The difference being that while Marine drive is located amidst a commercial part of the city, Worli Sea Face is situated in a residential area.If you are a visitor do remember to carry water and snacks as you wont find any place for a break along the way. However, half way through you can certainly divert on a different road towards Worki naka where you have ample options to eat and drink.The area is frequented by morning and evening walkers. The place is too hot for a walk at noon, but worth a walk in the evening to see the sunset in all its glory."
