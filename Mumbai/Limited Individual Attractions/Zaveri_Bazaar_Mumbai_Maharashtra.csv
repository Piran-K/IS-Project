Zaveri_Bazaar,Jeff H,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Good for Locals,"This is a jewel bazzar and they mostly sell indian style jewel. We did not find much that interested us as being Australian. the one store we entered which was large, was very expensive (over priced). But still worth a look around it has some very interesting streets sell most of everything."
Zaveri_Bazaar,David D,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,"Crowded, busy and noisy area in Mumbai","Wednesday 4th March we were out and about exploring and sightseeing in Mumbai. We walked along the labyrinth bustling streets from Crawford Market and we ended here, about 8 minute walk.It is an experience walking the streets, mingling with people pushing laden trolleys and stalls along the road and pavements. Another thing to contend with was the number of motorcycles and the constant sounding of horns and road works.The road and pavements are lined with a variety of shops and stalls with stuff you might not want to buy, but worth a walk about."

Zaveri_Bazaar,Allise W,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2018 • Solo,Was hoping for more variety and styles,"The Zaveri Bazaar mostly has Indian style jewelry--which can be gaudy and ""over the top"" compared to the fashion of many other regions of the world.  I was hoping to find Bali-style or western style jewelry, but there isn't much to be found.  Furthermore, I was hoping for genuine jewelry, but much of the jewelry was fake."

Zaveri_Bazaar,shritimerchant,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,jewellery and more!!!,"the area is aptly named as once you enter, there are loads of jewellery shops and then some more. small and big branded shops line both side of the streets and lead into many smaller streets in the area! one can buy everything from imitation, silver, semi precious to gold and diamond jewellery. some shops also buy old silver/ gold ornaments/ items. the streets are very narrow and brimming with people so one needs to be a little careful while walking.we normally buy a gold coin during diwali as per the tradition and normally my dad buys them, but this time i had also saved up some money so decided to buy 1 for myself."

Zaveri_Bazaar,Deepakshi J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2016 • Solo,Lives up to its name and reputation ,I had heard so much about this market and decided to go and see it for myself one weekend. I also wanted to pick up some stuff mostly silver. The market is as unorganised and crowded as you would imagine it to be. The good thing is it is a mostly pedestrian market so you can walk around but the number of people is staggering. I checked out some silver shops and the latest designs and ended up buying from one of them based on a friends experience.  I was looking for chunky vintage silver pendant etc but could not find that at all. Also one of the shops I visited had a great collection of stones and the best thing is he beaded them for me as per my liking. It took about 30 min but I got exactly what I wanted. A great place if you want to buy in bulk ..don't go if you want to pick up one earing. I never checked out the gold and diamonds but I believe that really is where you get the best deals.
